      <P>Since strawberry pulp is not separately distinguished as a heading in the Official Import List, it is not possible to furnish exact particulars of imports of this commodity.  It is estimated, however, that (a) the quantity of strawberry pulp imported in 1951 was 300 tons, (b) the quantity imported in the first six months of 1952 was 120 tons. As to (c) of the Deputy's question, it is not possible, on information available, to forecast imports during the last half of the present year.  As to (d), the average c.i.f. import price during the period January, 1951, to June, 1952, was about £110 per ton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter of privilege.  I do not want to argue it, Sir, but only to bring it to your attention.  I did not get an opportunity of informing you beforehand.  On 27th June the Minister for Finance tabled in the Library the Finance Accounts for the year ending 31st March, 1952.  On 28th June, the following day, I went to the Library to get the accounts that were so tabled and that appeared to be so tabled according to the Order Paper of 27th June.  I found that the sole account was a blank sheet of paper.  I informed the proper officers of this House who, I understand, informed the Minister's officers and I was told that that was the normal procedure.  I suggested that whether it was normal procedure or not it was an entirely incorrect procedure and that when documents are tabled, even if they are not yet printed, a typescript copy should be available, and I indicated that, so far as the summary was concerned, at least the summary should be made available.  I said I would raise the <Col N="1330" /> matter during the next week but, not being unduly anxious to press it, I left the matter over for a week.</P>
      <P>I then pressed the matter again, and I was told by message that the information would be forthcoming if I put down a question.  I submit that that is not the proper method, that when documents are presented and tabled in this way they should be put in the Library, which is the proper place, in typescript if, as can obviously be seen, they could not be printed within the statutory time.</P>

      <P>It would have been perhaps just as well if I had had some notice that the Deputy was going to raise this matter.  First of all, I should say that it has been the invariable practice not merely since this House was established but in another place, arising out of the fact that an Act of 1869 provides that the Finance Accounts must be in fact presented to Parliament before the 30th June in the year succeeding that to which they relate, to submit these and other documents, the presentation of which is prescribed within a certain time, in dummy.</P>

      <P>It may be, but because of the physical impossibility of having all the accounts collated and prepared and the information required ready for printing, that has been the invariable custom.  If it would meet the Deputy, we may bring in a Bill to extend the statutory date, and then I hope that the Deputy will have no further cause for dissatisfaction.  May I say with regard to the Deputy's suggestion that he was informed that if he put down a question certain information would be given to him, that I have no knowledge that that information was conveyed to the Deputy?  I do not propose to depart from the longstanding custom.  We will, I hope, before next session, have a Bill which will extend the statutory date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last, when discussing this Estimate, I was adverting to the necessity of the Minister keeping his benevolent eye on the horse population of this country so as not to allow it to be depleted beyond what might be considered, in times of emergency, the danger point.  Much could be done through committees of agriculture, if the Department policy so willed it, by giving small subsidies to owners of mares, just as the Royal Dublin Society are doing at agricultural shows at the present time, to encourage farmers to continue the breeding of a certain number of working horses in order to keep the horse population within a certain safety margin.  I mentioned before that the amount of money provided in this Estimate for the improvement of thoroughbred horse breeding is very small.  I should like if the Minister, in his reply, would give us the reasons why so little money has been spent in recent years in bringing in the type of high-class sire that formerly was brought into this country.  There is a known scarcity of that type of horse. In the past it has always been the policy to bring in the hunter-type of sire and to encourage the breeding of the strong hunter-type of horse for which this country was renowned.  In these times, when the idea of mechanisation is in everybody's mind and everything is becoming mechanised, the horse should not be lost sight of altogether, and every effort should be made to retain the reputation which this country won for itself in the past for breeding this fine type of horse. With the change-over to mechanisation, there is every danger of losing that <Col N="1333" /> fine type of horse.  The breeding of such horses should be encouraged, and much more might be done than is being done at the present time.</P>
      <P>There is not much more that I have to say on this Estimate.  We had, of course, a contribution from Deputy Dillon.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, he often came into this House like a roaring lion to speak on matters connected with agriculture, and if anybody dared to criticise any aspect of his administration or the policy he was operating, that Deputy was attacked viciously by the then Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>He attacked many Deputies on this side of the House because they dared to raise some questions on the policy he was carrying out during his administration. Fianna Fáil have a different outlook and a different point of view on many aspects of agriculture from that of the Opposition but I agree that there are some members amongst the Opposition who would agree 100 per cent. with Fianna Fáil policy on the matter of greater production of tillage crops.  It is recognised, however, that the Fine Gael Party are opposed, through their agricultural leader if you like, Deputy Dillon, to putting more land under the plough and producing more tillage.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we need to feed animals and human beings.  We had ample evidence of that over the years that Deputy Dillon held the Ministry of Agriculture and even before that time, during his whole career in this House.  During all the time that he had public responsibility he was opposed to tillage.  His belief was that we should bring food for our animals and food for human beings from the ends of the earth to this country.  He is on record as having said that.  He must have said it well over 100 times. He prayed God in this House to hasten the day when wheat and beet, like peat, would go up the spout.  He has never recanted saying that.  When the slogan: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough&rdquo; was coined first, we had in this country a three-days' supply of bread.  We had only 21,000 acres under wheat.  At the time that phrase was coined it was regarded as almost high treason to suggest that any more of the land of the country should be utilised for the production of food, for the growing of grain crops or tillage crops of any kind.  We had ample evidence during his term of office that Deputy Dillon went all out on a grass policy.  Good grass is, of course, most important for any country.  It is of the greatest importance in this country, but Deputy Dillon told the people that they were wasting their land by ploughing it and growing tillage crops. We had ample indications from him that he was opposed to wheat growing. He did something that will go down in history as having a most damaging effect on agriculture.  That was when <Col N="1336" /> he brought to an end the growing of pedigree seed.  A number of private individuals, merchants and others, had been induced by a predecessor of his, a former Minister for Agriculture, to undertake the setting up of plant for the processing, cleaning and drying of pedigree seed wheat.</P>
      <P>They had spent considerable sums of money in getting that organisation together.  The scheme was working most satisfactorily and was giving a generous measure of satisfaction to farmers, merchants and others.  Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, by one fell stroke, brought that organisation to an end.  It can never, I think, be estimated what that action of his cost agriculture, both in the present and in the future.  As a result of what he did, it will be very difficult, indeed, to revive pedigree seed growing in this country.  Those who were formerly engaged in it will, it is feared, be very slow to undertake it again because of the manner in which they were treated.  I think that very few can really comprehend what Deputy Dillon's reasons were for doing that damage to the agricultural industry. He did that when Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat growing in this country is, and always must be, all-important in our national economy.  It must be kept in the very forefront of our national economy.  There is no reason in the world why, with all the acres of firstclass arable land we have, we should not grow our total wheat requirements. Any Government that will ever sit in this House must keep that in the forefront of its policy.  It is of the first importance that we should produce our total requirements of wheat and other grain crops.  We cannot continue growing wheat unless we have a pure line of seed to supply to our farmers year after year.  We have not that at the moment.  We have to try and get supplies from Sweden, but the position is that we cannot get them at any price this year.  We could not get them from the Swedes, the British or anybody else.  We need a pure line of pedigree seed wheat to meet our own requirements.  We had that, and a success was being made of it until <Col N="1337" /> the former Minister for Agriculture brought it to an end.  It is hard to know how that organisation can ever be brought back again, or how we are going to get public-spirited men, farmers and others to undertake it again.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the present Minister for Agriculture that, if necessary, he should bring proposals for legislation before the House to ensure that if the growing of pedigree seed wheat, barley seed, turnip seed or any other seed that we may require is again undertaken here by farmers and merchants, no Minister in the future should have the right, without first coming before Parliament to bring such a scheme to an end, merely at his own whim or fancy.  Deputy Dillon brought the growing of root seeds to an end, and he brought the growing of pedigree seed wheat to an end.  I am sure that if he had remained in office he would have brought the growing of pedigree seed barley and the growing of seed potatoes to an end.  That was all due to the fact, as I said before, that Deputy Dillon was opposed in every possible way to the production of tillage crops.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of paying or compelling anyone in regard to what is the national policy of the Government, in regard to what is indicated to the people as being a sound national line to pursue in the matter of producing crops.  The big majority of the people are likely to pursue that policy unless they are given wrong and anti-national advice.  We do know that it has always been difficult to maintain sufficient tillage here, and that there is more of the land of the country occupied by persons who are not a bit favourable to tillage than <Col N="1338" /> there is by those who are interested in tillage crops.  That is a well-known fact.  Therefore, it needs all the persuasion possible, as well as a united effort from all sides in this House to get the people to try to keep up sufficient tillage.  That is fundamental to the future well-being of our national economy&mdash;that we should increase our acreage under tillage.  We know that it has been steadily declining since the end of the war.</P>
      <P>It has gone down now almost to what it was pre-war, in some directions. That decline must be arrested.  It can only be arrested by all sections in this House being unanimous in advising those who own land that it is in the national interest, as well as in their own interest, to produce from the land of the country all the food that we need both for human beings and for animal feeding.  I think everyone will agree with me on that, and I hope there will be no more controversy about it.</P>
      <P>We often hear talk about compulsory tillage and all the rest.  Efforts have been made by the people opposite to try and frighten the farmers of this country by saying that this Party stands for a permanent policy of compulsory tillage.  It has been indicated time and again that we do not stand for a permanent policy of compulsory tillage.  We believe that, as a long-term policy, it is far better for this country that our farmers should voluntarily, fully understanding the problem, produce sufficient tillage crops to provide for the full needs of the community in every respect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it to Deputy Hickey to indicate the soundest course of action.  Too many persons who own land in this country are only too eager every time to abandon tillage completely.  In some respects this country is fortunate at the moment in that meat prices are high, but possibly it is to our disadvantage in other respects which are not apparent <Col N="1339" /> now.  The tendency is to go out of tillage to as great a degree as possible. The high price for meat has accelerated that trend.</P>
      <P>The policy of the present Minister for Agriculture is a sound national policy and I hope that it will get the support of all our people.  The prices obtaining for agricultural produce agitate farmers' minds from year to year.  It is all to the good that farmers are keenly interested in their livelihood and in seeing that they get a fair price for the produce of their land.  If the farmer does not get a fair price then agricultural production will decrease.  The farmer is as entitled to a just price for his produce as any other member of the community is entitled to a just wage for his labour.  Some sections of the community have never fully recognised the right of the farmer to a just price for his produce and the right of agricultural workers to a decent standard of living.  These people are just as much entitled to a fair wage and a decent standard of living as people in more sheltered occupations.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that most of the farmers realise that there is a limit to what the other sections of the community can pay for agricultural produce.  It will be agreed that it is in the national interest that farmers should go all out to get the highest possible production with the highest degree of efficiency.  That is the only way in which we can keep down the prices of essential foodstuffs.  Only by increased production and greater efficiency in all directions can we improve the whole structure of the agricultural industry.  I think it is agreed that agricultural production in this country has been more or less static in the past 50 years.  There has been little or no increase and there may even be small decreases in certain directions.  Taken on the whole, however, there has been no worth-while improvement in the agricultural industry in the last 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there has been very little change in agricultural production in the past 50 years.  There <Col N="1340" /> may be a slight variation here and there but there has been no worthwhile change in the total output in the past 50 years.  We must step up agricultural production in this country. I think we lag behind almost every country in Europe in respect of increasing our agricultural production since the end of the war.  No doubt there are manifold reasons for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt generally that if farmers could obtain more artificial manure and lime for their land it would help to bring about increased production. I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to intensify his policy of getting artificial manures and ground limestone for the farmers of this country at a price which they can afford to pay through credit schemes or otherwise. Something must be done immediately about that matter.  We hear much talk in this House about capital investment.  We have capital investment in housing, electricity, turf and many other projects.  Capital investment in the land of this country will yield us as good, if not better, dividends than any other form of capital investment.  All our other forms of capital investment are very desirable, but, as a long-term policy, we should invest some of the money which is available to us each year for capital investment in the land of this country.  I believe that that would have a great effect on improving production, apart altogether from the fact that it would yield at least as great a dividend as any other item of capital investment.  I have no doubt that the Minister is actively pursuing investigations as to how he can bring that about.  As far as my information goes, the increase in the price of artificial manures this year did seriously reduce the amount that was bought and used on the land.  However, I see that freight charges are falling and that farmers may hope in the coming season to get a substantial reduction in the cost of artificial manures.  It is to be hoped they will.  In many other directions their costs are going up.  The amount of their rates is going up, the cost of machinery and everything they use is going up very steeply, and unless they can get artificial manure and ground limestone at a reasonable <Col N="1341" /> price there is not much hope of increasing production to the extent to which we all want to see it increased. I hope the Minister will, in a short time, be able to give some scheme to the House and to the country whereby these desirable results will be brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to having been unable to study the Minister's introductory statement on this Estimate I intend confining myself to just a few items.  Perhaps the Minister will be glad of that because it is only natural that he would be anxious to dispose of this Estimate.  First of all, may I just refer to what Deputy Allen said a while ago on the importation of cheap maize?  From the statement he made in this connection it would seem that he is opposed to such a policy.  I am not saying that I am in favour of it, but there is this difficulty in our approach to agriculture: it is a wellknown fact that the farmers in parts of the west and in the south-west areas are trying to work on very bad land and have not the facilities for grain growing, and so forth, as have farmers in the east, the midlands or the south. The policy which these small-holders would favour would be a policy whereby they could get imported maize at a cheap rate.  Therefore, when we have such views expressed by various interests on a broad subject of such importance as agriculture is to us, we must realise that while each member who speaks here on the subject, may express a different view which he believes to be correct, and while there may be a certain amount of correctness in each statement, our difficulty seems to be that we are never prepared to weld together the various views or take from the various views expressed the good points and see is it possible to discover where the weakness has come in in the agricultural policy of this country for years back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Allen stated, according to the statistics published each year, there has been little or no improvement in agricultural output for the last 50 years.  We know the figures vary, but, nevertheless, they vary only at a small rate and it is deplorable that <Col N="1342" /> with self-government in 26 counties of our country we have as yet, not alone not come by a policy which will give us increased production on a big scale but we have not yet come to solve the weaknesses which are preventing us from adopting a system which will give us that increase in production which is desirable if we are to have satisfactory results in the policy of agriculture.</P>
    <P>One of the points mentioned here by Deputy Corry the other night, and a matter on which I also wish to speak is the policy of the cattle breeds which has been adopted here and which has been in operation for many years past.  Again, even in trying to approach this subject we have different angles.  We have the view of the farmer in the west or in the south. We have the view, then, of the farmer in the midlands.  It is no advantage either to the man from the midlands who believes in a certain policy or to the man from the south who, perhaps, believes in another policy, to stand up here and express his views as being the correct views.</P>
    <P>While it is most advantageous for us, being noted for the export of beef, to adopt a policy whereby we will increase substantially our exports of cattle, we still admit our main worry is the question of milk supplies in various areas.  Even in Dublin City, in Cork City and other centres this problem has arisen time and again.  I am not going to go into the matter here now as regards the price of milk.  I am solely discussing the question of supplies.  Neither do I intend to say that the present policy is the copyright policy of the present Minister when it comes to the various cattle breeds because I believe that this policy has been the policy of each Government in this State for a number of years back.  As Deputy Corry said when he was not crosstalking with members in opposition, we are not getting satisfactory results simply and solely because we are not prepared to admit the weakness in our present policy.  Be it what we may call the beef breed or the dual purpose&mdash;it is immaterial which we call it&mdash;when it comes to milk yields <Col N="1343" /> and to the fact that even in county committees of agriculture premiums cannot be allowed to certain breeds even though these breeds, year in and year out, are giving valuable returns in the way of milk yields, the question must be posed as to why the same favoured treatment is not being given to cattle owners who are inclined to go in for these breeds as is given for other types.  Take the Friesian breed as an example.  It is undoubtedly giving an excellent milk yield and if we are concerned with the volume of milk that can be placed on the home market we must take the necessary steps.  We cannot allow ourselves the weakness of admitting that our sole object in improving agriculture is for the export market.</P>
    <P>We must be equally prepared to realise the importance of the home market.  If, therefore, as has been proved, some of the breeds are not giving adequate returns which are urgently required, then it is essential for the Minister to approach the subject by admitting that if a weakness exists the remedy must be sought for, and the sooner the Minister and his advisers realise that the present policy is not producing beneficial results in relation to the milk yield, and the sooner he and his advisers strike out on the formulation and implementation of a new policy to improve the milk yielding strains, the sooner we will go one step forward in improving that particular branch of the agricultural industry, and the less talk there will be on the part of people outside this House demanding increased milk prices.  By improving the breeding strains and the milk yield we will eliminate the uneconomic cow giving roughly 250 to 300 gallons per year, and replace her with an animal capable of giving 700 to 900 gallons per year. When we reach that stage we will go a long way towards solving one of our agricultural problems and making the production of milk a paying proposition for our farmers.</P>
    <P>South-west and West Cork has been noted for years past for its flax growing.  The small farmers in that <Col N="1344" /> area depend to a large extent on the money they make out of the sale of flax.  According to the memorandum issued to us here there will not be a guaranteed price for a considerable proportion of the flax coming on the market this year.  Prospects are not very good for the flax growers from that point of view.  I am not interested in quoting what any Minister for Agriculture may have said in the past, but I think that Deputy Dillon has been proved right in his approach towards the hard bargaining of the gentlemen from across the Border when dealing with the flax producers of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon's attitude when he was Minister for Agriculture has been justified.  These buyers from Northern Ireland suit themselves.  We hope to be in a position to establish a factory near Cork City in order to make the flax growers independent of these buyers from across the Border who offer a price that is wholly uneconomic. The sooner we protect our small farmers in that way the sooner we will improve another important branch of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen pointed out that the volume of output has varied very little over the past 50 years.  I do not wish to adopt an attitude which might be detrimental to agricultural policy or to agriculturists themselves.  Year after year, for the last few years, we have had moral and lay theologians very ready to use their pens and avail of all the opportunities offered them through the medium of the Press condemning what they regard as increased State expenditure usually termed by them &ldquo;State welfare&rdquo;. They find in that policy a grave danger of the State, as it were, becoming either the parent or foster-parent of the individual.  Some of these individuals, with their so-called generosity, state that we are going, day by day, nearer to a policy in which the individual would have no say whatsoever and would be simply a number in the records of State activity.  These people have never put in print their views on the question of grants to the agricultural community.  They have never openly pronounced any opinions <Col N="1345" /> as to whether or not these grants are beneficial to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>When one considers the total amount of money given directly by way of grants, agriculture is certainly getting a fair share of the expenditure.  The position in relation to these grants is somewhat anomalous as between the large landowner and the small landowner. Consider, for instance, grants given for the erection of pillars for gates, hay barns, water troughs, and so on.  The large landowner may decide to erect a number of gates on his farm.</P>
    <P>He may decide to erect a very large hay barn.  Because of the number of stock he carries he will find a use for that building.  He can decide to avail of many schemes through the medium of the grants offered by the State.  The small farmer will generally be quite satisfied with one or two gates and he will stick a bush in any other gaps on his place.  He will not go in for elaborate farm buildings.  The well-to-do farmer gets more benefit out of the grants provided by the State than the small farmer does.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted therefore that there can be no comparison made between the benefits derived by the large farmer as against those derived by the small farmer.  There are other schemes in which it can justifiably be claimed that the benefits derived, though the small farmer will get his share if he makes his application, are not proportionate.  I am not discussing agriculture now simply for the purpose of contrasting one Party's policy against another.  Under the present system of giving grants, the small farmer is not getting the advantages he undoubtedly should get, because it must be admitted that in most cases he is struggling for a livelihood whereas the larger landowner cannot be said to be in the same position.  If we admit that the volume of output has not increased, has not justified the hopes of the Government, are we not then coming to the time when this policy with regard to grants must be considered in the light of that weakness?  Instead of giving grants, instead of each Party saying to the farming community: <Col N="1346" />&ldquo;We are going to give you something the other crowd never gave you,&rdquo; we should approach it from a different angle.</P>
    <P>The biggest weakness in our present system of agriculture is the fact that agriculture, that is, the farmers down the country, are under-capitalised.  If the farmers are given adequate credit at a rate which will not fleece them, at a rate no higher than the cost of obtaining the money to give loans it will be in itself a greater help towards encouraging advances in agriculture on the medium-sized and smaller farms than the present system.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions heard farmers expressing their views on these matters and they put up the case that, while in one year their returns in respect of cattle and crops may be good, the next year these may fall, by reason, perhaps, of adverse weather conditions.  Their difficulty is that, through being under-capitalised, they are never in a position to stand the bad year as against the good year, and their argument is that if they were in a position to stock their farms adequately and improve the quality of their land in their own way, it would be much more beneficial than the system of grants for certain items on the farm.  This is perhaps a matter more for the Government than for the Minister, and I do not wish to dwell on it further than to say that when we are prepared to adopt a policy in relation to agriculture designed to provide these loans on a basis different from the present basis, which involves all forms of confession very often before the loan is made available, we will be moving in the direction of making agriculture more successful than it is.</P>
    <P>On page seven of the document issued to us, there is mention of dairy exports and the amount of butter being exported is given as amounting to £76,673 worth.  I presume there is a reason for it, and I am not drawing attention to this as some hidden stunt by either the Minister or the Department; but it strikes me as somewhat strange that, while, on the one hand, we are importing a large amount of butter at great cost to the State, <Col N="1347" /> butter which Deputy Corry and others have on many occasions condemned, there is, on the other hand, the fact, according to these figures, that £76,000 worth, involving 4,510 cwt., was exported. That looks lopsided&mdash;that we must import so much butter, while, at the same time, we export so much.</P>
    <P>However, there is not so great a necessity to dwell on that point as there is to dwell on some of the other items.  There is a large amount of money involved in the export of chocolate crumb, condensed milk and dried milk.  We hear on various occassions statements about the unsatisfactory milk yield in this country, and it would seem that, when a change of Government takes place, the cows know it and suddenly run dry.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us that there is so much employment involved in these exports, but when we look at the amount of milk being used to make possible these exports of chocolate crumb and condensed milk as against the fact that we have to import so much butter ourselves, one feels that that position is contradictory of the fact that we are not in a position to supply ourselves with the necessary amount of butter for our people.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that the employment involved is of primary importance, but the health of our people must come first in our consideration. No matter what Government is in power or what policy is in operation, the provision of adequate butter supplies for our people, for children and for old people, should be our primary consideration rather than the export to other countries of chocolate crumb and dried and condensed milk.  We realise the importance of exports, but, before we go into the export market on such a scale, we must ensure that the home market is provided for.  The fact that we have to import butter from Denmark or New Zealand and can export dairy produce to a total value of £5,850,000&mdash;I admit that portion of that figure relates to cheese&mdash;which export means that so much milk has been used in the preparation of these <Col N="1348" /> products, goes to show that if we had concentrated more on the butter problem in relation to the home market rather than the export market, we might be better off.  I know that the Minister may say, as his predecessor said, that cold storage is a problem. That problem may have existed, as I believe it did, but surely when problems are presented to us we should attempt to surmount them.  If, because of the cold storage problem, our people must be satisfied with imported butter, then I say that that policy is no credit to the Government or to the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen gave very fair views on the problem of prices on the home market.  Exorbitant prices have been paid by the public at times for some dairy products.  It is admitted that in some instances the producer does not benefit by these prices; in many cases the middleman obtrudes himself on the path between the producer and the consumer, and while the producer does not come out too well, the consumer is practically robbed.  Again, however, in other instances, the producer acts as retailer.  When we consider that working people with small wages and large families must pay from 3/- to 3/6 for a 21 lb. measure of potatoes, and when we consider the amount of cost and labour which goes into the growing of potatoes, we must admit that that price is scandalous, and nothing short of robbery.  These matters should be brought to the light of day. The farming community often do not get the benefit of the retail price, as that benefit goes to the middleman, but when they act as retailer they are often infected by the idea which seems to permeate our whole life at the present time: get rich quick.  Young families depend very much on potatoes. Often the woman of the home finds it difficult to balance her weekly budget, and can do so only by providing a good midday meal of potatoes for her children, and when she must pay so much for such an important item in the staple diet the question should be looked into.  I have a horror of inquiries and commissions.  In this case the Minister should not merely set up a commission, which would probably take two, three or four years, <Col N="1349" /> by which time there might be a completely new policy.  It is essential that agricultural prices should be investigated. Costings in general should be gone into.  We do not need a costings commission to examine the matter deeply and elaborately, because any up-to-date farmer&mdash;and there are many all over the country&mdash;can say truly and without hesitation that some prices are undoubtedly totally unfair to the consumer.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware the Minister did not mention pasteurisation.  A great deal has been said about the pasteurisation of milk in Cork City and suburbs. When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he played a man's part in trying to get the people who should be interested to move towards pasteurisation but great bodies move slowly and unfortunately, although he tried hard, he found that certain vested interests were definitely opposed to this policy.  They took a narrow, restricted view and saw in that policy disadvantages to their own personal well-being, financial and otherwise.  So far as I can recollect the present Minister stated last year that he was in favour of pasteurisation in the Cork area.  This is a question which must be considered and decided as soon as possible because many people are affected.  First, advantages would accrue to the consumer through an improved standard of milk.  I know that many farmers deliver on the Cork market milk of an excellent quality, but there are others and to say the least of them their milk is not of that quality; I need not go any further than that.  As a result of pasteurisation, people could be sure of the type of milk they would get.  At present if people who get milk at 8.30 or 9 in the morning go at 10.30 or 11 for some milk for a cup of tea, they find it thick and sour.  That may be a small individual problem, but a large number of individual problems combined make one mighty problem eventually.  Of course, the weather can cause many of our problems.</P>
    <P>As well as being of advantage to the consumer pasteurisation would also benefit the farm worker.  Very often people in Dublin or Cork whose milk is <Col N="1350" /> delivered to them in the morning never realise the very early hour at which the farm workers has to start milking the cows.</P>
    <P>They never realise the unearthly hour at which these men have to be on the road.  All that is taken for granted, so long as the milk is at the door.  Outside Cork City some farm workers have to strike out early, to have the cows milked, the men on the road, and the milk delivered to the city, and it means that life is fairly hard on them.  If by pasteurisation the number of hours worked and the early hours can be changed, it will be an advantage to the farm worker as well as to the consumer, and can give financial benefit to the producer, advantages which he may not be able to see at present.  If we fail to take advantage of pasteurisation, other concerns will probably move in, as individuals will group together and take over the responsibility, provided they can see a satisfactory financial return.  It will be regrettable if the day arrives in Cork City where other interests move in and make a success of pasteurisation, partly at the expense of the farmers. Therefore, the Minister must not lose sight of the fact that the attention of the farmers should be drawn to the advantages offered to them.  They should be told that the day is getting late, that the hours are moving on, and that it is essential, because of modern trends and modern health demands, that they should combine and take up the advantages already offered them through pasteurisation.</P>
    <P>I would finish on a point of greater importance than any I have mentioned so far, that of the farm worker.  While I heard many speakers, I heard only one mention this problem&mdash;my colleague, Deputy Dunne.  Speaker after speaker offered interesting contributions on agricultural problems, but the farm worker's name was never mentioned. The present Minister may have spoken outside about the wage he considers agricultural workers should get.</P>
    <P>I am not going to waste time picking out one statement of his at present or when in opposition, as that would not get us very far; yet it is significant <Col N="1351" /> that in the present Government's policy, through the Minister, as shown through this White Paper circulated by the Minister, nothing has been said about the agricultural worker.  During the emergency years, the agricultural worker was a slave to the land, he was denied the right to emigrate.  We know, of course, that too many workers have emigrated, but the agricultural worker was not allowed to go.  He was told his place was on the land, that he must stay there.  That was the policy during the emergency.  When we look back now on it as past history, it must be admitted that one section which played its part in helping this country at that time was that of the farm workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he has nothing to do with the policy on wages and conditions of agricultural workers. He is correct up to a point, but that does not relieve either him or the Government of responsibility for trying to improve the general policy on agriculture. I say with full responsibility that the Agricultural Wages Board should be wiped out.  Let us, if we wish, have a board on which both the agriculturist and the worker would be equally represented&mdash;somewhat like the Labour Court.  People may say the Labour Court has disadvantages, but I suppose everything in this life will offer some disadvantage.  An open court would be better than the present system.  At the present national or regional meetings the Press are not allowed in. Why?  I am not seeking to blame the present Minister.  I asked the Minister before him and we were refused.  Why refuse such an important thing as that?  Why is it that the Press cannot be allowed enter the holy precincts where an important discussion is to take place on the conditions and wages of the agricultural worker?  It is no wonder the Press are not allowed into some of those meetings.</P>
    <P>On one famous occasion a farmer representative from an area where farmers are well known to be prosperous stood up and, on behalf of the community that sent him there, demanded and insisted that, out of the wages being given to the indoor farm <Col N="1352" /> worker, after deducting his keep, which was natural, there should also be deducted 2/- a week for washing the worker's shirt.  That may seem a joke, but it is not a joke; it is on the records.  Why cannot such an attitude be brought out into the broad daylight? We surely should be in a position to say that we have nothing to hide.</P>
    <P>If the agricultural community have a case to put forward and are prepared to go into a room and show their disadvantages, their financial difficulties and so on, why not publish it? What is wrong in so doing?  If we are prepared, as we always have been, to go in and fight the cause of the farm worker, why must that be hidden from the light of day?  That policy, undoubtedly, which is putting the agricultural workers into the position of untouchables, is a policy which is giving poor returns.  We have now come to the stage where it is being said freely and often that agricultural workers cannot be got for any money. When they were there, they were treated in many cases in a manner which was not to the credit of those who employed them.  I have no intention of condemning all the employers, but what strikes me forcibly, from the records available to us, for the purpose of studying this matter, is that it is where the employers were financially not so well off that the workers were treated better, whereas in the many instances where the employers were well-to-do, the lot of the employees was anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In attempting to evolve a policy that will give us advantages in agriculture it must be realised that it will take a long time, perhaps, to weld the various viewpoints on the subject that exist in different parts of the country.  We must be prepared to move fast if we are to improve agriculture in our lifetime and to achieve the increased production for which we are all so anxious.  In connection with a policy for agriculture we must be prepared to consider not only the position of the farmer but the position of the farm worker, the man who gave all he had to the agricultural industry during the emergency, <Col N="1353" /> the man who got very little thanks and who, even to-day, gets very little pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing on which there is complete agreement here and that is that agriculture is the foundation of our economic structure and that the prosperity of the agricultural industry means the stability, prosperity and well-being of every section of the community.  May I be retrospective?  I think of the struggle of the Irish farmers and the people generally in co-operation with the old Irish Parliamentary Party, to get rid of the thraldom, the tyranny of landlordism, which inflicted upon every section of the community, but particularly on the farmers, lasting oppression and continuing rot.  That has passed away.  We have a national Government here and I am forced to ask myself what is the cause of the slow, almost imperceptible, progress in agriculture here?</P>
      <P>Let us relate the position in this country to the position in other countries in western Europe which are denied advantages and facilities which nature and beneficent Providence have bestowed on us.  Take, for instance, Denmark.  In the last 100 years the population of Denmark has trebled and in that country there is a progressive, developing agricultural industry.  According to Dr. Beddy, in 1944 the indebtedness of agriculture in Denmark represented £25 to the acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we have the advantages of fertile soil, suitable atmospheric conditions, and willing workers. No one can deny that the Irish farmer is a hard worker although I am afraid the Minister for Finance thought, quite recently, here, that the farmers were lethargic and did not give the results that might be expected.  I ask the Minister is the Irish farmer not hard working, progressive and intelligent? The question is, has he the capital wherewith to accomplish the increased production that the Government hope for.  If the indebtedness in Denmark represents £25 an acre compared with £1 here, is not that clear and unmistakable evidence of <Col N="1354" /> undercapitalisation and unco-operation with the farmer?</P>
    <P>The fact that western European countries, where the soil is less fertile than the soil of Ireland and where the atmospheric conditions are not as suitable as they are here, are progressing rapidly, in contrast to the position here, drives me to the conclusion that no real effort was made here until the Dillon rehabilitation scheme was put into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated, and it was generally accepted, that there were 4,500,000 acres unproductive in this country, due to silting up and other causes.  In a short space of about two years, under that scheme, according to reliable reports, 200,000 acres of such land has been in some measure rendered fertile and productive.</P>
    <P>We are told that the prosperity of any country depends on industrial and agricultural production.  Industrial development here depends in a great measure upon imports of raw materials. Quite recently, in concluding the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Tánaiste said&mdash;I am not quoting his exact words&mdash;that industrial development and prosperity here will depend, and must depend, very much on the home market.  I agree. Statistics show that about 62 per cent. of the people of this State depend mainly on agriculture.  That includes the farmer, the farmer's family and the worker.  If that estimate is right, what will happen if the industry in which 62 per cent. of the population are engaged is not prosperous?</P>
    <P>If, as Deputy Corry has said here over a number of years, from both sides of the House, the farmer is not being paid a price over and above the cost of production, it will be detrimental to the industry which is the pivot on which revolves the whole economic structure of our country.  If that section of our people are not prosperous, what earthly hope can we have of any successful development here?  How can we have a healthy economy when we have to depend mainly for our raw materials on abroad?</P>
    <P>One of my main reasons for <Col N="1355" /> contributing to this debate is to refer to one of our fundamental industries&mdash; the dairying industry.  I intend to approach this matter completely outside the domain of Party politics, and I would like the Minister to treat this matter objectively.  I hope to be able to help him and some of his inspectors and to point out to him the tragedy that is being enacted with regard to this industry.  On many occasions since the Minister took office, both over the air and at various county committee of agriculture meetings, he has appealed to the farmers to produce more, thereby reducing the millions of money being paid for imports.  I think the Taoiseach, in the early part of the present Administration, made a similar appeal, and the same holds good for some other members of the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister this question: What hope has he got of succeeding in getting the farmers to increase their production?  At the present time there is a big price for beef and store cattle, but how are we to ensure the continuty of store cattle if the dairying industry is destroyed? In March and April of this year I saw hundreds of in-calf heifers being offered to canners.  These were choice, coloured, shorthorn dairy cattle, many of them from a proven shorthorn dairy bull, engaged to be clear calved by the 10th May.  I know of farmers who attended these sales anxious to buy these in-calf heifers, but the price and the bidding were prohibitive.  I saw them follow buyers outside the ring, but money could not buy them from them.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine bought 500 of these heifers, but they passed to the canning factory.  In fact, thousands of in-calf heifers are passing daily to the canning factory.  Is that not clear proof that the beginning of the end of the dairying industry&mdash;our chief industry&mdash;is at hand?  In my own parish a small number of farmers, but relatively too many, sold out their dairy herds.  The Minister may say: I can answer that question by saying &ldquo;Did not other farmers buy them?&rdquo; that these herds went to the canning factories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> There is another aspect of this question which in my opinion, is the most serious of all.  I got my information from a most reliable source.  I do not think anybody would controvert the facts or question the honesty of the farmers who gave them to me.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one particular item.  In two stations in a certain area 32,000 dairy cows were put in calf by means of artificial insemination and 67 per cent of this number are now breeding for beef.  I am told, on good authority, that 72 per cent. of the dairy herd in another station are in calf for beef.  If this position of affairs continues for much longer it will spell the end of our whole dairying industry.  The Department thought they had arrived at a solution by laying down a charge of 25/- for the use of one bull and 15/- for the use of the other type.  Is it imagined that the farmer cares about the difference between 15/- and 25/-?  The farmer is a through business man working for the common good.  Let us take an example: a farmer with a herd of 30 cows takes 30 whiteheaded calves from a whiteheaded bull to the market and gets £10 or £11 for each calf, and in some areas perhaps more than this amount.  Another farmer takes 30 calves to the market from a guaranteed shorthorn bull and gets £5 or £5 10s. apiece for them or, at the most, £6 apiece.  Would any member of this Assembly suggest that any farmer, except one who should be medically examined, would depart from the type of calf which was of definite benefit to his bank account and adopt the other type?</P>
    <P>Is not that a nice picture, thousands of our in-calf heifers being sold for canning and thousands of our cows in calf being kept for the purpose of producing beef?  Without the dairy industry we would have nothing.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect.  It is a very serious one and one which has given me very grave concern.  I am not standing up here to attack anybody and make a political speech or attack Ministers of one Party or another. After 50 years' association with every <Col N="1357" /> Party in the public life of this little country, my sole aim and object is to see our country advance and be happy and progressive, irrespective of Parties or Governments.  Governments come and go but the nation remains.  Let us do our part with dignity and help whatever Government is in power to bring about the maximum results with the minimum trouble and taxation. Those are the very ethics of Christian idealism and social justice.  If I sit here in this Dáil it is by the authority and votes of the dairy people.</P>
    <P>It is easy to authenticate a statement, especially a responsible one.  I am not saying things that, on examination, would not be found to be entirely true or true at all.  I would present a lamentable figure if at a later stage someone were to say: &ldquo;Deputy Madden has made a serious statement.  Is it true?  My information is quite to the contrary&rdquo;.  A farmer not very far from me had 16 cows. He had them artificially inseminated from a whitehead bull for beef.  The first time that cost him £20.  The second time it cost him another £20 and a third time he went scouring the country looking for some old scrub bull to guarantee at least that the cows would subsequently calve.</P>
    <P>Another friend of mine, a member of Macra na Feirme, told me the other night that half of his cows were &ldquo;missing&rdquo; every three weeks and that is the general experience of the farmers.  That is a serious matter.  It is one to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  The Minister knows, any practical farmer knows and every Irishman knows that if a period of two or three months elapses during which you have to bring back the cows again that means they are two months late with the calf and two months' revenue is lost to the farmers.</P>
    <P>These were the few points that interested me.  I tried to put them before the Minister last Friday.  I am very glad that I have got the opportunity of doing it now.  The Minister wants production.  How are we going to get it?  The farmers say that the price which is being paid to-day for milk, 1/4 and 1/6 per gallon, is not enough.  It is not an economic price. <Col N="1358" /> I asked some of them what was an economic price.  The answer I got was one which I have heard repeatedly here from Deputy Corry, a guaranteed profit over and above the cost of production.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably reply and say: &ldquo;You know, Deputy Madden, that we have a commission sitting. We have asked them to examine and review the matter very carefully and submit to the Government, in due course, a careful analysis of what they consider should be the cost per gallon of milk.  Professor Murphy will then submit a report on the whole matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised when I heard the Minister contradict Deputy Blowick the other night.  The Minister ought to remember that about one and a half years ago he advocated in very serious language, to the point of conviction, to the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Dillon, that the farmers ought to be paid 1/6 per gallon and 1/9 in the winter.  I am sure the Minister would not deny that.  That statement was made nearly two years ago, when the Minister was Deputy Walsh.  He was a responsible member of the Kilkenny Agricultural Committee.  He was a long time associated with public life in the country and had received all the training in agriculture that a college could give him.  He said, with full responsibility, that he was convinced then, nearly two years ago, that the price which was being paid was not economic and that anything less than 1/6 in the summer would not give a guarantee of continuity to the dairy farmers.  I must take it from the Minister's silence that he did say that.  I am glad he did not contradict me because I have documentary evidence here which is absolutely convincing that he did say 1/6 and 1/9.</P>

      <P>The document is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Make milk dearer.  Kilkenny call to Mr. Dillon.  On the proposition of Mr. Mahony, seconded by Mr. Walsh, it was decided to ask the Minister to fix the price of milk supplied to creameries at 1/6 per gallon in the summer and 1/9 in the winter season.</P>
      <P>Mr. Walsh, T.D., said in connection with the price of milk, it was a recognised fact that the Minister must agree that the cost of production had increased.  There had been an increase in the price of beet.  Butter production had gone down and the best indication of the necessity of having the price of milk increased was the scarcity of butter at present.  Statistics had proved that.  In addition, for the first time in the past ten years, this country had to import butter.  Why, he asked.  Obviously there was something wrong.  What was wrong was that the price of milk was not sufficiently high to keep people in the dairying industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>That was purely political exigency but it did not prevent me from giving calm and deliberate support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture who made that pronouncement two years ago must admit that conditions for the farmer to-day are infinitely worse. The cost of labour has gone up, the incidence of taxation has increased, especially as a result of the recent Budget which will mean in our country that the ratepayers will have to find some thousands of pounds more.  As to the replacement of cattle, I pointed out that farmers came to a certain auction where in-calf heifers were being sold and guaranteed by a responsible auctioneer to be due to calve on the 10th May.  The auctioneer who gave that guarantee must be <Col N="1360" /> responsible for any delay.  But the farmers could not buy these heifers. That shows that the conditions have worsened for the dairying industry since the Minister made that speech with a full sense of his responsibility. What has he done since?</P>

      <P>As reported in the <i>Irish Press,</i> the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, dealing with his seven-point policy on the 19th of July, 1951 said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An increase in production for our exports, particularly agriculture, was urgently needed to reduce the trade deficit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told by experts from other countries that there must be a complete ploughing up of the soil.  According to experts, 80 per cent. of the grass of this country at the moment is of no food value.  I remember going with an inspector to one of my fields.  He took out a handkerchief and put it down on a square and from that square he was pulling ribs of this and that and calling them different names.  I said: &ldquo;I do not know what you call them, but I know what they are.  Will you give me time to write down the names of the weeds which you say are so fruitful here but are of no value to a man trying to make cattle pay, keep his family going and meet his ordinary commitments?&rdquo;<Col N="1361" /> He said, &ldquo;I will give you the names of them and if you travel every field in the country to-day you will find in every field 80 per cent. of such weeds which are of no food value.&rdquo; Is it any wonder that Denmark and other countries are so progressive and so advanced in agriculture and so completely at variance with the conditions of things here where you have had two or three native Governments for the last 30 years?  Here are the names of the weeds he read out to me: bent grass, fog grass, scutch grass, moss, creeping crowsfoot, ferns, crested dogtail, silver weed, black top, filustrums and daisies.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us to increase fertility and have a greater quantity of milk produced and more butter, also to keep more pigs which can be done as a result of dairying.  We are told to do that when superphosphates are costing £20 per ton.  What co-operation has ever been given by the Government to facilitate the farmer by way of a loan?  He has been turned down.  I know that the Minister was asked and I know that the answer he gave was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  On the one hand, the Minister tells us to go on and produce more, while his Department inspectors say, &ldquo;How can you produce more when 80 per cent. of the land is growing grass that is of no value?&rdquo;  They say, &ldquo;Plough it up, give it lime and fertilisers, re-seed and rotate it and in a few years you will have beneficial and productive results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking on the Vote for his Department on the 19th July, 1951, said, and I agree with him:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main aim of the economic policy was to utilise the natural resources of the country to the fullest extent.  No expansion of consequence in exports can come through cattle and sheep production, except with the certainty of further rural depopulation with its adverse social effects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is some significance in that. That is asking the farmers to stop rearing and selling cattle and sheep which are giving economic results. They are the only things that are really paying the farmers, with the <Col N="1362" /> minimum of cost, if you like.  Who will blame the farmers for doing that? Would not the Taoiseach do the same thing himself?  A man who would do anything else should be medically examined.  We are told by Deputy Corry and by the Minister that selling milk at anything less than 1/6 and 1/9 per gallon is not economic. Why then should we go away from cattle and sheep which are paying and revert to the development of the dairying industry which is not paying?</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach mentioned the question of rural depopulation. That is the most serious problem we have, as Dr. Lucey, Coadjutor Bishop of Cork pointed out recently. Deputy Hickey, in a very sound and constructive speech some time ago, pointed out that there were 140,000 fewer men employed in agriculture within a short space of time, men with technical knowledge and men who knew their jobs.  No fewer than 140,000 of these have gone away to find work in another country.  That is an appalling tragedy.  I remember raising this matter in 1936 when I was a member of the Seanad, the thing looked to me so catastrophic and so appalling.  The Registrar-General at that time reported that a great number of rural schools had been closed, that there were 60,000 fewer boys and girls attending national schools between the years 1926 to 1936. I remember then saying in the Seanad, and I repeat it now&mdash;we may have differences which will be forgotten when we are gone, but the nation will survive after us and we should try as Irishmen to maintain the nation in unity and in prosperity. We should not have to listen in an Irish Parliament to such things as &ldquo;Where were you during the Civil War?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said before and I shall repeat it that the O'Donnells, the MacCarthys and the O'Sullivans are flying and the Jews, the Belgians and others are coming in.  If you stand at the corner of one of our city streets, say at the corner of Gardiner Street, and listen to the conversation of a group there, you will have to strain your ears to discover the language in which the conversation is <Col N="1363" /> being carried on.  The Irish are flying; as Deputy Hickey said, 140,000 of them went within a very short time.  Dr. Lucey, the Coadjutor Bishop of Cork, said recently that 50,000 had gone within a few years.  These are problems that should seriously disturb the minds of responsible members of the Government, whose duty it is to find ways and means of tackling such problems and putting the country on the right road.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to finish with a quotation from the Taoiseach.  He spoke of depopulation as a terrible tragedy, but nothing is said of a greater tragedy that I could not mention but which I could authenticate, when they do go.  Did anybody ever think that we would see the reality in our days of the dangers pointed out to us by the poet:</P>
    <P>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</P>
    <P>And these far departing, seek a kinder shore,</P>
    <P>When rural mirth and manners are no more.</P>
    <P>Poor Goldsmith!  The Taoiseach stated the only alternative is the development of substantial exports of dairy produce and that a condition precedent is a favourable adjustment of milk and butter prices in relation to cattle and sheep.  You had the Minister two years ago admitting and almost accepting responsibility, as a Deputy of this House and as a man of character, that the price then was entirely insufficient to maintain an industry which is the very foundationstone of the whole economic structure of this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that an adjustment of milk and butter prices must be made in relation to cattle and sheep prices.  I accept that.  Two-year-old store cattle in 1947 made £32 19s. and in 1951 £44 per head.  Three-year-old cattle made in 1947 £37 3s. 9d. and in 1951, £47 4s. 9d. per head.  Two-year-old sheep made £5 14s. in 1947 and in 1951 £6 19s. 6d.  In 1947 fat sheep made £6 6s. and in 1951 £9 18s. 6d. per head. Three-year-old cattle increased in that <Col N="1364" /> period by 33? per cent.; two-year-olds by 22½ per cent. and fat sheep by 57 per cent.  The Taoiseach, as I say, has told us that the price of milk and butter must be related to the increase in the price of cattle and sheep.  I suggest that you might divide the average of these increases by two and apply that as the amount of increase to be made immediately available in the price of milk and butter.  That would be much better than submitting the matter to a commission of inquiry which may take 12 months to arrive at any conclusion.  Such a commission may spend most of its time in filing documents and in looking for evidence before it can furnish any tangible report. Let the remedy be applied now as the position is serious.</P>
    <P>I think very serious notice should be taken of a recent letter signed by a gentleman whom we all respect in the public life of this country.  I sat for about ten years beside him in the Seanad.  He has the technical knowledge and the honesty of purpose which qualify him to speak with special knowledge on agricultural matters and whenever he submitted a document and put his name to it, those of us who knew him were bound to be influenced by the honesty of purpose that obviously inspired him.  I allude to Senator Joseph Johnston.  He says that thousands of these young cattle are being slaughtered.</P>
    <P>I could not finish on a better note than his, if he will pardon me even using a line of his matter.  He says the high prices of beef and store cattle have caused the destruction and loss of tens of thousands of heifers which in the normal way would go back to replenish losses in milch cows. Then he goes on to ask: &ldquo;What is going to happen in three years' time?&rdquo;  He says he has confidence in the Minister and I hope that confidence will be justified by the Minister paying heed to the appeal which I am making to-night.  The dairying industry is in a parlous condition. Your artificial insemination programmes and the breeding of beef cattle are in contradiction to the breeding of dairy shorthorn cows. You cannot blame the farmer if he adopts the form of agricultural <Col N="1365" /> economy which is most likely to bring him a quick and profitable return.  I appeal to the Minister if he was honest in the statements he made two years ago that he should now give practical effect to these statements by going to the Minister for Finance to seek the financial help necessary to put the industry on a prosperous footing.  The Taoiseach as I pointed out said that we must relate prices in the dairying industry to the price of meat.  The price of meat as I have pointed out has gone up on the average by about 35 per cent. Increase the price of milk even by half as much and you will be able to give a price to milk producers that will pay them.  I suggest furthermore that instead of paying 1/4 a gallon in summer and 1/9 per gallon in winter, when there is a very low production the system should be reversed, that we should pay 1/9 in summer when there is a heavy production of milk and 1/4 in winter when the price does not matter so much as production is very low.</P>
    <P>I do not trouble this House very often; it is time for me now to think of other members.  I make this appeal to the Minister, coming as I do from the centre of the dairying industry and having made a very careful study of the decline of production in recent years.  I could not tell you how many farmers I have interviewed or how much work I have put into this investigation. It did not matter to me whether the farmers whom I interviewed belonged to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  I got up-to-date information and all the statistics about the white-headed bull and the threatened destruction of the dairying industry with the ancillary industries of poultry rearing and calf rearing.  I make this appeal to the Minister quite apart from any political feeling.  When I am no longer a member of this House, there will be a record of that appeal to show that I raised the matter in this House so that the Minister cannot plead ignorance of the matter.  The record will be there and I am glad that I shall be numbered amongst those who drew the attention of the Minister to the urgency of this question, and to the tragedy that threatens the dairying <Col N="1366" /> industry which, if it fails, may bring in the train of its failure the ultimate ruin and economic destruction of the whole State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not usually intervene in a debate on agriculture, but the Minister will remember that a few weeks ago I spoke to him concerning the export of horses for slaughter.  I wish to take this opportunity of making a further appeal to him.  I think a case has been made to show that cruelty does exist-cruelty and hardship both on the journey and at the other end.  When I say cruelty on the journey, I want to make it clear that I think the horses are well looked after here.  I think that the horses are as well looked after on the boats which leave our ports as the men on the ships can ensure and as well as our veterinary experts can ensure by means of examination at the Irish ports.  But, undoubtedly, the sea journey causes cruelty and suffering to the horses especially during severe weather.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the regulations which have been made in England with regard to the shipping, etc. of horses.  As I have said, during the actual journey the horses suffer hardship and cruelty, but they suffer a very much greater degree of cruelty from the time they arrive at the continental ports until they meet their death.  The methods of slaughter in the continental abattoirs are not, unfortunately, as humane as we would like them to be.  I should say, too, in that respect that we have reports of the bad conditions which exist in some of the black-market abattoirs in England.  I think, however we can leave that safely to the English people themselves who have been pioneers in this matter of the humane treatment of animals. Public opinion has been aroused in England on behalf of animals, and I think that question will be dealt with there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is no sign that the conditions in France and Belgium are going to be remedied by the peoples in those countries.  Therefore, a responsibility rests on us here which we cannot escape.  We are a horse <Col N="1367" /> loving people.  We owe a great deal to the horse.  A great deal of our economy has been built up on the horse and a lot of our tourist trade comes to us from our love of animals and from the success which we have had in breeding horses.  I would urge on the Minister, however, that, as regards the export of horses, we are unfortunately getting a bad name abroad.  That is not our fault.  We do our best to see that the animals are exported under humane conditions, but the position is that we cannot improve conditions abroad.  There is nothing that we can do here to improve the condition of slaughterhouses in France or Belgium which have standards that we, in this country, would not put up with.</P>
    <P>If we feel, as a very large number of people in this country do feel, that we ought to do something about this, the obvious remedy is to stop the export of horses for slaughter.  I know that is a very big question.  It is not one that can be easily remedied, and I do not want to embarrass the Minister. In this respect, the Minister and the previous Minister, indeed, have put forward the argument&mdash;I presume it is a departmental one&mdash;that the export of dressed horse-meat would interfere with our export of dressed beef.  That is an argument which very many people do not accept, and when I say &ldquo;very many people&rdquo; I include many people who are in the beef trade and who are in a position to know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why, I think, that argument is an unsound one is that horse-meat can be readily distinguished from beef.  The continental buyers, and especially the continental housewives, can readily tell the difference between horse-meat and beef.  Another reason is that horse-meat and beef are sold in different shops.  There you have three reasons why the horse and the beef trade would not interfere with each other. There is a further reason which seems to make nonsense of the departmental opinion.  It is this, that on the Paris market at any rate, a horse steak commands a higher price than beef. <Col N="1368" /> That would seem to show that not only would the French people not mind if they bought horse-meat in mistake for beef, but that in certain circumstances they would apparently be rather pleased since it is an undoubted fact that, in certain circumstances, they will pay a higher price for the horse-meat.  That would seem to indicate that we here are trying to save people from something which they themselves show no very great evidence of wishing to be saved from.</P>
    <P>Another reason is&mdash;and this is perhaps one of the biggest reasons actuating the Minister's policy&mdash;that dishonest people might export horse-meat deliberately as beef.  In answer to that, I think that ordinary commercial practice would protect the buyers of the animals.  That is to say, that if a man sells an article purporting to be one thing and it turns out to be something else, the trade will find him out in a very short time, and he will not be in business very long. The commercial world has a way of dealing with people who sell an article in that manner.</P>
    <P>Another way in which that could be dealt with would be by appointing inspectors in the dressed meat carcase factories.  These inspectors would ensure that only beef was exported as beef.  Another way would be to license factories to deal with horse-meat and not with beef.  It would appear to be quite easy to prevent fraudulent practices from creeping in, even if the trade were not sufficiently wide awake to protect themselves.  I do not want to go into the matter at great length. I went into it before with the Minister. There is the evidence of cruelty and hardship and suffering where these animals are concerned.  A tremendous number of people are very greatly disturbed by this practice and the cruelties which result from it.  I urge on the Minister to encourage the establishment of a dressed meat trade. It would have the effect of keeping in this country the valuable by-products which are lost to the country when horses are exported on the hoof.  I refer to by-products such as hides, glue and so forth, which would be of <Col N="1369" /> value to industry in this country and which would mean a great deal of employment in this country.  Another result of the encouragement of the dressed meat trade in this country would be to show to the world that not only do we love horses and treat them well but that we are prepared to go to a great deal of trouble to prove that our love of horses is not mere lipservice and that we are taking all the steps that animal lovers would wish us to take to protect these animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell has mentioned horses.  I am a great lover of horses but we must not forget that a large number of people depend for a livelihood on the price of horses.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture I approached him about the export of horses.  He assured me that everything possible was done for these animals and that he had sent men to foreign countries in connection with the matter.  If I thought that we could avoid having horse flesh sold as beef I should be all out in favour of having horses killed.  No matter what Deputy Dockrell may say, it would be an utter impossibility to prevent horse flesh from being sold as beef because it could be exported from this country as dressed horse meat and on the Continent it could be taken out of the cans and sold as dressed Irish beef.</P>
      <P>If you go down to the North Wall and look at the cattle which are being shipped to Birkenhead and then go across to Birkenhead and examine them on arrival you will see that they are very tossed about and sometimes very sick.  Some of them are shivering and shaking and it would make you cry sometimes to see them.  Then again, just consider the manner in which the Jewish people slaughter their cattle. I am aware of, and I respect, their religious rites but, in considering a matter such as this, we should bear all the facts in mind.  Consider the manner in which beasts are slaughtered at the Jewish abattoirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I love horses as much as any other man in this country.  I went to Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture about the matter and he assured me that no cruelty was inflicted <Col N="1370" /> on the horses that are exported. From what I hear I feel sure that our present Minister for Agriculture is looking after that matter also.  If I thought for one moment that it would be possible for us to have a dressed meat export trade in horse flesh in this country I should be very glad but, to be quite honest, I do not see how such an industry could be administered effectively.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies are making much ado about the decline in the cow population while Deputy Dillon was Minister.  No matter who is Minister, the cow population will decrease while the present export prices prevail. When I first went to the Dublin market 25 years ago you would not see a cow there because at that time cows fetched no more than £1 apiece. For that reason they were not exported, to the benefit of the country.  Consider, however, the present prices which cattle fetch.  An animal that is only a hurl of bones will now make £25 to £30.  We hear a lot of talk about the price of milk but I consider, and I know what I am talking about, that the present situation is a help to the dairy industry.  I know people in my county who milk out their cows and then export them.  They get a good price for the milked-out cows which they export and with that money they can purchase good milkers.  Our problem is to maintain our stock of cattle and it is the duty of the Minister to evolve some scheme with that end in view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Madden said that we should breed whiteheads for beef.  I have a lot of shorthorns but, nevertheless, I can see that the breed is going out. When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he bought a farm at Grange and another at Castleknock. He stocked these farms with hundreds of shorthorn heifers.  I consider that his action is to be commended.  From to-morrow onwards I am going to do what a man whom I know did.  When his cow was milked-out he sold it for export and with the money he received he purchased two milkers.  In that way he lost nothing on the transaction. I hope that the Government and the Minister and the Department will devise some means of maintaining <Col N="1371" /> the shorthorn heifer and cow in this country and of doing away with canning.  I do not believe what Deputy Madden said about the killing of incalf heifers for canning.  I know a man who put a valuable animal, which was a hurl of bones, on the market for £28.  He sold it to me and I got £39 for it.  Would it not be all to the good if the dairyman could get that price?  We have a Department of Agriculture with millions of pounds at its disposals and surely that Department should be able to solve the problem of bringing back the shorthorn heifer to the farmer and the dairyman.</P>
    <P>The late Minister went on those lines and that scheme should be extended. You will not get the farmer breeding the shorthorn because the whitehead calf is worth £5 to £6 more and the whitehead calf is a big asset to the country because he is going out as beef.  What are we living on at the present time only on all the cattle we export?  Is it not our chief industry? The Department of Agriculture should take steps to extend this scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of discussion about loans for farmers and in regard to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The corporation is a fraud.  A man must be thoroughly sound before he can obtain a loan.  I have in mind the case of a poor farmer from Kilbeggan. He was ill for four or five years.  He had a farm of 60 to 70 acres but things went wrong.  He did not owe a shilling to anybody.  He had seven or eight cattle on his farm.  On approaching the corporation for a loan of three or four hundred pounds his application was refused.  Why did he not get the loan?&mdash;because the poor fellow drove up in an old motor car which he bought for £40.  That is the reason.  That is not the approach which should be made to this problem.  I receive numerous letters from people inquiring as to what is the use of advertising these loan facilities, putting people to the trouble of going to their neighbours and exposing their affairs to them for the sake of obtaining a loan and then sending them off with a refusal.  If a man is badly off is that not the man to help?  If the Credit Corporation <Col N="1372" /> never get it back is it not an asset to the country that that farmer buys a few heifers?  The system is all wrong. They give money to a person in a good way.  What good is giving money to him?  To give it to the man who is down and out is a more sensible policy.  We all have to take chances.  Why not take a chance in this case when it is worth while to take it?</P>
    <P>We also had discussion on this question of cattle population, with one side holding the other responsible for a reduction in population in this respect.  It has been contended that during the term of office of the last Minister for Agriculture the cattle population went down.  From what I see I am convinced that it will be down twice as much by the time the present Minister leaves office.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dairying industry, it is my opinion that butter cannot be produced at an economic price until some such scheme as I mentioned is operated.  Nobody could sell milk at 2/- per gallon and there is no use in expecting good results until steps are taken to put forward a satisfactory scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was speaking about exporting cows.  If more encouragement were given to the rearing of the shorthorn heifers, it would result in greater wealth for the country, even though it is exported in beef because all these meat exports are the lifeblood of the country.</P>
    <P>Much has been said in relation to wheat and as to the reason why people are not growing it.  They are not growing wheat because there is no organisation for it.  The day has come when labour and everything else has become so dear that you cannot economically till.  I want to till and my neighbours want to till but it is not a paying proposition.  If we want to have wheat in sufficient quantity to provide all our own bread in this country, we must strike a different note.  Until such time as we can produce all our own bread we must give up thinking of anything else except the combine harvester. What are our Government doing? There is a particular problem in this connection.  The farmer has his combine.  He sends the wheat out to <Col N="1373" /> the mill but he does not get £3 for it because of the moisture content in it. The Department could cure that.  If you read last week's issue of the <i>Stockbreeder</i>, a farmer's journal, published in England, you would find that the British Government had recognised the necessity for building granaries on the farmer's land.  There is no use in building them for the miller. They are required in the farmer's yard.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the farm improvements scheme.  What is given under this scheme would hardly pay for the cement.  If 100 per cent. grants were given for the purposes for which this scheme was intended, it would pay the country.  It would be worth while to build granaries around every farmer's house and give them a grant for driers.  We have a lot of horses which we all love looking at, but we have not sufficient of them. Unfortunately, there is no lead given in matters of this kind.  If a farmer brings a load of oats from the country, he is put to considerable inconvenience; if he is waiting for ten minutes in the street with that big load he is summoned and brought to the police court without any thought given to the inconvenience which results.</P>
    <P>The lime scheme is the best scheme that ever came into the country.  At the beginning of last year you had the fertiliser manure scheme.  The manure was cheap enough last year, but conditions have changed.  There are many farmers who will have to get their land tested.  If they want to avail of the fertiliser scheme an inspector comes and tests the land.  He tells them they need so much lime per acre and so much manure, but the price of manure this year is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, as the lime is available at its present price, the farmers should be allowed to forgo the manure part of it for the time being until manure reaches an economic level.  The position at the moment is that you must do your whole farm.  A man receives the result of the test and the inspector informs him that so much lime and so much superphosphate must be applied.  The prices <Col N="1374" /> are abnormally high, and if the farmer carries out work he is putting that large debt on his land and putting a load around his children's neck.  I would suggest that that scheme be changed in order to allow the farmer to have the benefit of all the lime for his farm, because that is cheap enough; then give him a map of the test.  The farmer can, if he is progressive and if he is a good farmer, put so much manure on one year and so much the next year.  Let him put on all the lime, give him a map of the test, and let him go around the farm and apply the manure according as he can afford it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the lime scheme is all right, but a lot of farmers complain they are not receiving their weight. There would be 50 or 60 tons of lime sent in railway lorries.  There is no means of weighing it, and I understand that at no limestone burning factory is there a weighbridge.  When the railway lorry delivers the lime to the farmer, he has to take his chance as regards the weight.  Some scheme should be thought out.  There should be a weighbridge, and an arrangement something on the lines of that provided for the beet growers, whereby a charge of 3d. or 4d. per ton could be made, the Department sending a man to do all this and have all the lime weighed going out.  It is not fair to the farmers.  I know the factories have no wish to be dishonest. Unfortunately one man may not take as big a load as another man, and if you get two loads thrown side by side you can see the discrepancy.  They are not the same size.  Weighbridges should be constructed so that each load can be weighed before it leaves the factory.  Even if the farmer had to pay an extra 3d. per ton to meet the cost of that, it would be well worth his while in the end.  The factories are not niggardly about the lime, and I am not criticising them in any way. I am merely pointing out that loads vary in size.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of these pipes being used for drainage at all.  I think the old stone shore is infinitely preferable. Pipes are bound to get clogged, and in 20 years' time I believe all those <Col N="1375" /> pipes will be thrown up on the land. If suitable stone cannot be procured for the old shore type of drainage, then some other method should be devised.</P>
    <P>Under the water supply scheme for farmers' houses, I think the Minister should extend that scheme to yards and other parts of the farms where water is not available.  Water is essential for cattle but if a farmer lays on water for his cattle he gets no grant for it.  It would be a tremendous advantage to have the grant made available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the question of the moisture content of wheat.  Moisture content played havoc with those who grew wheat last year. Growers were supposed to get 70/- a barrel but the most any of them made, after the wheat had been dried, was £3.  Something should be done to improve the present position in that respect.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the price of carcase meat is relatively the same as that for meat on the hoof.  That is not so.  There is a difference of 3d. or 3½d. per lb. at the present time. The hides helped out last year because the Minister paid 2/6 per lb. for hides.  That has now been done away with unfortunately.  If steps are not taken immediately to improve the situation the consequences may well be disastrous.  I appeal to the Minister to do something to ensure that the men who work on the hides will be paid for them.</P>
    <P>The potato situation has been handled very badly.  Bigger grants should be made available for the steamers and people should be encouraged to make more use of them. The farmer should be taught how to use them to most advantage.  Potatoes are now being thrown into the ditches out of the way instead of being processed for feeding.</P>
    <P>A good deal of criticism was hurled at Deputy Dillon while he was Minister for Agriculture because of the developments in the oat situation. There should be just as much, if not more, criticism now and I appeal to the Minister to do something to <Col N="1376" /> remedy the present unsatisfactory position.  Most of last years' crop is still lying on the farmer's hands.  I do not want to do any shouting but I hope those oats will be got out of the way before this year's crop comes on the market.</P>
    <P>Is there a fixed minimum price for feeding barley this year?  Last year we had a fixed price.  If there is no fixed minimum price and the millers find a lot of barley coming on the market at the same time the price will collapse.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about farmers not pulling their weight, not paying income-tax and all the rest of it.  That is just so much nonsense. Any farmer I know is paying his income-tax unless he is heavily loaded in the bank.  Farmers have to pay enormous rates.  They are not so well off as some people would have us believe.  They may get big prices for their cattle, but that is not all profit. A man who gets £60 for a beast may have bought the beast for £50.  When you analyse them the profits are not so big at all.  My land is costing me £7 or £8 per acre in rates alone. Prices may appear to be good but all the money is paid out again.</P>
    <P>Consider for a moment the cost of agricultural machinery at the present time.  Consider the cost of replacements. It takes two pairs of socks to plough an acre of land.  Inferior quality socks cost 8/- apiece.  Good ones cost 18/-.  That is where the farmer's profits go.  It costs about 30/- an acre to buy twine to tie wheat at present prices.  Deputy Corry said it costs 30/- an acre to get rid of the wheat midge.  We do not suffer from midge but we are plagued with rabbits and crows.  A neighbour of mine found his barley gone overnight because of the depredations by crows.  All the farmers are out with sticks and twine and thread and glitter bags, but all to no avail. These are the problems we have to face.  One asks a neighbouring farmer: &ldquo;How is your barley doing?&rdquo; and the reply is: &ldquo;Oh, the rabbits eat it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are up against all those things, and it is not all so rosy as people think.  I see in the papers that city people are inclined to run down the <Col N="1377" /> farmers, but let them remember that the farmers are the lifeblood of the nation.  It is from what the farmers export that the money comes.  The townspeople live on the money the farmers get for their stock, and if it were not for the farmers coming up to Dublin and spending their money foolishly enough on gadgets, where would they all be?  The people in the towns should be very slow to run down the farmers.  They were very glad to have them during the emergency, when they produced the food to save the people from being hungry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Madden referred to what the Taoiseach said about the dairying industry, but, in my opinion, we would be better off importing butter and forgetting about dairying.  Get the money, the dollars, back by sending out heifers, and remember that if you do away with cattle, you will leave his industry less economical for the dairying farmer.  If he does not get the price for his cattle, he has no chance of living, and if he does not get the price of the white-headed calf, where is he?  We are sending our produce all over the world, to America, Spain and Holland, and that is the business to cater for.  Bring the money into the country and forget about butter. Export some if we have to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important Estimate we have to deal with and I find myself in agreement with much of what Deputy Fagan has said. This country depends on farming and it is essential that we should increase our production.  If we do not do so, we will not be able to maintain the standard of life we enjoy at present or have the social services we require.  I agree that exports are going up.  They have gone up considerably and the whole face of agriculture, taken by and large, is improving, but I do not think there is any reason why we should look at the situation with complacency.  Unless we can considerably increase our production we are going to run into stormy weather.  Agriculture is paying for everything here.  We have many subsidised industries, and, although I do not know much about the industrial <Col N="1378" /> life of the country, I know that the money to pay these subsidies and to provide the support which these industries get comes out of agriculture, in the final analysis.</P>
      <P>How are we to increase our production? The key to increased production is the feeding of live stock.  That is a very deep problem and a very difficult problem to deal with.  The backbone of the agricultural community is the small farmer, and unless and until the small farmer is able to feed his stock to give it a good start, we are not going to increase our agricultural production to any great extent.  That is bound up to a considerable degree with oats, and our position with regard to oats is a very difficult one for any Minister to deal with, because it seems that when we have plenty of oats, our neighbours have plenty of oats, and when we are short of oats, the climate here and in Great Britain being very much the same, they are short of oats.  The answer is that we should be able to provide against the lean day and that is a big problem.  It is not a problem for the farmers alone&mdash;it is a national problem, a problem which the Department will have to face in a big way sooner or later, that is, assuming that the Department accepts the fact that oats is one of the essential ingredients for the fattening of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to go in detail into the fluctuating prices of oats, but, in the same season a couple of years ago, I have known oats in Gorey to sell at about 24/-, while in New Ross, in the South Wexford area, it was making 34/- and 35/-.  We have heard the screams of indignation from Deputies now on the benches opposite about farmers being left with their oats, but the same position obtains to-day.  I am not putting the blame particularly on the Minister or on anybody else, but that is a situation which has to be faced and faced, as I said, in a broad way.  The only way to deal with the oats situation is by spending money on the building of storage for grain&mdash;a vast amount of storage.  It would pay the Government well, in a year when oats is plentiful, to buy in all the oats they can lay hands on and store it against the year when we have not got oats ourselves.  If we do not, <Col N="1379" /> we will have to import oats from foreign markets, as we had to do recently.  We had to bring oats across the world, but it had to be brought in because it is an essential foodstuff.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Department, whether working in association with the Department of Industry and Commerce or some other Department to buy oats from the farmers and store it here.  They will not lose any money on it, because, in a short supply year, it will be bought back again.  I would not ask the Department, however, to accept the responsibility in its entirety.  The small farmers should be encouraged to feed their stock, and the difficulty in that respect is again the same difficulty&mdash; lack of storage.  I agree with what Deputy Fagan says: the farm improvements scheme is not sufficient.  If a man proposes to feed his stock, he has to keep 30, 40 or 50 barrels of oats. Where is he going to put it?  Is he going to put it on the road?  If he is not to put it on the road, he must build storage, and where is he to get the money, unless it is lent to him?  If it is lent to him, is it not money well spent?  If every small farmer was feeding to the maximum capacity, would production not go up?  Would stock not be well reared, and would not the young stock which we sell to the bigger farmer&mdash;I am speaking as a small farmer, because I am a small farmer and, I hope, a practical farmer &mdash;come to maturity not only months, but a year, and possibly a year and a half, sooner than is the case at present?</P>
    <P>We are losing huge sums of money. A farmer going to a fair nowadays will buy beasts which are maybe three years old and then it takes another year or perhaps more to bring them to maturity.  If stock were properly fed they would reach maturity much sooner.  Take a half Hereford two and a half years old.  I had a Hereford heifer a year and eight months old which was fed and fit for the knife.  I fed it because I was in a position to have storage and feeding stuffs.  I would ask the Minister to pay attention to that.  The farm improvements scheme and many other schemes initiated by <Col N="1380" /> his predecessor&mdash;I take off my hat to him; he was the best Minister for Agriculture we had so far&mdash;were a beginning but they were not sufficient.  We want national storage and storage for farmers.  That will settle the oats question once and for all.</P>
    <P>Remember that there are some people in this country who cannot grow wheat.  I hope the Minister is listening to that.  The Minister can grow wheat, I can grow wheat, but there are many parts of Ireland where the people cannot grow wheat.  They were practically beggared in the emergency when they were forced to grow it, and it was not economic for the country because they were getting no return.  I believestrange as it may seem&mdash;in growing wheat&mdash;that is, anybody who has the land and is able to do so, but there is no use in growing wheat unless you can get a proper return.  In the present situation the farmers' costs are increasing, and it is good for Dublin people to hear that because they think we have it all our own way.  Everything is going up for the farmer.  During the past 12 months wages have gone up by 12/6 a week.  I am not decrying that as a man is worthy of his hire, but it is a charge on the farmer. Rates have gone up in my constituency and, furthermore, they will go up again.  Every public institution will be faced with extra charges and must come to the rates for the money.  The farmers provide the bulk of the rates in the country so they will pay more rates.  What about machinery? There seems to be no limit to the rise in the price of that.  Is it the raw material?  Is it the labour?  I do not know what it is, but it is an increased charge for the farmers.</P>
    <P>Take binder twine.  We all got a nice shock this year when we discovered that it was £14 5s. a cwt. as against £11 last year&mdash;a 25 per cent. increase in price.  If you are to grow wheat therefore you must get a good return.  I cannot deal in official terms of cwts. and English acres, but unless you can get 16 barrels to the Irish acre it is not economic to grow wheat at present prices.  I am not saying that it is really economic to get that yield but <Col N="1381" /> you will not lose if you have a good year and escape the wheat midge. How many farmers however can get that yield?  Very few.  What is the answer?  I think the answer is that the Minister should increase the price of wheat.  I find myself in total agrecment with what Deputy Fagan said about combined harvesters and the moisture cut.  The combined harvester is clearly coming to stay in this country.  Any device that will save labour will stay in this country.  The combined harvester is a method of harvesting used by the majority of big farmers and it is the big farmers who grow the bulk of the wheat in Ireland.  If their price is to be cut, if they find that instead of getting the statutory price of 75/- they are to get 55/- or 60/- per barrel they will not grow it and that is all.  The Minister should consider revising the price.  I agree that it is an advance on the original price but costs have risen and risen again and will rise further.</P>
    <P>I find myself at a loss to understand the barley situation.  Maiting barley is largely grown in Wexford. We claim to be one of the best tillage counties in Ireland.  We can hold up our heads and hold to that.  Farmers in my constituency find a difficulty in getting contracts for barley.  They had at all times a difficulty in getting contracts from the maltsters although they are prepared to grow it in the areas where it can be grown&mdash;I personally cannot grow it in my area&mdash;such as Enniscorthy and the south.  Last year we had to import 2,000 tons of barley.  Surely there must be some big blunder somewhere, whether the Department or the maltsters are responsible, in not assessing the need sufficiently.  Where that barley came from, Poland, is one of the lands of sweated labour. Why should Irish people assist or countenance sweated labour by importing 2,000 tons of barley when we can grow it ourselves?  I hope that it will not happen again.</P>
    <P>A lot of farmers in Wexford are dissatisfied with the price of barley.  The price which obtained when Deputy Dillon was Minister was 84/- per barrel, and I think I am right in claiming <Col N="1382" /> that had he remained as Minister Guinesses would have been prepared to give even more than that.  It could be argued that then nobody would grow any wheat, but if the Minister gives a satisfactory price he will get all the wheat he wants from people who can grow wheat and cannot grow barley.  I cannot see why the price of barley should be reduced except to try to get people to grow wheat.  The result is that in any case he must import barley while we do not seem to get any more wheat.</P>
    <P>We seem to have every sort of difficulty in Wexford, and because we are a tillage county we have a difficulty with potatoes.  Farmers in my constituency are unable to sell potatoes this year.  During the tenure of office of the late Government they marketed their potatoes.  There was an export market to Britain.  I understand the Department endeavoured to renew the contract.  Every contract is two-sided, however, and I believe that Britain refused to continue the contract any longer.  I am referring now to ware potatoes.  In the north of Wexford, and I think the same state of affairs obtains in South Wicklow, there is an area where potatoes are extensively grown and these people find themselves with enormous quantities of potatoes on hands which they are unable to sell. I do not say it is the Minister's fault entirely, but we cannot absolve the Department of all responsibility.  I believe efforts were made to obtain some export markets and that certain quantities went to Iceland and other places.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when replying to deal with this problem, which is of considerable interest in my constituency, and to clarify the position regarding potatoes.  There is no use in people in Wexford growing potatoes <i>ad lib</i> and then being told to feed them to pigs.  There is a limit to human endurance.  Let anyone try to fatten pigs on potatoes, with the difficulties of obtaining labour and the difficulty of the housewife in obtaining help nowadays.  It is practically a physical impossibility.  A lot of us would like to know if we should curtail the production of potatoes or not. <Col N="1383" /> I realise that the seed potato question is fairly satisfactory.  I think the arrangements made by the Department are pretty good.  Early potatoes are a dead letter, I am afraid, but that relates again to the British market. They have the same climate as ours, and when they have plenty of early potatoes we have plenty also.  They were always a gamble, and I do not think the Minister can help very much in that respect, but I would like him to clarify the position regarding ware potatoes.</P>
    <P>The butter question is a very vexed one.  It is an accepted fact that it is very difficult for farmers to sell their butter.  It may be that it is not up to first-class standard in these cases, but whatever the reason there are large quantities of farmers' butter held at the moment for which there is only a limited price.  I heard the Minister himself state the other evening that he had got an export market at 2/3 a lb.  Of course, that is not economic. There are two schools of thought on butter.  Some people feel we should give up making butter here except for our own personal requirements and that we should import butter.  I feel somehow that that is a risky problem. Being an island people and not having our own ships, or our Navy sufficiently strong to protect them in bringing in the stuff, I feel we should always produce as much as is humanly possible at home.  If the farmers are left with large quantities of butter on hands, we must do something about it.  Butter seems to be tied up with other problems. There is the major problem of labour on the farm.  I believe the travelling creameries, as initiated, I think, by the last Minister for Agriculture and now accepted by his successor, provide a very good scheme but the average person in the country really knows very little about it.</P>
    <P>If those travelling creameries were to go round and take the milk from the people, make butter and give them back butter for their own requirements and do it on a large scale and if they had the separated milk to feed the pigs and to rear <Col N="1384" /> live stock, a big step would be gained in producing a large portion of our own butter.  Would this be economical? It is doubtful.  At the same time, however, there has been a subsidy on farmers' butter and that subsidy seemingly has not been a success, because the farmer has not been able to sell his butter.  It would be worth while giving it a chance and giving a subsidy to the butter industry.  I would ask the Minister also to go to the radio and make it clear to the people that he has initiated such a scheme, so that in the remote country districts they would know where they stand.  Nowadays nearly everybody has a radio, no matter where they live.  He should give them some idea that the travelling creameries are going to be put into operation.  That would go a long way towards solving the butter problem and it would ease the load considerably on the farmer's wife, who is about the busiest person in the world to-day.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about drainage.  Like every other constituency, we need a lot of drainage in Wexford.  We have big problems there&mdash;the Ballyteigue and Inch drainage, the areas around Rosslare Harbour and Cahore, which are problems of big major drainage schemes.  Unless and until these major drainage schemes are put into effect, many farmers will be prevented from enjoying the benefits of the land reclamation scheme and many thousands of acres of productive land will not be in full production.  The Minister should look at this in a big way.  These problems do not apply to Wexford alone but many parts of the country require drainage.  It is a big scheme and essentially a national one and there are many things to be considered.  If you drain one part, you may flood another part.  Of these two particular areas I mentioned, Cahore is a place waiting for years for something to be done and apparently there is a possibility of a good scheme being carried out there, and the same applies to Ballyteigue and Inch.  Would the Minister not consider doing a temporary scheme there?  It has been put <Col N="1385" /> to me by people who know something about it, who are of an engineering turn of mind and have had some experience along that line, that it is possible to do a temporary scheme here if you create a catchment area and pump it by some temporary method, such as by windmills or something like that, so as to bring at least some of the land into production.</P>
    <P>Of course, the official mind permeates everything and the official mind is conservative.  Perhaps it is necessary to see that money will not be spent unnecessarily.  If we could get the official mind to decide that they can consider countenancing it or consider sanctioning it&mdash;I am not saying sanctioning, as probably it would be years before there is any sanction, but they might go as far as considering it&mdash;we would have advanced a long way.  I would ask the Minister to step in himself&mdash;I know he is keen to increase agricultural production&mdash;and put ahead some temporary scheme to initiate the drainage.</P>
    <P>Credit facilities are the last question I will deal with.  Like every other Deputy who has spoken on credit, I feel that the policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is &ldquo;safety first&rdquo; or &ldquo;no advance without security&rdquo;. Of all the bodies I know, they are certainly one that never takes a risk. As I said at the outset, this country is dependent on agriculture.  Not only the people living on the land but the whole country depends on agriculture. Any money that we can provide by credit facilities to enable farmers to improve their holdings means an increase in the national wealth.  The Minister for Agriculture has the most important Ministry here in Ireland. By it we sink or swim.  When the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget, the only credit in it available to the farmers, as far as I could see, was £250,000 for loans.  I think I am right in that.  That shows something is wrong and that credit is one of the things that should be developed.  Of all the things on which we are dependent, it is the one for which they are to get less money than practically any other Ministry.  There is something <Col N="1386" /> wrong there.  We want credit, and plenty of it.  Deputy Fagan very truly said that the farmers are not having it as easy as people think. Everyone thinks they are full of money.  Perhaps they have a little more in their pockets now than in the past, but they have a hard time.  The farmer and his wife and family work from daylight to dark and do not draw the big dividends that the industrial people draw, but get a small return. Perhaps they are drawing a profit, but they have to face all sorts of hazards with adverse weather and so forth.  If this Government wants to make the country safe, wants to improve it, wants to maintain our standard of living and wants to enable us to give the social services we should give it will hand out the money to agriculture, since every shilling that is paid out will return a rich dividend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important Estimate that comes before this House.  I am pleased to hear from Government spokesmen that they have realised at last that the real wealth of this nation lies in the land and what the land produces.  This is purely an agricultural country, depending for its existence on those engaged in agriculture to work the land in the best interests of the nation and to obtain the maximum return.  It is the object of every good farmer to raise not merely sufficient food for himself but also sufficient food for those who have no land.</P>
      <P>I fully realise the problems that confront the farmer who is anxious to develop his farm and to make it more productive, and I would like to know from the Minister what he proposes to do to make the land more productive. Everyone knows that our land is deficient in manures.  Is it the intention of the Minister to give farmers more manures at reasonable prices?  During the inter-Party Government régime, when the prices of manures were relatively lower than they are to-day, manures were used fairly extensively. At that time the price of manures was somewhere about £8 a ton as compared with £14 per ton to-day.  A reduction in the price of manure would tend to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> The Minister might consider subsidising manures by way of encouragement to farmers to use more manures and thereby increase the fertility of the land.  On the other hand, he might consider the provision of proper credit facilities so as to enable farmers to purchase manures.  I am not referring to credit facilities such as are provided by the Credit Corporation.  Everybody knows&mdash;Deputy Dr. Esmonde has referred to it&mdash;that one needs gilt-edged security to get money from the Credit Corporation.  It is practically impossible to get money from the Credit Corporation.  I would impress upon the Minister the great necessity to increase productivity by providing manures at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I put down a question in connection with wool prices.  I brought the Minister's attention to the fact that in Cavan it was difficult, practically impossible, to dispose of wool.  The Minister told me that that was not true.  I will tell the Minister that it is true, that in the large buying centres in Cavan, where wool is exposed for sale, it is impossible to get a price for it.  I would ask the Minister to see that not alone will the people concerned be able to dispose of their wool but will get an economic price for it.</P>
    <P>A burning question which concerns the farming community in general is compulsory tillage.  I would like to know from the Minister if he is of the same mind to-day as when he was in opposition.  At that particular stage, I believe, his intention was to have compulsory tillage.  What is his present attitude towards it.  Some time ago the Tánaiste made a statement to the effect that he believed we would have compulsory tillage soon. That is not a problem for the Tánaiste at all.  He has problems enough in the mess he has made in Córas Iompair Éireann and a lot of other lines without dealing with compulsory tillage.  The person to make statements like that is the Minister.  I would like to know from him when replying what his intentions are towards compulsory tillage because at present there is very little encouragement <Col N="1388" /> for people to do more tillage than they are doing.  In view of the surplus potatoes and oats last season, there was very little inducement to till.  I know the people will always do their share of tillage and there will be people who will always till, apart from whether it pays them or not.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prejudge the issue as regards the price of milk in view of the fact that a tribunal of seven has been established by the Minister to ascertain what would be an economic price for milk but milk producers are awaiting with very keen anxiety the results that may accrue from the setting up of the tribunal. They are looking forward to an increased price.  If, as a Labour Deputy said the other day, an increased price for milk will mean an increased price for butter, well, let it go.  It is better to have more milk than no milk and more butter than no butter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, as Deputy Madden asked him to-day, not to wait until the tribunal's findings are made, which may be in one or two years' time.  As he stated in Opposition that he believed an economic price for milk was 1/6 in summer and 1/9 in winter, he should take the bull by the horns and strike that price, and then await the tribunal's findings, because I am quite sure that if they are to arrive at an economic price to the producer, they will arrive at a price far in excess of that.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of farmers' butter.  Many farmers, for economic reasons, or possibly because there is no creamery in their area or for other reasons, make their own butter.  I am sure they received a great shock the other night when they heard on the radio that all that the Minister could obtain for them was 2/2 or 2/3 a lb.</P>
    <P>Contrast that statement with the statement made a few days earlier after the result of the by-elections had been declared, when the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The nation is on the march again.&rdquo;  I wonder would those people who are to receive 2/2 or 2/3 a lb. for their country butter consider that the nation is on the march again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Some time ago a scheme was put into operation whereby grants will be given to assist farmers to sink pumps.  As far as my information goes, only those who erect mechanical pumps will be entitled to a grant.  In view of the water shortage in the present season, and in view of the fact that the majority of people throughout the country erect pumps convenient to their houses, the Minister would be well advised to give a grant to these people as well as to those who erect the mechanical type of pump.  These are the few points I wished to raise, and I would like the Minister, when replying, to let me know what the position is in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will commence by thanking the Minister for the extension of the day-old chick scheme in the Gaeltacht districts in South Kerry and also for the reduced fee at the artificial insemination stations in the Kerry cattle districts.  I have been asked by the people of these districts to make further representations to the Minister in regard to the supply of drainage machines.  There is a shortage of these at the present time, and it would be a good thing if the Department of Agriculture could adopt some method under which they could be hired out to farmers for the drainage and levelling of land.  The necessity in these mountainous districts for mobile compressors has also been brought to my notice.  It would be a good idea if a farmer could purchase a compressor from the Department on reasonable terms and hire it out to his neighbours. This would prove of great advantage to small farmers in mountainous areas in the reclaiming of land.</P>
      <P>I have also been asked to make representations in regard to the Kerry cattle area with a view to having, if possible, a special inspector allocated to the area&mdash;a man who would get the necessary statistics, have true stock scheduled and, if necessary, get a cow-testing association established in the district.  It is hoped in that way to build up a foundation stock, in so far as it is possible to do so under modern technique and modern conditions.  I feel that the course suggested above is the proper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he initiated some type of scheme under which Kerry cattle were purchased and sent to Connemara, Donegal and other such areas.  As far as I know, that scheme was successful. I would like if that scheme were revived.  If it were established in the Kerry cattle area, we could send a graded type of cattle which would be very valuable to other counties.  I would be grateful if the Minister and his Department could see their way to consider that matter.  It is very difficult for farmers to conform to the Department's regulations in the Kerry cattle area.  Sooner or later, as I stated already, the Minister will have to allocate a special inspector to the district to have the whole position clarified.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tomato-growing scheme for Gaeltacht districts, I would like to make the case for Ballinskellings in South Kerry.  Experts inform me that this district lends itself better to tomato growing than any other area in the country, due to its southerly aspect and so forth.  I hope, when the Minister is replying, that he will be able to indicate to us if tomato growing could be developed in that area.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's Estimate that the land rehabilitation project has had a much wider scope than I ever visualised.  I think I am relevant in quoting now what Deputy Dillon said at column 1834 of the official debates on the 27th June:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was possible, under the land rehabilitation project, to make an agency agreement with the Department of Agriculture to engage technical staff and to charge up to the Vote for Agriculture the expenses of a survey of a main channel as distinct from a survey of a whole catchment area.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon made an extraordinary statement, as far as we in South Kerry are concerned, at any rate; he stated that when he <Col N="1391" /> approached the Office of Public Works in regard to three catchment areas, they informed him that they had selected three such areas.  He further stated that the catchment areas selected were altered at his request, and that the Maine arterial drainage scheme in County Kerry was deleted and replaced by the Moy catchment area.  That was an extraordinary statement, because I never knew a Minister to ask another Department to do something which would facilitate his own particular Department at the expense of the people in Kerry.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works informed him that the rivers they considered to be the most urgent were the Boyne, the Inny and a river in Kerry called the Maine.  The chief engineer of the Board of Works deleted the proposal to survey the Maine catchment area and agreed to the request of Deputy Dillon, then Minister for Agriculture, to substitute the Moy catchment area for the Maine.  On the same Vote, Deputy Donnellan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am informed that we can do a certain section of the arterial drainage scheme under the land rehabilitation project and that <Col N="1392" /> the Board of Works can act for the Department of Agriculture and carry out the survey for them.  I am appealing to the Minister now to assist us and right the wrong that was done to us when our scheme was deleted from the list originally made out by the Board of Works engineers.</P>
      <P>I am not blaming Deputy Dillon because he did it to facilitate his own Department.  I am not saying he did it deliberately but whether it was deliberate or not it was detrimental to us.  On the same occasion, Deputy Donnellan stated that he was responsible for the selection of the Corrib-Clare-Dalgan scheme at the expense of the Maine catchment scheme.  In fact, he gloried in saying that &ldquo;Despite anything the Fianna Fáil Party may say, I am the man who is responsible for the Corrib-Clare-Dalgan scheme.&rdquo; We suffered in Kerry as a result of those deletions and the arrangement between the then Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Donnellan who was Parliamentary Secretary at the time.</P>
      <P>We have a great case.  In justice, we ask that the main channel of the arterial river, the Maine, be done under the land rehabilitation project. That is the point I am making.</P>
      <P>In that same debate there was a reference to the Rye river in County Kildare.  I am not saying anything against those schemes.  I am making comparisons so that I can make my own point on behalf of Kerry.  The Rye is Deputy Sweetman's pet scheme, if you like.</P>

      <P>There were three schemes.  One could call them three political schemes. There was the Blackwater scheme in County Monaghan, Deputy Dillon's own scheme, the Corrib, which was Deputy Donnellan's and the Rye which was Deputy Sweetman's.  The Maine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When we face facts we face them and we give credit where it is necessary to give it. If the machinery is there we should avail of it even though the Department might say they had not a staff to carry out a survey.  According to my information, there were 14 or 16 special engineers employed for that work by the Board of Works.  They advertised for them.  That is my answer to the Department if they say the survey staff is not available. The people in Kerry have suffered considerable loss over a long number of years in regard to the Maine.  If the chief engineer and the others selected that scheme on its merits, it is unfair that we should suffer in order to facilitate Deputy Dillon or Deputy Donnellan as the case may be. Sooner or later, our people will have to do something about it.  The density <Col N="1394" /> of the population in the Maine valley is 200 per cent. greater than it is in the area served by the drainage of the Rye district.  Furthermore, the Maine was a major catchment area and the Rye a minor catchment area. Therefore, the injustice was complete from all angles.  Deputy Sweetman seems to enjoy it but it was a pretty serious matter for the people in Kerry when they discovered that not only was it not on the list but there was no immediate prospect that it would be surveyed.</P>

      <P>We have a case to make to the Minister in regard to the congested districts in connection with portable creameries and I should like to make a special appeal to the Minister in regard to an area for which we have been making representations for years&mdash;the Killorglin-Cromane district. Last year we were informed that something would be done and that an inspection would be carried out.</P>
      <P>I make an appeal in regard to that district because most of the other areas are being served and proper development is taking place, and this is the one area which is outstanding. I would be grateful, therefore, if the Minister would instruct the Dairy Disposals Company to do something about it.  I thank the Minister for the extension of these schemes to the Gaeltacht districts, and I hope that the proposals I have made will receive consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on this Estimate no section of the activities of the Department of Agriculture has come in for such commendation as the land rehabilitation project. Those of us who felt when it was <Col N="1395" /> initiated that it was long overdue and that it was a scheme which would bring very beneficial results in the productive field of agriculture certainly never thought that in such a short period of time it would meet with such commendation from people both inside and outside this House who were so sceptical of it when it was initiated and who warned farmers that if they availed of the scheme their valuations would be increased.  To-day we do not hear a word about that.  We have nothing but commendation of the results which have flown from that scheme.  If at that time the scheme had received the unanimous approval which it has now, I contend that it would have progressed much farther than the point which it has now reached.  On my way up to-day I was glad to see one of the new ploughs being transported to the south.  It is a pity that these units are not more widespread throughout the country so that the farmers would see their capabilities, see the amount of slavery which they would save on their holdings, and see land which they never thought would be reclaimed in their lifetime being reclaimed in a very short time.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the scheme for the spreading of ground limestone made such progress in the last few years. Again to-day on my way up here I counted 14 spreaders on their way out from Ballybeg carrying that limestone into the hills of West Cork and bringing into that barren area the means of obtaining such production as has not been seen in the lifetime of the oldest people there.  These benefits are already becoming apparent in increased production.  I feel that if these two schemes are pushed forward as they were when Deputy Dillon was Minister this country will see in a few more years a still greater return for the money invested in the land rehabilitation project and the limestone scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There still remain thousands of acres of waste land in this country which if drained, cleared of scrub and rock and manured are capable of giving to the farmers a return for the work put into them.  I regret that <Col N="1396" /> the store of cheap fertiliser which was left by the inter-Party Government was directed away from the land rehabilitation scheme, because the farmers who carried out the work themselves did not reap the full advantage of the labour which they put into that work owing to the increased cost of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>In connection with the administration of the land rehabilitation project I should like to see a linkup between the large units working under the direction of the Department and the work being carried out by the farmers themselves.  I should like to see many more of the small bulldozers which are employed for filling up drains distributed throughout the country.  It would encourage people to go in for the opening up of drains and the piping of them if they had the benefit of these machines to do work which was extremely laborious in the past and it would bring fields which are drained into such a condition that they could be cultivated much sooner.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate some discussion took place with regard to the prices for beet and barley.  There is no doubt that the cost of production has increased alarmingly during the past year.  People who are not engaged in agriculture should appreciate that.  Because Deputies who represent farming constituencies repeat so often in this House that an increased price is necessary for milk or for beet or for wheat or other agricultural products people may think it sounds like a song.  These people, however, should appreciate the difficulties which seem to be continually increasing for farmers owing to the higher wages which are necessary to meet the increased cost of living in order to maintain the farm labourer and his family in the frugal comfort to which they are entitled and the vastly increased cost of fertilisers, seeds, machinery and the other requirements.  In order to meet these increases the farmer must look for an increased price for his products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry felt it was wrong to seek for an increased price for beet. He felt that farmers growing beet were doing very well, and he made the <Col N="1397" /> charge that a campaign was initiated which had resulted in a reduction this year.  I do not think that many Deputies believe that any reduction which may occur this year was occasioned by anything in the nature of a campaign.  It does not come well from Deputies who advocated when in opposition that the farmers should use the big whip and tell the Minister and the Government in office that unless such-and-such a thing was done production would be reduced.  I do not think it has ever been proved that anybody on this side advocated that, which would be detrimental not only to the producers but to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputies should remember that the increase in milk output this year can be attributed to the good weather.  We had a very mild winter and the summer so far has been very good.  Last year we had the reverse, and an effort was made to make political capital out of it.  We feel that the Minister should direct the attention of his Department to some scheme which would protect farmers against the losses which they incurred last year, owing to the bad weather.  I would draw his attention in particular to the benefits which accrued to farmers in my part of the country who have gone in for ensilage. I think if it was carried on more extensively throughout the country farmers would be in a position to produce much more.  However, the general situation in the country has reacted very unfavourably on the capacity of the farmer to extend his business, to go in for increased tillage or increased production in any other direction.</P>
    <P>If the small shopkeeper cannot afford to give him credit for fertilisers and stuff for the ordinary requirements of his household, it will react on the capacity of the farmer to increase his production.  The country is now experiencing the results of credit restriction. It will experience in future months the ill-effects of the increased interest charges by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think it has been stressed by most Deputies who have contributed to the debate that this matter of credit is all important to the farmer in facing up to his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> As regards the labour situation, I realise that the allocation of cottages which become vacant is carried out generally in a very fair way but it should be remembered that they were erected in the first instance for farm labourers.  It is regrettable that so many of them have passed out of the occupancy of farm labourers and that people who have retired and who are now living on pensions, are resident in some of these cottages.  As a result the farmers are denied the labour which would be available to them if cottages adjacent to their farms were occupied by genuine agricultural labourers.  It will be readily understood that it highly desirable that farm labourers should reside as close as possible to the farms on which they work.  I should like to pay a tribute to the quality of the migratory labour which was supplied from the West of Ireland to carry out beet thinning in parts of my constituency where beet is grown extensively. It was a distinct asset in dealing with the situation there.</P>
    <P>The Minister should strive to advance the interest of the farming community on every occasion on which it would be necessary for him to consult his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I would direct his attention in this connection to a rumour which is in the air at the moment relating to the possibility of still further restrictions on the issue of permits to farmers to transport their own produce and I would ask him to maintain the system, which existed under his predecessor, of permitting people to transport milk to creameries by means of hired tractor-drawn lorries.</P>
    <P>Such a system leaves farmers in remote parts of the country in a position to attend to their work on the farm, whereas if each farmer is responsible for the transport of his own milk, he will probably spend the best part of the day in conveying small quantities of milk to the creameries. I think the system should be continued under which people with tractors are permitted to transport milk to creameries under an arrangement with their neighbours.  Many people who have departed from the practice of producing home-made butter are <Col N="1399" /> now anxious to send their milk to the creameries, and it is an asset for the creameries concerned to get this additional supply of milk.  I, therefore, hope that the system of transport which I have mentioned will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister also to the advisability of evolving some means of dealing with the very serious damage done to crops by vermin.  I think in other countries much more effective measures are taken to deal with this aspect of preserving fodder and the foodstuffs generally which come off the land.  I think every means should be applied towards instructing people in the best way in which to deal with the many hazards which affect crops that have been harvested.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to what I regard as an injustice in the filling of vacancies for agricultural officers under the county committees of agriculture. We know that, under the conditions of appointment, these officers are recommended by the Local Appointments Commission.  It is obligatory on the committee of agriculture to appoint the candidates recommended by the Local Appointments Commission, but there is, unfortunately, power left in the hands of the committee of agriculture which could be employed to prevent such an officer taking up duty.</P>
    <P>He may wish to go to the county to seek fresh experience, to apply there the experience he has gained in other counties or because he thinks he can advance his family interests by going there.  Surely he should be entitled to do so, but he may be prevented because it is still in the hands of the committee to suggest to the Minister the point at which his salary should commence. Quite frequently it happens that the salary proposed is far below that which he enjoyed in his previous position. Naturally, in such circumstances, the officer will refuse to take up the position for which the Local Appointments Commission had recommended him, preferring to remain in the county in which he had previously been employed.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="1400" /> withhold sanction to the proposal of committees in such cases, or at least inquire into the matter, so as to ensure that such men will get a fair deal.  It is commendable that schemes that were in existence before the Government took office, such as the land rehabilitation scheme and the ground limestone scheme are being continued, and we hope that the highest degree of intensive effort will be put into them in the coming 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points which I should like to put before the House.  I should first of all like to refer to the new industry which has sprung up in recent times&mdash;the export of carcase meat.  I think the Minister should do everything in his power to foster and develop that trade with other countries.  When agreements are being made with other countries, especially with Britain, for the export of cattle, the Minister should keep his eye on the development of the export of larger quantities of carcase meat.  It is very important to the economy of this country that our cattle should cease to be exported on the hoof.  Cattle should be sent out as processed meat, as is being done in these new factories now.  Apart from the fact that we shall get a better price for our beef, this new development should create more employment inasmuch as the by-products of the dead meat trade can be used for the manufacture of various articles which up to now have had to be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make has reference to demonstration plots of one kind or another.  I do not know whether the Minister has much power in this matter or not.  I think it mostly concerns county committees of agriculture. I find that where a county committee of agriculture wishes to have a number of demonstration plots &mdash;barley, flax, wheat or whatever it may be&mdash;they usually go to the largest farmer in the district, and he is given very many facilities.  I think it is a mistake to do that.  One result is that the small farmers feel that they are being left out in the cold.  If they were given these demonstration plots, I believe they would make a success of them.  It would be an encouragement <Col N="1401" /> to those small farmers who, in the main, constitute the majority of our farming community.  In my opinion, it is unwise to give these advantages to the larger farmers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the export of cattle, there is a tendency at the moment to export young heifers, in-calf heifers and in-calf cows.  If that situation is not corrected, we will find that our cattle population will continue to drop as it is doing at the moment.  In a country where we depend largely on live-stock exports of fat cattle, it is a shame to see very large numbers of heifers and cows, and especially of in-calf heifers, being exported.  I think the Minister should take some action in the matter.</P>
    <P>In the Northern Counties of Ireland this year the farmers who got a good price for flax last year will, I am afraid, be in a very serious position soon, because the flax spinners from the Six Counties have contracted to take only about half the amount that was taken last year.  The price will not be as good as it was last year.  If, for example, we have surplus potatoes in Donegal, we can put them into the alcohol factories, but that cannot be done with flax.  Therefore, I think, a very serious problem is going to arise this year.  I think that, for the coming year, it would be well if the Department were to advise farmers not to grow flax, because the Six County spinners will not need the flax this year.  The reason is that the American markets for linen are not absorbing the quantities of finished linen which the Six Counties have for export.</P>
    <P>The Six County spinners are taking a certain quantity of flax this year just to keep in touch with, and to prevent, farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties from getting out of the habit of growing flax.  The situation is one that should not be allowed to develop.  Our farmers should be advised early that, next year, a market will not be available, and that they should not grow flax unless we can compel the Northern spinners, which would be difficult, to take whatever quantity of flax we grow.  That will not be easy.  It would be a pity to see our farmers growing flax under <Col N="1402" /> the impression that a market would be available and then find, when an agreement with the spinners had been made, it was too late to do anything about it.  That would be a serious matter for those farmers who go in for flax growing and take land for flax by conacre at such a high price that it would not pay them to sow any other crop in it.  Many of them had also entered into agreements with regard to seed.  There was a flax seed shortage threatened, and as a result there was some panic buying. Prices shot up.  When the agreement came along it was found to be a bad agreement, and they were just caught out.  I am afraid of the situation which will develop.</P>
    <P>At the moment the only benefit which persons who erect grain-stores get is by way of loan.  I would urge on the Minister to make grants available as well as loans for these people. The present cost of building materials will keep farmers from doing this work unless they are encouraged by the provision of grants.  These grain-stores are very necessary.  They should be scattered not only throughout the country, at the ports and near the mills but in the different towns.  We should have sufficient grain-stores, and we are not likely to get them unless grants are available for people to erect them.</P>
    <P>Last year was a bumper year for potatoes.  In Donegal, which is one of the counties which produces most potatoes, a rather serious position developed during the past year.  In the first place, the potatoes grown for seed for export and for ware had to be put into the alcohol factories at from £6 to £6 7s. 6d. per ton.  That was not a paying proposition for the farmer who grew them or for the man who took land by conacre.  In order to remedy that situation, the Department should try to get extra export markets.  I feel that, with a little bit of push, we could capture some more of the continenal markets for our seed potatoes.  The second way of dealing with it would be to increase the price paid for the potatoes by the alcohol factories.  I think that if the price were raised to £7 10s. the people in the potato growing business would continue <Col N="1403" /> to grow them.  Unless the price is increased, we shall find that the heavy acreage will drop seriously. Potatoes are an expensive crop to grow.  A good deal of labour is involved and labour costs have increased. The cost of manures has increased also. Therefore, the price paid by the alcohol factories in the past few years is not sufficient now to cover the expenses of growing the potato crop.  The price would require to be increased to about £7 10s. and, even at that price, the margin of profit would be rather small.</P>
    <P>The prices for last year's oats varied considerably.  The price started off very good, but unlike the previous year it dropped towards the end of the season, and in some cases was as low as 2/6 a stone.  In other cases it was even lower still.  It started off at about 4/-a stone.  In one season fluctuations of that type are discouraging.  I think the Minister would do well to fix a minimum price for oats, as otherwise the farmer has no guarantee that he will get a price that will pay him for his work.  I fail to see how it comes about that oats purchased at 2/6 a stone should eventually arrive in the form of oatmeal on the working man's table at the rate of 8/5 a stone.  There is something there which needs to be investigated. There is a big discrepancy between 2/6 and 8/5.  I advise the Minister to get after the stone of oats, and to keep his eye on it until it arrives in the form of oatmeal across the retailer's counter.  He will probably find, that, as usual, the middlemen are cashing in.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on this Estimate, a good deal has been said about farmers and their work but I think very little mention was made of the farm worker.  I find that in many parts of the country the farm worker is the man who is really behind the increased production drive.  In most cases he is responsible for the management of crops and cattle.  The farmer who employs four or five men leaves most of the work to them.  Each farm worker is doing a highly skilled job. The rotation of crops and the various other types of work in connection with the growing of different types of crops are a highly skilled job.  A wage <Col N="1404" /> of £3 12s. 6d. per week does not adequately repay a farm worker for his work.  We hear a lot of talk at the moment that the farmer is the backbone of the country.  I say that it is the farm worker who produces the goods.  Every effort should be made to bring the wage of the farm worker at least to the same level as that of the road worker and other unskilled workers.  Until that is done, you will not have a supply of farm labour.  At the moment the tendency is that if a farm worker can get unskilled employment elsewhere he will leave his skilled employment on the farm for that other unskilled work.  Is it any wonder that, in such circumstances, production is declining? It is up to the Government to ensure that this type of workman will be paid at least as much as any other unskilled worker in the country.  I am glad to note that the Minister has introduced a new Weekly Half-Holiday Bill which will rectify the omissions of the last Weekly Half-Holiday Bill.  I hope he will bear in mind the fact that at present many farm workers are getting a half-holiday but that, as they must work a 54 hour week, the half-day from 1 o'clock on Saturday is not in reality a half-holiday.  The fact that he has to work 54 hours per week up to 1 o'clock on Saturday means that he is not getting a half-day at all.  I urge the Minister that, in forming the Bill, he will ensure that the farm labourer will get a full week's pay plus a half-day for a 50 hour week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost every aspect of agriculture has been referred to by Deputies on either side of this House in the course of the debate on this Estimate.  It is difficult, therefore, to choose some point which has not yet been discussed.  It is generally agreed in this country that agriculture is our basic industry.  That being so, the basis of agricultural progress must, in the first instance, be the soil of Ireland.  For the most part, the soil of this country is among the richest in the world, but in certain parts of this country we have some of the poorest soil in the world.  Certain Deputies seem to forget our western seaboard, where we have the poorest of land, and <Col N="1405" /> Fianna Fáil Deputies especially are continually talking about wheat, wheat, wheat, as if that were the only crop suitable for this country.  If anything, it seems to me that it is the type of crop least suitable to Irish soil, because it is a crop which depends a great deal on the kind of weather and, furthermore, it is a crop that, above all others, helps to impoverish the soil. We had examples of that during the war when, of course, fertilisers were not available to improve the soil after various crops of wheat were taken off. It was certainly a mistake during that period, or at any time, that people should be forced to sow wheat in land which is not suitable.  Naturally, when it was compulsory, what people really did&mdash;because they did not wish to destroy the best grasslands&mdash;was to sow the wheat in some of the poorest land even in the midlands and in the eastern counties, in the cutaway bogs and so forth.  It was compulsory to sow wheat, but it was not compulsory to sow it in the best type of land nor was it compulsory to cut it and save it. While Deputy Allen states that Deputy Dillon was all out for grass&mdash; and, of course, during his term of office we know he was styled &ldquo;the Minister for Grass&rdquo;&mdash;he need not be in any way ashamed of that, because, after all, the most important crop in this country is grass.  It was the first crop, and it is the crop that every farmer will make it a point to grow, and ensure, if possible, that he has the best type of grass growing on his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble is that, as Deputy Madden, I think, explained, 80 per cent. of the grasslands are not fit at all for the feeding of live stock because of the type of grass.  Therefore, the soil being the basis of agricultural progress, the first, most necessary and most desirable object in view should be to improve it.  How can that be done?  First of all, in the majority of cases drainage is not required; nevertheless, even for some of the best lands there is such a thing as arterial drainage required.  It is by means of the drainage schemes&mdash;the arterial drainage, the drainage under the Works Act and the drainage under the land <Col N="1406" /> project&mdash;that the land and the soil of this country will be prepared as it should be for the production of crops and the rearing of live stock.  The arterial drainage scheme is making progress slowly; that is as it should be because it is a difficult process.  But I regret to say that since the new Government and the new Minister for Agriculture took over, drainage under the Works Act has been retarded.  In fact, scarcely any work at all has been done and, when that is so, drainage under the land project is also bound to suffer because if drainage under the Works Act is not completed you have nowhere to take the drainage from the fields.  I know several farmers in my area who are prevented from carrying out drainage under the land project because of the fact that drainage under the Works Act must take place first. That is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>There is the drainage of the land, the reclamation and fertilisation of the land.  The present Government believes that the best land should be looked after first as regards fertilisation. Surely farmers in the rich lands should not require any Government aid in so far as they have the opportunities of growing crops such as wheat, barley, oats and all the other crops for which there is a good market.  They also have the lands where the cattle can be fattened and thereby reach a high price.  I believe that in the first instance drainage under the land project was meant for the bad lands, the lands mostly along the western seaboard. It is a pity that objection has been raised to the drainage of a certain type of bogland where the bog would not be too deep.</P>
    <P>If any help can ever be brought to the people living along the west, south-west and north-west coasts it is by helping the farmers by every means in the power of the Government or whatever body would be responsible to drain, reclaim and fertilise the land, and even to go so far as to carry out also some scheme by which the mountain grazing would be improved. Where no attention has ever been given to the improvement of the <Col N="1407" /> mountain grazing, it is certainly time to give it attention, for where land is being continually grazed by sheep and cattle it is bound to suffer.  Some years ago a man&mdash;I forget his name, but I think he was Mr. Griffiths&mdash;made a survey of the mountains of Wales and evolved a scheme by which the land there was improved, so much so that four times the number of sheep could now graze on its mountains.  If we could do something like that here, it would certainly bring about increased prosperity to the mountain farmers of the west, south-west and north-west.</P>
    <P>Having improved the soil by drainage, reclamation and fertilisation, the next step would be to find the type of crop suitable to the land and I think that should be left to the farmers themselves. No compulsion should be required at any time.  Every farmer should know the crop to suit his own soil&mdash;he could, of course, obtain help from the Department of Agriculture by having soil tests and so forth&mdash;just as the farmer should also know the best type of cattle, the best type of stock to keep on his land.  For instance, in my own County of Kerry we know by experience that it would not do to keep the same type of cattle as are reared in the midlands and the eastern counties.  Some farmers tried it once and the result was a very sad one. However, I would not agree, nor do the people in my own county agree, that there should be any compulsion as to the type of cattle to be kept there. There was one time a law by which we could only keep Kerry cattle.  However, some modification in that has been brought about and the farmer himself, if he is a good farmer, should know, or at least he should learn by experience, the type of cattle to suit his land best.</P>
    <P>Let us now deal with the question of markets.  The farmer, knowing the crops which suit his land and the kind of live stock to rear, if the right kind of crops are produced on properly prepared soil and if the right type of live stock are fed on soil which has been drained and fertilised, the next thing is to find markets. <Col N="1408" /> For crops of the right type we have, first of all, the home market.  Any surplus agricultural produce of the right quality and in the proper condition will always find a market, if not in England at least in some of the continental countries.</P>
    <P>The increased price for cattle to-day is due in large measure to the agreement made in 1948 wherein there is a clause stipulating that as the price of live stock goes up in England there will be a commensurate increase here. The dead-meat trade is to be recommended provided it is successfully carried out and it is a matter for congratulation that we should have found a market for that product in the United States of America. The fact remains, however, that the best and safest market for our agricultural produce is England. England is an industrial country. Ours is an agricultural country and the ideal market for our surplus agricultural produce is England.  We can buy from England in return the raw materials requisite for our industries and factories.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I mention that pigs recently offered for sale in the open market had to be brought home again because they were not sold?  Pigs of a certain weight fetch the highest price and it is easy to understand that the situation is not a happy one when pigs are ready for market and are not sold.  I suggest to the Minister that he should do what his predecessor did, namely, open the Border and let the pigs into the North so that the producers will be sure of a good price for their surplus pigs at least.  That operation can continue until the market rights itself once more.</P>
    <P>There has been some dissatisfaction with the price of milk.  I know the problem is a difficult one.  We must remember that when the price of milk goes up the price of butter will increase proportionately.  More people depend on butter and on milk than do the number of farmers producing these commodities and it is essential that we should preserve a proper balance as between producer and consumer. Farmers cannot be expected to produce <Col N="1409" /> a commodity unless they are ensured of a decent profit for their production.  The Minister has set up a costings commission but I understand the report of that body will not issue for at least a year, possibly two years.  In the meantime production is bound to decrease because farmers are not satisfied with present prices. In the past Governments have set up a Labour Court to fix workers' wages, a court to deal with the salaries of teachers and civil servants, and so on. I do not think it would be out of place to establish some type of tribunal to go into the cost and fix the price of milk or fix a remunerative and economic price for everything that is produced on the land.  That would remove price control so far as agricultural production is concerned out of the hands of the Minister and his Department.  The farmers would have representation on that tribunal and they would have the right to make their voices heard.  Surely they would be satisfied to a great extent with the prices fixed.  I think such a tribunal would provide the ideal solution for all our present troubles.  Such a tribunal would have the right to fix the price of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and so forth.</P>
    <P>It has been said that agricultural production here has remained static over the past 100 years.  It is somewhat difficult to believe that.  One hundred years ago people produced crops by the use of a spade and shovel&mdash;perhaps a wooden spade at that&mdash;and the population was more than twice what it is to-day.  It is hard to understand why, with all the facilities at the farmer's disposal to-day, agricultural production has remained static.  There must be something wrong.  We must not have followed the right course.  The time has come when there must be some kind of stock-taking in order to discover what is wrong.</P>
    <P>We know farmers have labour difficulties and scarcity of labour may have some influence on the situation.  If the farmer was made sufficiently prosperous so that he could give a decent living wage to his workers that would be an inducement to the men and <Col N="1410" /> women who are now flying from the land to stay at home and work on the land.  Some of the best land in the country, with beautiful residences and outbuildings, is let to graziers.  The people whom I represent have no objection to that because most of them live by rearing cattle and sheep.  They do a little tillage but it is not even sufficient for their own needs.  They cannot grow wheat or barley satisfactorily. They grow potatoes and a certain quantity of oats.  Their chief economy, however, is the sale of their live stock to the big ranchers in the midlands and eastern counties.  These people take the land on the 11 months' system and the more land they can get in that way the better price we will get for our store cattle.  That is not a good indication of agricultural progress however.  Surely there must be thousands of acres that should be tilled so as to get the maximum production from the soil.</P>
    <P>I have covered in a general way the course to be taken, a course which seems simple enough in its way.  There is, first, attention to the soil so that it may be at the point of maximum production, and then there is the matter of the best type of live stock, the marketing of our goods and the marketing of our surplus goods, and then the farmer and the farm labourer. It is by attention to all these matters that we will make progress, and, while I do not believe in too much spoonfeeding of either farmers or anybody else, I think that if other provision were made, so far as the resources of the State allow, to improve the lot of the farmer and increase our agricultural production, this country, in peace or war, could then feel that we are safe and able to help ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may begin with a sort of parenthetical remark, I was listening to Deputy Palmer talking about agricultural statistics.  I am not blaming him because he was only quoting other people, but I sometimes wonder whether, when people talk about agricultural production being stagnant or static, quoting figures in respect of the present with figures of 100 years ago, they ever stop to think how agricultural statistics are arrived <Col N="1411" /> at even at present.  I consider that it is a somewhat hit or miss arrangement and I doubt if many of the figures, except possibly those in relation to beef or beet where factory returns are available which provide some sort of check, would show anything under a 20 per cent. variation.  How the figures were arrived at 100 years ago, I do not profess to know, but I doubt if they were any more scientific in their arrangements, and I think it quite possible that a good deal of this talk about static production is due to people paying too much attention to statistics and too little to the look of the country.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to refer to something the Minister said in introducing the Estimate.  He was talking about egg production and he said that we cannot hope to increase our exports unless we get satisfactory prices.  I do not think it would be too much to ask that the Minister would apply that thought to agricultural production in general.  I do not think it would do the country any harm if he thought about it&mdash;we cannot hope to get increased agricultural production unless farmers get satisfactory prices. I am never quite sure why it is considered here a sort of moral lapse on the part of farmers to look for remunerative prices while it is perfectly all right for anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more than legitimate that business men, trade unionists and so on should look for a fair return, but when farmers start looking for increased prices, everyone talks about the poor and asks how are they to be fed. There is that problem, but it is not a problem for the Department, nor is it a problem for the farming industry. This is an agricultural country and the country as a whole must face up to the fact that its whole prosperity depends on the prosperity of agriculture, and face up to it in fact and not just talk about it, and must realise that, without good prices, we will not have agricultural prosperity and that, without agricultural prosperity, there will not be any prosperity in the country.  The link between prices and production is an absolutely self-evident truth, and one has only to look back <Col N="1412" /> through the ages to see how in any country agriculture improved as food prices went up and became stagnant and deteriorated as they went down.</P>
    <P>I think we are now at the turning point.  For the past 60 years, the industrial countries dominated the world.  I am not talking now in an imperial sense but on the basis of plain, economic facts.  It was their business to secure food at cheap prices.  Various factors contributed to help them&mdash;the opening up of America, better agricultural methods and so on. There was in the world a surplus of food and naturally agricultural countries suffered because they were fighting on a falling market.  That has been very noticeable for the past 60 years, but I think it has changed. The world population is going up at a fantastic rate&mdash;some 50,000 per week &mdash;and, if anything, the area under cultivation in the world is decreasing. I think we are now entering on a period&mdash;we have more or less entered on it&mdash;where the world will have to pay more for food.  That is fortunate for this country because it is an agricultural country, but townspeople here ought to remember, if they are asked to pay more for food, that, without the agricultural industry, there would not be any towns.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish for us, however, to sit back and say: &ldquo;Things are going to move in our direction.  Food prices are going to go up, so we can sit back and let the money roll in.&rdquo; That would be most unfair to our own urban population and it would be foolish to count too much on being able to walk into any export market we please.  There is an absolute necessity for us to reduce costs so that we may provide food as cheaply as possible for our own population and give ourselves the best possible chance in an export market. It is on the success of a reduction in costs that the whole policy and work of the Department will have to be judged. It is their function to assist the farming community and it is peculiarly their function to direct them in this way and to assist them towards that objective.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this country, as probably in many others, is that <Col N="1413" /> circumstances vary so much from area to area&mdash;in climatic conditions and possibly in traditions&mdash;that it is not easy to settle on the policy which will suit everyone; but I think it will be admitted that there are no areas in this country which are not interested in cattle in one way or another.  For that reason the cow becomes a very basic factor in our economy.  That being accepted, it is our obvious business to see that there are enough cows, but there will be enough cows only if it is economic to keep them.  One of the functions of the Department, therefore, must be to see that it is economic to keep them.  The easy way, of course, is to increase the price of milk.  Some increase will probably be necessary, but I must admit that I agree with the former Minister that merely to increase the price of milk per gallon can lead to a certain amount of carelessness as people will not try to get increased production from the cows which would obviously be the better solution in the long run.  Where the balance should come I do not profess to know, but I do think that as a short-term policy at any rate the Minister will have to increase the price of milk.  I hope that he will proceed with all possible despatch and do everything he possibly can to increase production per cow. Obviously that is the only real solution.</P>
    <P>To turn to matters which affect my own county even more than the price of milk, I am considerably worried about what may happen to oats this year.  My information is that the oatmeal millers are very heavily stocked at present.  If that is so, in the course of two or three months there will be a crisis.  The economy of my county&mdash;whether it is right or wrong, it is so&mdash;depends very much on oats as a cash crop and a great many people must sell in the autumn. Naturally they would like to hold it to the time when the price would be best but they just cannot do so.  The facts are against them and they must sell.  Last year was a peculiar one in that the opening price was best. Unfortunately if in the autumn the millers say: &ldquo;We are sorry but we cannot give you any more&rdquo; then our farmers must sell.  The farmers who can afford to hold over do not do so <Col N="1414" /> badly&mdash;although it did not work out in that way last year.</P>
    <P>One of the things I heard was that we actually imported oats.  Why we should ever have to do that I do not know.  It is like bringing coals to Newcastle.  As well as the importation into the Twenty-Six Counties of oats, I understand that some millers in Donegal where there was a surplus were compelled to accept imported oats.  How the Minister will deal with this matter I do not know, but I assure him that he will have to deal with it in some way&mdash;that is if he wants oats to be grown here.  It is one of the crops of which we are asked to grow more yet we find ourselves repeatedly in the position where unfortunate people are forced to the wall and must sell at low prices. There may be a solution through grain storage.  I do not know whether there has been any development on those lines in country mills or whether it is purely a question of development at the ports, but some system whereby grain could be bought and stored and part of the price perhaps given as with wheat in Canada would be the best solution.</P>
    <P>A problem which is most pressing at the moment is that of seed-potatoes. The history of the last year is a most unfortunate one from the seed-producer's point of view. Admittedly a solution was found and the alcohol factories took what was left, in fact a very considerable part of the crop, at prices ranging from £5 5s. to something over £6, but apart from the economy of it there is nothing more infuriating for the grower of seed-potatoes than to see that nothing can be found for the crop in which he took pride but the alcohol factories.  Admittedly the causes were international.  I know that, but I do think that there is something radically wrong with our marketing system.  Is the Minister satisfied that every possible market abroad was thoroughly explored?  Is he satisfied that our costs in selling are really satisfactory? My information is that our competitors are doing better.  The growers are getting more satisfactory prices but they are still underselling us on the foreign market.  This is an urgent <Col N="1415" /> matter.  In the course of the next two or three weeks seed-producers will have to settle a problem and that is whether to produce the seed or not. To produce satisfactory seed the crop must be burned to keep the potatoes to seed size and it is an expensive thing to do.  As well as that it reduces the tonnage per acre.  The Minister can imagine what a seed-producer thinks if he has gone through this expensive process which has the effect of limiting the tonnage per acre and then finds that his crop is just regarded as so much for the alcohol factory.  If he had let his crop grow on he would have had an extra two or three tons per acre and that much more for his trouble.  Instead of that he has limited his crop and produced seed only to find that there is nothing else to be done with it but to dump it in to make alcohol.  I think the Minister will have to review the method by which we are selling seed-potatoes and when he is doing that he might cast an eye on the method by which they are bought.  Endless trouble is caused by the system of f.o.b.  It leads to great confusion. Merchants are naturally anxious to get the potatoes at the handiest possible place so the grower who is lucky enough to live near a port gets a better price.  Some system by which an ex-farm price could be arranged would, I think, produce better results.</P>

    <P>Of the land project I have nothing but good to say.  It seems to be working extremely well.  I am aware that <Col N="1416" /> there has been criticism of the apparently disproportionate amount of administrative expense and I think that Deputy Dillon very fairly argued that if any huge scheme was to be carried out there would have to be large initial expenses, but I do think that there is one expense which is somewhat uncalled for in that even the most minor scheme of drainage on a farm seems to call for a map.  Under the old system an inspector came out and said the drain was to be put in such a place and he would mark it off. Now someone has to draw or trace a map of a farm and the drain is neatly drawn in, presumably to scale, yet the inspector still comes out and marks the ground.  What the purpose of the map is I have not discovered, but it seems to take a considerable amount of time and in the more minor schemes I think it could be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>Yes, the farmer can get a copy, but I am suspicious of the copy, for this reason.  On my own land some drainage was done and the map duly drawn.  It happened that we proposed removing a fence by a bulldozer and the map was not considered sufficiently accurate to guide the bulldozer and prevent the drains from being smashed, and the inspector came out and marked the position so that no damage would be done.  For that reason I am doubtful as to the value of the map to the farmer or anyone else.</P>

      <P>A further point about the grandson&mdash;I doubt if many of the clay pipes will be running in the grandson's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if they are kept clean with a rod&mdash;if the grandson knows where they are.  If he does not, how can they be kept clean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be easier to remake them.  There is one other point regarding the scheme and it may be only of local application&mdash;it is the question of the application of lime.  This problem affects my constituency peculiarly, because it happens that ground limestone has a bad effect on the production of seed-potatoes, as it encourages the growth of scab.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary way in my area, in draining, we drain the land in lea, then plough it and a grain crop is taken off&mdash;possibly two, but more likely one &mdash;and then it is followed by roots.  If you apply ground limestone on the lea, you are running a grave risk if you have to grow seed-potatoes.  I know there is the argument that you do not have to grow seed-potatoes there, but on smaller farms men are usually tied as to where they will grow things in rotation once they have started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the growing of seed-potatoes, it strikes me as being most extraordinary that in some cases, at any rate, an inspector insisted on the ground limestone being spread immediately after the drains were finished and before the field was ploughed. That meant that the limestone was ploughed five to seven inches deep, which is not the best place for it.  The trouble is that limestone sinks through the soil and if you hurry on the process by putting it down five to seven inches the first year, you are not helping it.  I understood that this difficulty had been overcome and an arrangement made by which the farmer would take the supply under <Col N="1418" /> the scheme and apply it where he thought best, on the understanding that when the field was drained and he came to the right part of the rotation to receive the limestone he would put the proper amount on.  I understand that arrangement has been made, but some of the inspectors do not seem to have heard about it.  The Minister might look into it and, if he thinks fit, issue a direction.  The proper thing is to keep the ground limestone in the ground as long as possible and the right time to apply it is when the field is out in grass.</P>
    <P>There is another point, to which Deputy Fagan referred earlier and which was mentioned last year.  The excellent water supply scheme to farms is not really a Department of Agriculture business.  Farmers do not get this water supply for the farm but rather to supply the household.  I think a great deal more good could be done if the scheme were extended to make water available to fields. Everyone is agreed that one of the most important things now in agriculture is to see that land is properly grazed, that it is very wasteful and harmful to the land to allow cattle to roam over a large acreage, that it ought to be grazed in small areas and then they should be moved on. You cannot do that unless the small areas are watered.</P>
    <P>I believe a very great development would come in the production of beef and milk if every field had a water supply in it.  I admit that that is looking into the very distant future. However, I imagine that a scheme could be devised which would encourage some water supplies to be laid on to fields.  It is a scheme which would tie in very well with the land project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy a question?  Does he not think that when a farmer gets to a scale of operations where he is employing rotational grazing, it is rather ludicrous to be suggesting that he should look to the Government to subsidise carrying water to every field? Surely that is something a man in such circumstances could afford to do for himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I think the Government ought to do everything possible to encourage every farmer to get to this desirable point where he does rotational grazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a matter of degree.  A great deal of money will be wasted in the drainage of land, in the fertilising of land, in the liming of land, unless it is possible to graze the land properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that it would be just another step further on to encourage this&mdash;I did not say what degree of encouragement.  I have found that it is not so much the size of the grant that encourages people: it is the fact that there is a grant at all and that there is an inspector who will come with advice and help and probably give one that sort of satisfied feeling that, difficult as it may be, one is getting something out of the Government.  The grants for the improvement of many things on the farm are very small, yet people take advantage of them.  It would, I think, be an indication of the importance of rotational grazing if the Government were to offer some measure of grant for providing a water supply to the fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen spent half an hour raising the annual war-cry that Fine Gael was out for grass and he asked: &ldquo;Why not come back to tillage, why not adopt a tillage policy, the Fianna Fáil policy of tillage?&rdquo;  I do not think that that policy belongs to any one Party in this House.  Deputy Allen finished up by making a most patriotic appeal&mdash; would we not all come in together, to <Col N="1420" /> pull our weight.  He is an able farmer and knows that there is only one or two ways of getting production&mdash;one way is by compulsory tillage and the other is by price inducement.  My firm belief is that if the present Government had got in with a clear majority and had not been depending for office on those Independents who supported them, we would have had compulsory tillage.  I believe that from my heart, whatever they may say.  They have changed overnight before.  Had they got a clear majority, they would have had compulsory tillage, but they have not had the courage to bring it in. Neither do they want to bring in price inducement.  They want to sit on the fence and do nothing.  As between the only two courses open to them, they had not the courage to take either course.</P>
      <P>This year, it is all right for the Taoiseach to throw a party to the chairmen of all the agricultural committees and chief executive officers of Ireland in the Gresham Hotel and do the patriotic stunt, beat the big drum and tell the boys to go home and to improve tillage by 20 or 30 per cent. That is all right while the party lasts and while sport is good but when people return to earth they want to see what they are going to get, how they are going to do it and what help the Government will give.</P>
      <P>There was one item this year, production of which declined greatly.  The blame for the reduction in the acreage under beet this year can be left at the feet of no one but the Minister for Agriculture and the Government.  The farmers are as entitled as the newspaper men or as any other section of the community are entitled, to look for better conditions.  The farming community this year felt that a trick was being played on them in the price of beet.  They felt they were bluffed. They were getting on paper an increase of 7/- per ton in the price of beet but that was being taken back again because for every ton of pulp the farmer took from the factory he had to pay back £4 10s., which was a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agitation started.  The Minister for Agriculture represents the area <Col N="1421" /> where the oldest beet factory in the country is established.  If he had taken an interest in that and had called together the various parties and asked them to give him their case, that he would get the factory case, and had arranged a slight compromise&mdash;I believe a very small compromise would have done&mdash;it would have meant 5,000 to 7,000 more acres under beet this year.  No, the Government said: &ldquo;No, let them do the best they can&rdquo;.  The result is that we are short of that much beet, in spite of the blowing they had to-day about production.  We are short, through the Government's fault, of 5,000 to 7,000 acres of beet this year.</P>
    <P>Next we come to the question of barley.  Last year and for the past few years there was an agreement made with Messrs.  Guinness that they would pay 2/6 per barrel more for Irish barley than they pay for English barley.  Last year, that price meant 84/- per barrel.  It was helping the farmers and giving them that extra capital that they required to put into their land.  It was a windfall for the farmers.  It helped to give them security and to improve their farms. This year, according to that agreement, we would have had 105/- per barrel for barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>102/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>When it gets to 100/-, a couple of shillings one way or the other will not kill anyone.  The Government, apparently, felt that that would affect the wheat position and they arranged that the Beet Growers' Association would go to Messrs. Guinness and, instead of getting 102/-per barrel, as they were entitled to get, make a bargain for 75/-, handing in that case 27/- to Messrs.  Guinness. At the same time, the Minister for Agriculture came along and at every meeting at which he spoke he told the people that if they grew barley they grew it at their own risk; unless they had contracted, not to grow barley, because he knew the people were getting a decent price or would have got a decent price had the Government left Messrs.  Guinness alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a very low-down trick to <Col N="1422" /> play on the farmers&mdash;when the Minister had done that, the crops were hardly sown when the Minister turned around and gave Messrs. Guinness a permit to import thousands of tons of barley.  That was a trick on the farmers of this country. People did not realise.  They thought the Minister was quite honest and that the Government was quite honest, that they wanted to safeguard the farmers.  I wonder did they. After all these speeches had been made, they told Messrs.  Guinness that the crop was down, that the farmers cannot grow any more and that Messrs.  Guinness could import all that they wanted.  Where did we go for it? Poland, no less.  We were prepared to pay the Polish farmer 102/- per barrel but the Irish farmer, of course, must be kept down; if he is not kept down, Fianna Fáil goes out of office.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of wheat. They had enough talk about wheat but that is all it came to&mdash;a miserable 7/6 per barrel.  We all know the increases in the last Budget, the increases in labour costs, naturally enough, as a sequence to that Budget and yet all that the farmer was to get was 7/6.</P>

      <P>This year in view of the prevalence of midge, one would imagine the Minister would come along and give people some encouragement to spray the wheat for the sake of the country.  No.  The price is retained.</P>
      <P>There is the famous milk question. When I was on the Government side of the House, I heard the present Minister talking at great length about milk. He even went down to the cost of the butter boxes and the butter paper and of the fuel oil driving the machines in the creameries.  He went down to the last detail in order to make a case for the farmers and then, at Kilkenny, there was a proposal made by the Minister's and my mutual friend, an ex-Deputy of this House, Mr. Phil Mahony, of 1/6 for the summer and 1/9 for the winter.</P>

    <P>I used to wonder why Deputy Cogan whined so much about credit for farmers, and I decided that he was ever and always a whiner.  However, this matter of credit was brought to my notice by a couple of farmers this year, and I think it is only right that their experiences should be related in this House when discussing the Estimate for Agriculture.  After all, we <Col N="1426" /> want our farmers to produce more, and we must realise that they must be given a certain amount of credit to help them to do so.  One farmer of my acquaintance applied for a loan to the Department of Agriculture under the heifer scheme, or some other such scheme. The Department referred him to the Agricultural Credit Corporation who replied to him as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I regret to have to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, have been unable to grant you the loan for which you applied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody could find fault with the company for so replying.  The farmer in question then wrote them a letter as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of April 3rd (No. C.S.350) would you be good enough to tell me the following: Yes or not to each would do. (1) Is there anything wrong with my application? (2) Were my sureties enough?  (I can have any number of them).  (3) Is there anything against me personally?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The company replied to him as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>Referring to your letter of the 7th instant, we regret that the board do not give the reasons for their decisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The farmer in question came to me and told me his story.  I said to him: &ldquo;That seems to be extraordinary.  I did not think the board would turn you down as quickly as that.  There must be something wrong.&rdquo;  I then went into the offices of the company and contacted the official dealing with the case. I was told by him that the company could not inform me of the private affairs of one of my constituents.  Of course, the very fact that this man gave me the letters I have quoted meant that I had power to inquire into his private affairs and, as well as that, to find out why he was not given the loan.</P>

      <P>Apparently not.  He said he could get more sureties, but neither he nor I would be told what was wrong.</P>
      <P>A further case was brought to my notice, which concerns a man who has been left a farm by his late father. Last year he hired a tractor at a cost of about £70 and sometimes he got a loan of one from his neighbours.  This year he made up his mind that he was going to extend his business.  He said to himself: &ldquo;Why should I be at the loss of £70 because of hiring a tractor, or why should I be asking the loan of one from my neighbours. I feel it would be better to buy a tractor altogether.&rdquo;  He approached a bank manager, bringing with him the title deeds to his farm.  The bank manager asked him to get the farm buildings and the crops insured which he did.  Shortly after his interview with the manager, he was informed that he would get the required loan and that it was only a matter of getting it ratified by the directors. However, soon after he was informed by the bank: &ldquo;We are not allowed to give any overdrafts this year, no matter what security you may put up. You know the cause of this; the directors have instructions from the Government not to issue any credit to the farmers.  You are the unfortunate sufferer.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the farmer had been able to buy the tractor, he would have increased his production this year, and his tractor would have paid its way, because he could let it out on hire. Deputy Murphy from Cork asked would the farmer be enabled to get rid of his pigs which were up to condition so that he would not have to hold them until they had gone over 12 stone weight, as the case may be. The Minister got very hot and bothered and said that there was an export market for pork and bacon, and that the farmers should export these pigs.  The Minister said that the farmers should apply to the Department of Agriculture and that <Col N="1428" /> although the pigs were held up for two or three weeks and were overweight, he would see to it that they did get full price for them.  They cannot sell these pigs, because the factories will not take them.</P>
      <P>A friend of mine who has two pigs for sale approached the factory to which he has always sold pigs, but they informed him that they could not take them for another three weeks.  If the Government mean to help the farmers and the pig producers of this country they should follow the bold lead given by Deputy James Dillon when Minister for Agriculture; they should open the Border and clear the country of this surplus bacon.</P>

      <P>For the last week we have listened to practically everything that could be said from a national point of view on this question of agriculture, and I may be forgiven if I sound parochial in what I have to say on the matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presumed that the Parliamentary Secretary would attend here&mdash;possibly he may have&mdash;and criticise every solitary Vote on the Estimate in so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned. I represent a constituency in which we have the greatest Gaeltacht in Ireland.  Deputy Duignan may wag his head but figures prove what I say. I am sorry to say that the Gaeltacht is dwindling very fast for very many reasons.  Two previous Ministers endeavoured to set up industries in the Gaeltacht.  The present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, set up, as an experiment, tomato houses in Connemara and West Donegal.  The present Minister for Local Government told us it was merely an experiment and that if the experiment proved successful these tomato houses would be extended.</P>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister, by his not extending this tomato house scheme, indicates that the scheme is a failure?  I put down a question last week to know whether it was proposed to extend the tomato house scheme in the Gaeltacht areas.  The reply I received was: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Therefore I take it that the experiment has been a failure.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he considers it a failure.  His silence gives me food for thought.</P>

      <P>Surely the experience of Deputy Dillon, the Minister's predecessor, should be taken into consideration by the Minister in deciding whether this scheme was a failure or otherwise.  I have not heard the Parliamentary Secretary for the Gaeltacht advocate the extension of the tomato houses.  I have not heard him condemn them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister, tried a second scheme in the Gaeltacht areas, hill reclamation.  In West Donegal he did a considerable amount of experimental work on hill reclamation.  That appears to have come to a standstill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister has dropped that too.  The tomato house scheme has been dropped.  Hill reclamation has been dropped.  What is the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government going to do to assist the Gaeltacht?  What industries, what schemes are they going to advance in substitution for these? Again, the Minister is silent and again the Parliamentary Secretary is silent. It speaks badly for them.</P>
      <P>We have Ministers going round the country opening Irish colleges and preaching what a grand thing it is to preserve the Irish language, but you can only preserve the Irish language by keeping the Irish speakers in the Irish-speaking areas.  What has been done to keep them there?  What is being done by the Department of Agriculture to keep them there?  These are questions which I would like the Minister or the Government to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land project gives a considerable amount of employment in the poorer districts.  God knows, we have not a lot of land to reclaim, but what land we have we should try to reclaim. We have a considerable amount of unemployment in the congested areas. Not one solitary scheme has been advanced.  Not one solitary application, made through the land project, in North-West Donegal and the <Col N="1431" /> Gaeltacht areas, where we have asked the Minister to carry out the work, has yet been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to know why these applications were not being dealt with.  The reply I got was that they had no machinery.  The person who looks for or tries to bring machinery into the Rosses, Gweedore or Cloghaneely districts to reclaim land knows nothing about the land with which he has to deal.  We have the unemployed, good hard working men eager to earn the money.  Why are these applications not being dealt with?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for farmers there to engage those men under Section A of the Land Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act, the Ministry undertakes, where the applicant so desires, to carry out the work on the applicant contributing a certain percentage of the cost.  These applications are lying unattended to in the Ministry's office for the past two years despite the fact that we have not only hundreds but thousands unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told there was no machinery.  You do not want machinery.  All you want is a spade and thanks be to God we have plenty of them left.  I want to know why the directors of the land project have not gone into West Donegal and attended to the applications made by small farmers for reclamation of their land, small farmers who are willing to contribute the percentage required by the Minister.  I want to know why that was not done.  I want to know why the Parliamentary Secretary for the Gaeltacht has not impressed upon the Government that this is one way of absorbing the unemployed in these congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Some six months ago, the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question, informed me that it was hoped to send his director to the Rosses area for the purpose of carrying out these schemes.  No person has yet arrived in the area and nothing has been done.  In South-West Donegal and in the area south of Donegal town, joint applications have been made by a number of farmers for the purpose of reclaiming lands there.  Further south, in Pullins, near Finner Camp applications have been made for the reclamation of land.  Not one of these applicants had been dealt with.  I often wonder whether the result of the by-election there some years ago had anything to do with it.  Certainly, West Donegal is one of the constituencies which has been neglected and sadly neglected by the present Government.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Minister say in this House and outside that dairy farmers, who have uneconomic cattle, may have them replaced from his Department's herds.  Unfortunately, the majority of small farmers in West Donegal have nothing but uneconomic cattle.  No scheme has been provided to replace them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon when Minister made a serious effort to introduce what is known as the Kerry cattle scheme into West Donegal.  He sent Kerry cattle to Arranmore Island, to Glencolumbcille and to Gweedore in the hope of improving the milk yield for the small farmers there.  It was merely an experiment.  I asked the Minister some eight months ago if he would consider continuing the experiment and his reply was that he would not. Do I take it that the Minister considers that scheme also as a failure or has he any substitute for it?  Why did he stop it?  That is something to which I would like a reply.</P>
    <P>Again, down through the years, the Department considered that they are the experts as to the class of cattle we require in West Donegal.  Repeatedly year after year we make application for Polled Angus and Aberdeen Angus bulls.  Despite that, and despite the poor nature of the land which we have, they insist on sending double dairy and beef Shorthorn bulls to the area <Col N="1433" /> which are useless to us.  I made application to the Minister and I must say that he met me very fairly in the matter.  He told me he could not send these bulls.  But I am telling him now, and I am telling him as the mouthpiece of some of his own inspectors, that we want nothing in West Donegal but black cattle, polled cattle, and they are the only salvation of the small farmer there.  I appeal to the Minister to take into his confidence the Parliamentary Secretary for the Gaeltacht and, if he does, between them something may be done for the Gaeltacht. If he only follows in the footsteps of Deputy Dillon by continuing the Kerry cattle scheme and in the footsteps of the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, by extending the tomato scheme, be it a success or otherwise, he will be doing something to keep the Irish speakers in the Irishspeaking areas of West Donegal and Connemara.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the caustic criticisms made in this House as to how the agricultural industry should have been handled and, if these criticisms are really genuine, the farmers of the country can be very happy and contented as regards their future.  Every Deputy who spoke on this Estimate dealt with it as it affected his own county.  I shall deal with it as it affects my own County of Clare.  Every Deputy, and I think the people as a whole, realise that Clare is a cattle-raising county and plays no small part in the agricultural industry. The people of West Clare will always feel grateful to Deputy Dillon for receiving a deputation from the people there when he was Minister for Agriculture as to the mortality in cattle and the severe losses which they were suffering through that for years past. He sent down three of his veterinary inspectors and they went into every farm in West Clare and in two years that scourge had been wiped out, with the result that the cattle population has increased considerably in Clare and is to-day playing a major part in the export of cattle from this country which is undoubtedly bridging the gap and doing what every country is trying to do, to increase exports and reduce imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister, was severely criticised for not setting up a lime plant in Clare.  He has now been out of office for 12 months and a plant has not yet been set up there, even though North Clare abounds in limestone and the land of West and South Clare is badly in need of lime.  I was listening to the Parliamentary Secretary the other day speaking about the removal of rocks in Connemara and saying it was useless. He said that under these rocks there was no soil.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to bear in mind that the farmers in Clare are not suffering from rocks on their land but from water.  Thousands of acres of the most fertile land in Clare are constantly under water and it would be much easier to remove that water than to remove rocks.  Most of this flooding occurred on the 28th December last.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that the old landlords, who were despised in this country and from whom this land was taken, always held themselves responsible for the maintenance of banks and maintained them for the tenants. These banks are now in the hands of the Land Commission and they absolutely refuse to have any responsibility for them.  On two occasions I went to the Land Commission about two different floodings.  Even though the Land Commission had made the banks 25 years ago&mdash;I know one particular place which is flooded where they put up a sluice five years ago&mdash;they refused to do anything about them.  As a matter of fact, they suggested that the tenants concerned should go to the Special Employment Schemes Department and do the work themselves.  In one case they suggested that they would give £800 if two tenants put up £300.  They shirked their responsibility by insisting on a clause that the tenants would have to maintain these banks hereafter.</P>
    <P>As I stated, Clare is a cattle-raising county, and something should be done for it.  It is a pity to see thousands of acres of the best land which was under grazing last year to-day under water while nobody seems to care about it.  No Minister can say that he is genuinely interested in the agricultural <Col N="1435" /> industry until he brings into fertility again that land in Clare which is flooded.  It has been admitted that the agricultural industry is the only industry which can save this country. To-day it is, as it were, holding out its hands and saying to the Minister: &ldquo;Take me along; if you handle me as you should, I will repay you one hundredfold.&rdquo;  It can be seen from the export returns that the bulk of our exports consist of the produce of our agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>This debate opened last week and, in regard to parts of it, we are at the disadvantage of not having the printed reports circulated. Therefore, it is perhaps difficult sometimes for us to comment as accurately as one might desire on some of the statements that have been made.  In so far, however, as the hurried look which I got of the report of the Minister's speech was concerned, I think most Deputies, when they have the time to read it in print, will get the same impression as I got from that look&mdash;that we are glad that the Minister, now that he has gone on to those benches, has come to the conclusion that the policy adumbrated by his predecessor was the policy best suited to the needs of this country. Some of the statements which he made, however, must have made the ghost of the man who used to sit as Deputy Tom Walsh on these benches turn and squirm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Walsh had been on this side of the House and had heard Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture say that there was &ldquo;no conflict between tillage and grass production,&rdquo; if he had heard Deputy Dillon use the words that &ldquo;in fact there is crying need for vast improvement in the quality of our grass&rdquo;&mdash;words which the Minister used when he opened the debate&mdash;I can well imagine that Deputy Walsh sitting on this side of the House with his colleague, Deputy Corry and others, would have made the welkin ring about the &ldquo;Minister for Grass.&rdquo;  It is good indeed to see that the Minister has, to some small extent, as indicated on the outline he has given on agricultural <Col N="1436" /> policy, become converted to the views that were put before him by his predecessor and members of this Party, views which he then spurned.</P>
    <P>Speaking here to-night, Deputy Allen bewailed the fact that anybody should suggest that it had been part and parcel of the policy of Fianna Fáil to have in normal times any sort of compulsory tillage.  While the Deputy was speaking I recollected an advertisement that had been published by Fianna Fáil in the 1948 election. I went out and I am glad to be able to say I found it.  In one of these advertisements, to which we have become so accustomed from Fianna Fáil, headed a &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;&mdash; they always seem to have plans for everything but strangely enough they never seem to put any of their plans into operation; this advertisement in 1948 dealt with: &ldquo;A plan for agriculture&rdquo;&mdash;we find this positive statement: &ldquo;A reasonable measure of compulsory tillage will be a permanent feature of policy.&rdquo;  A reasonable measure of compulsory tillage was to be a permanent feature of the policy on which the people were told then to vote for Fianna Fáil&mdash;a positive statement in a positive Party propaganda advertisement.  Is it any wonder when one sees advertisements like that, apparently, setting out the policy of the Party, that people who are not members of Fianna Fáil come to the conclusion that the item referred to is indeed part of the policy?</P>
    <P>We came last year to a much more recent episode, an episode which I myself witnessed.  The Minister when he was on this side of the House, was speaking on the 18th April, when he was asked by Deputy Davin as reported in column 1097, Volume 125:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What does he want?  Compulsary tillage?</P>
    <P>Mr. Donnellan: We do not know yet.</P>
    <P>Mr. Davin: He is silent on that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Walsh: I am not silent.  Yes, compulsory tillage for this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In case there might be any doubt that that statement made by him then was a statement made by a person in the <Col N="1437" /> heat of debate answering questions fired across the House&mdash;and it is easy enough when questions are being fired from one side of the House to the other, to say something which perhaps on more mature reflection one would not say&mdash;let me quote a statement made on the following day, to make it quite clear that it was in the mind of Deputy Walsh, as he then was, that the statement he had made truly reflected his views.  As reported in column 1152 of the debates of the 19th April, 1951, the Minister, then Deputy Walsh, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I mentioned last night, in reply to Deputy Davin&mdash;the admission was not forced from me because it is my own personal belief&mdash;that we should have compulsory tillage in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are we to think of a Minister who comes in with a Government, in the forefront of whose governmental programme in 1948 was put the declaration that there was to be compulsory tillage, who on the 18th and 19th April last year confirmed his belief in compulsory tillage and who is now defended by Deputy Allen because people from this side of the House suggested that there was ever any such thing in the mind of the Minister or in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party as compulsory tillage?</P>
    <P>The facts are quite simple.  The Minister and his Party would like to go on the line they took 12 months ago but they are afraid to do it.  The danger is that he has abandoned that foolish policy, but only temporarily abandoned it, and that he will introduce it at a later stage.  It could be put on the same lines as another statement recently made in another place in regard to another aspect of agricultural policy.  Last month the Finance Bill was debated in the other House and certain aspects of agricultural policy were discussed on that Bill.  We had the position in which Senator Johnston, one of the Senators nominated by the Taoiseach, put forward the suggestion that there should be a tax of from £8 to £10 per head imposed on cattle exported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister bides his time for a few moments, he will understand the extent of the responsibility which I am placing upon him. That was followed by a speech, not by a novice at the game, but by the Leader of the Minister's Party in the Seanad.  We are entitled to expect that the Leader of the Minister's Party in the Seanad will not, as such leader, put forward views unless these views have been discussed previously in the way that all these policies are hammered out in Parties and that, therefore, the Leader of the Government Party in the Seanad was putting forward on the 19th June last a kite for the Minister, to see whether it would go down well or not in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke is not a neophyte.  He is Leader of the Government Party in the Seanad, and, in the Seanad, speaking on agricultural policy, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the question of raising the taxes, a suggestion has been made that a tax should be put on the export of cattle.  That suggestion was made, I believe, by Senator Johnston, and I am entirely in agreement with it.  I believe that cattle being exported from this country would stand at least some tax and that a certain amount of money could be collected in that way.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not expect the Leader of the Government in the Seanad to make such a statement about agricultural policy without having the concurrence of the Minister.  If the Minister gave that concurrence, then he was doing a thing which would do infinite harm to the cause of agriculture in this country. The Minister should ensure that responsible spokesmen for the Government, when they are dealing with agriculture, should realise that, no matter what personal opinions may be held and whoever may be the Minister for the time being, it is the job of the Minister to put forward policy in that <Col N="1439" /> respect.  I wonder is that another aspect of policy which the Minister would bring in if he dared and was not afraid of the reaction that it would cause down the country?</P>
    <P>We had, during the course of the year and even during this debate, some discussions about barley. Deputy Corry, the other night, purported to give us the history of the barley situation.  Barley is a crop that is of the greatest importance to South Kildare.  It is a crop, the return from which is of importance to farmers in that area, just as it is of importance to the farmers in the Minister's own constituency and in that of Deputy Hughes and to Deputy Crotty.  The position, as regards barley, is quite clearly this, that Deputy Corry left out certain facts in his recital which I want to fill in.  The position is that, up to 1948, there was a controlled price, a fixed price&mdash;in 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946&mdash;of 35/- a barrel.  In 1947, the price fixed by the then Government was 40/- a barrel.  On the 10th October, 1947, Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Agriculture, announced that for the 1948 crop the price would be 45/- per barrel.</P>
    <P>After the change of Government, the position was reviewed by the then Minister, Deputy Dillon.  As a result of that review, the price was increased by him for that year from 45/- to 50/-.  On the introduction of his Estimate in that year, he made it quite clear that he was going to take off control for the following year.  He then made it quite clear that the price for the following year would be not less than 55/- a barrel.  When Deputy Corry was speaking the other night, he omitted from his statement these two facts, (1) that the price was increased by Deputy Dillon from 45/- to 50/- a barrel, and (2) that Deputy Dillon had indicated that there was going to be a price of not less than 55/- for the following year.</P>
    <P>Before the discussions between the Beet Growers' Association and Messrs. Guinness to which Deputy Corry referred the other night, as a result, and only as a result, of the fact that control and the fixed price was taken <Col N="1440" /> off barley by Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture in 1948, it was possible for a new system to be operated. The new system, so far as Messrs. Guinness, the largest buyers, were concerned, was a contract system. Deputy Corry, the other night, read an extract&mdash;when pressed he read it down to the end&mdash;from a paper in which that contract system was abused.  Deputy Corry disagreed with the criticism of the contract system that was voiced in that paper, and I too disagree with it. I think the contract system is very desirable.</P>
    <P>As far as South Kildare is concerned, I have not come across any evidence of the &ldquo;hooky&rdquo; suggestions that were made in the newspaper concerned in regard to the allocation of contracts as a result of the contract system that was introduced.  The price was fixed on the basis that a minimum amount would be paid, and that, in addition to it, there would be the overriding provision that our farmers here could expect to receive from Messrs. Guinness half a crown over the amount that their counterparts on the other side received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The effect of that was that, in the 1949 season, the growers here received 57/6; in the 1950 season, 55/6; and in 1951, 84/-. I think the Minister and I are agreed that that represents the correct trend of the facts up to the end of last season's harvest.  There was in existence, at the end of last season's harvest, a binding arrangement with Messrs.  Guinness that, for the years up to 1951 and for the years 1952 and 1953, they would pay to the Irish farmers a price of not less than 2/6 per barrel more than the amount which they had to pay to the English farmers at the other side.  That was the binding arrangement that was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> We have heard from Deputy Corry that, in the beginning of this year, Messrs.  Guinness sent for the committee of which he was one and told the committee that they wished to get out of their bargain.  Deputy Corry told us then that after negotiations with Messrs.  Guinness, the matter was subsequently referred to a meeting of the council of the Beet Growers' Association, that after those negotiations had taken place a price of 75/- was fixed and that the provision that was previously there of the 2/6 per barrel excess over the English price would go by the board.  All this happened approximately a week before the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach addressed a meeting last January which was representative of the county committees of agriculture in the whole country.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that that meeting took place on the 16th January. At that meeting, the price of wheat in relation to the price of barley was discussed.  At that meeting no indication whatever was given by the Minister or by the Taoiseach that there had been any change in the arrangements for barley for the 1952 harvest. The Minister told us when the matter was raised in the House&mdash;Volume 129, column 232&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no concern with the price paid by Messrs.  Guinness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In one of the next day's sittings of the House, the 14th February, we read at column 600 of the Official Report of that day that the Minister was asked whether he would give any assistance in the negotiations for a better price for the barley growers so that they would not have to accept this year from Messrs.  Guinness a lesser price than last year.  We read in the same column that the Minister, in his reply, said: &ldquo;I have no intention of interfering between the growers and Messrs.  Guinness in negotiations on price.&rdquo;  At column 1421 of the same volume of the Official Report we read that, on the 5th March last, the Taoiseach, when questioned on the matter, stated that the Minister for Agriculture had informed him &ldquo;that he had heard that there were rumours that some change had been made. <Col N="1442" /> That is the position.&rdquo;  What was the position?  What was the fact?  The Minister alleged in this House that, in the discussions that took place over these months about the price of barley, neither he nor any member of his Department had any contact with Messrs.  Guinness since the previous August about the price of barley.  I want to put it to the House that, if that statement is true, the Minister was falling down very badly on his job &mdash;falling down so badly on his job that he does not deserve to be Minister.  It seems to me an extraordinary suggestion that the Minister for Agriculture should state that he had no concern with the price of barley, that he was not going to intervene and assist the growers in getting a good price, that he had heard rumours, but that he made no effort to ascertain whether or not they were true.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary procedure demands that I accept the Minister's word in that regard but its acceptance means that the Minister is cutting a very sorry sight in his position of honour. More than that was, however, involved. Deputy Corry told us that he could not be blamed for the arrangement that was made because he had objected to the reduction in price.  I said then and I repeat now that, in my view, Deputy Corry at those negotiations sold the farmers&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;sold&rdquo; I do not use the word in a monetary sense but in a political sense. A solemn contract was there by virtue of which the barley growers were going to be paid 2/6 per barrel more than their British counterparts were going to be paid by Messrs.  Guinness for the season.  Immediately any suggestion was made of breaking that contract&mdash; and if the position was going to be defended in the proper way&mdash;the answer should have been that the suggestion of breaking the contract would be entirely and at once repudiated. The moment anybody on that committee sat down to discuss in any way the repudiation of the contract, that moment was the case given away and it was of no avail to anyone on the following day to propose its rejection. The case was lost when the people went up to Messrs.  Guinness.  It was <Col N="1443" /> lost because the Deputy and those associated with him had before them the idea of what the Fianna Fáil Party policy was and what the Government wanted.  What the Government wanted was to depress artificially&mdash;as they had depressed it from 1943 to 1947&mdash;the price of barley.  It was because of the knowledge that that was to be the Party line that the Deputy followed suit so quickly.  But an even worse thing happened in regard to this complete neglect by the Minister and his colleague, Deputy Corry, to be open and above board with the people concerned in this and with the people concerned at the meeting of the 16th January.</P>
    <P>No effort, apparently, from what the Minister has said, was made to inquire from him the official estimate of his Department as to the price to be paid in the coming year by Messrs. Guinness to the counterpart of the Irish farmer in Britain.  The very moment the suggestion was put up it was accepted.  I suggest that any competent person dealing with the matter would have considered it his duty to make certain that he took every step to get the best possible advice and information as to the likely price on the other side of the water.  After the decision had been taken&mdash;because it was a decision in line with the Party policy&mdash;again a deputation from the Beet Growers' Association before the 16th January, went to see the Minister.  At that meeting, again they discussed with the Minister the price of wheat in relation to the price of barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  That is what I said.  One of the aspects of the case that was made in regard to that wheat price was the price of barley.  Does the Minister seriously suggest and ask this House and the people of the country to believe that they told him then an untrue price? Does he suggest that no price was mentioned.  If no price was mentioned it must have been a very strange discussion about prices.  I presume the Minister made no inquiry of the gentlemen who came to see him about prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew there was an 84/- price.  Possibly that price was used on that day but there was nothing about 75/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The story, then, that the Minister wants us and the country to believe is that hard-headed people like Deputy Corry came to see him that day on a deputation and, I have no doubt, saw him on other occasions during the week that intervened between this discussion with Messrs.  Guinness and the meeting on the 16th January. Does the Minister suggest that during all those chats and during the discussion no mention whatsoever was made of any change in price?  I do not think that even the Minister's statement that he has no concern with the price will allow him to get away with that.  The Minister should have had a concern. He should have made it his business and his duty to see that the facts were put before these gentlemen when they came, if they did not already know the facts.  What were the facts?  The facts were that it was known or should have been known&mdash;and I am sure would have been known if the Minister had inquired in the ordinary way through the facilities available in his Department and through the Minister for External Affairs as to the British position&mdash;that at that time maltsters in Britain were anticipating that they would have to pay up to 200/- to 210/-a quarter.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is finished I will finish my sentence.  If they had not mentioned the price and if the Minister had not asked them what was going to be the price for next year, it was because everybody knew what had occurred but everybody wanted to have a clean bib and be able to come out here in the House and say so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister either had the information or was so negligent that he did not try to find the information and that he did it for the purpose of hoodwinking the people that he brought up from the county committees of agriculture.  If the Minister was competent in his job he would have known what the position was.  Here is an extract from the <i>Farmer's Weekly</i> of the 11th January, 1952, a report of the 30th Annual General Meeting of Associated British Maltsters.  The Minister can ascertain through the facilities that are open to him and to his Department that these people are concerned in a big way with purchases and the likely competitive prices that will have to be paid for malt purchased in Great Britain and for barley purchased for malt in Great Britain.  Here is what the chairman of the company said and it was reported on 11th January, 1952:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Shortage of foreign exchange and high prices which have made it difficult for this country to import adequate supplies of animal feeding stuffs have made it worth while for British farmers to use barley they grow for animal feed unless they can sell it at a price exceeding 160/- per quarter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is for last year's harvest:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" />&ldquo;Malting barley prices, therefore, now start at some price above that figure and may advance up to, say, 200/- to 210/- per quarter.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that barley prices this year will be about 124/- per quarter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Corry cannot have it both ways.  He said he was against the deal made and the Minister now is trying to suggest that Mr. Corry is in favour of the deal made.  I want to make this case without any fear or shadow of contradiction that the only reason these prices were accepted was because the record of the Minister's Party in regard to barley in 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947 was known and that the record of the Party always was unduly to depress the price for barley that would be received here.  I want to make the case further that if there was any validity in any of the things that the Minister has put forward as his defence, it was his bounden duty, occupying the honourable post he occupies, to inform the members of the county committees of agriculture of this on the 16th January last.  They were entitled to get the service which was at the Minister's disposal if he wanted to look for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, of course, the Minister did not come and look for it because he knew perfectly well that the answer and the information that was going to be made available was the same information made available by Associated British Maltsters and was not going to suit the Fianna Fáil Party book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I had occasion not so very long ago to meet each other down in the constituency of County Limerick.  I had the pleasure of listening to a speech made by the <Col N="1447" /> Minister in a place, the name of which I think was Caherline.</P>

The Minister stood up and told the people there&mdash;and I presume, therefore, that he meant what he said &mdash;that if only there had been a Fianna Fáil Government in power during the years of the inter-Party Government, then, No. 1, there would not have been the decline that there was in wheat acreage, No. 2, that there would not have been the imports of wheat that there were during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might, <Col N="1448" /> in one of his rare visits that he makes into his Department, call for the <i>Committee of European Economic Cooperation, Volume 2, Technical Reports, July to September,</i> 1947, and he might turn there to page 40.  He will find on that page two estimates of what this country was going to produce in respect of bread grains, wheat and rye, which were sent in by his predecessor, Deputy Smith, when Minister for Agriculture, and transmitted on behalf of Deputy Smith to the O. E. E. C. committee by Deputy de Valera as the then Minister for External Affairs.  If the Minister takes the figures that are there, the estimates that were sent forward for the four years in which those estimates were given and takes any of those years, he will find, in any of the four years that he likes to take, that there was, in fact, more wheat grown during the régime of the inter-Party Government than was intended by Fianna Fáil if they had remained in office.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion Deputy Briscoe said that it was not fair to take the year 1948-49 because perhaps that was still the result of Deputy Smith's policy.  Therefore, let us take the last year for which these estimates were given, the year 1951. Deputy Smith and Deputy de Valera transmitted to O. E. E. C. the information that we were going to grow in the 1951 cereal year 103,000 hectares of wheat in this country.  One hundred and three thousand hectares are equivalent to approximately 252,000 acres. The ratio is 2.47 to one.</P>
      <P>Let us see what the Taoiseach's Department say was grown in that year.  Giving the reply in this House on 1st April, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Ó Briain, gave the figures of what was grown in that year, computed, as was specifically asked by me, for the same period as the estimate given to O. E. E. C. and the answer is 366,000 acres&mdash;114,000 acres of wheat more than the Fianna Fáil Government proposed to grow in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take then the question of imports because that day down in Caherline, the Minister for Agriculture told <Col N="1449" /> the people that if only Fianna Fáil had been the Government in that time there would not have been brought in the same amount of foreign wheat as had been brought in.  I will take any year the Minister likes.  Again, I will take the last year because the last year presumably is the fairest year on which to judge.  On the last year, Deputy Smith, as Minister for Agriculture, estimated and Deputy de Valera as Minister for External Affairs transmitted to Paris that we would bring in 446,000 metric tons of wheat.  If the Minister wants the reference, it is the same volume of technical reports that I mentioned, page 64.  Four hundred and forty-six thousand metric tons are approximately 440,000 straight tons.</P>
    <P>What was brought in?  Again, if we take the answer of 1st April of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach we find that there were 249,600 tons but, let me be fair, let me also add to that the amount of wheaten flour that was brought in, because it would be fair to add the two.  When you add the two you will find that our record in that year was of importing 251,000 tons compared with the 444,000 tons that Fianna Fáil proposed and sent in their estimate as their anxiety and their ambition.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will take the trouble to sit down and examine the figures he will find that every estimate that was given by Fianna Fáil in reply to the questionnaire of the 23rd July, 1947, as to what this country would be able to produce in agriculture up to the end of the 1951 season, which was the last year for which O. E. E. C. asked for such estimates, was beaten in production by the inter-Party Government and that the estimates that were given in regard to imports were equally beaten.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that day in Caherline that if only Fianna Fáil had been in power there would not have been the same money spent on the importation of maize.  The position is quite clear.  Again, if the Minister looks at page 66 of the same volume he will see that Fianna Fáil proposed in the 1951 year to bring in 696,000 metric tons and that in fact during those years the amount that was brought in was less than half that amount, <Col N="1450" /> approximately of the nature of 300,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Those figures are there.  They are not figures that we have made up. They are figures that are in the records of the Minister's Department.  They are figures that are on the records of this House, given by the Statistics Office that is under the direction of the Taoiseach, of the facts.</P>

The performance shows the difference and it is because of that difference that, at the risk, as Deputy Allen said, of wearying the House I repeated what the Minister said that day and show how very untrue his speech was.  The reason I mention it is that, if Fianna Fáil had been left in power, there would not have been the revitalisation in agriculture that there was during the three years of inter-Party Government.  The reason for the increase in exports in the first six months of this year is that the momentum of the revitalisation that was put into agriculture by Deputy Dillon is still carrying on in spite of the Minister and in spite of the clog that is now being put on the machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is perfectly clear.  So far as the expansion that has taken place in agricultural production this year is concerned, I am delighted again to see the Minister's change of heart.  In his opening speech he said that he now agrees that agricultural production is expanding.  I am glad that he does not take the sorrowful wails of some of his colleagues as being true.  The amazing expansion in our exports that has taken place for the past six months is entirely due to the influence of Deputy Dillon in the Department of Agriculture, and I only hope that, when the Minister's term of office is ended, the next person to follow him will get in the 12 months thereafter the same expansion following his work, but I am afraid I do not think it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the only thing the Minister has done in the last 12 months has been to slow up what was started.  He came in here on the opening of this debate and proceeded to tell us that the amount that was being provided for the land rehabilitation project was an increase over the amount provided last year.  He told us, when opening, that the Vote in M. 9 was an increase on the amount provided for last year.  The Vote in <Col N="1452" /> M. 9 is an increase over the revised amount for last year, an increase over the amount spent after the Minister had slowed up his progress on the land project.  The amount provided in the Estimate last year for the land rehabilitation project was £2,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a sum which would have been spent were it not that the Minister went from this side to the opposite side to slow up the project, perhaps because, as Deputy Bartley told us, some of it was bad. Time, again, will tell us about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put some particular questions to the Minister although I do not know whether I will get any assistance from him with regard to them.  I do not know whether he knows the answer or not.  I take it that it is agreed that over the years there has always been a certain amount of wheat midge and that it is only in the past couple of years that the ravages of that midge have begun to take serious effect, or is it that it is believed by the technical people concerned that the ravages of the midge are no greater than ever they were but that the cause of the ravages is now more accurately diagnosed? If the position is that the technical people in the Department believe that there is no more damage being done than ever was done by wheat midge, and that all that is happening is that we now know, when <Col N="1453" /> damage is done, that it has been done by the midge, it can be approached in one way.  It can be approached in the way in which it is being tackled, by the provision of and education in the use of sprays and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to put this point to the Minister, however, that if it is the belief of the technical people that there is an increase in the amount of midge damage in relation to the area of crop, there is another problem which must be tackled&mdash;the reason for the increase.  I do not pretend to be an expert on agricultural matters.  I only pick the brains of other people and try to get such information as I can from experts, but I have heard people, who, I consider, know their job, say that they believe that the damage has increased, that the midge has increased substantially, the reason for the increase being that sprays for charlock or for land in some other shape, modern methods of treatment of land, have destroyed what one might describe as the parasite that normally lives on the midge.</P>
    <P>Is that view held by the technical people in the Department?  If it is, can steps not be taken to find out what is responsible for the destruction of that parasite and what is the parasite concerned which normally preys upon the midge?  If the second is the position, it seems to me that it is one that can become very serious, and will become increasingly serious each year, unless we are able to get scientific research moving for its solution.  It is a highly technical scientific problem, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that substantial research is being conducted as to whether the disease is spreading, or whether it is merely better diagnosis of a disease which is always there in more or less the same proportions.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, also referred to foot-and-mouth disease and he mentioned, quite properly, the viewpoint that the reason some countries have turned over from slaughter to immunisation is that they have accepted the position that the disease must be there and that slaughter would not be possible or economic.  I should like to know, in <Col N="1454" /> view of the nearness of such serious outbreaks of disease, whether the Minister has got a complete cut-and-dried operation Order, so to speak, to be put into effect immediately there is any question of an outbreak?  I do not mean immediately an outbreak is confirmed, but immediately there is a question of an outbreak.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example of what happened on the previous occasion.  Unfortunately, there was an outbreak here and a certain farmer not very far away from where I live found, as he thought, a suspected case on his land.  He at once sent for the vets and took all proper precautions.  It happened at midday and the first thing necessary for him was to do his utmost to ensure that hordes of schoolchildren coming out at lunch-time would not invade his place to have a look at his cattle and go all over the farm.  I am not thinking merely of the position when the disease has got a grip.  It is in the initial stage that victory in regard to any outbreak will be won or lost.</P>

      <P>The Minister should insist on this point with his colleague the Minister for Education so as to ensure a proper estimation of the damage which can be done in the initial stages before the Minister's officers can get to the scene of the outbreak. The technical steps that can be taken have been outlined quite clearly by the Minister.  From what I can ascertain the Minister is right in saying that immunisation is only an acknowledgment of defeat.  That does not affect the fact that we want a proper realisation of how easily it can be spread. What occurred at the Spring Show proved that people did not realise that. With this very virulent form of the disease surrounding us from France and from England it would be entirely desirable that a little knowledge should be imparted throughout the country of the steps which should be taken.  It would be a very valuable insurance. It certainly cannot do any harm and might do incalculable good.</P>
      <P>Deputy J. Flynn referred to the position of the Minister for Agriculture in getting the Board of Works to carry out certain works for him as his agents for the land rehabilitation project. What progress has been made on the river to which the Deputy referred, the Rye, between Kildare and Meath? A survey was made of that river at the direction of the then Minister, Deputy Dillon.  Since it was completed we have heard nothing more. That river prevents the proper drainage of, and proper production on, a very large area of fertile land.  In addition it is the source of substantial periodic flooding in Kilcock.  I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that the results of that survey are to hand and that it will be possible to carry out the work at a very early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope too that the Minister will be able to go further and get the Board of Works as his agents on the Blackwater&mdash;I mean the Blackwater in Kildare and Meath, not the many other Blackwaters there are in other parts of the country.  He will be told by his advisers that there are very large areas in the Blackwater basin in North Kildare and where it flows into the Boyne in Meath which cannot be <Col N="1456" /> something is done on the main rivertouched under the land project until It is a very desirable and necessary work and would mean that a further substantial area of land could be dealt with under the project.</P>
    <P>It is of course commonplace to say that it is useless to attempt land project drainage in an area where there is not an outfall.  There is not an outfall in the Blackwater or the Rye area. The Rye has an additional advantage in that it discharges into the Liffey where there need not be arterial drainage because the Poulaphouca and Leixlip lakes act as an evening factor and prevent the river from getting into flood.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that those two schemes receive early attention and that even more machinery with greater efficiency in its use will be brought into the area.</P>
    <P>The general outline of that section of the rehabilitation project is dealt with by the Department itself.  I had hoped that the Minister would, before his Estimate, give us a schedule of figures showing the way in which the various counties have been dealt with, but as he has not done so we can only assume that progress is more or less as it was.</P>

      <P>All the important issues affecting farming, our principal industry, have been dealt with and I hope to hear the Minister very soon.  I want to avail of this opportunity to tell a little story.  To-day I had some American visitors in the Gallery. One was a child, whose name was Burke, with her auntie, whose name was Kickham&mdash;not a very foreign name.  I told her the debate was on agriculture.</P>

      <P>The little girl from Boston spoke of the terrible things which were allowed to be done to our lovely horses and drew attention to articles which had appeared in foreign papers about the slaughter of Irish horses on the Continent and their travelling under very unfavourable conditions.  I was glad to get that reminder from a child from the United States whose connections were <Col N="1457" /> Irish that somebody should raise the question again in this House and ask the Minister to stop this slaughter of Irish horses when their useful life is thought to be practically ended.  They are sent away under what has been described as very inhumane conditions. The question has been raised by Deputy Dockrell and I want to pay a tribute to him, to Deputy Esmonde and to the others who have done so.  I would ask the Minister to give us some hope that he has not given us his last word, that he is not adamant in his previous opinion that it does not concern him and that he will take no steps.  Organisations for the prevention of cruelty to animals, to our dumb friends, are very keen that the Minister should give some hope.  I hope that he will get in to-night to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister the other evening reading his introduction to the Estimate, I could not help coming to the conclusion that there was very little difference between the Estimate introduced by him and that introduced last year and the previous year.  I think that things should be so, as in this little country this Estimate deals with our principal industry and a mere change of Government or of Ministers cannot create a wonderful change overnight.  It is <Col N="1458" /> rather peculiar that many Irish people think that when a new Government comes into power everything in the garden will be lovely.  The present Minister, however, has realised I am sure since he came into power that it is a different position now from when he was in opposition.  The Estimate he introduced is one that will find general favour with members of this House and with the people outside, for the reasons I have stated.  The Minister must agree that the position of agriculture as he found it on his accession to office was good and that he was able to build on a solid foundation that had been laid already during the previous three years&mdash;or the previous ten or 20 years, for that matter.</P>
      <P>The proof of that is contained in statistics I was reading regarding our exports.  It is generally agreed that their value has shown an upward tendency. The growing of cereals shows a satisfactory position in respect of the yield.  Take wheat, around which there has been a very violent and at times acrimonious discussion for some years. Let me say here and now that I think we will never be in a position to grow sufficient wheat to produce all the flour we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to this before and want to emphasise here to-night that if we were left severely alone on our own we would not exist for a month.  It is questionable if, outside the United States of America or the great Russian empire, there is any country in the world which could exist absolutely by itself for one month.  So much for this wild talk about growing everything we need here on the limited amount of land at our disposal.  To get back to wheat figures count for something and the figures I am going to give now are, I think, official&mdash;at least they have been taken from official reports and I presume they have been submitted by officials of the Department who naturally are responsible for the production of such figures.  In regard to wheat, I find that in 1950 there were 366,000 acres sown and that it produced 2,000,000 barrels of wheat, while an acreage of 579,646 of wheat sown in 1947 yielded no more than 1,463,200 barrels. I think it will be agreed from <Col N="1459" /> those figures that the contention of the then Minister was right, that there is not much use in growing wheat on land that is not suitable for wheat. Everyone knows that some land can grow it and other land cannot.  That is proved by these figures, that from a lesser acreage more wheat has been delivered into the mills than was delivered from a greater number of acres in 1947 or the years previous to that. The Minister may be in the happy position possibly this year of being able to make the same announcement here, that the yield per acre was greater this year than it was during the past three years&mdash;for this reason, that the farmers now are allowed to grow the wheat on the land they think most suitable for it.  After all, who knows better how to run his business than the man who has to earn his living by it every day?  The farmer who grows the crops is the best judge.  The same can be said of oats and barley.  In 1950, 119,000 tons of barley were grown from 123,000 acres, whereas in 1947 from 145,883 acres the return was no more than 88,000 tons.</P>
    <P>We come to the question of cattle, and here it has been stated over and over again that the number was decreasing and had decreased during those years.  The figures tell a different story.  In 1948 the total number of cattle was 3,531,500 head, while to-day it is 3,910,600 head.  Sheep also showed a remarkable increase in number.  In 1948 there were 1,626,400, while in 1950 there were 1,949,100.  The pig population showed a very marked increase. In January, 1948, there were 369,700 pigs, while to-day there are 530,700. Similarly in regard to our exports of cattle.  The value of cattle exports in 1947 was £15,628,000, while in 1950 it was £22,277,000.  That shows the important place that cattle take in the economy of this country so far as exports are concerned, in providing us with the necessary finances to purchase those things that are essential in order that we may carry on the national economy.</P>
    <P>It has been said over and over again that the previous Minister was all out <Col N="1460" /> for grass.  It was good grass that turned out £22,277,000 worth of cattle for export.  I am sure the Minister would be very happy to be able to say at the end of this year&mdash;as I hope he will&mdash;that there have been even better results and that the figures he can give next year will show a marked increase on those I have given to-day.</P>
    <P>Our exports of poultry have also increased. There was great criticism of the ex-Minister in regard to poultry. In 1947 the exports were valued at £1,926,000, while in 1950 they were valued at £3,916,000.  That is a marked increase.  Might I remind Deputies again that during that particular period criticism was levelled at the Minister then because of his failure to get an increased price for eggs from the British Government?  Some Deputies were foretelling that producers would go out of the business of poultry-keeping altogether.</P>
    <P>The facts are that, in 1947, the value was £1,926,000, and in 1950 it was £3,916,000.  Egg exports in 1947 were valued at £1,574,000, and in 1950 they were valued at £5,146,000.  That is, roughly speaking, well over 300 per cent.  increase so far as value was concerned.  The same applies to wool exports.  In 1947 they were valued at £893,000, and in 1950 they were valued at £3,516,000.  Exports of ham in 1947 were nil; in 1950 they were valued at £994,431.  Exports of tinned meat were valued in 1947 at £752,000 and in 1950 at £1,540,000.  Chocolate crumb exports in 1947 were valued at £472,000 and in 1950 at £2,784,000.  Those figures prove conclusively that Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, whatever may have been his faults in other directions, was not the bold, bad boy that many Deputies would have us believe he was.  In so far as he personally was concerned, his sole ambition was to do the best he could in the interests of those whom he represented and on whose behalf he held office as Minister for Agriculture. My wish for the present Minister is that he will find himself in the same position this time next year, namely, in the position of being able to give out figures here as favourable as those <Col N="1461" /> I have quoted to-night in so far as agricultural production is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are two matters to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention in relation to my constituency.  One is the price of barley and the other is the price of potatoes, especially the price to the growers of potatoes in the Cooley area.  As the Minister is aware, the price of 75/- in regard to barley will only be paid to those farmers who have signed contracts with the various agents of Messrs.  Guinness.</P>
    <P>In County Louth there are many farmers who did not have an opportunity of entering into contracts. Nevertheless they grow barley fit for malting and it has been suggested to me by some of the farmers in that area that the Minister should take any steps that lie within his power to ensure that no barley will be imported for malting until such time as all the home-grown barley fit for malting, other than that contracted for, has been purchased by Messrs.  Guinness or by the other breweries in the country.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware the position in relation to potatoes will be anything but satisfactory.  Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, made a contract with the British Government for the export of 50,000 tons of ware potatoes at an agreed price.  That price varied as the season progressed. It started off with £7 10s. per ton, or £8, then went up to £9 and eventually £10 during the months of February, March and April.  This year, as far as I know, there is no hope of a contract being entered into with the British Government or with any other Government. We did export potatoes to Spain, France, the Canary Islands and North Africa.  The farmers in the Cooley area are somewhat worried at the prospect of having no outlet other than selling these potatoes to the alcohol factories.  I understand the price they will receive from the factories averages £6 per ton.  That is not a bad price when one considers that they have not to pick the potatoes.  They can dig them out &ldquo;on the face&rdquo;, as they say, and get £6 per ton but the growers feel that the price is not economic because of increased labour costs and the increased cost of <Col N="1462" /> fertilisers.  The Minister knows that potatoes are a costly crop to grow. They require a good deal of labour, care, attention and hard work.  If the worst comes to the worst and there is no export market, the farmers feel they should get an increase in the basic rate of £6 per ton.  They suggest an increase of £1, or £7 per ton, for potatoes supplied to the alcohol factories.</P>
    <P>There have been many differences of opinion as to the efficacy of the land rehabilitation scheme.  Might I remind Deputies once more that one of our failings as a race is that we are too impetuous; we want results overnight? It was never claimed by Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, that the land rehabilitation scheme would change the face of the country overnight. He made it quite clear that the scheme would extend over a period of ten years.  He stated that the maximum cost of the scheme would be £40,000,000, an average of £4,000,000 per year for each of the ten years of its operation.  In answer to some of the criticisms that have been levelled against the scheme, may I point out that there was freedom of choice?  A farmer who wanted his land drained, limed, and rehabilitated, etc., could make a contract with a contractor to have the work done.  He could give it to the Department of Agriculture to do it for him, or he could do the job on his own.  From the results that have been achieved during the last few years, I think that scheme will prove to be of great benefit in so far as the agricultural economy of the country is concerned.  As Deputies are aware, it was assumed that there were at least 4,000,000 acres to be reclaimed.  If 4,000,000 acres were reclaimed, it would add greatly to the agricultural productivity of this country.  The value of this land, when reclaimed and in full production, would be much greater than the money spent on it.  Taking the cost of reclamation to be £10 per acre, which is a small sum, one can see that if 4,000,000 acres were reclaimed, the Government would be reimbursed for whatever money had been expended. Criticisms have been levelled at the project because of the slowness with which it operated in the beginning. <Col N="1463" /> However, everybody must realise that this was a new scheme&mdash;new to the officials, new to the farmers and new to everybody concerned with its operation.  There is always bound to be a little waste of time where big schemes of this nature are concerned. It was not so easy to procure contractors who were skilled in that particular form of work, and, consequently, the scheme did not make as good headway as one would expect.</P>
    <P>I feel that it must be agreed on all sides of the House that magnificent work has been done under this project during the past year.  I have made it my business to examine some of the reclaimed land because I believe in the old saying that seeing is believing; what one sees for oneself is far better than hearsay.  I visited a certain farm before it was reclaimed.  I visited it again 12 months after the work had been carried out and I found fields of the finest wheat I have ever seen growing on what was one time a heavy, sluggish type of land.  I feel that that is the best possible proof that this scheme will be successful.  Nobody claims that it can be operated with the same success in all parts of the country, because this country varies a lot.  We have not sufficient land to meet the needs of many of our people, especially the small farmers with three, four and six acres who, at the present time, have to emigrate to England. Therefore, this project will be an achievement of which we may feel proud.  It does not matter who was responsible for the scheme.  It is succeeding and we hope it will be brought to a final success, no matter who is Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Whilst farmers may not be millionaires, on the whole the agricultural industry is not in too bad a position. Of course, that is as it should be.  The farming community are the real backbone of this country.  They have proved to be that not alone during the last few years but also during two terrible wars.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, I feel this country need have no anxiety for the future so long as our farmers are in a tolerably prosperous condition.  The Minister <Col N="1464" /> may rest assured that, no matter what little differences there may be, he will get the necessary co-operation from all members of this House.  I am sure that he will agree that, during his visits to the various committees of agriculture, he experienced the same co-operation which was given to his predecessor.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear in mind the two matters affecting my constituency which I brought to his notice.  I am referring to the price which should be given for the barley which is in the hands of the farmers who were not fortunate enough to secure contracts with Messrs.  Guinness and to the price that will be paid for potatoes to the farmers in the Cooley area.  So far as I understand the question, no contract has been made this year with the British Government in regard to the export of ware potatoes.</P>

      <P>One would hardly think, listening to this debate and particularly to the contribution given by Deputy Sweetman, that some kind of arrangement has, apparently, been made whereby the Dáil will close down on Thursday night having disposed of all the Estimates still before us for consideration, including such important Estimates as those for the Department of External Affairs and for the Taoiseach's Department.  I see that a motion has been put down to refer back the Taoiseach's Estimate, signed not only by Deputy Costello but by leading members of the Labour Party, and it was obviously hoped to have a long and important debate on general national policy on this Estimate.</P>

Deputy Sweetman's reference was an uncalled for and offensive one and because of it I propose to say a few words on this important Estimate.</P>

Undoubtedly, statistics must be understood if they are to be handled with effect.  To suggest that the value of our exports was, say, £1,500,000 in 1947 and £3,000,000 in 1950 means nothing at all unless one takes into account the change the value of money has undergone in the meantime.  It would be a very good thing to put against that what imports cost or what specific imports cost in 1947 and what they cost in 1950.</P>

If I make that comment, I want also to say that I am making no criticism whatsoever of the speech that Deputy Coburn made, a speech sincerely and honestly meant and one which contained a lot of important material.

      <P>Deputy Coburn mentioned the matter of compulsory tillage.  He told us that, when farmers were compelled to grow wheat, they grew less wheat per acre than when they were allowed to select, as he said, their own land on which to grow. What does that mean?  It means that, when the Government said &ldquo;We want so many thousands of acres of wheat,&rdquo; the farmers grew that wheat on land that was unfit to grow wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He does and he did see, in counties not very far from Dublin, where wheat was grown in swamps&mdash;at least it was sown in swamps.  In other parts, land was used year after year without any fertilisation for the growing of wheat. If that whole position was examined, it would be seen that certain people did not render very great national service to this country during a dangerous emergency.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Coburn when he says we cannot grow all the wheat we need.  We can.</P>

      <P>We have the land on which to grow it.  We have the people who can sow it and harvest it. What is really wanted is determination to do it and co-operation to get the best possible results out of the soil.  It is much better that a country should make an effort to be as self-supporting as possible.  That needs the co-operation of everybody.</P>
      <P>I do not care who thinks it is wrong but I believe in a policy of tillage, compulsory tillage if necessary, that will get for this country its requirements in vital foodstuffs that we can produce ourselves.  I think there is something wrong with agriculture if we have to import butter.  There is something wrong with agriculture if we have got to do that.  There is something wrong with agriculture when sufficient milk cannot be produced at a price at which people in the cities, particularly city families, can purchase it.  The same remarks apply in regard to beef.</P>
      <P>There is something wrong with a system of agriculture that relates our price in the city shops to what our farmers get for their cattle in England. I would like to see more milk drunk in this country.  I would like to see more beef available but the position now is that it is only an odd family who have all the meat they ought to have in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Beef is too dear in the cities simply because we have a completely wrong organisation in regard to it.  Deputy Sweetman dealt at some length with this particular point.  Our prices for beef ought not to be decided by the price that our farmers get for beef in England. That is the deciding factor now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well what I am going to suggest and he is welcome to make any capital he likes out of it.  I say that we should have a system of organisation whereby prices in the home market will be controlled in the interests of our consumers and where the price for our consumers will be subsidised from the difference between what our Government considers the economic price for our farmers and what the British pay for our beef.  I think that is perfectly clear.  In other words, the farmer would be guaranteed every year what is considered to be an economic price for his produce&mdash; his cattle, say, in this instance&mdash;and that any price in excess of that which can be got by this country would react to the benefit of the country as a whole and would be utilised for the purpose of enabling beef to be sold at a price at which the ordinary worker can buy it.  That is not such a revolutionary suggestion at all.  It is a matter of organising our agriculture in the interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey knows&mdash;I am glad he is here&mdash;that the New Zealand Government could carry out a system such as that and that they carried it out successfully.  We will not do anything like that.  Oh, no!  We must permit the <Col N="1469" /> price of beef in Dublin to be decided by the price our farmers get for their beef in London, Birkenhead or somewhere else.  I say definitely&mdash;and I am only going to touch on these few points &mdash;that there is a lot wrong with our agriculture.  It will require the very hardest work on the part of the Minister and his Department to bring about the sort of reorganisation which I envisage and recommend.  We shall get nowhere with the type of debate we have heard for some days past, comparing the Minister's achievements since he took office with the achievements of his predecessor, Deputy Dillon, in the three and a half years he was Minister.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider is the objective and what we have to do is to work towards that objective.  When we have, as we have, a Minister who is personally interested and vitally concerned in the future of agriculture, when he has shown evidence of his determination to do the best he can for agriculture, then he ought to receive all the support this House can give him in the very big and onerous task he has before him.  Whether I am offended by a Deputy or not, I will not agree to the suggestion that everything is all right with agriculture; it is not all right.  I have mentioned just a few points and I could mention many more.  The Minister has a huge task before him and it is our duty as a Parliament on behalf of the people to give him all the help we can, to make all the suggestions we can, and to get away from the sort of destructive criticism we have had.</P>
    <P>I intervened when Deputy Sweetman was talking about foot-and-mouth disease and the precautions which should be taken in regard to it.  We have avoided foot-and-mouth disease for a long period, due to the fact that we have an efficient section of the Department of Agriculture dealing with that.  We should be almost afraid to mention such a dread disease. Listening to the talk we have had about it and some of the interjections that were made, one would think that some Deputies would almost wish that such a dread scourge should descend upon the country in order to establish that the Minister had not taken the <Col N="1470" /> steps he should have taken.  Why should it be mentioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was talking about offensive references a few minutes ago.  There could be nothing more offensive than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should that be introduced now?  Does not Deputy Morrissey know that every conceivable step that can be taken to protect the country is being taken by the officials of the Department?  The same officials who did the work under Deputy Dillon are doing it to-day under the present Minister.  When we get down to that sort of business, one feels that the serious interest which ought to be taken in this matter is not being taken. I repeat to the Minister that I am not satisfied that everything is all right with agriculture.  I think he is not satisfied either and I hope that he realises that there is a very big field of endeavour before him in order to put agriculture right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution from Deputy Cowan must have been embarrassing to the Minister.  Certainly, if the Minister were here during the course of the Deputy's speech he would have been very embarrassed by the many points put to him regarding the policy which he should adopt. Deputy Cowan was annoyed when he began to interrupt with regard to foot-and-mouth disease.  He talked about foot-and-mouth disease not having visited this country for a very long period, when in fact it visited this country within the last ten years and we had a bad dose of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan mentioned that all is not well with agriculture. Nobody knows that better than the Deputies on this side of the House.  The Minister is in charge of the most important branch of our national economy.  When Deputy Dillon was in charge of the Department of Agriculture there was confidence amongst the farmers and they felt that they had a leader in him.  There is no confidence amongst the farmers at present. <Col N="1471" /> Nobody is a better judge of that than themselves and the Minister must know it.  In some respects agriculture is on the decline.  I certainly give credit to the Minister for being very much better than the Minister for livestock destruction or the Minister for tillage compulsion belonging to his Party whom we had in previous years.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister doing in regard to a policy for milk and butter production?  Will he import less butter during the coming winter than during the last winter?  Will he explain the reason for the game of ducks and drakes which he and his Party played with the milk producers of this country during the last few years and which caused many farmers to go out of milk production?  They were convinced by the Minister and his colleagues that they should get out of business as soon as possible and they took that advice.  The result is that we must now import butter and, possibly, in the future we shall be faced with the prospect of importing milk.  The only thing the Minister did was to set up a milk costings commission which was only a method of &ldquo;passing the buck &ldquo;or putting the responsibility on somebody else instead of taking the responsibility himself.  He was very vocal when on this side of the House regarding agricultural prices.  In the past year we have seen what has occurred in regard to many crops which were the backbone of agricultural economy for the farmers.  Let us take barley as an instance.  We know that the Minister went into a conspiracy with the Beet Growers' Association in order to depress the price of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I shall put it this way: that the Beet Growers' Association, which can be regarded as a wing of the Fianna Fáil Party under cover, was usually very vocal in relation to prices in years past.  The point I want to make is that in previous years nothing was good enough.  A price of 75/- a barrel, or 77/- or even £4 10s. was not enough for barley when Deputy Dillon was in charge as Minister. But we remember that the Fianna Fáil Party had fixed the price of barley at 35/- a barrel and when we came into office we decontrolled the price of barley, thus enabling the farmers to get the best price they could, especially as Messrs.  Guinness and the other brewers when they were paying 35/- for all the Irish barley they could get were importing barley from Australia landed here at a cost of 85/-a barrel.  We decided to give the farmers a chance of getting the best price they could from the brewers of this country and immediately the price went up to the figure we have known in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Beet Growers' Association got them that price in previous years, they certainly brought down the price this time.  That was done, I suggest, for the purpose of forcing farmers to grow wheat instead of barley and the Beet Growers' Association should be honest about it. That is the reason they did their part in depressing the price of barley.  The price of wheat this year compared with last year or previous years will not give the farmers the return they had in previous years.  Remember, fertilisers were available to farmers in past years at £6 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know that fertilisers could be purchased at £6 10s. per ton when Deputy Dillon was in office.  Apparently he did not see the fertilisers that were there at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that when fertilisers were imported at £9 per ton, he was criticised by Deputy Lemass for bringing in 160,000 tons at that price.  These fertilisers disappeared after the change of Government, to be found eventually in building contractors' stores or in the stores of speculators and the stuff can now be made available to farmers only at £16 10s. per ton.  If the farmer has to pay that price it will place a higher load on the price of wheat per barrel than when fertilisers were available at £6 10s. or £9 per ton, the ruling prices when the Minister and his colleagues were on this side of the House.  Now, of course, they have taken the fertilisers from the farmers and made them available to the Beet Growers' Association&mdash;many of them beet growers only in name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to hear the Minister when he is replying with regard to his policy on wheat.  When he was on this side of the House he was constantly shouting that the acreage of wheat had fallen from 600,000 acres to 350,000 acres.  Yet when the present Minister for Local Government was Minister for Agriculture he furnished a report to the American officials of E.C.A. indicating that it was intended to have the acreage of wheat in 1950 reduced to 247,000 acres. That is there in black and white.  It must also be remembered that when the area under wheat was 350,000 acres, more wheat was produced from that acreage than was got from the 600,000 acres about which the Fianna Fáil Government boasted so much. The inter-Party Government regarded the number of tons of wheat produced as more important than the actual <Col N="1474" /> acreage; with Fianna Fáil it was always the acres that were looked to and not the tonnage produced, but the Minister has made no attempt even to get acres of wheat produced this year.</P>
    <P>He has certainly discouraged the production of tons of wheat by removing fertilisers from the reach of the farmers.  Of course, when he was on this side of the House he expressed himself frequently as being in favour of compulsory tillage but ultimately he had to go down to retract these views in his own constituency at a very suitable time&mdash;during the election campaign. He has since continued in that attitude.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister do last spring to ensure that we would grow our full requirements of wheat?  Has he increased the price of wheat to a figure which will induce farmers to believe that it is a paying proposition and encourage them to grow it?  He certainly has not and he is not going to get wheat at that price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <P>I am not.  When there was a surplus crop of oats a few years ago, there was a considerable amount of moaning on this side of the House by the then Opposition and eventually a floor of 35/- was put to the price of oats.  Is the Minister going to put a floor to the price of oats this year? He knows the floor has gone from under it, and that there are many farmers who have their lofts full of oats for which they cannot get an economic price.</P>

      <P>You imported a lot of barley from Poland during the past 12 months.  That was, of course, part of the scheme to bring down the price of barley and the Beet Growers' Association made the final effort.  Apparently <Col N="1475" /> the importation of barley from Poland was not having the desired result.</P>
      <P>As regards potato prices, the farmers of Rush had not such a bad season for early potatoes for the last five years as they had during the recent season.  They are getting a very bad price for them and the future of potato growing in the Rush area is regarded with considerable uncertainty. Certainly, having regard to the present cost of fertilisers and the cost of labour, etc., farmers would not consider it worth while growing potatoes at the prices which were received this year.  They are getting only about £6 or £6 10s. per ton after having met all their costs.</P>

      <P>The fruit growers are very dissatisfied regarding the attitude of the Government.  People who grew strawberries, raspberries and other types of perishable fruit find themselves in competition with dried fruit and fruit pulp.  Resolutions of protest have been passed by many bodies.  I think Deputy O'Reilly from Meath was associated with one of these resolutions regarding fruit prices. There was plenty of noise about that when the Minister and his colleagues were on this side of the House but we hear very little about it from them nowadays.</P>
      <P>Again agricultural machinery has been placed beyond the reach of many farmers.  No effort has been made by the present Government to curb the price and farmers find it very difficult to get together certain gear for use with tractors.</P>
      <P>Some mention was made of the poultry industry and egg prices.  We remember that when Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture in this country he found his hands tied by the 1947 agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under that agreement £1,250,000 was given to this country by the British Government in return for certain undertakings given by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  We <Col N="1476" /> took that money and invested it in order to develop the poultry industry. Then we had to honour the agreement with the British Government when egg production eventually increased.  The price of 2/6 per dozen lasted for one year and then Deputy Dillon was faced with the prospect of having to accept only 1/8 per dozen.  He however succeeded in getting an agreement to pay 3/- for one year.  As Deputies know, in the following year the British Government were not prepared to give what many poultry producers would regard as an economic price for eggs with the result that it was decided to export poultry instead of eggs.</P>
      <P>With the return of the present Government, we had the formation of rings and monopolies.  One is the seed ring.  It is beginning to show itself again and to push out the small man from earning some kind of a living from the sale and distribution of seeds. The monopolies are taking over again. I was shown a letter from a Denmark firm which indicated that they had a letter from a particular group in this country telling them not to supply seeds to an individual here because he was not a member of their particular group.  That is the type of thing that is being fostered, and it is in the interests of agriculture that it should be stopped because it is causing hardship to many farmers who are unable to get good quality seeds.  Anything at all is dished up to them when a monoply is given by our own Government.</P>
      <P>It was a remarkable thing to hear Deputy Cowan speaking on agriculture last year and this year.  We remember well that he spoke loudly in praise of Deputy Dillon last year, and said that, even though he approved of his policy and even though he was making a good job of it, he was going to vote against the Estimate.  That is the type of logic that we are always ready to accept from Deputy Cowan.</P>
      <P>We ought to get a statement from the Minister regarding milk prices.  It was the one thing that he was very vocal about in the past.  He certainly suggested a figure of 1/9 per gallon himself. That was published in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>Regarding the land project, there are many complaints from people who got the work on their land done either by private contractors or by the Government.  Even though it has been certified to have been done in accordance with the regulations, the grants are not being paid.  There is a great deal of delay.  I understand that there has been a certain amount of inquiry regarding the liability of the Government in respect of grants, and that they seem to be holding up the grants for some unspecified time. Farmers and contractors are at considerable loss and inconvenience owing to that.  In view of that, I would ask the Minister to carry out some sort of an inquiry.  I think that, when work on the land has been certified to have been done properly, the payments should be made promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would ask his colleagues in the Government to stop talking about agriculture.  He is responsible for the management of his own Department, and it is very embarrassing to have the Minister for Industry and Commerce making speeches and pronouncements in relation to agriculture and then being followed by the Minister for Agriculture himself.  We had the Taoiseach in this House on the 28th November last, saying that the land project should be operated by making the rich land richer and by ignoring the poor land.  The real purpose of the land project was to make the poor land better.  If there is any Deputy who considers that that is not a proper policy he should make his position clear.  The farmers with the rich land are in a position to invest money in it for the purpose of getting <Col N="1479" /> extra production, whereas it is the farmers with the poor land who need help.  Therefore, I hope we will have a clear statement from the Minister that he is not going to operate the policy which was laid down by the Taoiseach of making the rich land richer instead of making the poor land better.</P>
    <P>I think it was regrettable that the parish plan, which was envisaged by Deputy Dillon, was abolished.  I feel myself that the parish plan would have secured the organisation and development of agriculture, that it would have ensured a greater volume of agricultural production and a sound economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak in this debate at all. I am doing so because my patience has been exhausted listening to all the speeches we have had about agriculture.  I think it is about time&mdash; I do not care who takes exception to what I have to say&mdash;that we discussed matters in this House, ceased to play Party politics and refrained from personal abuse of each other.  I protest against that.  As an Irishman, first of all, I protest against the use of this House as a means of passing personal insults across to each other. Taking the statement that was issued by the Minister as to how we stand as regards our acreage under crops and our number of live stock, one would imagine, from the speeches made by some Deputies, that everything was well with agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have Deputies on both sides of the House boasting that they were responsible for any success that has been achieved in agriculture.  I suggest that Deputies on both sides of the House, and indeed every Deputy, should be ashamed when we find that our agriculture is in the position it is in 1952.  If anybody takes the trouble of reading the tables circulated by the Minister he will find that, as between 1939 and 1951, the number of milch cows in the country has declined by 80,807.  If we take the position in regard to young cattle under one year, we find that, over the same period, the <Col N="1480" /> number has declined by 48,573.  If we examine the number of sheep we have in the country we find that the number is 431,994 less than in 1939.  Our pig population is 372,947 less than it was in 1939.  We have 797,442 less poultry than we had in 1939.  When he is replying, the Minister can tell the House our acreage for 1952.  It is a sad thing that we have 84,375 acres less under wheat this year than we had in 1950.  Is the Minister or any member of this House satisfied that that state of affairs is good for this country? The sooner the Minister takes the people into his confidence, irrespective of their Party affiliations, and deals with agriculture as it deserves to be dealt with, the sooner we shall have some progress.  Would it be a foolish thing to spend £20,000,000 on the development of our agricultural industry to-day?  Does the Minister think that that is too extravagant a sum to spend on our agricultural industry? Anybody who has occasion to travel to different parts of this country cannot fail to notice the small amount of tillage.  We should be ashamed of ourselves and of the position in which the agricultural industry is to-day&mdash;and yet we hear one Party claiming credit for one thing and another Party claiming credit for something else.  The Minister has a grave responsibility to improve the position.  If the Government spends £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 on improving agriculture over the next few years they will have the support of the people who matter.  The Labour Party has always recognised agriculture as the main industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is doing its duty by the farming community? Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient money is lent by them to farmers for the development of their industry?  What are the figures? According to the latest figures which I could get for 1951, I find that they gave 766 loans to the value of £261,254. That represents just a little over £10,052 per county for the development of agriculture.  Who are the members of this Agricultural Credit Corporation and what is their function?  Their function is to lend money to the farmers <Col N="1481" /> and the present rate of interest is 6 per cent.  I suggest to the Minister, and the Minister can tell it to the Taoiseach, that it would be a good day for this country if we had a private session of the Dáil in order to discuss the financial system of this country. The time has arrived when the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture or any other responsible Minister will have to take the people of the country into their confidence.  Then we shall know where we are.  We should be masters of this House and of our country.  What is the present position? The Minister, as a Minister, does not function or govern.  Neither does the Minister behind him.  Neither has any Government in this country for the past 30 years.  The dictation comes from the people who control our money and our credit, and that cannot be denied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in a series of articles which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> in recent months on how to achieve the best production from the land.  I understand that these articles are to be printed in booklet <Col N="1483" /> form.  The Minister should co-operate in an effort to ensure that a copy of that booklet will be in every home in the country.  Every aspect of agriculture was discussed in these articles.  I should prefer to hear some of the men who wrote those articles speak in this House than have to listen to some of the foolish speeches which I have heard here in the past few days.  I congratulate the <i>Irish Times</i> on allowing the people to get an insight into the development of agriculture in this country.  I am not making little of what was said here by the Minister or by any Deputy but I consider that these articles are worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how many of our farmer Deputies are members of the co-operative societies in their respective counties.  If a farmer is to make any progress on his farm he will have to become a member of his local co-operative society.  If there is not a local co-operative society, he will have to establish one.  We hear a lot of talk about the price of potatoes, fruit, grain and so forth.  Is there anything as sad as to see a farmer thresh his grain and put it into bags and to have to send it then to Cork or Limerick or Dublin or to get a merchant to take it from him so that it will not rot on his hands?  Is there any reason why silos cannot be built around those co-operative societies among the farming community? The farmers could develop them themselves.  The farmers should assert themselves and prove their right to do their own work in their own way and in a profitable manner.  After all, nobody will deny that the marketing of goods is as important as their production, and at the moment we are just at the mercy of the combine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is dealing vigorously at all with the agricultural industry.  What we want is millions of pounds invested in the land. We have people leaving the land because they have not got the status which they are entitled to have.  It is disgraceful that farm workers producing the food of the nation work for 50 to 54 hours a week for less than £4 a week.  The value of the pound even <Col N="1484" /> before the Budget was introduced, was only 9/- by comparison with what it could purchase in 1938.  Yet we expect the men who are producing the food for the nation, highly-skilled men, to remain on the land at that miserable pittance.  The Minister is responsible to the nation for the progress of agriculture, and if he is prepared to deal vigorously with the problems involved, he will have the backing and support of the Labour Party for any measures he takes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the Deputies for the past two days discussing this Estimate for Agriculture, and I think I would be right in saying that I heard nothing more than I heard when I travelled down the country to committees of agriculture.  There was one thing that struck me, and I am sure it has struck other people in this House particularly in this year.  We have heard talk, not merely on this occasion, but on several occasions, about our production and the reasons for it, but it seems peculiar to me that even the Deputies would not recognise in this year that no Minister can be responsible for a bad year or for a good year.  It is our duty that even in this year we should be very thankful to Providence that we have had such a good year.  The weather has been suitable, we had greater production of milk, the crops appear to be good and, please God, we will have a good harvest.  It is not the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for that.  Neither is it nor was it the Minister for Agriculture in the past, who was responsible for any increase there might have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken this attitude on this occasion because I remember in 1948 when we were assessing the production of the country, 1946 and 1947 were held up by the then Government as being the years by which the yardstick was to be taken; in 1948 and 1949 we again had good years, but the Government then tried to claim that they were responsible for the increase which occurred in production.  That, in my opinion, is wrong.  If we have a good season we will have good crops and have good production, and if there is <Col N="1485" /> a bad one we are likely to have reductions.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the important point that in this good year we have been able to export our cattle at an earlier period.  We have a greater production of milk and consequently it will not be necessary for us to import butter in the coming year.  That is attributable to the good weather we have had.  But even in a year when the weather is bad we can try to minimise the dangers that may be there to avoid having a bad year and it is in this way that we produce more food from the land, that is, that we have more tillage. How often have you seen as you go through the country in a bad year the condition of the cattle, the condition of the cows during the winter? They are not going to give you the production, but you can minimise the reduction that may take place by feeding them better during the winter. Since I became Minister I have gone through practically every county and I have advocated more tillage, better feeding, better housing and in that way we can increase our production of milk and butter.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies again as far as our people are concerned, that we will have a sufficiency of bread and of flour for our people because we have advocated an increased acreage of wheat, again to minimise the dangers that might exist if the international situation grew worse, and it is likely to grow worse at any time.  We have no guarantee that there is not going to be a war but, supposing the worst came to the worst, how are our people going to exist if we do not produce the food at home?  Our policy is now&mdash;as it has always been in the past&mdash;that we must be as self-contained as possible if we are to retain our independence. I stressed these particular aims at every meeting I have attended: I want more wheat in order to ensure that our people will have a sufficiency of food; I want more beet so that our people will have more sugar; I want more barley, more oats, more potatoes grown in order to ensure that our cattle will be better fed, will grow to maturity earlier and will command a <Col N="1486" /> better price whether in the home or in the foreign market.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but while there is a lot in what he says, when it comes to the question of tillage as regards wheat, I would like him to make it a regional area so far as the growing of wheat is concerned.</P>

      <P>Regarding the production of wheat, not long after I came into office, having regard to the agitation I was engaged in myself in the spring of that year, asking for higher prices for wheat, even though I knew it was not going to bring one stone of wheat more into the mill I took steps in that direction.  Notwithstanding that it was then July and you could not have any more production at that particular time and in order to justify my own action and to justify the action of the people who had advocated a higher price, one of the first actions of this Government was to increase the price which was held out as an inducement to our people for the following year to produce more.  After the harvest, when we were making arrangements for the coming year, the 1952 crop, we again increased the price of wheat by 7/6 per barrel.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12 midnight until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd July, 1952.</P>
