    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to assist producers of hand-won turf by continuing the provision for bog road and drainage works, and by maintaining the turf marketing and publicity section of Bord na Móna which has been of very material assistance to private producers in the disposal of their turf.</P>
      <P>The unavoidably high cost of coal provides an assurance of a ready market for all good quality turf offered at a reasonable price.</P>

    <P>I have no information as to the comparable prices, quality for quality, charged for coal from these sources in 1951 but the average c.i.f. costs per ton of American, Polish and German coals <Col N="739" /> were £2 13s. 8d., £1 4s. 1d. and £1 4s. 0d. respectively higher than the average c.i.f. cost per ton of all British coals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will reconsider his decision not to make use of the provincial Press for advertising retail prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Advertisements concerning the controlled retail prices are ordinarily published in the morning daily papers.  On occasions, the evening newspapers are also selected for the publication of some of the advertisements, and the provincial Press is selected for the publication of others which have a particular local interest. I am satisfied that the existing arrangements are adequate to meet requirements and do not consider that it is necessary at present to make more extensive use of the provincial Press, but the position will be reconsidered from time to time in the light of prevailing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are many people, especially in the rural areas, who do not read the daily papers and the only source of news they have is the papers printed locally&mdash;the weekly provincial Press?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  The advertisements which were published recently were intended as much for the information of traders as for the information of the public.  If there should be evidence of a lack of knowledge of controlled prices in rural areas which could be rectified by the publication of advertisements in local papers, the position will be re-examined but the cost of advertisement in the local Press is quite considerable and it is necessary at the present time to try and avoid unnecessary cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, not all the advertisements appear in evening <Col N="740" /> papers, only advertisements relating to prices where it is considered important that they should be brought directly to the attention of those who are located in the areas where these newspapers are read.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the price of fresh meat has been increased by 4d. per lb. in many towns in the Midlands during the past few weeks and if the increase was sanctioned by him or if he will state what action he has taken or proposes taking in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Fresh meat prices are not controlled and, therefore, the question of sanctioning increases by me does not arise.  Since meat prices were decontrolled, the position has been kept under review, and I have not, as yet, any evidence that meat prices have moved out of line with cattle prices.  As I have stated already, the reimposition of control will be considered if the circumstances appear to call for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister defending this increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My information does not coincide with the Deputy's but there has been an increase in cattle prices and, in so far as I can ascertain from the information supplied to me as a result of departmental inspections, that increase in price has not, in some areas anyway, been passed on to the public, at least not by all shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not an extraordinary coincidence that this increase in prices has been imposed in many towns in the Midlands including several in my constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that this is the season of the year where meat prices are highest and that apart from any seasonal increase there <Col N="741" /> has been an increase in the price of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us details of the increase that has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that since the decontrol some shops have kept meat prices lower than the price of cattle would justify.  If we had had control, there would have been a general increase, while the decontrol has resulted in the situation which is now developing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will request the Prices Advisory Body to hold a public inquiry concerning the cause and effect of the increase in the price of hides since January, 1949, the amount of the increase received since that date by firms and persons engaged in the fresh meat trade and the percentage increase in the price of boots and shoes since the date mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by asking the Prices Advisory Body to hold a public inquiry into the matters referred to in the Deputy's question. I assume the Deputy has in mind the price payable for hides arising from the export trade in meat.  This position is under review at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has not sufficient information at his disposal why does he not refer the matter back to the Prices Advisory Tribunal since it was appointed for the purpose of advising the Minister on matters of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prices Advisory Body has nothing to do with it.  I fix the prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is in a position to confirm that certain hide and skin merchants are paying 2/6 per lb. for cattle hides and if he will take steps to ensure that many victuallers will not be forced to accept less than 1/- per lb. for similar hides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information to show that any hide and skin merchant is paying more than the agreed maximum price of 1/- per lb. for domestic cattle hides, nor am I in a position to ensure that this maximum price will always be obtainable by sellers of hides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no information on whether hides are being put through as export hides and receiving the rate of 2/6 per lb. from retail victuallers?  The report is that nearly 75 per cent. of hides from the tanneries are now being paid for at the rate of 2/6 per lb. which must effect an increase in the price of leather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that, in <Col N="748" /> recordings broadcast by the B.B.C. of the reading of the Proclamation of Accession of the new British Sovereign, she was described as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland; and, if so, whether the Government propose to take steps to refute the assumption of sovereignty by Britain over Ireland thus implied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be confusing the Proclamation of Accession of the new British Sovereign which was made in London with the form used in some Commonwealth countries.  No mention of Ireland was included in the London Proclamation of Accession, but in some Commonwealth countries and, later, when the styles and titles of Queen Elizabeth II were recited by the Garter King at Arms at the burial ceremony in Windsor, the British statutory form, which mentions Ireland, was used.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, of course, aware, the existing statutory form of royal title was adopted by British Royal Proclamation on the 22nd June, 1948, and during the past three and a half years has been in constant use by the British Government.  The assumption of sovereignty it implies is well known not to be accepted by the Irish people or the Irish Government.  In view of our Constitution, which clearly sets out wherein lies the sovereignty of Ireland, and of the obvious political facts, any more formal refutation would not seem likely at present to serve any effective purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Minister's answer, is the Minister not aware that on some broadcasts from the B.B.C. the Proclamation of Accession did include the term &ldquo;Queen of Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;that is, quite apart from whatever may have been said in Canada or elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer to London.  The Minister has added the word &ldquo;London&rdquo; of his own volition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has just now made that distinction and I want to say this to the Deputy that the fact that it was used in certain cases must not have come as a shock to him.  He knows that it was on 22nd June, 1948 that the present Royal Style and Title was proclaimed over in England.  He has seen documents delivered officially to himself in which the British Monarch described himself as &ldquo;King of Britain, Ireland and the Dominions beyond the Seas.&rdquo;  He received them officially.  So that it cannot be of any great surprise to him The fact is that the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; was not used in the London Declaration, that is, the British Home Declaration of Accession. It was used in certain of the Commonwealth countries&mdash;in some of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is either deliberately or mistakenly misunderstanding the supplementary question I put to him, which was, was he not aware that, apart from any proclamation that may have been read in Canada or elsewhere, the B.B.C. from its stations, not necessarily in London, but elsewhere in England, did read out a proclamation in terms that were different from the one which was published here.</P>

Four cases cannot be vested until the allottees become registered as owners of the county council cottages they occupy and this is a matter outside the control of the Land Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is grave discontent amongst the workers there due to the fact that, while the forestry centre in Cong is astride the border between the two counties, the greater portion of it is in County Mayo?  The difference is not so much and, in view of the fact that a great deal of discontent would be eliminated if the Mayo County Council rates were paid to them, I think the Minister should agree to that course.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <P>Incremental salary is payable in quarterly instalments but, where a teacher so desires, a payment on account is allowed after the end of each of the first two months of the quarter, the balance due for the quarter being payable after the close of the third month.  It is open to any teacher to request the Department to make a monthly advance of less than he would ordinarily receive so that the balance payable to him at the end of the quarter may be proportionately greater.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Glensaul school has not been in operation since 1st April last due to the difficulty experienced by the manager in securing the services of a qualified teacher.  The appointment of an untrained teacher has recently been sanctioned in a temporary capacity to the end of June next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Treen National School, it became necessary under the regulations to consider the withdrawal of grants from the school following the retirement of the principal teacher, as the average attendance had fallen below 20, and the school was situated at a distance of less than one mile and a half from another national school. It was found that all the children in <Col N="759" /> the Treen school district could without hardship attend neighbouring schools in the same parish, and it was decided that payment of grants to the school would not be warranted beyond the 21st December, 1951, the date of the closing of the school for Christmas vacation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Treen school, the Minister's information that the children who formerly attended this school will not undergo hardship by having to attend some other school, is not correct.  This is a mountainous district and the weather conditions, particularly in winter, have a very serious effect on the children. The regulations for the Gaeltacht, in my opinion, should be altered because it is unfortunately common knowledge amongst all of us that the population in these areas is dropping quickly.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies do not state the basis of their assumption that exported horses are exposed to cruelty.  I am as anxious as the Deputies to ensure that animals do not suffer from ill-treatment, but it does seem to me that the views expressed in certain quarters on this question are often founded less on a careful and objective study of the facts than on emotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a serious charge against other countries to imply that they are in <Col N="765" /> different to the point of callousness as regards the treatment of our horses. I have seen no evidence that this is the case.  A set of photographs of Irish horses exported to France has been sent to me recently but these photographs do not in fact reveal any concrete evidence that our horses are being treated with cruelty.</P>
    <P>On the question of the development of an export trade in horse meat in substitution for the export of live horses.  I have already pointed out to Deputy Cogan, in reply to the question he asked in this House on 18th July, 1951, that this raises a number of very important issues affecting the standing of this country as an exporter of high quality meat such as beef and mutton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am amazed to learn that the Minister has yet to be convinced in regard to the cruelty which horses suffer on export from this country.  I have photographs here in this envelope which I shall show to the Minister afterwards.  They prove conclusively that horses undergo the most terrible suffering and cruelty on export.  With reference to the second part of the Minister's reply, may I ask if he is prepared to help a properly organised trade for the export of horse meat?  The Minister has said that there are difficulties in the way.  We all know that there are difficulties.  Is the minister prepared to facilitate a properly organised and well-conducted factory to deal with the export of horse meat?</P>

    <Title>Vital Statistics and Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to improve the legal basis for the collection and publication of statistics of births, deaths and marriages and other vital statistics.  At present, the information obtained when births, deaths and marriages are registered is used for compiling some statistics but this information is not sufficient for the preparation of the detailed classified statistics which modern statistical methods make possible and which modern conditions require.  The Bill will enable more detailed vital statistics to be complied and will permit the specialised services <Col N="771" /> of the Central Statistics Office to be used for the collection and publication of these statistics.  Additional information can be sought at or after registration in relation to births, deaths and marriages, and for the first time information can be got about stillbirths or, as described in the Bill, foetal deaths.  Further extensions of the scope of this work are also provided for so that, for example, a survey of sickness may be undertaken or the results of schemes of medical treatment or immunisation may be assessed.</P>
      <P>This proposal to have power to get better information on the lives and health of the people is not founded on any desire on the part of the Government officiously to pry into private affairs.  Nowdays, when so much private and public money is spent annually on health services, it is obviously in the public interest that the value of these services and the lines of their future development should be assessable on the basis of accurate statistics.  Any information received from individuals in the compilation of the statistics will be kept strictly confidential by the officials concerned, disclosure being subject to severe penalties.  These safeguards are on similar lines to corresponding provisions in the Statistics Act, 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken to make other amendments of the births, deaths and marriages law, some of which dates back as far as 1844.  These amendments are in advance of codification which, I think, will have to be undertaken at a future date.  Of these amendments, the most important from the public point of view is, I think, the power to provide an abridged certificate of birth.  The actual form of this short certificate will be specified in regulations later and will probably contain details of the name, date of birth and sex only with, possibly, the place of birth of the person concerned. It is proposed to take power also to provide for a short form of death certificate or marriage certificate.  The full marriage certificate discloses parentage and a short from of this, similar in scope to the short birth certificate, <Col N="772" /> might be prescribed at a future date.  The full death certificate does not disclose parentage but contains detailed information which would not be required in all cases.  A short form of this might also be desirable and is provided for.</P>
    <P>I may mention that the power to issue the usual long certificate is not being interfered with, so that, when it is needed, for example, by the courts for identification purposes, etc., it may still be obtained.  I hope, however, that in time the short form of certificate, particularly the short birth certificate, will become the normal form, otherwise one of the primary purposes which the provision of this form of certificate has in view will be frustrated.  It may indeed be necessary to take steps to encourage the use of the short form.</P>
    <P>Ministers of the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church are authorised to issue licences for marriages and are entitled to collect fees from the contracting parties.  Maximum amounts for these fees are fixed in the Acts passed in 1844 and 1870, being at the rate of 5/- for a licence and 1/- for entering certificates in &ldquo;Marriage Notice Books.&rdquo;  It has been represented that these fees are inadequate nowadays and I am sure that Deputies will agree that this is so.  It is proposed, therefore, in the Bill to remove these limitations of 5/- and 1/- and leave the Churches to fix the fees themselves.  No State money is involved. The fees are paid by the contracting parties to the clergyman concerned. I think, therefore, that there is no call for the State to continue to fix a limit for these fees.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made that the other fees fixed in the births, deaths and marriages code may be altered, if thought desirable, by regulations made by the Minister for Health.  For the same reason, provision is included for altering the reduced fees for which certificates may be obtained under other legislation.  It is felt that the fixing by statute of fees of this kind for varying types of certificates results in an undesirable rigidity, and that there <Col N="773" /> should be power to vary such fees to meet changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The clerk of the poor law union was appointed in the old days as a matter of course to be superintendent registrar and to perform such duties as the checking of the registers of the local registrar, sending on particulars to the General Register Office, etc. With the alterations in the local government code and the replacement of the Poor Law Acts by the public assistance code, the power to appoint superintendent registrars on a permanent basis lapsed and, in recent years, only interim registrars could be appointed.  The opportunity is being taken of remedying this unsatisfactory state of affairs.  As vacancies arises the duty of acting as superintendent registrar will be assigned to the public assistance authority.  This makes no fundamental change except that instead of specifying a particular officer of a local authority the local authority itself, acting through its officers, will discharge the duties.  This provision brings the administration of the births, deaths and marriages code into line with modern procedure.  It means also that the local authorities will retain the fees paid to them for the benefit of the rates, and, furthermore, that the amounts paid to the superitendent registrars from the General Register Office Vote will diminish as vacancies occur and will, in time, disappear.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I think, be glad to note that the titles &ldquo;Registrar General&rdquo; and &ldquo;General Registrar Office&rdquo; are now to disappear and are to be replaced in future by their Irish equivalents, &ldquo;An tArd-Chlaraitheoir&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora.&rdquo; It is also proposed to enable the hours in which Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora will be open to the public to be modified by regulations instead of by statute and to remove the time limit of one year for correcting entries in the birth registers&mdash;a limit which has imposed hardship in some cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  We are told that <Col N="774" /> the chief reason for its introduction is to enable statistics to be more readily compiled and made available, but the astonishing part of it is that a very important change in one of the most essential parts of the life of the people of the country is being altered under that title.  Now, I am not in any way to be taken as prudish or of having any superiority complex or inferiority complex either one way or the other. On this matter, what I am going to mention is the question of short certificates; short certificates for births, short certificates for deaths and short certificates for marriages. This is, believe it or not, the beginning of the liberalistic mind in this country.  It is the opening up and the starting up of the liberalistic mind in Europe being put across in this House for the first time under vital statistics. This is not a Department in which I had any part.  I am not a shadow Minister for Health or anything like that, but I am an ordinary Deputy having positive views upon certain matters which are of the utmost importance to every person in this country.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be welcomed by a lot of cranks.  There is not a crank in the country who will not say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister.  Very well.  If he wants the approbation of those people, he can have it, and if what I am going to say will bring the reverse to me, I am prepared to take it and to stand up to it.  First, as regards the question of the short certificates.  The Minister was Minister for Agriculture, and he now proposes to do with the Irish people what he would not do with Coates's herd book.  He is going to show nothing as to who we are or where we came from or anything about us, and to legitimise everybody.  He is going to make every one of us illegitimate. Now, that may be hard talk. I hope it will not be misunderstood, but it is direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulation, shorten the marriage certificate, again forgetting that marriage in this country is a Sacrament, one that is regarded by the Irish people as being of the utmost importance.  Before the legislature here undertakes to cut away <Col N="775" /> existing things, he should tell us much more than he has told us as to what will be the result, and as to whether certain people in this country approve or disapprove.  Again, he tells us that he is going to assist the use of the short certificate, and that it is something that is to be admired.  Mind you, the Minister, his family and himself, they are very proud of their record in the books, and rightly so.  It has ever been the tradition of the people in this country to keep the record clean, to keep it straight so that we do know who everybody is.  But, as I have said, the liberalistic mind is taking effect, and the Minister for Health is taking this first step to break down our best, our ancient, tradition.</P>
    <P>Statistics are very important.  A Bill relating to them could be brought in, but we should leave matters of importance as they are.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill and carefully to reconsider the matter before proceeding further with it.  If he persists in it, and if the Government persist in proceeding with this Bill, well then, mind you, there is no Deputy in this House who will not have to take deep thought with himself and examine his own conscience very clearly upon the line which the Parliament of this country is about to undertake.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the attitude which Deputy MacEoin has taken up here to-day, and I am not surprised, without wishing to be personal, that during his term of office we did not have a Legal Adoption Bill brought into this Dáil.  I cannot understand how anybody would oppose a section in a Bill which would seek to try to release the illegitimate people in this country who are being ground under the present law as virtual lepers in society.  They are people who are admitted into the world but not into the Christian society in which we live.  It is no fault of theirs.  I simply cannot understand how anyone would oppose a section in this Bill which would propose to bring forward the short certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended to go further&mdash;I sup-hap <Col N="777" /> pose I am one of the cranks the Deputy has referred to&mdash;but I had intended to ask the Minister what steps were going to be taken, when the short and long certificates were introduced, to see that the short certificate in regard to births was accepted and used generally, and that the long certificate would be only available, or made available, in special cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;such as for marriage, in connection with the inheritance of property, or where it was necessary for legal purposes.  I fear that if the two certificates are brought in and if it is just as easy to obtain one as the other, everybody who can obtain the long certificate, human nature being what it is, will do so and the person who is unable to obtain the long certificate will be left amongst the few with the short certificate and, generally speaking, his lot will be no better than it is to-day.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties involved. I am quite aware that we must have the two certificates, that they are necessary, and I am not suggesting that there should not be two, but so far as the long certificate is concerned, only one copy should be made available and a considerable amount of trouble should have to be taken before a second copy should be made available and perhaps it should be made available only in cases of the loss of the original copy of the long certificate.  The short certificate should be easily available, and, in the case of all the universities, public institutions, competitive examinations and so on, it is always the short certificate that should be asked for.  I cannot understand the attitude of Deputy MacEoin.  I do not see anything wrong in trying to help these people, and if trying to relieve these people of the slur which they have inherited through no fault of their own is liberalism, I am certainly all for it.</P>

      <P>There is one matter I should like to understand.  For some years back I have followed with interest, as have many other Deputies, the agitation that has grown up, a well-founded agitation, with regard to the whole problem of legal adoption. It is important when discussing this Bill to realise that legal adoption has nothing whatever to do with it.  We are not concerned with that problem here.  We are concerned with a change proposed in the manner of registering births and I say: let us keep our powder dry until the Legal Adoption Bill is discussed here.  It is a Bill which will undoubtedly give rise to very grave consideration by this House.</P>
      <P>With regard to registration, I am by profession a lawyer and I suppose that as a lawyer, I am more concerned in my daily practice with this entire question of registration than with anything else.  For the life of me, I could never understand what measure of importance was to be attached to different certificates.  The only time a certificate is required is when full disclosure must be made with regard to a person's percentage.</P>

      <P>Birth certificates are required in relation to funds standing in court, payments to minors of their shares and a variety of matters which entail examination and a satisfying of a court of law as to the parentage of a particular minor or infant.  They are also required for many other legal matters.  There is no legal necessity for a birth certificate that I can think of that would be satisfied by what is referred to here as a short certificate. To my mind, this entire matter of the two kinds of certificates is merely a well-intentioned wish which was uttered some years ago and which has not been examined very properly.  I am afraid that it will achieve very little so far as the aim the Minister has in mind is concerned.  You may have your short certificate, but you will find that it certainly will not conceal or cloak what Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll has referred to as the slur of illegitimacy.</P>
      <P>Every time a certificate is required in our courts of law, the full certificate will be required.  Let there be no mistake about that.  If it is not required, if it is dispensed with, we will have the spectacle of an unfortunate mother or father having to go into the witness box to give evidence in a public court of law which will stigmatise a minor as illegitimate.  I say very seriously to the Minister that this matter has not been examined with all the care which should have been given to it.  I well appreciate the sentiments which Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has uttered, but again it seems to me that this is an action we are being rushed into, perhaps with the best of motives, which may and, I think, will, cause considerable harm to the interests that are attempted to be served.  I suggest that this is a matter that might well be committed for consideration to a Committee of the House.  It may be that, on consideration quietly by a Committee, some other way may be found of achieving what obviously is the intention.</P>

I suggest to the Minister in all seriousness, therefore, that this matter should be examined quietly by a Committee of this House.  We should consider it carefully from all aspects.</P>
      <P>I think it is regrettable that in the first six months of this Dáil this Bill should have been introduced as a precursor of the Legal Adoption Bill, that it should have been introduced as a result of a rather unfair newspaper publicity campaign indulged in in the last two years.  It makes me doubt whether consideration has been given to the Bill; it makes me doubt whether the Minister, in introducing the Bill, has reflected carefully on his step; and, as a practitioner at law, it makes me doubtful as to the efficacy of the proposal contained in the Bill.  I urge on the Minister to consider it very carefully.  The Minister is a doctor: he no doubt views this matter from a different point of view from mine, but I do say to him seriously that if he provides a short certificate here in this country, he will do considerable harm to the section the Bill is intended to help and he will achieve very, very little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy O'Higgins is labouring under some misapprehension. Probably what he calls his knowledge of the world is confined in the main to the law courts.  He is not aware that birth, marriage and death certificates are very widely used in the ordinary business of life.  Only yesterday I was assisting a widow to fill up her application for a widow's pension and I found that with her application she had to supply no less than seven certificates&mdash;those of her husband's birth, her own birth, her marriage and her husband's death, in addition to her children's birth certificates. Children at school have to provide birth certificates for academic examinations and for numbers of other <Col N="781" /> purposes.  Applicants for situations have in many cases to provide birth certificates.  There is a wide variety of ordinary administrative purposes in life for which these certificates are required.</P>
      <P>I would be for a simplification of the certificate and would even go further and suggest that there should be, if possible, a reduction in the charge for these certificates, especially when they are required by poor persons applying for the legal pension to which they may be entitled.  I think Deputy MacEoin made a rather foolish statement when he said this Bill would be welcomed by cranks.  I think it is more likely to be opposed by cranks and I think one cannot have a more cranky person than one who wants to investigate the parentage and other circumstances of his own neighbours.  The ordinary charitably minded person does not inquire into matters of this kind.  What Deputy MacEoin described as liberalism I would be more inclined to describe as Christian charity.</P>

Deputy MacEoin described this as a liberalistic approach and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll was surprised at that, but I am not surprised at Deputy MacEoin raising this issue.  I agree with Deputy Cogan that the approach to this Bill is, as he has said, an approach from the point of view of Christian charity. Deputy MacEoin's would be the pharisaical approach.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins talks about the full certificate being required in courts of law.  I quite realise that and, as I said in my opening speech, the long certificate will be always available as well as the short one.  However, the short certificate will certainly <Col N="782" /> suffice for many of the uses that a certificate is put to now, for many of the requirements under various Acts passed through this House.  I just have some things jotted down here of that kind. For instance, in education, a child is asked for a certificate of age when going for a primary certificate or for secondary examinations and again for university examinations.  No doubt the short certificate is quite all right there. It would also be quite all right for the issue of a passport and in seeking employment.  For instance, when the Civil Service Commissioners or other employers require proof of age the short certificate would do.  It would be all right again where questions of unemployment insurance arise, where age is sometimes a factor.  It would also do for national health insurance and, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, in the case of a widow's pension.</P>

Under the present law relating to widow's pensions, it makes a difference whether she is over 48 or not and I was speaking of the point where the widow had to prove her age and Deputy MacEoin said she would not have to prove she was married at all; in other words, to give this House an idea of the way legislation is tending since Deputy MacEoin left the Government.

I was mentioning some of the cases where the short certificate would suffice.  There are also cases where it is necessary for a boy or girl to prove <Col N="784" /> age in order to get a vote under the Representation of the People Acts and the short certificate would be quite all right there.  Then when people get old and want to prove age for the old age pension, the short certificate would do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it would if the other could not be found.  As far as the certificate issued by the Registrar-General is concerned, the short one would suffice.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy O'Higgins, who said that in courts of law a long certificate would always be required, I would like to say that, in any type of legal case, a long certificate, would, of course, be necessary because I take it that in law the issue of identifying a person would be very important.  In all those other cases where certificates have to be used very commonly and very often, a short certificate would be quite sufficient and I feel there would be plenty of use found for it.</P>

    <P>I think that the only point of importance that arose was the one made by Deputy O'Higgins with regard to the law courts.  I am in full agreement with him when he says that a long <Col N="785" /> certificate would be necessary, and the long certificate will be available.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I wonder could he give any indication of the approximate cost of the shorter form of certificate, because I feel that is the most important issue?  If there is to be any great difference in cost between the short and the long certificate people will naturally use the cheaper form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

It might be that if a committee of this House were set up to consider the matter the difficulty could be got over and other objections which people may have to the Bill could also be considered by the committee. I would strongly recommend that suggestion to the Minister.</P>

      <P>A total sum of £73,000 is required to meet additional expenditure on (1) development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers of turf (sub-head 1), and on (2) rural improvements schemes (sub-head K).  Savings on other sub-heads will amount to £38,000 so that the net additional sum required is £35,000.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of the policy to encourage the production of hand-won turf by private producers in the 1951 season, arrangements were made at a very early stage in the financial year to carry out the urgent bog development works for which reports and estimates of cost were already available.  During the course of the year reports were received on further works of equal urgency which could not be neglected without serious detriment to the turf production campaign. The sum of £90,000 originally provided under sub-head I was found to be quite insufficient to meet the cost of all the works which it has been necessary to carry out.  The total sum required in excess of the original provision is £48,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional amount required for rural improvement schemes is £25,000. In the year 1950-51 a large number of offers of grants under the scheme were accepted by the landholders at a late stage in the financial year.  Because of this, and also due to the effect of bad weather in slowing up the execution of works during the winter of 1950-51, there was an abnormally heavy commitment against the sub-head at the beginning of the current financial year <Col N="789" /> in respect of uncompleted works.  The provision of £125,000 for 1951-52 was found to be insufficient to clear off this commitment, and at the same time to meet the cost of new schemes for which there has been a continuing heavy demand during the current financial year.</P>

      <P>I listened with some surprise a few days ago, and previously to the Parliamentary Secretary-probably also to his predecessor-stating that he had not received certain applications which had been sent into his Department.  This happened in one case where I was concerned some time ago.  I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary can get up in the House and give that kind of answer to a Deputy who has a postcard from his Department acknowledging receipt of a particular application.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether there is a special register kept of all the applications in his Department; if so, how many of these still remain to be examined even at the end of a fairly lengthy period.  I think <Col N="790" /> there is no justifiable explanation, at least no justifiable explanation can be given to me for the failure of the Department concerned to examine applications that have been sent in a year or two ago.  I would like to know if there are many such applications awaiting examination or whether all these cases are now being provided for under the Supplementary Estimate introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that in my constituency of North Mayo there are quite a number of applicants under the rural improvement schemes who have made applications as far back as 12 months or in some cases 18 months ago and I feel that when delay occurs under a scheme like the rural improvement scheme there is something wrong.  I would like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that these rural improvement works are very important works particularly in an area like North Mayo where you have a considerable number of unemployed persons who have to migrate.  Meeting some of my constituents recently I came across quite a number of such cases.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take this matter up with his officials with a view to having these works speeded up.  It is only fair to say about his officials that when I visited the rural improvements department in Dublin I found nothing but courtesy in that department; but I have been told that some of these works have been held up due to scarcity of money.  Therefore, if the voting of this sum here to-day will speed up these works, I am certainly with it.  In regard to turf production was the money for improvement of roads?</P>

      <P>I would like also to say that in a recent discussion by the Mayo Country Council it was emphasised by members of the various political groups there that the people in Mayo generally, North and South, were most anxious to contribute to the national pool of turf by way of producing turf by private methods.  I think that in an area like North Mayo, where many people have to migrate, we must also consider that due to family circumstances there are many who cannot migrate.  They may have a couple of acres of bog and the father of a family whose children may be young may not be free to go across to England or take up permanent employment even locally.  The production of turf by private methods could supplement that uneconomic holder's income. A man, by cutting, saving and stacking on the roadside a couple of stacks of turf may reap a harvest of turf that would bring him in £50 or £100.  That, I respectfully submit to the Parliamentary Secretary, is a very useful thing and a very useful sum of money to a man who has an uneconomic holding.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the picture, from the point of view of making sure of adequate supplies of turf for our requirements for the winter, it will also be a great help in building up our reserves.</P>
      <P>I appeal very earnestly to the Parliamentary Secretary to give us special consideration in that regard in Mayo generally.  In many parts of Crossmolina and Ballycroy there are large tracts of bog out of which it is quite impossible for the tenants to haul turf because of the bad condition of the roads.  That applies to many areas in Mayo, areas too numerous to mention. If the Parliamentary Secretary gives us a little consideration in the matter of improving these bog roads he can rest assured that the people in my part of the country will be quite prepared to take off their coats and work hard to produce the greatest possible amount of good quality hand-won turf. I earnestly appeal to him to do what he can for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that this Supplementary Estimate will be sufficient to <Col N="792" /> do the job satisfactorily.  In North Tipperary we have large tracts of bog in the hands of private owners.  These owners find it impossible to get at their turbary because of the bad conditions of the roads and because of lack of proper drainage.  Deputy Davin raised the question last week as regards complaints about applications. As far as I recollect I sent up a number of applications for the drainage of a bog held by about 25 tenants.  I got a blue card in reply stating that the matter was receiving attention but so far nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>I hope the money voted now will be adequate for the work that has to be carried out.  I know plenty of people who, if the roads and bogs were properly maintained, would be more than willing to cut turf because it would be a great help to them in making a living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood by the Parliamentary Secretary in view of what the last speaker has said.  I intervened, as possibly Deputy Fanning knows, some considerable time ago in the case of the O'Meara application.  Reference was made to that here last week by the Parliamentary Secretary.  This bog is right over the border of Laoighis-Offaly in the adjoining parish and I cannot understand why it has taken so long to have that application properly investigated or an inspector sent down; nor can I understand the delay in sanctioning an urgent scheme of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of turf production I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give high priority to all applications for drainage and accommodation roads to bogs.  This is a matter of urgency now.  A good deal has been said about the delay in dealing with applications.  To some extent I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Office of Public Works because very often when everything has been done a scheme falls through for some reason or other.  I think that happens in a great number of cases.  Something should be done to ensure that once a scheme has been prepared at the request of the affected parties it will not be allowed to fall <Col N="793" /> through.  I realise that this may be a difficult and a delicate matter.  Very often when people discover what the cost of the scheme will be one or two of the affected parties may refuse to contribute.  That is very unfortunate and I think that is a matter that should be examined with a view to implementing some scheme which will persuade such people to fall into line in order to avoid the injury they can now do to those who want a scheme, the cost to the State and the injustice in many cases inflicted upon the other applicants. Very often the person who would derive the greatest benefit is in favour of going ahead with the scheme and quite prepared to contribute to it while the person who happens to be nearest to the public road and who will not, therefore, derive much benefit will be against the scheme.</P>

      <P>Points were raised by Deputy Davin and Deputy Fanning in relation to applications that they contend&mdash;and I am sure they are correct in their contention&mdash;were made.  In my reply a week ago I stated that from the information set out in the question these applications could not be traced. That happens quite often.  It is possible that applications were made but unfortunately they were not made on the prescribed forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy interested in bog development, minor employment schemes or rural improvement schemes should understand that there are special prescribed forms in the Office of Public Works obtainable by Deputies or private individuals for the purpose of making applications in the proper manner.  These forms are quite simple.  They set out the county, the rural district, the townland, the nature of the work, the number of people concerned and the name of the person who will act as correspondent for the people.  If my memory serves me aright, all these forms are numbered and when the applications are sent in it is quite easy to have them filed county by county and rural district by rural district.  In that case there is no question of their being lost.  Many Deputies, however, just write an ordinary <Col N="794" /> letter pointing out that there is a bog at a certain place.  They very often apply the local term which may not be the term on the ordnance survey sheet or on the map.  If they looked up the instructions sent out with the forms and followed those instructions, there would be no question of their application being subsequently lost or mislaid.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the delay in the inspection of schemes submitted.  As far as the Office of Public Works is concerned there is no avoidable delay.  Last year this question of providing money for bog development for bogs in the hands of private producers came to the forefront about the month of February and £90,000 was provided in the Estimate for the year 1951-52 for that purpose. A large portion of that money was allocated fairly early on and in order to do the work and get off to an early start it was necessary for the people concerned in the Special Employment Schemes Office to go through schemes that had been submitted about two years previously in order to find out which schemes could be dealt with most expeditiously and which would give the speediest return.  As time went on it was found that there were other schemes of an urgent nature on which reports later became available and it was then discovered that the £90,000 was exhausted.  In order to do the other schemes that had been vetted, examined and approved fresh money was required.  A certain amount of money, £30,000, was got from savings under other sub-heads.  We now require more money both for bog development schemes and rural improvement schemes and that is what we are asking for in this Supplementary Estimate and I expect we will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara mentioned the rural improvement schemes.  Our inspectorial staff was not up to their required number until quite recently, particularly in County Mayo.  In view of the urgency of going ahead with bog development schemes, the inspectors were switched over to bog development for a considerable time.  It was only in the latter part of the year 1951 that they were switched over to examining <Col N="795" /> the rural improvement schemes.  It was held that rural improvement schemes, principally the construction of roads to villages, could be more easily carried out than bog development schemes which are usually carried out in the fine period of the year.  The staff has been brought up to strength now.  I expect that the work will be speeded up and that there will be less delay.</P>
    <P>As far as bog development works of this kind are concerned, I am very glad that the Deputies are anxious about them.  I am anxious about them myself because I know quite well what it means to have a bad road going into a bog and to have to take advantage of the period of the year which has the finest weather in order to try to get out the turf and neglect the other crops as a result.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;I believe it is Government policy too&mdash;I will give every assistance, but there are certain difficulties.  The examination of all the schemes cannot be done in one year but we propose to carry on and do the most worth while schemes and, if possible, give preference to bogs where turf is produced for commercial use, that is, where turf is produced by the local people to supply the needs of the local towns.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £75,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for sundry Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services, including Grants.</P>
      <P>There are three sub-heads under which this supplementary amount is necessary: Number one, grants under the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Acts; number two, the welfare of the blind, and number three, the supply of fuel to necessitous families.  A State grant of £10,000 is provided in the Estimate for school meals in the Gaeltacht under the Acts passed in 1930 and 1933.  The county councils of Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo are recouped a portion of their expenditure on meals in the schools in the area set out in the Schedule to the Act of 1930.  The amount allocated to each county is allocated on the basis of the aggregate attendance of pupils in the scheduled schools and it was estimated in the beginning of the year that £10,000 would cover this but it was found that £10,000 was not sufficient and hence I am asking the Dáil for an amount of £750. Donegal in particular has a higher expenditure than was anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second subject, the welfare of the blind, grants are made to certain institutions which look after the blind.  There are various institutions, seven in all, and in these institutions there are about 400 inmates.  A certain capitation grant is made to these institutions according to the &ldquo;attendance,&rdquo; as it is called, of the inmates. During the year it was found necessary to increase the grant <Col N="799" /> in certain cases on account of the increased cost of these institutions and under that head I am asking £1,750.</P>
    <P>The biggest amount, however, is required under the fuel scheme head. There is a free or subsidised fuel scheme for certain beneficiaries in cities or large towns.  It applies to the following categories: first of all, those who are in receipt of home assistance; next, old age pensioners, blind pensioners and those in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions; third, people in receipt of unemployment assistance, and fourth, people of low income.  In summer time they get a half cwt. of turf per week and in winter one cwt. The benefits vary: in the case of home assistance they get the fuel free; in the case of old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans they get it for 6d. per cwt.; the unemployment assistance class get it for 1/- per cwt. and those of low income have to pay 2/- for a cwt. of turf.</P>
    <P>I, in my anxiety to balance the Budget, increased those prices early in the winter but I was persuaded after a few months to go back to the old charges which had been in operation since, I think, 1945 and these are the charges that will remain.  The increase is due to many factors, the first being that turf is dearer than it was in previous winters&mdash;we use machine-won turf as far as possible&mdash;and the second that we had to go further away for the turf in some cases and therefore the haulage was increased.  A third factor is that the scheme was availed of to a larger extent than was anticipated, the result being that it will cost £49,000 more than was anticipated.  In addition Dublin Corporation would like to carry a stock of turf which will cost £31,000 and that £49,000 and £31,000 make a total of £80,000 which is the amount now asked.  There is an Appropriation-in-Aid. When we were making out the Estimate for Gaeltacht meals we thought that bread, butter and other materials would cost more in the last year.  They did cost more but not as much as we estimated and consequently there is a certain saving under that sub-head, the result being that the net amount required is £75,000.</P>

      <P>I am sure that nobody will object to giving the Minister what he has asked.  What surprises me is that he did not ask more to enable some relief to be given to people in receipt of national health, unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefits.  We do not realise the straits these people are in.  Take a man with 22/6 per week and 7/6 for his wife making 30/-.  He falls ill and is unemployed.  Work that sum out into meals; it makes 3/2 per day or about 1/- per meal.  He cannot do without some firing, he must pay for light and surely he needs something to put on his body as clothing.  We sit here without thinking that these people are in straits.  They are.  I am surprised that the Minister did not think of those people and of giving them sufficient to meet the increased cost of living.  I am sure that nobody in this House would object to giving assistance to those people and I would suggest that the Minister consider the matter.</P>

With very little hesitation he agreed to go back to the previous prices and I think that was only what we expected of him.  He did an amount of good when he agreed to that.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department should see that tenders are invited in all cases for the fuel scheme.  We have trouble in Cork over this scheme.  It would be as well, I think, for me not to say anything more at this time but his Department should always insist on getting tenders for those schemes.</P>

      <P>With regard to the £31,000 the corporation thought that they should carry a stock.  It is to be used by the end of this winter though it is quite possible that some may be carried over the end of the financial year.  There will, I presume, be some stock there on 31st March.  To that extent, of course, we are providing money in this Vote which we will have a saving against, perhaps, next year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the price that Deputy McGrath spoke about, I tried to keep the grant the same as it was last year, that is, with the increasing price of turf, that the recipient would bear a certain higher proportion of it than he had been bearing. Then I found, when I met these softhearted Deputies from Dublin and Cork, that I had been too severe, if you like, on these recipients and I went back to the old price as far as they were concerned, which meant, of course, a much bigger burden on the local authorities which was passed on to the central Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey raised a point that <Col N="802" /> it does not specifically apply&mdash;it is quite true&mdash;to the recipients of unemployment insurance or sickness benefit but it does indirectly apply, I should remind the Deputy, because, if they are, for instance, in receipt of home assistance, as many recipients of unemployment insurance and sickness benefit are, then they would be entitled to the free fuel or they could be even classed as persons of low income and then they would also be entitled to cheap fuel.  However, I do hope that when we bring in our Social Welfare Bill in the near future we will do something substantial for these classes by giving them better benefits than they have at the moment, because we all recognise that the benefits they are receiving at the moment are not adequate to maintain them.  I think it would be a better and more permanent way of dealing with the classes that Deputy Hickey and Deputy McGrath have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £650,200 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>I think the House is aware that by a transfer of functions Order the administration of food subsidies has become the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce whereas formerly it was the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the original Estimate for the flour and bread subsidy was being prepared in the Department of Agriculture prior to the commencement of the financial year, it was calculated that a sum of £7,400,000 would be required. That Estimate of the Department of Agriculture went to the Cabinet Sub-Committee which the previous Government <Col N="803" /> had set up to review Estimates and was there written down to £7,000,000.  The original Estimate for £7,400,000 prepared in the Department of Agriculture assumed that the deliveries of subsidised and unsubsidised flours during the years would be much the same as in the previous year and that the cost of both native and imported wheat would remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Cabinet Sub-Committee to knock £400,000 off the Estimate was partly due to a decision to take out of it certain payments due to the flour millers and to incorporate them in a Supplementary Estimate which was introduced before the beginning of the financial year and partly due apparently to a tentative decision to revise the bread rationing scheme involving a reduction of rations in some instances and consequently reduced deliveries of subsidised flours.</P>
    <P>Whatever may have been intended in that regard, in fact, no action to put it into effect was initiated.  However, as it turned out, the Estimate prepared in the Department of Agriculture was more accurate than the Estimate prepared by the Cabinet Sub-Committee. As might have been anticipated, the cost of imported wheat rose steadily during the year and, on that account alone, the original Estimate of £7,400,000 would have had to be reinstated.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, however, it was decided, when the 1951 Wheat Order was made, to increase the guaranteed price for native wheat by 6s. 6d. a barrel and that added a further £250,000 to the cost of the flour subsidy in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the flour and bread subsidy will therefore be £7,650,000 and not the £7,000,000 provided in the Book of Estimates and hence a Supplementary Estimate for £650,000 is required.</P>

The original Estimate for the total cost of the subsidy was prepared in the Department of Agriculture and it is in the Book of Estimates as £7,000,000.</P>

That figure includes the payments that have been made out of the Industry and Commerce Vote after the transfer of functions.  A further £650,000 has to be provided.  I hope I have made it clear.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point which I want to raise with the Minister.  The Minister is aware that it is not a new thing.  There has been considerable dissatisfaction for some time amongst provincial bakeries.  The provincial bakeries find themselves in the position that Dublin bakeries are able to go down and muscle in, so to speak, on their territory and sell bread in these districts because of the arrangements that exist in regard to the sale of bread in <Col N="806" /> Dublin.  It does appear somewhat unfair to the provincial bakeries concerned that they are in the position of having the whole of their ration taken up in the ordinary way in the rural areas while in Dublin the ration is not used up with the result that the Dublin bakeries are able to send out the surplus bread from the city to country areas.</P>
      <P>I am not so innocent as to suggest that this is a problem which can be easily solved&mdash;I quite see the difficulties involved in it&mdash;but it might be possible to strike a ration in the cities commensurate with the demand and similarly to strike a ration in the rural areas commensurate with the demand there.  It is common knowledge that people in the country use much more bread than people living in Dublin. Probably it is the effect of fresh air, country life and so forth.  In the case of the city bakeries, however, there seems to be always a surplus which they can sell in rural areas at the subsidised price and at the expense of provincial bakeries.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the country people should have that additional supply taken away from them.  I think that the supply should be there but that it should be made available through the country bakeries.  As I say, I realise that it is a problem which cannot be easily solved but the situation at present is such that many provincial bakeries are in grave danger of having to close down and I do not think that would be a result that the Minister would like to see brought about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several recommendations.  Has anything been done to carry any of them into effect? I know that in one of the recommendations, they pointed out that £150,000 was allowed to the milling industry for depreciation while only <Col N="807" /> about £90,000 was shown in their reports.  Is the Government going to do anything at all in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring the position of bakeries in rural towns and villages before the Minister.  The proprietors of these concerns have made repeated complaints to me that their business has been very adversely affected by the present regulations in regard to the distribution of flour. The city bakeries, in the City of Cork in particular, find that the full quantity of flour issued to them is not being used within the cities.  As a matter of fact I understand the bakers in the cities are running a blackmarket in the sale of flour on some occasions to rural bakeries as it would appear that rural bakers have not sufficient flour.  There is a wide difference between the appetite of a man who goes out ploughing the soil of a field in the early morning and that of the city joker who dodges around for a few hours pretending to work.  One result of that is that the city bakers are pushing further and further into the rural districts to find a market for their spare bread.  One finds if one is dealing with a rural baker, that one is confined to one's ration but if one is dealing with a city baker, one gets all one wants because they have always a quantity of spare bread on hands.  I mentioned this matter last year but no change has been made since.  I would suggest to the Minister that the matter should be looked into now with a view to having a different ration for rural bakers as distinct from bakers baking purely for city consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the Minister's statement that £34 per ton is being paid for foreign wheat now, and in view of the absolute necessity of getting wheat grown in this country, I would point out that £34 a ton represents 85/- a barrel.  I think he should bear that in mind in regard to the price at present being paid to the Irish farmer.  We do not know what the price of foreign wheat will be next harvest.  Unless a bigger move is made within the next month, I am afraid the acreage under wheat will be down next harvest instead of being up. <Col N="808" /> I would urge on the Minister, therefore, that the price paid to the Irish farmer should be somewhere in or around the price paid for wheat which has to be imported.  It is £34 a ton to-day&mdash;that is, I take it, for wheat got from inside the wheat pool&mdash;but if our production of wheat goes down further, that can easily be £45 per ton if we have to buy it in the open market.  I would, therefore, urge on the Minister before it is too late to endeavour to see that the price paid to the Irish farmer is increased and that our Irish farmers will get the same opportunity as foreigners of supplying the market for an essential product in this country, namely, bread for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House but I want to make just one or two observations in connection with this Estimate.  I think that there is one aspect of flour distribution with which the Minister should seriously concern himself.  There is, first of all, the question of the jute bags in which flour is distributed, at least throughout rural Ireland.  In the first instance, I submit that there is a considerable waste in these sacks because if a sack becomes damp the flour is inclined to adhere to the sack.  In that way alone there is a considerable amount of waste.  A still worse feature is that the jute sack, as Deputies all know, is inclined to collect dust and dirt and naturally the flour emptied out of such sacks cannot be clean.  Any person who is engaged in business must realise that flour is transported in lorries and railway wagons and that, sometimes, there is turf mould and other dirt on the bodies of these lorries and wagons with the result that sometimes a considerable amount of dirt accumulates on the sacks.  There is the further point that, generally, merchants do not take the precaution of cleaning these sacks.  Therefore, even with the best of intentions, it can happen that there can be a considerable amount of dirt in the flour.  I think, too, that it should be compulsory on bakers to wrap every loaf of bread.  It is a shame to see bread handled in the way it is handled in this year of 1952.  I hope the Minister will look into these <Col N="809" /> matters from the point of view of the public health and the well-being of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the enormous amount of money involved in this Estimate, I think that a most searching inquiry should be made into the profits of all the people who are engaged in the handling of wheat, from the time it is brought ashore in this country or from the time it leaves the farmer's haggard until it reaches the consumer. Rightly or wrongly, there is a widespread feeling that those who are engaged in the milling business and in the large-scale bakery business are making fairly substantial profits. Deputy Corry spoke about the Cork bakeries.  The Dublin bakeries supply bread in most of the provincial towns in Leinster and I fear that they compete unfairly with the local bakers.</P>
      <P>I think that there should, perhaps, be some adjustment in the rationing system.  It is generally accepted that the consumption of bread per head in rural areas is greater than that in the cities.  The number of hotels and restaurants, and so forth, which operate in the city may help somewhat to explain the difference together with the reason which Deputy Corry has suggested, namely, that the appetites of manual workers in the fields are greater than the appetites of city people who lead sedentary lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to inquire into the price which it is likely that this country will have to pay for imported wheat during the coming 12 months.  The Minister has mentioned a figure of £34 per ton but we may have to pay a higher figure than that.  At present, the Irish farmer is getting £30 per ton for his wheat.  I am aware that the Minister will point out that the imported wheat has a lower moisture content than the home-grown wheat.  As against that, however, I would stress the point that before the end of the year it may be that we shall have to pay much more for our imported wheat. The price may be very substantially increased or the supply may not be available.  For that reason, I think there is need to consider the desirability <Col N="810" /> of stepping-up the price somewhat of home-grown wheat so as to compare at least with the price that is paid at present for imported wheat. I think that that is a very urgent and important matter and that the Government should devote their immediate and concentrated attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that Deputies on all sides of the House are unanimous in expressing the desire that the Minister should apply himself particularly to the problem of the city bakeries which have the advantage that their city customers do not consume their entire ration and that they can, therefore, compete unfairly with the small town bakery by selling the surplus bread in these small towns.  The reasons why country folk consume more bread than city dwellers are quite apparent to all Deputies in the House.  We appreciate the administrative difficulties with which the Minister will have to contend in dealing with this problem. Nevertheless, the existence of such unfair competition in the business life of the community is surely deserving of the very best application of the Minister and his Department towards finding a solution of the problem.  I hope he will be successful in overcoming that difficulty.</P>
      <P>I join with other Deputies of the House in appealing to the Minister to extend to the farmers a price which will induce them to grow the wheat which is so badly needed in present circumstances.  I appeal to him also to bear in mind the fact that the farmers of this country, and particularly the southern farmers, suffered greatly last year from the wheat midge with the result that the return per acre was much lower than it should have been and that, consequently, they will need a price inducement this year to produce the food which is so urgently required.</P>

      <P>The difficulties and complaints of the provincial bakers have recently been brought to my attention by deputations which expressed them to officers of my Department.  The complaints of these provincial bakers <Col N="811" /> are more apparent than real.  The provincial baker can get all the flour he requires to sell all the bread for which he can get customers within the rationing scheme.  If a baker is losing trade, it is because his customers prefer some other bread to his.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;and there is no doubt that if rationing were abolished, and Government control of flour deliveries removed so that normal prewar competition could develop amongst bakeries again, the position of the provincial baker would be worse than it is now.  He is protected, to some extent; by the existence of rationing&mdash; by the obligation on all bakers to conform to the requirements of the rationing scheme.  If that ended, and if the competition were restored, the position of the small provincial baker, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the better-equipped and larger city bakery, would be much weaker.  If he is losing trade now, it is because his customers prefer to buy bread from the city baker rather than his bread. His complaint is that the city baker is in a position to supply bread because of the operation of the rationing scheme in the city area.  Nevertheless, remember that I said if controls are removed the city baker can deliver more bread than he is selling now in the provincial baker's area, and it has to be assumed, having regard to the transfer of trade which has taken place, that he would get sale for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should operate the rationing scheme solely to preserve the provincial baker from competition. That is, in fact, what they have in mind&mdash;that this scheme should be so administered that nobody could sell bread in their area so long as they are producing less than their maximum. Certainly the rationing scheme does not operate with absolute fairness; it never could.  One of the arguments for getting rid of bread rationing is that very fact.  I do not think we can remedy the situation, however, by cutting down the ration in Dublin and increasing it in the country.  It may <Col N="812" /> be that some people in Dublin can buy more bread under the rationing scheme than they require.  But it is also true that there are many people in Dublin who are buying up to the full amount of the ration and would buy more if they were permitted to do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned primarily with meeting the needs of the rural consumer rather than with the effect of the regulation upon traders.  May I remind the House that the operation of the harvest rationing scheme was considerably extended by my Order last year; the additional rations being made available over a longer period?  I would not like to hold out any immediate prospect of relieving the position of the provincial bakers by increasing the ration generally.  As the House is learning now, the subsidy upon flour and bread is costing the taxpayer £7,650,000.  Any increase in the ration will increase the cost of the subsidy and an increase would not be worth while making unless it was a substantial one in which case the increased cost to the Exchequer would be substantial also.</P>

      <P>If anybody shows me that some baker persistently sells bread outside the ration regulations, giving people more than the rations, then that baker is committing an offence and will be prosecuted.  May I ask that that statement will not be applied too literally?  There was always under the rationing scheme a certain amount of elasticity and, in fact, no bread rationing scheme could be operated unless you recognise the need for it.  But the position of the provincial baker cannot be improved by anything I can do.  The only way for him to get more sale for his bread is to produce the kind of bread that the public in his area wants to buy.</P>

Might I again remind Deputies that, so far as the provincial baker is concerned, he is to some extent protected by the existence of the rationing regulations, a protection which would be withdrawn if rationing ceased?  A number of provincial bakers admitted that they realised they would be up against more intense competition if rationing ended.</P>

      <P>That is not true of all provincial bakers.  Some of the best bakers in Ireland are provincial bakers and they are also extending their trade.  We could not deal with the situation, as has been suggested, by cutting down the city ration.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, there is a standard grist prepared by Grain Importers and every miller gets the same quality and can produce the same quality of flour.  As far as the baker is concerned, he can buy flour from any miller who will supply him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do deny that. Deputy Hickey referred to the Lavery Committee on the flour-milling industry.  He will remember that when that report was published it was accompanied by a mimeographed document from the Minister for Agriculture indicating that the Government of the day had accepted and put into effect some recommendations, had rejected other recommendations and had some few under consideration.  The Deputy referred particularly to the question of depreciation.  One of the observations made by the Lavery Committee was that in the arrangements for the remuneration of the milling industry there is allowed depreciation at a higher rate than the Revenue Commissioners allow them for tax purposes.  I do not think there is much in that.  It is true that in every business at the present time the tax-free allowance for depreciation under the Revenue Commissioners' administration is less than any prudent business management <Col N="816" /> would regard as necessary to set aside for that purpose.  In so far as the cost of the replacement of equipment now is much greater than its original cost, any firm would find it prudent to make an appropriation from profits for the purpose of depreciation considerably above what the Revenue Commissioners would allow for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They make a certain allowance for that in their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the only difference between the present arrangement and that suggested by the Lavery Commission would be to alter the division of the total amount allowed to the milling industry between gross profits and depreciation.  That, in my opinion, would not alter the total amount at all, so that if we were to cut the depreciation allowance, as calculated by the Revenue Commissioners, we would then have to increase the total remuneration of the industry, thereby enabling it to appropriate to depreciation reserves what would be regarded as a reasonable allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Cogan need have any anxiety about the investigation of the costs and profits arising out of the handling of wheat and flour because, in effect, these costs are met and these profits are provided by the taxpayer out of the Exchequer.  The Deputy can be quite certain of this, that they are being continuously investigated, and that any variations in cost, which appear to justify a revision of the present arrangement for the remuneration of the industry, are immediately seized upon, generally with the idea of saving the Exchequer unnecessary expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of wheat prices, I hope I have not misled the Dáil.  The present price fixed for Irish wheat is higher than world price.  It certainly is far higher than that received by the farmers whose wheat we import. The price guaranteed to the Irish farmer on the farm should not be compared with the price of foreign wheat <Col N="817" /> delivered to the mills here.  It is quite obvious, when one has regard to transport and handling charges, that the present price received by the Irish farmer for wheat is much above the price received by the Canadian or Australian farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the price of imported wheat this year is going to be I do not know.  A new wheat agreement will have to be negotiated when the present agreement expires, and it is anybody's guess whether that agreement will involve us in a higher price for wheat or not.  Against that, there is evidence that shipping freights are going to fall, and that, consequently, the landed price of wheat may be reduced on that account.  I think we have got to watch the position carefully. The problem relating to wheat is that the total world supply this year looks like being down very much, and if we are unable to expand our own production we may not be able to get more wheat from abroad.  We may, in fact, find ourselves in the position in which we will not get as much wheat from abroad as we are getting at present.  Not merely is the total supply this year being contracted by reduced production in Australia and a severe drought in the Argentine, but, of course, there are far more people looking for wheat now than there were when the original agreement was made. Therefore, the position looks very much like this, that if we do not get an increase in the acreage under wheat here this year we may have to cut the ration, and that would be a very undesirable situation to have to face.</P>

Not even my officials could tell me, as regards questions which arose for decision, whether they were the concern of my Department or the Department of Agriculture.  The whole thing was so higgledy-piggledy that it was obvious that the administration of the flour and bread subsidies, and their distribution, should be under one Department.

    <P>That in order to achieve a balanced economy for smallholders resident in Gaeltacht areas and with a view to implementing the Government's stated policy for taking all steps necessary for the revival of the Irish language, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Minister for Agriculture should fix a guaranteed economic price to be given in respect of the <Col N="819" /> total output of tomatoes from Connemara and other Gaeltacht areas for this coming year.&mdash;(Deputies MacBride and Tully.)</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The only one we have had in this country.  As a member of that Coalition, it was surely within his power to advise the then Minister for Agriculture that, instead of killing the tomato industry, he should do something to improve it.  But, instead of helping the tomato growers here, the then Minister for Agriculture went out of his way, as did the Coalition Government generally, to kill tomato growing. That is evidenced by the fact that there was a reduction in the incomes of our people engaged in the production of tomatoes.  In 1947 the Fianna Fáil Government experimented in the production of tomatoes.  A number of houses were erected in Donegal and Connemara.  Unfortunately for the tomato growers, that Government went out of office in 1948, but the provisions laid down in regard to the experiments held good for the year 1948.  They could not be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the experiments are shown in the records we have of the amount of money received by the owners of the glass-houses in that year. The Connemara houses in the year 1948 gave a return of £84 15s. 8d. per house.  The return in Donegal was £63 10s. 0d.  But, in order to kill the scheme, the protection that was given to the tomato growers was withdrawn in 1949, with the result that the income of tomato growers in Connemara dropped from £84 15s. 0d. in 1948 to £50 2s. 0d. in 1949 and of the Donegal growers from £63 10s. 0d. to £26 2s. 0d. Deputy MacBride was then a member of the Government, and if he had been as concerned then for the tomato growers as he is to-day, surely he would <Col N="820" /> have seen that something should have been done for these unfortunate people whose income had been reduced by one stroke of the pen, in the case of the Donegal growers, from £63 to £26, and, in the case of the Connemara growers, from £84 to £50.  What concern did he show in 1949 and why does he come here now to ask the Minister for Agriculture to give a guaranteed price?  Is there any sincerity behind the man or was there ever any sincerity behind him?  Is this his way of showing his insincerity?  He has shown it in many ways already, but this is one of the damnedest ways of doing so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They had two years' experience of the Coalition Government and what they were doing for the tomato growers, but my action was different when I came into office.

      <P>I have already challenged <Col N="821" /> his sincerity in putting down this motion, designed to mislead the House and the people into thinking that he wants to get them something, although he denied it to them while he was a member of the Coalition Government. I met representatives of the tomato growers as far back as last July and I gave them the protection they needed.  We stopped the import of tomatoes in August and September and we were able to supply the market during that period.  In addition, I told them that I was anxious to see tomato growing extended and that every facility I could give them would be given to them.  I told them on that occasion that if they were able to tell me as early as next May or June that they would be able to supply tomatoes for the market towards the end of July I would give them further protection in the Irish market.</P>

      <P>The tomatoes did not go up to the extent to which they went up when the people of Dominick Street were not able to get them, the people about whom we heard so much in the past.  It is not Deputy MacBride's concern to make cheap tomatoes available, because, if it were, he would not put down such a motion as this.  I told the tomato growers as far back as last July that if they were able to give me a guarantee as to putting tomatoes on the market in the last week or fortnight of July, we would prohibit the importation of tomatoes, and that if they were able to extend the period over which they could supply them, if they were able to put them on the market up to October, we would give them protection for that month.  I have had no demands yet from the tomato growers for a guaranteed price, and I do not know who asked Deputy MacBride to bring forward a motion here with regard to it.  I have been <Col N="822" /> in very close touch with the tomato growers, and no such demand has been made to me at any time during the year.</P>
      <P>What these people want is protection, the protection I have given and which has increased their income from £55 to £94 per house.  If they are able to grow more, their income will be correspondingly increased.  We are at the moment carrying out an experiment in Donegal whereby we hope that income will be further increased.  We are experimenting on heating conditions in that county and if we could have electricity extended to people engaged in the production of tomatoes, we would have a further source of income.  We are hoping that we may be able to do that, that we will be able to give them electricity so that they can produce vegetables.  We have a ready market here for fresh vegetables. Lettuce, tomatoes, parsnips, carrots&mdash; all these vegetables can be produced at home and their production can be helped materially by the use of glass-houses.</P>
      <P>At present we are doing our utmost to help these people.  It is a question at the moment of price and production. We have numbers of people engaged in tomato production who are getting certain yields from their glass-houses and we have many cases of people who are getting over 30 cwt.  In Connemara, there were ten people in 1951 who got over 30 cwt. per house.  There are a number of people who got between 20 and 30 cwt.  In 1948, there were 18 people who got between 20 and 30 cwt., and in 1951 60 people got between 20 and 30 cwt.  In 1948, only one person got over 30 cwt. and, in 1951, over ten people got more than 30 cwt. so that it is a question of being yet in the initial stage, the experimental stage even.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the people engaged in tomato growing are not as well educated in production methods as they might be, but they are making headway as the yields indicate.  We are going forward and better yields are now being obtained in Connemara than were obtained two or three years ago.  If they continue on that line, instead of having, as we had in 1950, 60 people <Col N="823" /> getting between 20 and 30 cwt. we will have many more and the income from the industry will be much greater. That is a much better way of improving the income of the people engaged in the industry than the giving of a guaranteed price.  It might be of interest to the House to know that there is a greater consumption of tomatoes now than there has been in years gone by.  We have been importing tomatoes to a great extent for a great many years and in 1947 we imported 64,092 cwt.  In 1951 that figure went up to 116,000 cwt.  Therefore, there is plenty of room for the extension of tomato growing.  The market is there and it is only a question of our people going into it and of trying to protect the market for them.  As I have said, we are already prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting to show what protection has done, especially to show those people who are interested in having guaranteed prices but were not so interested in giving protection to the growers over the past two or three years.  In August, 1950, when there was no protection, 15,000 cwt. were brought in.  In 1951, 7,648 cwt. came in&mdash;already imported before the end of July and delivered in the first two or three days of August.  In the month of September, 1950, the imports were 5,067 cwt., but in September of 1951 none came in. That is what we have been trying to do for the tomato growers.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept this motion as it is here worded.  I see no necessity for it, as my sincerity regarding tomato growing has been amply proved by the action I have already taken since I came into office in giving protection to the growers. It has been further proved by the statements I have made to the people interested in the production of tomatoes and not interested in the production of cheap political propaganda for themselves.  I am going to give the protection to the people who deserve it.</P>

      <P>It is only a very able member of the Dáil who would have the hardihood to put down a motion of this kind, in view of the record of his own Government when in office, particularly in regard to tomato growing in Gaeltacht areas.  I think Deputy MacBride was in the House when his colleague, the then Minister for Agriculture, entertained the House for hours ridiculing this whole tomato scheme for the Western Gaeltacht.  He took the rather disgraceful course of quoting private letters written by his predecessors in office to each other in regard to this scheme.  He quoted letters from the Minister for Finance advocating it, and letters from the then Minister for Agriculture casting doubts on the wisdom of the scheme.  The whole effect of his quoting these letters in the House was to lower the standard of debate here, and to lower the standard of dignity and decency in public life.  The result in my mind and in the mind of every fair-minded person was to reflect credit on the then Minister's predecessor and on the Minister for Finance, who conceived this imaginative scheme and submitted it to his colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It reflected a certain measure of credit on the previous Minister for Agriculture for having considered that scheme and having striven to point out where there were difficulties in it, and for having brought those <Col N="825" /> difficulties to the notice of the originator of the scheme.  Was not that a sensible course?  Was it wise or prudent or even decent for Deputy MacBride's colleague in the Government to quote those letters, to hold them up as a matter for public amusement? Having quoted the letters here, the then Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If I had to do it all again I would do exactly as before.  I think the scheme is a thoroughly rotten one, and I wanted to protect as many as I could from becoming involved in it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in the Government of which Deputy MacBride was a member, wanted to protect the people of the West of Ireland from being involved in this scheme.  He told us of his interview with the Rev. Father Moran, who, more or less, forced him to continue the scheme which had been initiated by his predecessors. In the debate for the 15th July, 1948, at column 591, Deputy Dillon, then Minister for Agriculture, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Father Moran came up here and shouted at me very loudly and I shouted at him.  Next, Father Eaton came along.  Father Eaton is a young curate there.  He said to me: &lsquo;Minister, these people, rightly or wrongly, believe that they have a claim in natural justice to the performance of what they understood to be a promise of a Minister of State to carry out the undertakings they had been given.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Rightly or wrongly,&rdquo; the then Minister for Agriculture said, he was forced to adopt the scheme; but, having adopted it, he sought to kill it by exposing these unfortunate people and other tomato growers to the merciless and unfair competition of imported tomatoes&mdash;possibly subsidised imported tomatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the inconsistency which Deputy MacBride has shown&mdash;and I think I might excuse his inconsistency in this respect, in that he may not have been aware of what his Government was doing to the tomato growers in Ireland, and particularly the West of Ireland&mdash;possibly he was not acquainted with the agricultural policy <Col N="826" /> being carried out by the Government of which he was a member, as his visits to the country were too hurried and too brief to let him know what kind of economic policy was being carried into operation.  That is the only excuse that can be offered for Deputy MacBride's introduction of this motion.</P>
    <P>Even the motion itself does not make sense.  If the Deputy reads it again he will see that he asks for an &ldquo;economic price&rdquo;&mdash;that the Minister should &ldquo;fix a guaranteed economic price to be given in respect of the total output of tomatoes in Connemara and other Gaeltacht areas for the coming year&rdquo;. That implies that those who do not live in the Gaeltacht areas are not to get an economic price.  Surely any sane person will recognise that anyone engaged in production, particularly in production of this nature, is entitled to an economic price.  Surely Deputy MacBride will acknowledge that those who do not live in the Gaeltacht areas, who live in Wicklow or Dublin or elsewhere, are also entitled to an economic price for their produce.  Why should it be declared by this House, as Deputy MacBride seeks to have it declared, that those people are not to get an economic price for their produce?  That is the type of legislation which this House would never stand for.  I think there is nothing more dangerous than to try to provide special prices for special areas in regard to a particular commodity.  I am all for helping the Gaeltacht areas.  They deserve to be assisted in every way possible and I think the Fianna Fáil Government, when they were last in office, deserved to be congratulated on having initiated this scheme.  As I say, it was an imaginative and a bold scheme and one which was specially suited for the needs and the requirements of the congested areas.  What could be more suitable for a congested area than the provision of intensified production of fruit or vegetables under glass?  They have not got the vast area of land on which to grow crops on a large scale or on which to maintain stock on a large scale.  Therefore it was wise and right that they should be assisted in producing and in undertaking work of this kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> The proper way to assist these people was along the lines on which this scheme was initiated, that is, to assist these smallholders financially in the erection of their glass-houses and also to give them the necessary technical instruction and assistance that they might require in order to become skilled in that particular work with which they were unfamiliar.</P>
    <P>On the question of price, they should, in the ordinary course of events, take their stand along with the rest of the producers in the country.  Only yesterday I was speaking to a farmer who has put a considerable amount of his own little garden, adjacent to his house, under glass for the purpose of producing tomatoes, mushrooms and other things of that kind.  He has carried out that work without Government assistance in the way of grant or otherwise.  He has carried it out from his small savings and with the help of his sons.  I think that man is as much entitled to a fair and economic price for his produce as anybody else in the country.  I do not think we should have a situation in which industrious people like that should be excluded from their God-given right to get a fair price for their produce and a fair reward for their labour.  If Deputy MacBride had suggested something in the way of subsidy for transport in recognition of the handicap of distance, I might have considered the proposal favourably, but in the manner in which the motion is worded I think nobody could consider it, at least no reasonable person could consider it.</P>
    <P>I raised this question of tomatoes on several occasions because I am very much interested in it, not from the point of view purely of the Gaeltacht areas but from the point of view of producers generally who, I consider, are doing very useful work.  The Irish producer of tomatoes produces an article which is superior to anything that is imported, and I hope that superiority will continue.  Questions have been raised about the consumers' interests.  I think the greatest injustice that could be done to the consumer would be to kill native production of <Col N="828" /> tomatoes because then they would be completely at the mercy of outside monopolies who would in all probability compel them to pay a higher price for an inferior type of fruit.</P>
    <P>On 4th August, at column 1884, Volume 112&mdash;that is, in the early days of the inter-Party Government&mdash;I asked the then Minister for Agriculture:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... if he is aware that owing to the very low prices paid to Irish producers of tomatoes there is grave danger that this important industry may be completely wiped out and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to safeguard the industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not agree with the view expressed in the first part of the Deputy's question.  As regards the second part of the question, tomatoes imported under licence bear a customs duty of 2d. per lb. and I have no reason to believe that Dutch producers are or should be more efficient than our producers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I further asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to put two supplementary questions to the Minister: (1) Does the Minister accept the principle that it is his duty as Minister to see that the Irish producer gets a fair price for his products, and (2) is the Minister satisfied that the present price of tomatoes is fair to the Irish producer?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have some doubt as to whether the price was an economic one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not economic. That is the period in 1948 when prices were forced down due to the action of the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister gave his reasons:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My principal duty is to see that every section of the people of this country, in so far as my functions extend to them, are equitably dealt with.  I can see no justification for withholding from the poorest sections of our community access to desirable and nutritious fruit, of which the prohibition of imports would deprive them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the attitude taken up by the Government of which Deputy MacBride <Col N="829" /> was a member.  He was prepared to allow this country to be flooded with cheap, inferior, imported tomatoes and other fruit and drive home producers, not only in the Gaeltacht areas but throughout the country, out of production, and having done that, to expose the Irish consumers to any injustice that might be inflicted upon them by the forces controlling the imports into this country. I think Deputy MacBride should have been ashamed to bring in this motion.</P>
    <P>In view of his Government's policy when they were in office, both in regard to tomato growers in the West and the tomato growers generally in this country, if he was bringing in here at all a motion in regard to tomatoes, he should come dressed in sackcloth with a little pail of ashes on his head just to show that he does repent for the misconduct of the Government of which he was a member, not only in regard to their policy on tomatoes but generally to their agricultural policy.</P>

Twelve months ago the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputies McGrath, Davern and Allen and other Deputies on the opposite side of the House always fled the House when Deputy Cogan got up to speak.  Now, however, the chains bind them to their seats and, whether they like it or not, they must remain here in rebellious silence to hear his utterances. The Deputy talked about what he calls the &ldquo;Galltacht&rdquo;.  Might I translate for him that word?  It means the foreign districts of Ireland.

I do not agree at all with the Minister's view, that his only concern should be to get a price, no matter how it may be obtained, for tomato growers.  I feel that every Minister in this present &ldquo;Coalition Government&rdquo; or the Ministers of any other Government that might succeed it have a duty to the people.  In discussing this motion the Minister has shown but a very slight regard for the people for whom tomatoes are produced, namely, the consumers.  Like <Col N="831" /> many other Deputies in this House I have a family and personal problems and I can certainly remember a time, two or three years ago, when this nutritious fruit, which Deputy Cogan has described here to-night, was denied to the people of this city and to the people of Cork, not denied because it was in scarce supply but because of the price demanded for it. Are we to adopt a situation here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly this fact to be considered in relation to the price of tomatoes.  Whether it is to be a guaranteed price, and I never understand what that means in relation to any commodity, or whether it is to be a competitive price, the consumer must be considered.  It is a very easy matter for Deputies like Deputy Cogan or like the Minister for Agriculture, to make speeches about guaranteeing the rights of producers and all the rest of it.  They may say: &ldquo;What great fellows we are.  We stopped the import of tomatoes and we conserved a market for producers.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest parasite in the agricultural industry is the Minister, <Col N="832" /> and he knows it well.  The outcome of this kind of policy is that the unfortunate poor of Dublin, Cork and other cities in this country have to subsidise tomatoes.  I feel that that is a factor we cannot afford to forget.  It is all very well to prevent the import of any fruit in competition with our home-grown tomatoes when the production of tomatoes here is capable of supplying the entire market.  If that position was obtained, then ordinary competition between growers would ensure a fair price, not an unfair price, from both points of view and would ensure a fair deal for the consumer.  How ever, that is not the position.  The complaint made here by different Deputies who have spoken is that the tomato growing industry is not capable of supplying the entire market even to the point of getting a competitive price.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as that is the situation, then, by preventing, as the Minister has done, any competition from imported fruit, it means that a scarce article must be sold here at a price fixed by the producer.  I am not speaking about those people who produce tomatoes in the Gaeltacht, be it Connemara or Donegal.  Those are not the people who sell the tomatoes here in Dublin.  There is many a stage between the actual growing of the tomato and its eventual sale in this city.  If we ever permit a situation to arise where the suppliers to the markets here in Dublin can command the entire market, then the tomato will become as rare as the golden egg which Deputy Cogan thought this Government would lay.  I suggest to the House and to the Minister that the point of view of the consumer should not be neglected in matters of this kind.  It is very easy to ask, as Deputy Cogan did, are we going to allow a situation to arise in which cheap inferior fruit will be brought into the country?  That is just a question in so <Col N="833" /> many words.  From the point of view of the ordinary family, in Deputy Cogan's constituency or anywhere else, Irish tomatoes are infinitely preferable, should they require tomatoes.  The Irish tomato is undoubtedly a much better article, but the ordinary family does not see any sense in the Minister for Agriculture subsidising tomato growing and charging, in effect, twice the price that should be paid.  That is an aspect of the matter that should be considered by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan referred to a constituent of his who had built glass-houses and is going in for tomato growing.  He commended him for his enterprise.  I also commend him.  I think it is always commendable for people to engage in enterprises of this kind without assistance from anyone.  No one enters into any enterprise unless he is assured of some return from a business point of view.  No one will erect a lot of glass, a most expensive item in these days, for the cultivation of tomatoes or mushrooms or anything else unless he is fairly certain of getting a good return.  Despite all we have heard I believe glass-house cultivation is growing in County Dublin.  More and more people are going into the production of tomatoes because in recent years tomato growers have got a fair return.  I appeal to the Minister now not to forget that, and not to do anything that might create a scarcity market.  If that is done fortunes will undoubtedly be made by the producers, and those fortunes will be acquired at the expense of the poorer sections of the community; the poorer sections of the community will not pay the high price, and they will thereby lose the benefit of that particular commodity. The market will be dealt in purely by the richer sections of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the objection that I see in this entire discussion.  I do not think it is possible to discuss this motion without considering the effect of the market generally on the consuming public.  I do not know whether Deputy MacBride, in referring to the guaranteed economic price for the product from the Gaeltacht area, adverted to that.  If he had that in mind, then the motion would certainly have my <Col N="834" /> support.  But I would not like to see a situation arise in which the interests of the consumer are at a discount and that, I regretfully admit, is the interpretation I read into the Minister's remarks here.</P>
    <P>He appears to regard the interests of the consumer as being no concern of his.  He appears to regard his role as Minister as being one purely concerned with the producer and the price to be paid to the producer.  I do not think that should be the approach of a Minister for Agriculture.  Any Minister for Agriculture has a joint responsibility, a responsibility to the producer and a responsibility to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The same speech was made by Deputy O'Higgins in relation to the poorer sections of our community. It is a good thing for the success of Deputy O'Higgins as a future politician that the poor will be always with us.  They will be there at all times to be exploited by Deputies like Deputy O'Higgins.  They were there six months ago when one penny per gallon increase was proposed for farmers supplying milk to the creameries. They are here again now because it is the policy of this Government to encourage the production of tomatoes in the country and to guarantee the growers an economic market for their produce.  The poor will always be dragged in by Deputies like Deputy O'Higgins to prevent any development whatsoever here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the policy that was in operation while the inter-Party Government was in office.  Deputy MacBride has now introduced this motion.  It is an extraordinary motion, to my mind, and I would like some explanation from him as to whether he is concerned mainly with the revival of the Irish <Col N="835" /> language or with the production of tomatoes.  We have heard many suggestions for keeping the language alive.  This is a new one tied up with tomato growers in the Gaeltacht. When Deputies come to vote upon this motion they will have to make up their minds as to whether they are voting for the revival of the Irish language or the promotion of tomato growing in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomato growing here would be in a sound position to-day were it not for the fact that the inter-Party Government came into office. Deputy MacBride sat cheek by jowl with the then Minister for Agriculture and supported him in his avowed determination to destroy tomato growing here.  That Minister for Agriculture referred to tomatoes as an exotic crop with no place in Irish agriculture; he said that no self-respecting Minister and no self-respecting Irishman could stand over the policy of growing tomatoes in Ireland.  He found other exotic crops but I do not suppose I will be permitted to refer to them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome Deputy MacBride's belated assistance.  Everything that he and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, could do to prevent tomatoes from being grown in the Gaeltacht or in any part of Ireland was done during the inter-Party Government's term in office.  Deputy Dillon used his position to decry every effort by agriculturists to promote the production of tomatoes.  He threw the ports open. He depressed the price for the Irish growers, the price that would have been an economic price and would have represented a fair return for their labour and their capital investment. It was an approved crop that could be grown economically at a reasonable price to the consumer. They were entitled to get that for it.  We would have had full and plenty of tomatoes at very reasonable prices by now had the last Minister for Agriculture and Deputy MacBride's Government allowed the development of <Col N="836" /> the tomato crop to continue as it was when they found it.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Higgins had influence in the largest Party and the largest group that comprised the last Government. While you have the viewpoint I have outlined in regard to tomatoes one day, and in regard to milk and butter another day, no progress whatever will be made.  Every possible scheme designed to help the Gaeltacht has been decried and Deputy Dillon has commenced to decry again proposals by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Jack Lynch, which have as their object the promotion of certain activities in the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Dillon has set out with bell, book and candle to try and kill these activities before they start.  I wish some of his colleagues-they are now his ex-colleagues-would say a word in Deputy Dillon's ear to remind him of the damage he did to agriculture and agricultural production in this country during his three and a half years.  The damage he did during that period will not be wiped out in a century.  That is a recognised fact among agriculturists in this country at the present time.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they could not be grown as cheaply as Dutch tomatoes and, therefore, they should not be grown in the Gaeltacht or anywhere else.  That is the policy we get from the opposite benches.  It is well that this country fully realises the lead taken by prominent leaders of the Fine Gael Party on this matter and the viewpoint they take on these matters. Deputy O'Higgins represents in this House a purely agricultural constituency. A small proportion of his constituency consists of an urban population.  There are a number of small industries in his constituency, but a big proportion of his constituents make their livelihood from agriculture. There is no doubt about that.  I would like to see tomato growing in Leix-Offaly. It would be to the advantage of many small farmers in that constituency of his.</P>

Deputy Dunne, whose appetite for higher wages is insatiable, and Deputy Rooney, if he were here now, would admit that there are good <Col N="838" /> farmers in North County Dublin who are engaged in tomato growing.  Deputy Dunne will also admit, I am sure, that in the last three years some of those farmers who have gone in extensively for tomato growing, found themselves in the bankruptcy court.  That is a well-known fact.  They put their capital and all they could borrow or find in any way into the growing of tomatoes in North County Dublin, and found themselves in the bankruptcy court as a result of the policy of the late Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I hope that all this will have its lesson in the future, as it had not in the past for Deputy MacBride who should, as Deputy Cogan stated, have come into this House clothed in sackcloth and ashes.

Deputy MacBride admits, of course, by implication in the motion that it is the Government's policy to revive the Irish language and maintain the Gaeltacht with the largest possible Irish-speaking population in it.  He admits that he wants a guaranteed economic price for tomato growing in the Gaeltacht with a view to promoting the revival of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>That is the motion. Deputy MacBride admits by implication that it is the recognised policy of this Government to promote the revival <Col N="839" /> of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and he wants an economic price for tomatoes for that purpose.  Deputy O'Higgins, as his ex-colleague or whatever he is, is against that policy.  He believes that an economic price should not be paid to Irish tomato growers and that the poor, of whom he is the only friend, according to himself, must get cheap tomatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the extraordinary divergent viewpoints we get from two members of the Opposition. We hope they will come together when they have an agreed policy upon something and say that if tomato growing is to be desirable in the Gaeltacht or otherwise the growers of tomatoes will get a fair chance and an economic price for their produce.  I am sure that the Minister for Agriculture is prepared to stand over that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has already announced his policy of the further production and development of tomato growing in the Gaeltacht.  One of his first acts when he became Minister for Agriculture was to indicate that the Government would give protection to those who are interested in the Gaeltacht and would provide further moneys for the production of tomatoes in the Gaeltacht to help the Irish language with which we are all concerned.</P>
      <P>It is welcome to hear Deputy MacBride agreeing that this Government's policy is a sound one for the country, but it is sad to think that in his group there is a difference of opinion and that there are Deputies like Deputy O'Higgins who will give an economic price neither to tomato growers, milk producers, nor anybody else in an agricultural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully for some time to various people and I must say that I did not interpret Deputy O'Higgins as being against the growing of tomatoes.  I do not like to hear misrepresentation in this House from any side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that on this motion we are <Col N="840" /> discussing a problem in only one of its facets.  The question should be much larger.  The question of tomato growing in the Gaeltacht cannot be divorced from the general problem of tomato production in the country as a whole.  I listened also very carefully to the Minister's remarks and I am satisfied that the welfare of the tomato growers in the Gaeltacht is safe in his hands and I am making a present of that to anybody who likes. To be fair to his predecessor, he had the courage to come into this House and say that he personally did not care for the policy that had been initiated in the Gaeltacht but that in so far as it had been initiated before he came into office he was prepared to give the scheme a chance. I think that we should be fair to Deputy Dillon in that respect also.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke in favour of the consumer and I think the consumer must be taken into consideration. We would all like to see our full requirements of tomatoes grown in this country but at the present moment we are not in a position to do that.  If that is the case, is there not always a danger that a certain element who are in production in this country will, if they can get away with it, overcharge for their product?  I know for a fact that a few years ago tomatoes were sold at 10/- a lb. at a time of the year when they should not cost that&mdash;they should not cost that at any time; I mean at a time of year when tomatoes were ripening without artificial means. The previous Minister took a step which I think was right.  He allowed in foreign tomatoes at certain times in order to make sure that not alone the poor people but the ordinary consumer in the country could buy this fruit at a reasonable price.  I know perfectly well what would happen if that foreign tomato were not allowed in.  Quite a few of the natives would take advantage of the scarcity, as they did for a period, and the price of tomatoes would skyrocket.  There are a number of individuals&mdash;I do not say that this applies to the producers as a whole in the Midlands and in the East&mdash;who built large glass-houses and hoped to recoup their capital outlay within a <Col N="841" /> year or two by charging enormous prices for their produce.  They were not prepared to recoup themselves over a fair period of years but wanted to get their money back within a couple of years and I think that the like of that should be carefully watched.</P>
    <P>I recollect that the mover of the motion suggested, on the last night, that the people of Connemara were getting 7d. per lb. and the people of Donegal 6d. per lb. for their tomatoes and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that statement.  Let us examine this question: those tomatoes for which the people in Connemara got 7d. went to 1/4 and 1/6 per lb. and more in Galway City, 15 miles away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>And 3/6 in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of 15 miles from the area where they were produced; the consumer there paid three times the price the producer got for his tomatoes.  That is a problem that must be attacked.  The mover of the motion is fighting his cause on the wrong line.  The Minister should inquire into the reasons why the producers in Connemara got only 7d. and the consumers 15 miles away were charged 1/6 a lb.  As far as I can judge some robber of a middleman or a wholesaler got more than his fair share of the profits.  This problem of the middleman applies not alone to tomatoes but to any other produce of the farm.  I do not want to go into it, but it is the same old story: the producer is not getting a fair return but the middleman, the distributor and all these people are getting more than a fair proportion of the profits.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the mover of the motion should drop it and accept the Minister's assurance that the welfare of the tomato growers in the Gaeltacht will be safeguarded so far as lies in his power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate and particularly to Deputy O'Higgins's contribution I felt that we have not learned the lesson taught by Arthur Griffith.  If we can produce an article in this country like tomatoes, that is superior to an imported <Col N="842" /> article, the production of that article should be encouraged until it is fit to supply the complete home market.  There is no reason why with encouragement and assistance we cannot supply the complete home market with tomatoes.  I do not see any reason why we should give employment to Dutch workers that could be given to our workers here.  That is fundamental in any approach to the problem of national production.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan that the producer should get a reasonable and fair price.  Of course, it is a difficult problem.  What is a reasonable price? I asked Deputy MacBride when he was moving the motion, had he any view as to what in present circumstances is an economic price per lb. for tomatoes.  In putting that question I realised that it was a difficult one and that consideration of many problems was entailed in estimating an economic price to the producer in a particular year.</P>
      <P>The dangerous thing I see about the Motion is that during the period of office of the inter-Party Government Deputy Dillon did everything that one individual could do to sabotage the tomato-growing industry, not only in the Gaeltacht but elsewhere, and Deputy MacBride's approach, that the price being paid now is uneconomic, is an unsettling factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we must do is to encourage the production of tomatoes and, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas, I want to see more and more glass-houses built.  From my discussions with people in the Gaeltacht who have glass-houses I know that they consider it an excellent scheme.  I know that there are many people in the Gaeltacht who want that scheme extended.  That being so, it is the duty of every one of us to encourage the extension of the scheme.  There are 200 glass-houses, approximately, in the Gaeltacht of Connemara and Donegal.  I should like to see many hundreds more.  The people in the Gaeltacht have to do their part in the scheme and anything that unsettles them or leads them to believe that the scheme will break down in a few years, that the country will be flooded with Dutch or other foreign tomatoes and that they will <Col N="843" /> not have a market, is not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here specifically by the Minister that when he took over control of the Department of Agriculture last year, by stopping imports of tomatoes in August and September he was able almost to double the receipts of glass-houses in the Gaeltacht.  The Minister has done a remarkable job in a very short period by that simple method of stopping imports of tomatoes that were flooding the country during those months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne&mdash;I am glad he is here &mdash;and others of us impressed on Deputy Dillon the necessity for some such prohibition on imports in the interests of our producers.  I hope that as time goes on the Minister for Agriculture will be in a position to extend the period during which imports are stopped.</P>
    <P>I have been at the Dublin market and I thought it was a shocking disgrace to see people walking around in rubber boots, up to their knees in tomatoes that had been brought in from Holland.  They were trying to hand out boxes of tomatoes for almost nothing.  I do not know how that is done, but it is not nationally desirable that the country should be flooded in that way and that a valuable national industry should be sabotaged in the initial stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Rooney is here. I am sorry he was not here to hear Deputy O'Higgins talking on this subject.  Deputy O'Higgins's contribution to this debate was that the Minister was to be condemned because he was trying to improve the price the tomato grower would get.  Deputy O'Higgins says that that is wrong; that you must consider the consumer. If we have concern only for the consumer we will flood the country with Dutch tomatoes and will have the position in the Dublin market that you have to wear rubber boots to walk through rotten and rotting tomatoes.</P>

      <P>I have considerable interest in the consumers, because I represent a constituency in which nearly everybody is a consumer.  The fact that I am interested in consumers does not necessarily mean that I have to forget all that I ever learned about the fundamentals of building up our Irish national industries.  I am not afraid or ashamed to go into any part of my constituency and explain to the people that the development of our industries gives good employment, that it is in their own interests that there should be that employment, that it means employment for some of their own children, some of their own friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I do not mind about being misrepresented. I consider that the consumers in my area and in other areas in the city are intelligent people, who understand things.  They are not led astray by all this talk about the consumers.  They do not want tomatoes at ½d. a lb. if it means that there will be derelict glass-houses all over the country and more unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a little practical experience of growing tomatoes.  I grow tomatoes, not on a very extensive scale.  During the period of office of the inter-Party Government I was selling a certain amount of tomatoes, making what I consider was a reasonable return.  It would take me nine or ten years to pay for the glass-houses.  Nevertheless, I and my family worked in our spare time, and we had an interesting occupation. I found that the price dropped so low that it was not worth while taking the tomatoes to the market.  I bottled the tomatoes that I produced. I hope the Minister will be able to do the same thing in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere.  I have bottled tomatoes all the year round.  I make at home the sauces and chutneys that we need for the whole year round and quite a considerable quantity that we give away. In doing that I find I can save more money than if I were to sell the tomatoes at the market price and buy tinned or bottled tomatoes when the fresh tomatoes are gone.  I believe <Col N="845" /> there is a germ of an idea there.  It would be of great assistance, particularly in the Gaeltacht, if we could have increased production of tomatoes, and if those tomatoes could be bottled or tinned in the Gaeltacht or converted into sauces or chutneys.  In that way the producers in the Gaeltacht would get a much better return and industry would be created in the areas.</P>
    <P>I just wanted to make those particular observations.  It is regrettable that in 1952 we should be driven back to discussions as to whether the correct thing is to build up our own industries or to allow unlimited imports and destroy our own industries.  I think that Deputies who come here as representatives of the people should have their minds made up on that matter.  If they had made up their minds, we would be able to approach the problem in the correct way without going back to these out-of-date discussions as to whether we should have these unlimited exports or build up our own industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the problem of the tomato growing industry crystallises in its own way the whole problem of agricultural production and distribution in this country.  I hardly think it is realistic to assume that there are in this House amongst any Party persons who would consciously try to promote a policy which would have as its results the destruction of a native industry and an improvement in demand for the benefit of the products of a foreign industry, no matter what the cause or the circumstances might be.  I think it will be found when you tear away the arguments made on all sides for political advantage, when you cast aside these considerations, and look at the problem as it is, an economic problem, you will find there is very little difference of opinion and very little difference in the real attitude of all Deputies towards the question of tomato growing generally.  I have interested myself in this question since the first day I entered this House and it will be within the recollection of Deputies that during the lifetime of the previous Government I lost no opportunity to bring before the then <Col N="846" /> Minister the position in which the tomato-growing industry was placed and the steps which I felt should be taken to put it into a satisfactory condition.  As I have said, the industry in those years was not and now is not in a satisfactory condition because the attitude of mind of successive Governments towards it and towards agriculture generally, particularly so far as the distribution end is concerned, has been identical. Deputy McQuillan hit the nail on the head when he talked about the price that the producer gets and has got in other years and the price that the consumer has to pay.  Thereby hangs a tale.</P>
      <P>This motion of Deputy MacBride is a laudable motion.  Anything that can be done to promote and encourage the growth of the language in the West should be done, within, of course, reasonable limits, because the language is something that every one of us wants to see revived but some of us should cast our minds back to the war years and, if we can recall the language that was used by the working class people of Dublin in relation to the price of tomatoes during the years of the war, I think it will be agreed that it was a language, in the words of the song, that the English did not know.  What was the position then?  Is it not a fact the working class people in this city, and in every city and town, had to pay an extraordinarily high price if they wanted to get tomatoes?  Is it not a fact that they had to pay 6/-, 7/- and 8/- per lb?  Is there anybody who will try to justify that price?  I do not think that anybody will dare to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Minister for Agriculture in his approach to this problem did not, in my view, take the steps which were necessary to correct the abuse that occurred during those years.  I do not see any evidence that the present Minister is doing it either. I am convinced that in order to get a condition of affairs in the tomato industry which will be satisfactory to all, there must be some degree of State supervision in this industry.  I have spoken over many years to men in my own constituency who have spent long years growing tomatoes, to their employees <Col N="847" /> and to the Tomato Growers' Organisation, the organisation which represents growers nationally in this country.  They have expressed to me on numerous occasions the view that could they be assured of an economic price all the year round for their produce, they would rest content, but they are not assured of that.  Even the restriction on the importation of Dutch tomatoes, which now applies, does not give them that assurance or that guarantee because, if Irish producers have an exceptionally good year, and produce too much for the needs of the market on a particular day, week or month, they are subject again to the fluctuations which come from this system of supply and demand, this system of profit-making which dominates every phase of national life in this country.  The producers of tomatoes, like the producers of every other agricultural commodity, are completely at the mercy of those in charge of the distributing end.  Even in past years to which Deputy Cowan referred, when the price of tomatoes in the Dublin market sank to a very low level, you could still go down Moore Street or any of the shopping centres in Dublin to buy tomatoes and you were charged a very high price, a price far too high so far as working-class people were concerned.</P>
    <P>What is the point in our talking in vague and general terms about this industry without realising that before there can be any satisfaction, any proper adjustment of the position, there must be some degree of State supervision? There should be a guaranteed price for the producer.  I was told 18 months ago by a number of producers that if they were guaranteed a price of 1/3 to 1/6 per lb. for home-grown tomatoes-tomatoes grown under glass &mdash;they would consider it an adequate price.  Since then costs may have altered somewhat.  Wages have not altered very much, I can assure the House.  Other costs may have altered. How many working-class families in this city can be assured of a supply of tomatoes at 1/9 to 2/- per lb. all the year round?  I believe that if the Minister is in earnest&mdash;and I have no <Col N="848" /> reason to think he is not&mdash;in his desire to promote this industry and to encourage its expansion, he will have to take the bull by the horns.  He will have to provide a central marketing board which will lay down a guaranteed price for the producer and which will fix a ceiling for the price to be charged to the people in the cities and towns who consume tomatoes.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious that native industry should be encouraged and built up and that the maximum number of our own people are employed in native industry.  None of us want to see foreign tomatoes being imported&mdash;or, indeed, any foreign article, for that matter.  However, in our desire to bring about that position, we must ensure that we do not impose too great a hardship upon the consuming public.  Some advocates here would appear to think that you have either to be all for the producer and against the consumer or all for the consumer and against the producer. That is a nonsensical attitude to take up in this matter.  There is a happy medium which must be found. People who like to eat tomatoes will tell you that the Irish tomato is superior in flavour to the imported tomato&mdash;and that is correct.  These people are prepared to pay a differential over the price demanded for foreign tomatoes.  I do not think that this is a question which should be left to the jungle economics that obtain in so far as the present-day business methods of this industry are concerned.  I do not think that the economic policy of the survival of the fittest and of the glorification of competitive business will serve any useful purpose in relation to this industry. In fact, I think it will do immeasurable harm.  I think it will lead, eventually, to monopolisation even in this small industry because the small man will have no chance whatsoever of carrying on if prices are going to be driven down to such a level that only large-scale production will enable a man to carry on in business at all. The tomato-growing industry is an industry that can prove of immense value to the country.  It is not at the moment employing one-twentieth of <Col N="849" /> the number it is capable of employing, if properly developed.  If this motion does nothing else it will at least have occasioned a discussion in this House which will give the Minister food for thought.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will get rid of the old idea of letting this industry go whichever way it will and of taking care of itself, with the least possible interference.  That attitude is not good enough because it will lead to an end of the tomato-growing industry. That industry needs supervision, aid, guaranteed prices for the producer, a reasonable profit for the distributor&mdash; and not the robber profits which have been made and are being made at present by distributors in this particular line&mdash;and a ceiling price for the people who, in the last analysis, have to pay, namely, the community.  The Minister will do a great deal of good if he does that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. My attitude towards the tomato industry has always been consistent and the record will prove my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a problem presented itself to the growers early in 1948, Deputy Dunne and myself were the first two persons in this House to raise the question of the dumping of tomatoes in this country which resulted in Irish-grown tomatoes being sold at a price below what could be regarded as an economic level.  I am in favour of protection for the tomato industry in so far as the growers can (1) meet the demand, (2) provide tomatoes at a price within the reach of the consumers and (3) provide the tomatoes at a price related in some way to the price at which the foreign tomatoes can be sold in this country&mdash;these foreign tomatoes having been brought, possibly, 1,000 miles over land and sea and put on the market here.  I realise that the weather in these other countries probably suits tomato growing better than our climate, and also that the level of wages paid to persons engaged in the tomato-growing industry outside this country is higher than the level of wages paid to people engaged in tomato growing here.  These are factors which must be taken into consideration when the question of <Col N="850" /> price presents itself.  I hope that the present Minister will encourage the expansion of this industry and that, when he is expanding this industry at the expense of the taxpayer, he will keep in mind the interests of the taxpayer in so far as the prices of tomatoes are concerned.  If the taxpayers are going to finance the expansion of the tomato-growing industry in order to ensure that Irish-grown tomatoes will be available, it is only right that they should expect the Administration and the Minister to ensure that tomatoes will be available to them at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>We are aware that our climate does not permit of a large quantity of tomatoes becoming available during most of the year.  There are only a couple of months&mdash;I think August and September&mdash;during which our growers can produce the full requirements of the consumers of this country.  With expansion, it is probable that a sufficiency of tomatoes could be grown for the consumers in this country, to be available during the month of July and, possibly, the earlier part of October.</P>
    <P>When the scheme for the expansion of tomato growing comes under way, I hope measures will be instituted to ensure that heating will be provided in glass-houses to enable growers to produce tomatoes during months other than the months of August and September.  It is probable that the production of tomatoes by means of artificial heating may prove more expensive than the ripening of tomatoes under normal conditions.  In that respect, I believe that the growers would be entitled to some kind of price adjustment.  I was very glad to see that last year the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, made an Order which provided protection for growers in this country during the months of August and September.  He probably did so having regard to previous experience and the knowledge that our growers were capable of producing sufficient tomatoes for consumers in this country during those months.</P>
    <P>When the question of protection arises, however, there is always the danger that advantage will be taken <Col N="851" /> of that protection, and there is the point at which the Minister should have a function to ensure that fair play will be given to both sides, particularly having regard to the cost of producing the tomatoes.  It would be a great hardship on tomato growers, having cultivated the crop and put the tomatoes on the market, if they did not receive in return a little profit in addition to the cost of labour, and the other expenses in connection with the production of the tomatoes.  That is where the level of protection should come in.</P>
    <P>The law of supply and demand is one which has always hit producers in this country.  All is well when there is a scarcity.  The price appears then to provide a return to the producer.  But the very moment he produces too much he finds that advantage is taken of his position, and that he is obliged to take a sacrifice price for his produce.  At the same time, the cost in the matter of labour and other expenses of producing the surplus is the same as the cost of producing a smaller crop in the long run.  Therefore the law of supply and demand should only be permitted to operate when prices have reached a certain level, and below that the law should not be permitted to operate.</P>
    <P>In every other branch of trade and industry there are basic figures.  The only basic figures existing so far as people engaged on the land are concerned are for wheat and beet.  These are the only two crops for which the producers when they are planting the seeds can say the price which they will get when they produce the crop.  Every other crop is subject to supply and demand, and that is an unsatisfactory position when the price goes below the cost of production</P>
    <P>If this scheme is extended in the Gaeltacht areas, I hope that it will be a success.  It has been an experiment so far.  The experience we have had up to the present&mdash;perhaps it would not be advisable to base our views on that experience&mdash;has not been very encouraging.  It is, however, worth another trial.  Every effort should be made to find out whether in fact it is <Col N="852" /> an economic proposition, first of all for the growers of tomatoes and, secondly, for the consumers, to expand the tomato-growing industry in the Gaeltacht and western areas.  We know that the climate there is very humid, and possibly there is not as much sunshine there as there is in the drier districts of the country.  At the same time, we know that this is the type of industry which suits smallholders best. It enables them to get the most from a small area of land.</P>
    <P>I fully support the terms of this motion.  I believe that it is one more step in our efforts to be self-sufficient. After self-sufficiency the question of efficiency arises.  We ought to be able to compare the results of our efforts in this country with the results that can be obtained elsewhere.  Prices generally in the country should be compared with the prices of similar articles elsewhere, having regard to labour costs and expenses and all other considerations. I am not one of those who believe that the public should be made to pay through the nose rather than pay a normal price, so that an Irish product can be grown.  There has been an inclination to go all out for self-sufficiency and to make the public pay for that.  It is all very well getting people to pay for it in the initial stages in order to get production into full gear, whether it be the tomato industry or any kind of manufacturing industry, but, when it has been firmly established, it is only right for the taxpayer to expect that the measure of protection required and the measure of protection to be afforded should not be so great as in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>The measure of protection now to be given to tomato growers must be carefully considered.  The industry is only in its infancy, especially if we are to aim at producing Irish tomatoes all through the 12 months of the year.  It will be more expensive to produce Irish tomatoes during the winter months than during the summer months.  If we are to aim at tomato production in this way, we ought to be able to get some scale of prices related to the cost of production at these different times.  But at all times we must ensure that if the housewife wants <Col N="853" /> tomatoes she will be able to buy them, and buy them at a reasonable price. We do not want to have a position in which the housewife will find that there are no tomatoes to-day, or there will be no tomatoes this week because of one difficulty or another.  We must take steps to ensure that, no matter where the tomatoes come from, the housewife will be able to get them when she wants them, and able to get them at a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>This is a motion that I would like to support.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be long. There are two sides to this question.  I agree that the tomato-growing industry should be tried out in the West of Ireland amongst the small uneconomic holders.  I am satisfied that at present, at least in my end of the country, the wrong type of people are in the industry.  I think it is very wrong that money should be given to men with large tracts of land.  This is an industry which, I think, should be confined to the cottier and the small uneconomic holder, to men who cannot make a living for themselves on their small holdings.  But the present position is that the industry is being allowed to extend to men with 1,500 acres of land. They cover a couple of acres of their estates with glass-houses at the expense of the State.  I think that is going too far.  While that is the position, those men, with their vast estates, do not grow a head of cabbage.  They have cattle roaming over their estates and, at the same time, they avail of every opportunity to get Government money at the expense of the ordinary poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, unless there is a proper organisation at the top, the drive that we are making in regard to this industry will flop&mdash;that is, unless the people concerned wake up and do something for themselves.  I am also satisfied that, for a couple of years, <Col N="855" /> the public were absolutely fleeced when there was no competition.  I believe that, whether a product is foreign or native, there should be reasonable competition in every industry.  I am of the opinion that a ceiling should be fixed in regard to the price of Irish tomatoes.  Neither the poor man nor the middle-class man can afford to buy tomatoes at 4/-, 5/- or 6/- per lb.  I think the price should be kept at a reasonable figure, say 2/- or 2/6.  If the price fixed is a reasonable one, then I am satisfied that the industry will be able to get on a firm foundation. I believe that it should be a poor man's industry and that every effort should be made to confine it to the poor man.  It is an industry which, in my opinion, should be encouraged in the West of Ireland, where so many people have a hard struggle to make ends meet.  If we fail to do something for them then they must emigrate.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House longer.  I welcome the motion but I urge caution.  If we are to make a success of the industry a good organisation will be necessary to see that the right type of people will get the grants.  We should not allow the industry to pass into the hands of big people.  If the points which I have urged are attended to, then I think I can say the industry will have the blessing of all of us.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question? Am I to understand that this fixation of price deals only with tomatoes grown in Connemara, or are we to take it that there is going to be a fixed price for tomatoes grown all over the country?

At least, many of the speeches would lead one to believe that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the discussion <Col N="857" /> ranged over the question as to whether the tomato-growing industry, as a whole, should be protected or not.  This motion standing in my name, which has been discussed on two occasions, does not propose any measure to extend the tomato-growing industry to the whole country, nor does it propose protection.  Most of the discussion seems to have ranged over these two aspects.  However, I suppose that is inevitable in this House, and to that extent the discussion has been rather disappointing.</P>
      <P>The discussion was also disappointing in another respect, that a great many Deputies on the Government side seemed to have been far more interested in trying to launch some personal or political attacks against myself or members of the last Government. I do not propose to deal with a great many of the contemptible charges that were made by some Deputies, including Deputy Cogan. That type of thing is rather amusing, and indicates that many Deputies are not very observant.  I have been accused of tabling this motion in order to make political capital, and that now that I am in opposition I was going to use this to make political capital against the present Government&mdash;that it was to embarrass the Government as such, and that it was dishonest.  I think these words were used by the Minister.</P>

I make no apology for it, and I retabled it immediately on the change of <Col N="858" /> Government, in my own name.  That disposes of the various suggestions of political dishonesty or trickery that have been levelled by the Minister and some of his colleagues.  Possibly in future, before they level accusations of that kind, they might be a little bit more careful to investigate the motion which is under discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not want to let me talk.  It is unfortunate that instead of dealing with a question of this kind objectively he should merely resort to the hurling of insults and epithets across the floor of the House.  The motion itself is put forward on this basis, that the giving of protection in itself to the tomato-growing industry as a whole will not deal with the particular problem involved in Connemara and Donegal.  It is one of the problems of the Gaeltacht, one of the problems which was faced recently by the Government, by the Tánaiste, when he found it necessary to introduce the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  If you were to set up a market garden for the growing of tomatoes on any large scale, obviously you would not pick the Gaeltacht or Donegal, but you would set it up beside a big population centre such as Dublin, Cork or some big town.  The same applies to many other industries. I thought that we had reached the stage where all Parties in this House were agreed that the Gaeltacht had to receive special treatment and special help, that we considered that the depopulation of the Gaeltacht was a menace that was threatening the existence of the Gaeltacht, and thereby threatening the possible success of the revival of the language and, therefore, we had reached the position where we accepted that special measures had to be brought in in order to assist the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gaeltacht tomato house scheme was a good one.  I always thought it was a good one and said so; but it occurred to me that if it was to be a success it had to receive a certain degree of assistance that the tomato-growing industry in the rest of the <Col N="859" /> country did not require.  In other words, the big tomato growers or even the small tomato growers in County Dublin were obviously in a much more favourable position than the grower in Gweedore or Connemara and, therefore, they would require special assistance. The imposition of a tax or of a ban on imports undoubtedly is of some help to them, but proportionately it is of much less help to them than it is to the bigger producers in County Dublin or outside the big towns; and therefore, in order to extend a small measure of help to the growers in the Gaeltacht areas, it became necessary to impose a heavy levy on the consumer as a whole, the bulk of which went not to the growers in the Gaeltacht but to those in County Dublin, who did not require that help at that particular period.  At some particular time of the year even the County Dublin growers may require help, but certainly not to the same extent as the Gaeltacht growers need it throughout the whole season.  The position last year was, I think, that the growers in the Gaeltacht received 5d. to 8d. or 9d. per lb., while the tomatoes were resold at 3/- to 4/- per lb.  Undoubtedly there is something wrong there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>At some periods it was less.  It was an improvement on the previous year.  The previous year it ranged from 4d. to 7d.  Undoubtedly, therefore, they required a greater degree of help than the grower in County Dublin.  You are up against this difficulty in every phase of development here, that if you impose protection on a heavy scale you are imposing a tax on the consumer and contributing to an increase in the cost of living.  I do not know to what extent that is necessary in the case of the tomato growers in County Dublin. I am not competent to judge that.  It is a matter of costing and I am sure the Minister and the Department will <Col N="860" /> look into it.  I am quite satisfied, however, that the tomato grower in the Gaeltacht area does require protection and a greater degree of protection than the Dublin grower. The best way to deal with that position is not to impose a blanket protection on all imports of tomatoes at all periods of the year, which will make the price shoot up to the consumer, but to guarantee to the producer in the Gaeltacht a minimum price.  If the guarantee of minimum price involves a subsidy, it would be a very small one.  The cost of that subsidy could then be defrayed from the duty which is imposed on the import of tomatoes.</P>
      <P>I think some Deputies mentioned that it would be better to subsidise the transport of the tomatoes.  That would be a much more cumbersome method of achieving the result.  It would be much simpler to guarantee a minimum price and provide a market at that minimum price.</P>

      <P>I have not suggested a subsidy on transport.  It was some of the Deputy's friends who suggested that.  I think Deputy Cowan's friend, Deputy Cogan, suggested it: he might discuss it with him.  I do not think that a subsidy on transport would meet the position, but I think a guaranteed minimum price would meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies should bear one point in mind in regard to the whole question of imposing duties and imposing protection, particularly with regard to an industry such as tomato growing. There is a much greater number of consumers in the country than there is tomato growers.  I am all in favour of affording protection to the tomato <Col N="861" /> grower, I am in favour of developing the tomato industry; but I think it would be highly dangerous for the development of that industry if prices were allowed to rise so high as to breed a reaction on the part of consumers. The consumers are in much greater force and could wield much more influence politically than a few tomato growers.  Therefore, I think that the producers and the Minister, in looking after their interests, should always be very careful that, by affording high protection in any given cases, reaction should not be created which would be unfavourable to the development of the industry in the long run.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one more point before I sit down.  This guaranteed price was criticised by some Deputies as something extraordinary.  Is there not a guaranteed price for milk?  Is there not a guaranteed price for wheat?  Is there not a guaranteed price for most crops?</P>

      <P>I want to say at the outset that Deputy Oliver Flanagan was primarily responsible for having this motion placed on the Order Paper and I became associated with him.  It was the intention that Deputy Oliver Flanagan should speak first and move this motion.  Unfortunately he cannot be present and, in order to facilitate the business of the House, I have agreed to do so.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will not be denied that the River Shannon is the most important river that we have in this country, important from different angles.  It is the longest river in the country, travelling a distance of 224 miles from its source to the sea.  It is also the source from which we derive light and power and, for that reason, one would think when arterial drainage was being introduced that, from these two angles, it would be No. 1 on any priority list.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that that has not been the case and that it has been pushed very far down on that list.  As a result of that, thousands of pounds of valuable food and property have been lost to this State over a long number of years.  Farmers living along the Shannon and in the vicinity of the bank lose, year after year, what should be the reward of their labour throughout the summer months.  Their potatoes, oats and other grain crops, their hay and in many cases their turf have been swept away by the annual flooding of this river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems strange that any Government, <Col N="863" /> having any serious consideration for the people whom they call on in every emergency, ignore the terrible destruction that is being done, year after year, by the flooding of the River Shannon.  I am in the happy position in speaking to this motion that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance, Deputy Beegan, is even more intimately acquainted with the devastation done by the flooding of this river than I. There is no need for me or for any other Deputy in this House to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that it is one of the most urgent national problems we have.  I have no doubt either that if it lies within the power of the Parliamentary Secretary to carry out the terms of this motion, he will do so. I am afraid he will be handicapped by the fact that the mind which animated the drawing up of that priority list under the Arterial Drainage Act will militate against the Deputy because it definitely has been the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government that there are three types of land in this country when they consider the question of drainage, that is to say, there is the good land, and, as the Taoiseach has said recently, there is the marginal and the submarginal land.  Evidently, it was decided that the land along the River Shannon bank belongs to the third class.  Good arguments can be put forward to justify that point of view.  If you want quick results it is natural that you would develop and look after the good land first.</P>
    <P>I see the merits of that argument, but I think there is another point of view that should bear more heavily with the Government and with the Parliamentary Secretary and that is the need of these people who suffer from the flooding of the Shannon. That should be a very important factor and should weigh heavily.  I think it is right to say that the people who live along the Shannon would and do make far more use of their few acres than those who are in possession of the good lands in this country.  They are not people upon whom any form of compulsory tillage must be brought to bear to produce food.  Almost every <Col N="864" /> arable acre that can be found is put under the plough in order to produce food.  If there is any real intention on the part of this Government they will give immediate attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>One has only to stand on Shannon bridge on almost any day of the year and witness with one's own eyes the colossal losses which those people are suffering.  I am informed, and I believe rightly so, that, on one occasion when representations were made to the Taoiseach in regard to the flooding of the River Shannon, and it was pointed out to him that the maintaining of the high level of the river by the Electricity Supply Board was causing serious loss to the farmers, his reply was that if it could be proved that that was so the matter would be looked into.  Now that is a rather difficult thing to prove.  A thing may be obvious and yet may be difficult to prove.  I feel that that was an unfair onus to throw upon the deputation. But even if it were not so, and if the damage and losses sustained at the present time were no greater, is it suggested that nothing should be done to relieve the victims of this flooding? I do not think that is a proper attitude towards this matter.  I feel a duty devolves upon the Government to tackle this problem, and at once, and to give the Shannon the place it should have got when the priority list for the drainage of rivers was being drawn up.  On almost any day of the year, taking up the newspaper, one will see glaring headlines as well as photographs of people struggling for existence in the vicinity of the River Shannon.  One will see pictures of ricks of turf, of cocks of hay and of stacks of oats being swept away, and pictures of flooded pasture lands.  I do not understand how anybody shouldering the responsibility which devolves upon a Minister can look with indifference on such destruction and injustice.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we are particularly interested in the drainage of the River Shannon because we find ourselves in a dilemma which we cannot overcome, not as the result of the flooding of the Shannon but of the flooding of one of its tributaries&mdash;the <Col N="865" /> Suck.  Our engineers tell us that until the level of the Shannon is lowered it is impossible to tackle the problem of the Suck.  Indeed, it does not need any engineer to tell one that there is no sense in draining a tributary if the surface of the main river is higher than the waters of the tributary.  The people in the vicinity of the Suck are suffering in the same way as those in the vicinity of the Shannon.  I know that it may not be strictly in order to deal with this matter now, but I would like to give figures in connection with the Suck to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It drains an area of 16,500 acres, I rood and 14 perches, the number of parcels of land affected is 2,200 and the number of people affected 10,700.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am dealing with the tributary alone.  I have not at my disposal the number of people affected by the flooding of the Shannon, but they must be considerably greater.  If one combines those figures one realises it is time some Government tackled this problem.  If there be vested interests standing in the way I say the time must have arrived, after 30 years of native Government, when vested interests must be swept aside in the interests of the ordinary people of this country.  If freedom was worth anything, if freedom was worth fighting for, vested interests must not take priority over the interests of the ordinary peasantry of our country. Those who are in a position to judge in a technical way state, and I believe are prepared to back their arguments, that you could lower the surface level of the Shannon without reducing in any way current output.  I am sure that it is not beyond engineering skill to ensure that, while the requisite power will be maintained, the level of the water can be reduced so as to prevent the damage that is taking place at present.  As I said at the beginning, I am quite confident that if the decision was left to the Parliamentary Secretary the matter would be attended to.  I do not want to labour the point too much, but I believe that, as far as he is concerned personally, I am pushing an open door. <Col N="866" /> Now that the Parliamentary Secretary is a responsible member of the Government, I am exhorting him to use his influence and his knowledge to bring to bear on the Government as a whole that they have a duty to the people in the affected district and that they cannot in any justice stand idly by and allow these unfortunate people to be robbed year after year of the fruits of their toil, and still maintain that they are doing their duty by the country.  I do not propose to say anything further at this stage.  I will leave it to others to deal in a more detailed manner with the flooding down the lower regions of the Shannon.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy McQuillan is very anxious to speak on this motion.  He has been in the House all the evening, but I do not see him now.  I am sure somebody will inform him that the stage has been reached when he could contribute to this particular motion which, it seems to me, has been spoken of in a very sound and sensible way by the mover. Undoubtedly, the flooding of the Shannon has caused very extensive damage for years and, perhaps, for centuries.  In the past, during the many years during which I was associated with the particular locality around Athlone, I saw very extensive damage being done to crops and to people's property in the locality, and I often wondered whether something could not be done to ease the position.  To some extent, I feel the Shannon scheme has not eased the situation at all.  If that scheme is to be a success there must be a considerable storage of water in the upper reaches above Athlone.  If we have that storage, then the danger of flooding increases.  Suggestions have been made from time to time as to what might be done to ease the situation.  Questions have been asked. Debates have taken place.  I think it is fortunate for the mover of the motion and those who are interested in it that the Parliamentary Secretary has not only a personal knowledge of the situation, but has been intimately connected with the problem for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Everybody realises that a problem of this magnitude cannot be easily solved. Its solution will require considerable expenditure.  Its solution is really a matter for experts.  The problem is sufficiently important to be raised by way of motion, and it is big enough to call for the placing of complete knowledge at the disposal of the Government and the responsible Minister as to what can be done, if anything can be done, to deal with it satisfactorily in a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to deal with the heavy losses sustained year after year by farmers in that area. Losses have been sustained by their forefathers over many generations.  It has almost come to be accepted that damage from flooding is inevitable in these areas.  I have seen this flooding and the damage that results from it. I am not in a position to make any constructive suggestion, but I think it is a problem for which, with goodwill and determination on the part of everybody concerned, some solution can be found.  I have intervened for the purpose of supporting the motion and I hope that my intervention will encourage the Parliamentary Secretary to contribute to the debate from his wide store of personal experience apart from the knowledge at his disposal as the responsible authority and tell us what, in his view, will ease the flooding situation on the Shannon.</P>

      <P>I have been taken at somewhat short notice in regard to this matter, because there were two or three motions on the Paper before this one.  It was only late this evening I was notified that this was coming on. There is a good deal of data over in the Office of Public Works in connection with this matter, but I have not got access to it because the office is closed. Consequently what I say now is impromptu.  I have nothing prepared. I can only speak about the position from my own personal knowledge.</P>
      <P>This question of the Shannon drainage is one that has been before at least three native Governments.</P>
      <P>It was also before the Drainage Commission and Deputies who put down a motion of this kind should first of all, I think, read very carefully the findings of the Drainage Commission and the report that they made on the Shannon.  The Drainage Commission did make certain recommendations about carrying out certain works to give partial relief from flooding, but at no time did the Drainage Commission admit that flooding, after abnormal rainfalls, could be relieved, and that any attempt to do it would entail the spending of a colossal sum of money, which the benefits accruing therefrom would not justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon is the largest river in this country anyhow and, I believe, in what was one time known as the British Isles.  It is 130 miles in length from Lough Allen to the tidal waters at Corbally, near Limerick.  It has a catchment area of 4,020 square miles. In the 117 miles above Killaloe there is a fall of only 55 feet, and the fall from Killaloe to the tidal reach, a distance of 14 miles, is from 90 to 100 feet. Since 1930 the Shannon is under the direct control of the Board of Works and the Electricity Supply Board. Everybody understands what the Electricity Supply Board did by virtue of the 1925 Act, when they raised the level of the Shannon for a considerable distance, back almost as far as Meelick, below Portumna, at any rate. You would have a very big problem as <Col N="869" /> regards undertaking the draining of the Shannon if it were possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finan mentioned that he understands that the Electricity Supply Board levels, which are being maintained, are the cause to some extent of the flooding.  The experts of the Electricity Supply Board and also the Drainage Commission hold that what was done on the reservoirs at Lough Allen and Lough Rea, and also at Lough Derg, if anything has helped in some small degree to mitigate flooding.</P>
    <P>The question of the removal of obstacles was also mentioned in the Drainage Commission Report.  There were certain obstacles in the stretch of river between Athlone and Meelick.  I was down there myself with the commissioners in August.  We met the lock keeper at Meelick&mdash;a very intelligent man.  He pointed out and actually showed us the gauge where, at that time, he had kept the level of the water at least two inches below the navigation level.  He pointed out to us that while this was all right in the summer and in the dry period of the year, no matter how the level was reduced or lowered or even if the lock were taken away altogether, when you have abnormal rainfall, it did not matter in that case and it would give no relief whatsoever.</P>
    <P>According to the Drainage Commission Report, the record of the flow at Killaloe in the summer of 1904 was 52 cubic feet per second.  In January, 1915, during the heavy rains, it was 32,500 cubic feet per second, which shows the great variation between the normal summer flow and the abnormal flooding in winter periods&mdash;not in every winter but periodically, once in every five years.</P>
    <P>I am quite well aware of the great losses that have been sustained by the farmers along the River Shannon, particularly from Meelick to Athlone. That is the portion with which I am most conversant.  The question is, would this or any other Government be prepared to spend anywhere between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000 to carry out a comprehensive drainage scheme on the Shannon?  I attended conferences both during the period of office of Fianna Fáil, prior to 1948, and also during the period of office of the <Col N="870" /> inter-Party Government&mdash;I think Deputy O'Higgins was present at one conference at least in Shannonbridge&mdash; and I do not take advantage of being a member of the Opposition to try to throw over responsibility on the then Government which, I believe, they could not undertake.  I made it quite clear to the people in Shannonbridge on that occasion that unless the plight of the people along the Shannon banks could be relieved by methods other than drainage they would never be relieved by drainage.  I am still of that opinion.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that no Government would stand up in this House and justify an expenditure of £10,000,000 or £12,000,000.  That is the estimate that has been mentioned to me by the chief engineer and the assistant engineer as the likely minimum figure it would take, according to present-day costs, to carry out a comprehensive scheme on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The total acreage that the Drainage Commission estimated as being affected by flooding in their report was 24,000 acres.  When divided up, it would be 5,000 acres between Lough Allen and Lanesborough; between Lanesborough and Athlone, 2,550; between Athlone and Meelick, 9,260; and below Meelick, 7,190.  These are the figures they were given.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Finan that nothing has been done to relieve the plight of those people.  To my own knowledge, a certain amount has been done by the Land Commission to remedy their plight, but it has only had partial success.  I mean by migrating people from the area, but the difficulty was to get people to migrate, bad and all as their conditions there were.  Away back in the days of the old Congested Districts Board in 1914 or 1915, I know that a number of people in the townlands of Reask and Cartagh were given a portion of land in a place called Abbeylands, near Eyrecourt.  They were not asked to give up their old holdings, but could retain them.  They signed for the land and took it over.  The position is that, instead of going out and building houses on the portion of land which was given to them a distance away <Col N="871" /> from the floods, almost every one of them, in fact, I think every one of them, applied at a later stage to the Land Commission for permission to sell the land they had got, and they continued to live in the flooded area. In 1944 a survey of that particular area was made by the Land Commission at a time when the floods were there.  If I had access to the data I could bring into the House I would show clearly what the surveyor's computation of their losses and conditions was and what he suggested doing about it.  Then the Land Commission did take action, and acquired the Waller Estate at a place called Moystown, near Shannon Harbour.  What they proposed to do, and did, was to take five or six families from the townland of Reask and give them extra holdings there, with new houses, while leaving them in possession of the old holdings across the Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Flanagan to put his name to this motion pointing out the plight of the people in the flooded areas, but when the Land Commission were proposing to do that Deputy Flanagan was one of the Deputies who were very vocal in their agitation against taking those people across into Offaly.  That creates a precedent for the people of Westmeath if at some later stage an attempt is made by the Land Commission to take the people out of Clonowen and Derrycahill and take them where land is available in Westmeath. If that were decided for the people in Clonowen and Derrycahill and in villages in or near Athlone I am prepared to bet a penny to a penny anyway that they would migrate only a short distance east of Athlone because of the case they have made to the Land Commission inspectors that they want to be near Athlone market town and the very fine schools that are there for their children.</P>

      <P>As far as the Shannon area is concerned around Lusmagh, Ballymacoolaghan and other townlands there, the difficulty is for the Land Commission to get land in the immediate vicinity whereby they could take away some of the people and have a proper rearrangement of their holdings.  That is very badly needed because in that particular district you have land holders or tenants with smallholdings in several different patches.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here to speak the blunt, brutal and candid truth as far as the drainage of the Shannon is concerned, and my belief is that it will not come in our generation and that all expert advice is against it.  But what I would like to see is a motion asking that a solution of those people's difficulties be found by some other means and that they be treated as a special entity like the undeveloped areas and so on.  To that end I have put up a memorandum to the Land Commission asking them to make an economic survey in conjunction with engineers of the Office of Public Works of the whole Shannon area to see if something can be done.  I believe that the only solution for the Shannon area is to take the people who are prepared to migrate and give them holdings elsewhere, and when the rearrangement is carried out to provide the people whose houses are periodically flooded with new houses on sites which will be safe from a recurrence of flooding in future.  That, in my opinion, is the only solution that could be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other things could be done as well, however.  Along the Shannon we have a number of small towns and the pretty big town of Athlone, which is going ahead well industrially.  If we could secure industries for the other towns I believe that the lot of the people along the Shannon basin would be relieved in a much better way than by going ahead with the comprehensive drainage of the Shannon, which would <Col N="873" /> cost millions and millions of pounds. If a quarter or even one-fifth of the money it would take to drain the Shannon were expended in that way even over a period of years it would be of greater benefit to the people concerned than an attempt to carry out a drainage scheme which would never give an economic return.  Remember that we have a number of catchment areas and that everyone&mdash;and, I suppose, rightly so&mdash;is pressing for the drainage of the catchment in his constitutency. They are pressing for a survey to be made in that particular catchment and drainage proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Brosna is, I hope, nearing completion.</P>
    <P>We have the Glyde and Dee and the Feale, the Corrib and the Moy, all of them pretty big catchment areas. They have to be dealt with now anyhow. That decision was come to.  In at least one instance the decision was come to by my predecessor.  In another he had it on the stocks and I was not going to take the responsibility of altering that and putting it back.  That has to be gone on with now.  It is the River Moy.  I cannot make any promise, nor do I propose to make any promise, as to what other rivers or catchment areas will be taken after the survey of the Moy is completed.  It would be premature to do so and I shall not do it.  When the time comes, if I am still here, as I stated in the House the other night, I will have recourse to the advice and judgment of the people in my office who are capable of deciding in a very detached way the schemes that should be proceeded with when the Corrib and Moy are completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reply I can give to the Deputy in that case is that the Brosna has been proceeded with and is being drained into the Shannon.  The people in the Shannon basin hold that it will deteriorate the position.  The people in the office maintain that it will not and are hoping that it will not.  I believe that, if it does not, it will probably make the problem of the Suck easier to be faced.  That is all that I can say on that.</P>
      <P>I have given an outline of what the Land Commission attempted to do. Since the Waller estate was divided there was a large estate taken over at Clonfert demesne, the estate of J.A.B. Trench, and a big number of uneconomic holders from Reask and Cartagh are being provided for there and they are also being permitted to retain their old holdings.  Indeed, I could term them nothing but bog holdings and cutaway bog.  Nobody else would take them and it was just as well to leave them to the holders.</P>
      <P>The position in the two townlands that have been most affected and that have always been first affected by abnormal flooding has been almost fully remedied.  There are, possibly, a couple of families there yet and some of them, I think, would not migrate.  We are told that flooding has rendered the land almost useless.  It could be possible that, owing to the nature of the land, if a comprehensive drainage scheme were carried out, the land would be much worse and that the callow land along the Shannon would be aerated to such an extent and become so dried that the grass that would grow on it would be much inferior to the grass and hay that grow on it now.  Last year, an acre of callow land that was allocated to a tenant&mdash;a number of tenants got an acre each of callow land not far from the Shannon some years ago&mdash;was put up for public auction by the owner, and a neighbouring farmer bought it. He did not seem to consider it valueless. He paid the handsome some of £135 for a statute acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear people talking of relieving <Col N="875" /> those people of annuities and rates.  It cannot be done under existing legislation unless it can be proved that the land is submerged for 12 months of the year.  That would not bring very much relief and I do not think a very strong case could be made for it because any of the callow land along that area is valuable land, perhaps not so valuable now as it was in years gone by because of the fact that there is so much mechanised transport in the country.  Years ago, the callow land of Clonburn was very valuable land and the hay coming to Athlone and Ballinasloe commanded a higher price than rye grass of the uplands. That may not be the position now but valuable hay is got there yet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan hinted that something should be done to find a solution.  I believe the only solution that can be found is on the lines I have indicated. If a number of people are prepared to migrate and if the Land Commission settle down to it and provide land not very far away from where the people are at present domiciled, that is part of the solution.  The second part is that those who remain behind and whose houses are periodically flooded should be given generous grants and, if necessary, sites should be acquired, compulsorily if necessary, in order to enable them to erect houses that would be immune from flooding.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies would ask that this matter would be considered in conjunction with consideration of the undeveloped areas.  The greater part of the area concerned is in the undeveloped areas.  If there is local initiative, I am sure the board that has been established under the recent Act will be prepared to give every assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say any more on this motion.  Before it is put to a division, I would like to hear something more constructive as to how we can solve the problem of the people affected than has been yet brought out in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Finan on tabling this motion, and I should like to chide the Parliamentary Secretary for his reluctance to tell the House of his undoubted <Col N="876" /> experience over a number of years of this extremely difficult problem.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anyone on any side of the House who could imagine that the arterial drainage of the river Shannon, by far the biggest river in Great Britain or Ireland, is an undertaking that could be accomplished by any Government overnight. It is not.  It is one of the largest arterial drainage problems that could face any country.  Undoubtedly, the magnitude of the problem must be considered by any junior Minister who is responsible for drainage.  I do not propose to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should direct his policy towards the arterial drainage of the river Shannon because I do not think that that could be accomplished.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that the drainage of the Shannon would cost between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000.  That may or may not be correct.  It may be an estimate made at the time the Drainage Commission sat, or it may be an up-to-date figure.  Apart from cost, the actual engineering problem would be stupendous.  Accordingly, the position may be, as the Parliamentary Secretary has put it, that we will not see the arterial drainage of the Shannon in our lifetime.</P>
      <P>Accepting that, as I think we must, we still have to face the fact that all down the banks of the Shannon, particularly from Meelick to Athlone, there exists what is undoubtedly a desolated area&mdash;thousands of families living on the very brink of disaster, existing on land subject to flooding, and incurring perennially hardship and loss.  Those are facts that will not be disputed.  There is no member of the House more keenly aware of them, I think, than the present Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is there.  It is correct to say that, since the Shannon scheme was initiated, there are farmers living along the Shannon who will tell you, who told me, and I am sure told the Parliamentary Secretary, of splendid patches of ground which grew potatoes and that were tilled in the early twenties which to-day will grow <Col N="877" /> nothing.  They are convinced that the initiation of the Shannon hydroelectric scheme has undoubtedly contributed to the flooding of their land. It is no good telling them, as I witnessed representatives of the board of works telling them, that statistics show that there has been no increased flooding of the Shannon since the initiation of the Shannon scheme. That just will not be accepted, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that there is all down the Shannon banks a widely-held belief that their troubles, if they did not start in the late twenties, certainly were considerably increased by the Shannon hydro-electric scheme.  That is one matter that must be considered in relation to this problem.  I know that down near Lusmagh, not far from Banagher some years ago, when the Shannon was in full spate and considerable damage was being done, there was nearly a minor rebellion because one of Guinness's barges overturned and its cargo was thrown into the water, but, lo and behold, in a matter of hours the flooding was controlled through the operation of the sluice gates and Guinness were able to recover their stout.  The farmers who found their turf and their hay being swept away and their homes being flooded found it very hard to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it was in the early spring but I am not quite certain. In any event, a considerable volume of discontent has grown up over a number of years because the people along this area feel that they have been neglected.  I do not say that they were neglected only by the former Fianna Fáil Government.  I think that <Col N="878" /> this problem did not get the attention it should have got from the inter-Party Government.  I said that here, I have said it in conference and I have said it publicly, because I do not think that, up to now, the Office of Public Works had in charge of it a person who understands and appreciates the problem as intimately as the present Parliamentary Secretary.  I have said that there is this volume of discontent, suspicion, indeed, amongst the people of the area, believing as they do that the Electricity Supply Board has in some way contributed to their misfortunes, believing, as they do, undoubtedly, that there is no one in the Government or outside the Government prepared to do anything on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Added to that discontent, unfortunately, along the banks of the Shannon, there is also the further uneasiness created by the drainage of the River Brosna.  The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned that, and I do not think there is anyone who has witnessed the work carried out on the Brosna who can praise it sufficiently highly.  The scheme is a magnificent one; it has undoubtedly relieved the callows from Pullagh right back into Banagher and has opened up acres and acres of land formerly subject to flooding.  That is to the credit side of the scheme, but the people between Meelick and Athlone are firmly convinced that the water taken off the Boora bog and the callows is being sailed down right on top of their land.  They ask what is the sense in draining a huge catchment area and turning a neglected river like the Brosna into a well-banked watercourse, a watercourse that carries undoubtedly a much greater volume of water than it did in the past, and bringing all that down into the Shannon.  They feel that the drainage of the Brosna will add to the hardship of their lot in the future.  I do not know whether that is correct or not. It is undoubtedly an engineering question and an engineering problem, and I am quite certain that engineering advice would not have permitted the drainage of the Brosna to be initiated if damage or increased flooding were to result along the Shannon, but there, undoubtedly, is the local belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> I mention these matters because I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary who has lived with this problem for a number of years to allow familiarity to breed contempt.  I am certain it will not but it is well for him to appreciate that all along the banks of the Shannon the years of inactivity that have gone by have added considerably to the local problem and to local grievances.  To-day farmers who at the moment are flooded along the Shannon hear appeals by the Government for increased tillage, for more production and more food, and they undoubtedly feel that the situation is far from right and that the Government would be better served in assisting them in some way to deal with their own perennial production problems.  That being the situation and accepting, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that a complete comprehensive drainage of the Shannon is not feasible, I should like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;he is himself a member of the Shannon drainage committee &mdash; that the Government should give urgent consideration to the recommendations of the Drainage Commission of 1940 in relation to the limited drainage of the Shannon. Undoubtedly, a considerable amount of work could be done on the Shannon, short of arterial or comprehensive drainage &mdash; the removal of obstacles, the repair of fallen-in banks in certain areas and other works within the definition of drainage. That course was suggested and recommended when the Drainage Commission considered the drainage problem of the country.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago the Shannon Drainage Association went to considerable trouble to prepare an engineering plan for the carrying out of such a form of limited drainage and obstacle removal on the Shannon. That plan was submitted to the Office of Public Works, bedecked by the signatures of Deputies, including the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy McQuillan, and other Deputies.  We urged the point of view that consideration should at least be given to the removal of the major obstacles and <Col N="880" /> the freeing of the flow of water on the river.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary did not deal in more detail with the possibility of carrying out that limited form of drainage work.  I do not know what the cost would be, but the cost which was estimated at that time by our committee was, if my recollection is correct, something in the neighbourhood of £500,000.  If the expenditure of £500,000 on the Shannon will reduce in some way the danger of flooding&mdash;in view of the large acreage at present subject to flooding&mdash;I think such expenditure would be well worth while.  Money has, unfortunately, been misspent from time to time as a result of bad information or bad advice and certainly the expenditure of £500,000 on the Shannon&mdash;even if the work were of a highly experimental nature&mdash;is an expenditure which I should regard as an investment.  If that cannot be done or if the Government are unwilling to do it, they will still have the problem of the desolated areas to deal with.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister for Lands was in the House for portion of this discussion because undoubtedly the conditions along the Shannon are conditions which must primarily be the concern of the Land Commission. Apart altogether from any help which the Land Commission may be able to give, I should like to know whether the Government has considered the possibility of buying all the land within a certain distance of the Shannon, and which is now included in the acreage subject to flooding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid you would not get agreement on that from the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the price.  It might be that, if the land were purchased at an attractive price, sufficient capital might be made available to the people concerned to enable them to purchase land elsewhere or to purchase lands as they came on the market.  If the people concerned had the capital, they might be able to find suitable land in their own area far quicker, perhaps, than the Land Commission might be able to find it.  However, that is only a suggestion, and it <Col N="881" /> may not be practicable.  Certainly, the Land Commission would have my support in any effort it might make to ease the intolerable situation that exists all along this area.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, quite a number of men who are termed &ldquo;landowners&rdquo; own a bit of land at one end of a field, another bit of land at another end of the field and have, maybe, little patches of land all along areas near to the Shannon.  I suppose the problem is a social one but considerable assistance could be given by the Land Commission to ease the lot of these people.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give immediate consideration to some form of limited drainage along the Shannon.  The Parliamentary Secretary has now absolute knowledge of the problem. He has more machinery than was available two or three years ago.  He has the goodwill of all sections of this House in tackling the problem, even on a limited scale.  Even if he feels that the problem is too big to be tackled, I do not think he need fear any unfair political opposition provided he can give some token to us that his appreciation of the problem will be translated into action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of this debate has been very gentlemanly.  I must say that I am rather surprised that a more vigorous approach was not made to this problem both by the Parliamentary Secretary and the other Deputies who have spoken.  So far, most of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter are very closely in touch with the Shannon drainage problem through various deputations they have introduced to different Governments and also by reason of the fact that many of the members of the House are also members of different drainage committees within the vicinity of the Shannon.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is as anxious as anybody in this House to do the best he can.  I do not agree, however, that the problem is beyond solution.  It would appear from the remarks of Deputies that there is no hope of a comprehensive scheme for the drainage of the Shannon catchment area being undertaken <Col N="882" /> in our lifetime.  That is the sum total of the remarks passed here to-night on this motion.  At any rate, that is news of a sort for the people who are so vitally concerned.  The people who live in the flooded areas along the Shannon should at any rate be told what the position is, whether there is any hope of relieving the hardships they have been suffering for the last 40 or 50 years.  I am glad that, so far as lay in his power, the Parliamentary Secretary has cleared the decks and pointed out that there is little hope of this problem being tackled in our lifetime.</P>
      <P>I have already said that I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is sincerely anxious to do the best he can. Whether people in this House like it or not, I say that I do not believe the engineering staff behind him are as anxious as the Parliamentary Secretary to carry out this essential work. Without introducing any personalities, it is quite evident in all walks of life that the older a man gets the more he is inclined to take a conservative view. I believe that the conservative view or the easy way out is being taken by many of those whose responsibility it is to this State to carry out essential drainage works.  That lack of energy or enthusiasm may come from lack of confidence in their own ability to carry out such essential works.  I do not deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence to support my contention in this respect.  We all know that the first real approach to arterial drainage was taken when the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 was passed.  That was really getting down to brass tacks. Owing to the fact that the war was on and that it was difficult to get machinery, etc., it was not possible to get the first scheme under way under the 1945 Act until 1948.  In 1948, the first scheme under the Act was commenced on the River Brosna.  Most Deputies will remember that not so long ago in this House we were given the reasons why the Brosna catchment area was undertaken first.  It might be no harm to have it on record again that one of the reasons why the Brosna catchment area was put first on the priority list was that, so far as the <Col N="883" /> engineering section were concerned, the Brosna presented a less difficult proposition than any of the other catchment areas and that, as far as they were concerned, they were starting off on new ground and were undertaking a type of drainage work which they had never hitherto envisaged in this country.  Consequently, I think we cannot blame them for picking what, to their mind, was the easiest scheme. Nobody can blame the engineering staff for tackling the Brosna because it was an easy scheme so far as they were concerned.  Naturally, as it was their first dive in the dark, they were anxious not to come up against the tricky or intricate problems they might have to face on arterial drainage schemes on the Suck or the Corrib or many other large catchment areas that will have at some time to be dealt with.  I want to bring it home forcibly to Deputies that lack of confidence is apparent in the engineering section of the Office of Works, lack of confidence in their ability to tackle a scheme of the magnitude of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary under the inter-Party Government, Deputy Donnellan, found himself in the same boat as the present Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Donnellan showed the same anxiety when he had responsibility as Parliamentary Secretary as Deputy Beegan has shown to-day.  But all the good wishes in the world and all the enthusiasm are not enough to break down the prejudices of the engineering staff.  Therefore, we must accept the position in our lifetime&mdash;the Shannon is a closed problem as far as drainage is concerned.</P>
    <P>The position along the Shannon, as far as the people there are concerned, is that, for years past, they have lived in hopes that something would be done.  Year after year, deputation after deputation went to the different Ministers of the various Governments in power, hoping for success in their efforts either to have a drainage scheme carried out on the Shannon or else that they would be recompensed for the loss they suffer owing to flooding every year.  Every time there <Col N="884" /> is a general election hope runs high in the breasts of those dwellers along the Shannon, but I think the day has come at last when little or no political capital can be made out of this drainage problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this motion is on the Order Paper, if for no other purpose than to get a statement from all sides of the House, a statement giving information, at any rate, as to what can be done for those people who live along the Shannon.  I think that the motion is useful in so far as it will give definite proof to those unfortunate people that there can be no hope held out to them of a major arterial drainage scheme being undertaken in our lifetime.  Now, having satisfied them on that, and I think it is a useful thing to have satisfied them on it, we might be able to get down to an alternative solution.  As long as you have people living in hope that some major work would be carried out along the Shannon, and as long as that hope existed, then it was only with reluctance that you could get any assent from those who are being flooded out to move elsewhere if suitable holdings were made available.  Once that little spark of hope was held out to them, that, at some date, be it in the near or distant future, a major scheme would be carried out, and that there was the possibility that their lands which are now flooded for six months of the year would be once more fit to be utilised for tillage purposes, then the people living in those areas hesitated to give their consent to change elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a suggestion which has been made before, both by deputations and by Deputies in this House, to the effect that a limited drainage scheme be carried out on the Shannon.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself is well aware that such recommendations have been made before, and I am sorry at this stage that we have not an opportunity of hearing from him his views in that respect.  I think myself that if you consider the results of a limited scheme, you will find that the cost of it, according to the information that is available, at any rate, will be out of all proportion <Col N="885" /> to the amount of land that would be reclaimed and brought back to productivity. In other words, the same argument can be put up against carrying out a limited drainage scheme as can be put up against carrying out a major arterial drainage scheme&mdash;the cost was prohibitive for the return which would be achieved.  I would prefer if the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know to-night for certain whether or not it is envisaged at some stage in the near future to carry out a limited drainage scheme on the lines that have often been suggested to the Board of Works in the past.</P>
    <P>So far, to-night, no Deputy put up the case that drainage, even a major drainage scheme on the Shannon, might not be as useful as all would expect.  I have heard people who are interested in the drainage of the Shannon suggest that, if it is considered impossible to carry out a major scheme, steps be taken all along the Shannon valley to carry out a proper afforestation scheme.  I do not know how that suggestion would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I propose to enlarge upon it in this connection.  If we assume now, once and for all, that the drainage of the Shannon is to be cut out, then the next thing we should do is to get down to the problem of offering alternative accommodation to the people who at present exist along or are in close proximity to the Shannon, as well as to those people who try to make a living near the various tributaries of the Shannon.  I think mention was made by Deputy Finan of one particular tributary of the Shannon, the River Suck.  That is a river with which both the Parliamentary Secretary and myself are very familiar.  I think we have good cause to be familiar with that same river.  Now, the Suck flows into the River Shannon, and the Suck is another headache for the drainage section of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>The Brosna scheme has been under way for a considerable time and, I believe, is now almost completed. Opinions vary as to whether the extra flow of water from the Brosna catchment area into the Shannon is going to affect adversely the people who live <Col N="886" /> along the Shannon itself.  That is a problem that has yet to be resolved. No doubt, if the question of carrying out a drainage scheme on the tributary of the Shannon known as the Suck arises, and if that scheme is tackled similar worries will face not alone the Board of Works engineers but the people likely to be affected along the Shannon valley.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy about the reply given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the proposed drainage of the River Suck.  A promise was given to me by his predecessor that a survey party of engineers would be on the River Suck around July or August of 1951.  We will not feel the time slipping by until July, 1952, is upon us and, so far, there is no sign of any engineering or survey party that I know of coming to tackle the initial problem connected with the drainage of the Suck.  The reason I mention the River Suck is that it is a tributary of the Shannon and the very same problem faces the authorities, when they tackle the problem of flooding on the Shannon, as face them on the River Suck.  There are villages along the Suck which at times of the year are practically surrounded by water.  The very same problem exists along the Shannon, so that it would only be common sense if the problem of the Shannon and its tributaries were all tackled at the same time.  In other words, it would be much better, when dealing with these people whose land is flooded along or near the Shannon, if steps were taken at the same time to solve the problems of the people whose land is flooded along the River Suck and other tributaries of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>In connection with that problem, I believe that the only solution, barring arterial drainage, is to remove these people from the flooded areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that objections had been raised by Deputies and by people outside because unfortunate flood sufferers were removed from one side of the Shannon to the other, but the Parliamentary Secretary is big enough and courageous enough to ignore what I believe to be unchristian tactics on the part of these <Col N="887" /> people.  There is a danger, however, that if alternative holdings are offered to people along the Shannon, and if these holdings are 50, 60 or 70 miles away from the areas in which they were reared, the people may not be inclined to go, but that danger can be got over very easily.  So far as the Clonown area, with which I am familiar and which is really the main problem along the Shannon, is concerned, if steps were taken by the Land Commission to carry out a proper survey of the flooded area, and if the people whose lands and houses are affected by the floods were interviewed, I believe it would be found that a majority of these people are willing to move out of that locality, provided they get decent holdings elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that they want to move only a short distance from their present position, that they want to be near the town of Athlone, and so forth. That is perfectly true, and it is only natural that it should be so.  People do not like to tear up their roots and move many miles away from the areas in which they were born, and, especially in the case of the Clonown area which is very near Athlone, the people have very close ties with that town.  They have traded there for years; many of their children have secured work in the factories in Athlone, and the youngsters attend first class schools, national, secondary and vocational, in Athlone.  Naturally, they cannot be expected to feel anxious about moving up to Kinnegad or on to some portion of Meath.  I do not think that presents any very great difficulty at all, because, to my own personal knowledge, there is plenty of suitable land available for distribution in County Westmeath within a reasonable distance of Athlone.</P>
    <P>I had a question on the Order Paper to-day with regard to one farm&mdash;the Talbot farm at Garry Castle, outside Athlone.  I have been after the Land Commission for the past couple of years to interest them in acquiring this farm.  I do not know at this stage what purpose the Land Commission will put this farm to, but I believe it would be an ideal farm to give to <Col N="888" /> some of the Clonown people who at present suffer from flooding.  Nobody in this House is in a position to say what the Land Commission will do at any time, but it is no harm to impress on them the necessity of making available as much land as they possibly can acquire in Westmeath to solve this Clonown problem.  I know that it is the desire of the people in these areas to get land as near as possible to a town such as Athlone.  That is only natural.  All their ties are connected with the town, and it would be too much to expect them to start out anew in fresh territory where they have little or no contacts or connections.</P>
    <P>Many well-intentioned people have suggested that the land in question along the Shannon and the Suck should be de-rated, that it should be given at a nominal cost to the people who are flooded.  I think that type of suggestion does more harm than good. I do not believe for a moment in allowing people to use those lands at a nominal cost.  The suggestion has been made also that houses be built further back, so that the actual dwellings themselves would be free from flooding. I do not think that suggestion would be a solution to the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I hesitate at this stage to suggest in a big way what would deal with the whole Shannon basin, but I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary has ever considered that the Shannon itself, from the point of view of fisheries and of the tourist trade, could be made a very attractive proposition.  I know, for a fact, that a little over a hundred years ago the catch of salmon from the Shannon was in the region of £300,000 in a year.  That was over a hundred years ago, and that was a time when salmon sold at 1d. a lb.  In that river alone there is to-day, if properly developed, a first-class means of balancing our payments.</P>

      <P>The return from the fishing alone was tremendous. There is no need for me to emphasise what a similar catch would mean to the people as a whole here to-day. That is only one aspect of the matter. A large number of tourists would be delighted to go on the Shannon every year, provided that facilities were made available for them, including boats and what I might describe as hunting lodges.</P>
      <P>In order to make a proper success of the Shannon itself from a fishing and a tourist point of view, I think it would be essential, first of all, for the people there to understand that there is no hope now of a comprehensive drainage scheme being undertaken and that the best thing for them would be to accept a change of holding or suitable compensation from the State.  Having got the decision from the people that they are willing to leave, the Shannon problem should be handed over to a special body and the first move that could be made along it&mdash;in so far as it is possible at the moment; how far it is possible I cannot say&mdash;would be a thorough examination to see what afforestation schemes can be carried out there.  It is not necessary to emphasise to the members of this House the tremendous aid that afforestation is to drainage.  One of the main causes of the tremendous flooding in recent years is mainly the lack of afforestation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know perfectly well that the Parliamentary Secretary has no responsibility for the afforestation programme.  That, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Lands&mdash;but I do think that in a matter of such importance as the drainage of the Shannon or the problem that arises from lack of drainage of the Shannon the Parliamentary Secretary would have the assistance of his colleague, the <Col N="890" /> Minister for Lands&mdash;that is, in connection with the afforestation side of it.  I think he would also have the assistance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so that between them they would be able to put up a strong case to the Minister for Finance.  In my little experience of this House, I have found that there is no use in approaching the Department of Finance unless you have the backing of several other Departments which may be interested as well.  I think that a case could be put up for the Department of Finance to tackle, first of all, the problem of removing those people whose land is flooded along the Shannon area to suitable holdings elsewhere and then making good use of the land which they leave behind. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Some days ago I put down a question to the Minister for External Affairs asking him whether his attention had been drawn to the fact that in recordings broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation of the reading of the proclamation of accession of the new British Sovereign wherein she was described as &ldquo;Queen of Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and, if so, whether the Government proposed to take steps to refute the assumption of sovereignty by Britain over Ireland thus implied.  When I drafted this question the subsequent announcement of the styles and titles of the new queen of England had not been promulgated.  The question related to the reading of the Proclamation of Accession which was read throughout different parts of England immediately following upon the death of the late King of Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I put down the question, not anticipating that it would cause the Minister for External Affairs any difficulty.  I felt it was a matter to which his attention should be drawn and did not anticipate that it would lead to any acrimonious discussions at Question Time.  The Minister, in replying, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy appears to be confusing the Proclamation of Accession <Col N="891" /> of the new British Sovereign which was made in London with the form used in some Commonwealth countries.  No mention of Ireland was included in the London Proclamation of Accession, but in some Commonwealth countries and, later, when the styles and titles of Queen Elizabeth II were recited by the Garter King-at-Arms at the burial ceremony at Windsor, the British statutory form, which mentions Ireland, was used.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the Deputy is, of course, aware, the existing statutory form of royal title was adopted by British Royal Proclamation on the 22nd June, 1948, and during the past three and a half years has been in constant use by the British Government. The assumption of sovereignty it implies is well known not to be accepted by the Irish people or the Irish Government.  In view of our Constitution, which clearly sets out wherein lies the sovereignty of Ireland, and of the obvious political facts, any more formal refutation would not seem likely at present to serve any effective purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no confusion whatsoever in my mind as to the question I put to the Minister.  Through some rather extraordinary process of the Press, various reports were published in our newspapers immediately following upon the death of the late King of Great Britain to the effect that the British Royal Title had been changed in some respects.  Simultaneously with those reports, recordings of the Proclamation read in London proclaimed the new Queen as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland.  I felt that it would be well to have these matters cleared up. I felt, too, that on the coming into power of a new sovereign in Great Britain, it was essential that we should make our position clear if that new sovereign claimed sovereignty, either directly or by inference, over Ireland.</P>
    <P>As some acrimonious discussions followed between the Minister and myself at Question Time.  I felt it would be well to raise this matter on the <Col N="892" /> Adjournment so that it could be cleared up fully.  As I said at the outset, I put down this question to the Minister not anticipating that it would give him any difficulty, and hoping that it would provide him with an opportunity of making the position clear.</P>
    <P>This is the first time that a new British Sovereign has claimed sovereignty over this State since the Repeal of the External Relations Act, and I think it well that such claim to sovereignty should be clearly repudiated.  I do not suggest that it should be done in any bombastic or antagonistic manner.  A notification will, no doubt, be sent, through its diplomatic channels, by the British Government to all the governments of the world announcing that a new Queen of Great Britain and Ireland has been proclaimed and now reigns.  That claim to sovereignty over Ireland, is, of course, what is known as a &ldquo;claim of pretension,&rdquo; but even if it be merely a &ldquo;claim of pretension,&rdquo; I feel it is both necessary and desirable that a formal notification should go from this Government to the governments of all other countries intimating that this Government regards this assumption of sovereignty merely as a &ldquo;claim of pretension,&rdquo; and that, of course, Ireland is an independent sovereign Republic which does not recognise any form of overlordship by the head of any other State.  The Minister, I think somewhat unworthily in his reply to-day, sought to suggest that I was displaying surprise at the assumption of sovereignty by the British Sovereign over Ireland, but that, in fact, this position had obtained since the 22nd of June, 1948.</P>
    <P>I was not surprised that this claim was made.  The position has obtained far longer than since the 22nd June, 1948.  The position of the British Royal Title is that it originally rested on an Act of William III passed in 1696, which settled the succession of the Crown of England and Ireland on Sophia of Hanover and &ldquo;the heirs of her body being Protestants&rdquo;.  Finally, in 1917, the British Royal Family's description was changed to &ldquo;the House and Family of Windsor&rdquo;.  In 1927 the present form of the British <Col N="893" /> Royal Title was evolved and remained unchanged until, I think, the passage of the Indian Independence Act of 1947 in England, which, by Section 7, altered the Royal Title by omitting from it &ldquo;Emperor of India&rdquo;.  That Act, which is the Act under this Proclamation to which the Minister refers was issued, became law in England on the 18th July, 1947.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister or the Government is in any way to blame or responsible for the fact that the British Crown should still assume a title from which sovereignty might be inferred in respect to this country. It is probably unwise from the point of view of the British Government and Crown to continue to assert a &ldquo;title of pretension&rdquo; of this kind, but so long as an assumption of this kind is made, an assumption which clearly conveys a claim to sovereignty, it is necessary that we should, on the accession of any new Sovereign in Britain that chooses to claim sovereignty over the country, make it clear beyond doubt to the other Governments of the world that we do not admit that claim of sovereignty. This can be done quite politely.  There is no necessity for any friction, but I think a formal notification should be sent to the other Governments of the world who will have been notified formally of the accession of the new Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. In so far as Ireland is concerned, that is merely a &ldquo;title of pretension&rdquo; which is not accepted by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider that very seriously.  It is a matter of some importance.  It is a new precedent.  Until the 18th April, 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948, came into operation here, it would have been difficult to take that step, in that, by the External Relations Act, we not merely had a British Sovereign as part of our constitutional machinery but we also, in fact, accepted the British Sovereign as King of Great Britain and Ireland by sub-section (2), Section 3, of the External Relations Act.</P>

      <P>If the Act was unconstitutional that Act had no validity or force.  But we presume it was constitutional as it was passed by this House in 1936 and was not set aside by the courts.  Therefore it was a legal Act.  By it we made the Act of Abdication of King Edward VIII of Great Britain part of our law.  We provided in sub-section (2), Section 3, that the Act of Abdication &ldquo;shall have effect according to the tenor thereof&rdquo; for the purposes of the External Relations Act &ldquo;and all other (if any) purposes,&rdquo; and then went on to provide that the King who would succeed Edward VIII would be King for &ldquo;these purposes.&rdquo;  The Act of Abdication described the King as &ldquo;King of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  Until the repeal of that Act by this House it would have been difficult to take any exception to the facts that the British Sovereign described himself as King of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>

      <P>Quite the worst thing the Deputy does is to preach and I must say he has very great impudence in preaching to me about not treating this matter in a contentious manner after his false description of the procedure here by which the Dáil got rid of the King out of this country in spite of the Deputy's friends of the last few years.  I have not time in the ten minutes at my disposal to deal with all the aspects of the matter but the Deputy said here to-night that this is the first time a British Sovereign has claimed sovereignty over Ireland since the repeal of the External Relations Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The repeal of the External Relations Act is what the Deputy said.  However, I will take the other phrase, the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act, as it was called.  The Deputy has a very short memory and a very convenient memory.  If this Proclamation of Accession read in some parts of the Commonwealth is an effective claim to sovereignty by a British Sovereign over Ireland, then this is not the first time such a claim has been made, and, to the knowledge of the Deputy, it is not the first time since the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act.  When the British Ambassador was accredited <Col N="896" /> here on June 23rd, 1950, he presented to the Deputy this document: &ldquo;George VI, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Sea, King, Defender of the Faith, etc., etc....&rdquo; That was handed in to the Deputy's own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>True.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And not alone on one occasion, but on several occasions. Yet the Deputy says this is the first time a British Sovereign has claimed sovereignty over this part of our country since the repeal of the External Relations Act.  I have given the Deputy now one occasion on which a document was handed into his hands in which the British Sovereign claimed that, by the Grace of God, he was King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas and Defender of the Faith.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22nd July, 1950, there was another such document, a document which refutes the Deputy's suggestion now that this is the first time a British Sovereign claimed sovereignty over Ireland because again on that date, 22nd July, 1950, in the fourteenth year of his reign, George Rex describing himself as &ldquo;By the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith,&rdquo; suggested that the Deputy as Minister for External Affairs should take a second gentleman here as ambassador. Again, after the Repeal of the External Relations Act on 9th June, 1949, another ambassador was sent here, and the document handed to the Deputy was in similar terms.  The Deputy cannot get away with that sort of prevarication very long, and he should stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that I was trying to create confusion to-day when I said that he was alluding in his question to the official Proclamation of <Col N="897" /> Accession in Britain.  What did the Deputy ask?  He referred to &ldquo;recordings of the reading of the Proclamation of Accession of the new British Sovereign.&rdquo;  There was one principal Proclamation of Accession and that was in London when the Accession Council solemnly met members of the British Government and proclaimed the new Queen as their sovereign, and in that proclamation they did not address her or describe her as Sovereign of Ireland.  They talked about Queen of this realm and other realms, head of the Commonwealth, but they did not say Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. So far as I am aware that was only done in a couple of Commonwealth countries where the lawyers took the view that, according to their domestic law, the new sovereign had to be proclaimed according to the statutory royal style and title, and the statutory royal style and title is the style and title which the late King gave himself when he addressed letters through the Deputy, and when the Deputy accepted those letters as Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Without any public protest or any protest of any kind. Another point Deputy MacBride made was that he was alluding to something merely in reference to the B.B C. in his question.  He talked about this Proclamation of Accession and asked me to take steps to refute the assumption of sovereignty by Britain&mdash;not by some announcer in the B.B.C. but by Britain.  It is quite clear, therefore, that the Deputy had in his mind when he put down the question that he was asking me about the official proclamation in Britain and about the assumption in it by Britain of sovereignty over Ireland.  I told the Deputy quite plainly early to-day that there is no one here who for a moment accepts this claim of sovereignty by Britain over Ireland.</P>

For the last three years Deputy MacBride was sitting alongside men in Government who in the past drove the Oath of Allegiance to the British King down our throats.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that I repudiate completely Deputy MacBride's suggestion that I in any way misinterpreted his question this afternoon in my reply to it.  I dealt with it clearly as it was written down.  If the Deputy changed his mind between the time he put down the question and the date upon which I had to answer it, that is none of my affair.  I believe that the people here at the present time, and I am glad to say this&mdash; the Opposition as well as the Government&mdash;have the one view on this matter.  They have the one view also, now, on our Constitution and on its extension to embrace the whole of Ireland and the relations they hope eventually to see exist between ourselves and our nearest neighbour. There is no use in Deputy MacBride or anybody else claiming there is any difference in views on that matter for <Col N="899" /> the sake of a purely ephemeral political purpose.  In the past there was a difference and a very acute difference.  At the present time there is no difference and I hope that the position will remain so for the future.</P>
