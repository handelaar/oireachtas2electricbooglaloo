      <P>We had a fairly long discussion on Sections 9 and 10 on the Committee Stage.  The first two amendments on the Order Paper, though they are amendments to different sections, are co-related because in both of them it is proposed that the ceiling be raised and I am prepared to discuss them together if the Chair will permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 9, to delete &ldquo;£12 10s., £20, £27 10s. and £35&rdquo; wherever these figures appear and substitute, respectively, &ldquo;£25, £40, £55 and £65&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made it clear on the Committee Stage that we thought it unsatisfactory to have the same ceiling limit for the Leinster areas as for the West and the same figure for Kildare as for Kerry, for example.  The Minister made it quite clear that, so far as he was concerned, he would insist on having a level figure all over the country.  Bearing that in mind, the only way in which we could possibly find a solution to our problem is by extending the ceiling limit in Sections 9 and 10 in such a way as to bring them within the ambit of what might be considered reasonable in the <Col N="134" /> Leinster counties.  I have no experience of the other counties as to what would be a suitable valuation limit and, therefore, I do not propose to suggest a figure for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested certain figures in his Bill.  To limit the grant the county council may make to the full 100 per cent. figure of the departmental grant in the case of a farmer whose valuation does not exceed £12 10s. and in the case of a person who is being assessed on his income to a figure of £4 per week is altogether too low.  Every house that is built by a private individual eases the burden placed on local authorities who are building houses for people who cannot build for themselves.  For that reason, if for no other reason, everything that can be done to induce people who, while not at the lowest income are very near to it, to build houses for themselves should be done by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand how farmers with a valuation of £12 10s. can face the problem of building a house and I feel that the effect of the section, limiting it as it does to the grant, is tantamount to saying that we do not want this scheme available at all in the Leinster area.  The limits I have suggested are approximately double in the case of the valuation and increased by approximately 50 per cent. in the case of income.  The reason why I did not double the income as compared with the valuation is because I feel there is a case such as the case made here by Deputy Allen on the Committee Stage, and that the income rates, as against the valuation rates, are unbalanced in the Bill as it stands.  The proposal that is put to the Minister in these amendments is a very modest one.  It is a proposal, in the case of farmers, to say that the local authority may, if it so wishes, pay a 100 per cent. housing grant if the valuation does not exceed £25, that the local authority can introduce a scheme which will provide that every farmer who is up to £25 valuation can get the same grant as the Government grant.</P>
    <P>The section is permissive; it is not mandatory.  Both sections say that the housing authority &ldquo;may make.&rdquo;  The sections do not make it mandatory on <Col N="135" /> the housing authorities.  In the circumstances, therefore, it is a matter for the housing authority to decide what it wants to do.</P>
    <P>From the letter that I have received since the Committee Stage, it is clear that there are some housing authorities who are anxious to make more generous provision than is provided by these two sections.  I have had letters, not merely from small farmers in Kildare who are over the minimum limit of £12 10s. provided in the Bill, but from people who had banded themselves together in the Newbridge Public Utility Society for the purpose of building houses outside Newbridge on the assumption that the scheme which the Kildare County Council had in operation under the 1950 Act could be permitted.  These people tell me in these letters that they will not go ahead with the building of their houses because they feel that unless they would be able to get the facilities that would have been available to them up to the 31st March last, having regard to present costs and the prospect of mounting costs, the task and the burden of building houses for themselves would be entirely beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House will agree that anything that tends to impede or even to discourage the building of a single house at the present time should be avoided.  The limits provided in the sections as introduced by the Minister are altogether too low in many parts of the country.  We have suggested, therefore, that in regard to valuation, the limit of £12 10s. for the payment of an equivalent 100 per cent. grant should be raised to £25; that the limit of £20 valuation for the payment of two-thirds of the appropriate departmental grant should be raised to £40; that the limit of £27 10s. for a 50 per cent. housing grant should be raised to £55; and that the top limit should be raised from £35 to £65, that is to say, that between £55 and £65, a person would get only one-third of the grant; that between £40 and £55 he would get half the grant; between £25 and £40, two-thirds of the grant; and below £25, the full grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> The figures can be compared when one remembers that under the Minister's proposal, over £35, a person gets no grant at all from the local authority.</P>
    <P>So far as income is concerned, the Minister's limit is £8 a week.  It is not actually £8 a week because the Minister forgot that a year consists of 52 weeks and three days and that the three days cut out the man who is getting the even weekly wage.  The Minister's figures provide that a county council cannot pay any grant at all to a man who is earning £8 a week.  That is much too low.  He provides that it is only in the case of a man who is earning £4 a week or less that the full 100 per cent. grant will be paid.  I find it difficult to understand how a person earning only £4 a week could set out to build a house for himself.</P>
    <P>We propose to raise the Minister's figure of £4 a week, by 50 per cent. to £6 and to put the range between £6 and £10.  Even that is not a very high ceiling.  When we were putting this amendment down we did not think that there was the slightest use in flying at any higher ceiling; we thought we would have to use all our powers of persuasion and all the powers of persuasion of the Deputies opposite, including Deputy Burke, to get the Minister to come even as far as we are asking him to come in this amendment.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage there was a fairly long discussion of the principles involved here, and I do not propose to weary the House any further with them.  I commend these extensions to the Minister and to the House as extensions in the ceilings in a permissive section which would in some way enable the various housing authorities to meet the needs of their own areas instead of having the position that might affect western seaboard areas imposed on, say, a Leinster county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the former Minister, and I appeal now to the present Minister, to reconsider the ceilings prescribed in the Bill.  For once in my life I am in agreement with Deputy Sweetman.  In County Dublin the ceilings prescribed will definitely cut out a number of applicants.  The <Col N="137" /> valuations in County Dublin are high. I know it is difficult from an administrative point of view to differentiate between one county and another and one province and another.  I have had appeals similar to those that Deputy Sweetman has had, from people in my constituency who are taking a keen interest in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the fact that the valuations in certain areas are higher than in others.  I did speak on the Committee Stage with regard to the ceiling of £8 per week.  In the suburbs of Dublin a salary of £8 a week possibly does not go as far as £5 in other areas down the country. For that reason I can definitely make a case for County Dublin, because conditions are completely different there from those in other areas in the country.  The salary scales there cannot be compared with salary scales in rural Ireland, where it is much cheaper to live.  Therefore, a flat rate for the whole country would not work out equitably.  I can appreciate the Minister's difficulties in regard to that, but, in fairness to my constituents, I must voice my opinion as to what I believe to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Minister introduced these restrictions in Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill because my experience, and I am sure it is the experience of most members of local authorities, is that the natural anxiety of local authorities to see that grants will not be made available to applicants whose means would not merit their being helped in that way is sufficient safeguard.  The Minister has gone too far in these sections so far as restriction is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin County Council has not yet adopted that section of the recent Act which enables local authorities to provide grants as well as the grants given by the State.  But, so far as the valuations set out in Section 9, and the ceilings indicated are concerned, if the Bill is to be put into operation in that form it will mean that 99 per cent. of the farmers in County Dublin will be completely excluded from any possible benefit which might accrue to them should the Dublin County <Col N="138" /> Council at any future date decide to adopt that section and put it into operation.  A 25-acre farm in County Dublin would exceed in valuation the ceiling of £35 indicated in Section 9. Therefore, it will be seen that the great majority of these farmers would gain no benefit from the Bill.  I do not think that legislation in this House should be so designed as to exclude so important a section of the community as the farmers of County Dublin, and indeed, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, most of the farmers on the better land in the counties of Leinster.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 10, of course it is completely unreal and has no application whatever so far as my constituency is concerned.  In order to avail of the maximum grant under that section the total family income would have to be as low as £4 per week.  In fact, if what Deputy Sweetman says is correct in regard to the number of weeks plus days in the year, it would be a fraction less than £4 per week. The minimum wage of an agricultural worker in County Dublin at present is £4 5s. per week.  It is inconceivable, of course, that he would want to build a house, as £4 5s. a week is not sufficient to enable him to put a suit on his back let alone a roof on a house. He must, however, have less than £4 a week under the Bill in order to avail of the grant.  If, through some such eventuality as a relative dying and leaving him money, he wanted to build a house, he must have less than £4 a week.  The maximum income per week is indicated at £8.  The question of the family income, however, is the important thing.  It is not just the income of the head of the household that is considered, but the family income.  That means that if a father is a tradesman earning £7 a week and a son is working at some occupation and earning more than £1 per week, that particular family will be excluded from receiving the grant.  That is most undesirable.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said for these sections in regard to the Midlands or the West of Ireland, where they may have occasional application, I doubt if they will have universal application. Where there are poverty-stricken areas these sections may have very occasional <Col N="139" /> application, but the majority of the people of the country, by reason of these ceilings which are imposed in respect of valuation and family income, will gain no benefit whatever from this Bill.  I therefore join with Deputy Sweetman in asking the Minister to reconsider these sections because they are unreal and will have a disastrous effect as far as the spirit of the Act of 1950 is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Dunne, in his contribution to this debate, widened the scope of the discussion by referring to the general principle of a statutory restriction on valuations and income.  So far as the county councils are concerned, I am in favour of statutory restriction.  I think it is desirable that the restriction should be imposed by statute so that county councils would not be put in the difficult position of having all kinds of pressure brought to bear upon them to change their ceilings from month to month or year to year.  It is better that the matter should be dealt with in this Bill as it is proposed to do.  On the Committee Stage, however, I did express the view that I was not quite satisfied with the limits fixed and I suggested that the Minister should reconsider this question.  A reasonable case has been made for some increase in the limits both in regard to valuation and income.  Our main desire should be to ensure that these grants which are being provided by the ratepaying community should be confined to those who are in need of them.  There would not be any sense in imposing an increased rate on the ratepayers of a county in order to give the 100 per cent. grant of £275 to the wealthiest person in that county. There is a case for restriction.  There is a case for a means test so far as the subsidising of houses is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers this question, however, I think he will see that a reasonable case can be made for increasing the limits both in regard to valuation and income.  One of the ends sought to be achieved by the giving of this grant by local authorities is to ensure that private people will build houses and thereby save the <Col N="140" /> local authorities from a certain amount of the expenditure in which they would be involved.  It has happened that county councils have had to build houses over £20 valuation and it must happen that they will have to build houses for people with over £4 and £8 per week income.  If we are to achieve what is set out to be achieved by these local authority grants, it is desirable that the Minister should raise the limit to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>The limits provided in the Bill may be satisfactory enough in the West and in some other counties, but it will be generally accepted that they are scarcely sufficiently high to be of any use in the Leinster counties.  I am in wholehearted agreement with the principle of having a limitation, a restriction, but it should be on a basis which would enable a certain number of people to benefit by it, and the number who will benefit by it in my constituency will be very small and the effect of the provision will be very small.  On the other hand, I agree that there should be a limit, and I think that the limits set out in the amendment are not excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on an earlier stage, he indicated that he thought a conservative approach to this problem was the more prudent approach in present circumstances, but I am sure the Minister must by now be astonished by the standard of conservatism which is set in this Section 10, and, indeed, in Section 9 as well.  So far as some counties are concerned, some of these provisions might as well be in the wastepaper basket as in this amending Bill.  Look at what we propose to do in Section 10.  We propose to give a 100 per cent. grant to a person whose family income does not exceed £4 per week.  That means that we are saying to an agricultural worker, to a road worker and perhaps to a casually employed turf worker: &ldquo;If you build a house for yourself, you can get from the local authority a 100 per cent. grant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Read Section 11 then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="141" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 provides for a 50 per cent. grant for people not covered by the previous section.  What we are really doing is saying to a person who has not enough wages to buy clothes to cover himself and his family, and who is compelled to endure an appallingly low standard of living, that if he builds a house, he will get a 100 per cent. grant.  The truth is that that man cannot buy clothes for himself and his children much less contemplate the gigantic task of building a house with materials and labour costing what they are costing to-day.  Kildare County Council is paying £1,200 and £1,300 for building labourers' cottages.  Let us assume a person has sufficient knowhow and skill to manage to build a house for himself, of the same proportions as a labourer's cottage.  He might, by working hard and by working long hours, be able to build it 25 per cent. cheaper, but the net position is that he sets out to build a house which he knows will cost him, in the long run, £900.</P>
      <P>Is he going to get £900?  Do you imagine that the Kildare County Council will lend him money with an income of £4 a week to build a house costing £900 or £1,000?  What resources has he to go to a builders' provider to get materials to build a house costing anything like that sum?  Yet the Bill tells him that if he manages to do that, he will get the full grant from the local authority.  The truth is that that poor devil is not able to provide food and clothes for his family, much less essay the task of building a house for himself to qualify for a grant under this section.  If he is in that circumstance, he is the only person who will get a grant of 100 per cent. from the local authority.  You might as well offer him £1,000,000 if he could manage to fly. He has as much chance of earning the £1,000,000 by being able to fly as he has of qualifying for a full grant from the local authority with a family income of £4 a week in 1952.  Whoever drafted this Bill can be given a certificate immediately of not having the slightest tendency towards financial extravagance or financial indiscretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us pass on to the next person. If the family income exceeds £4 but does not exceed £6, he gets two-thirds <Col N="142" /> of the relevant grant.  If it exceeds £6, he does not get the 66 per cent., so that if a road worker has a family of four, five or six and happens to have one son working, perhaps helping a farmer or perhaps earning something on a bog, and the family income at the end of the week amounts to £6 or over, there is no 66 per cent. for him.  These are unreasonable restrictions, and, as the local authority are being asked to pay, and in many cases where they are liberal minded local authorities, are willing to pay, because they think it is a good bargain, I utterly fail to see why the State should fix the statutory limit at such a low level as this.  If there be a case for the fixation of a statutory limit, that could be examined, but it ought not to be fixed at so low a level that a local authority is denied the opportunity of giving grants to ratepayers in its area who desire to build houses for themselves and whose financial position is such that it is necessary that they should have financial aid from the local authority.</P>
    <P>This section seems to me to kill almost stone dead any notion of craftsmen of unskilled workers ever attempting to build houses for themselves, because the amount of the grant they will get from the local authority will be scaled down so much, under the rigid conditions imposed by Section 10, that they will not be able to raise the wherewithal between grants and loans from local authorities to enable them to undertake a task of the magnitude of building a house to-day.  When we look at these figures and construe them against the background of a reply given by the Taoiseach recently that the £ in July, 1952, now buys only what 9/- bought in 1939, their absurdity becomes obvious.  We are now told by no less an authority than the Taoiseach fortified by information from the Central Statistics Office that a £ to-day will buy only 9/- worth of goods in terms of 1939 purchasing power.  It would probably buy less as far as building materials are concerned.  In view of that shrunken value of money, to fix a family income as low as £4 per week before a person can get a full grant from a local authority is not to be conservative but to go back to a <Col N="143" /> period long before that phrase was coined as a description of people who were politically prudent.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that there is any use in appealing to the Minister to alter these figures because, during the discussion on the sections, he played the rôle of Pharaoh and every time anybody suggested moving away from these figures his heart grew harder and harder.  Knowing him, I think that he probably has no disposition at this stage to change his mind.</P>
    <P>Section 10, as far as the ordinary working people are concerned, is a waste of paper because they will not be enabled to build houses.  Twelve months hence a parliamentary question will elicit the number of people who honestly complied with these conditions and availed of the full grant from the local authority.  Deputy Sweetman, I think, has the same question in mind as I have&mdash;the Newbridge Public Utility Society.  People were locally encouraged to become members in the belief that they would get the full grant from the local authority. I certainly encouraged them to get sites from the local authority and they got them.  Everybody was encouraged to join the society with a view to building houses.  They satisfied the planning requirements and now they get the smack of this Bill which tells the local authority: &ldquo;Do not give them the full grant if they have more than £4 per week.&rdquo;  I would like the Housing Section of the Department to go to Newbridge for a weekend and then come back and tell us how a man with £4 a week can build a house with this restricted aid from the local authority.  No man with £8 a week could do it if he had a wife and children to maintain and yet these miserable limits are put into the Bill in such a way as if they were conferring a benefit.</P>
    <P>The only person who can attempt to do anything under the section&mdash;and even he is in a bad position, too&mdash;is the man who has £416&mdash;£8 per week. What anyone with £8 per week with a wife and children to maintain, especially if he lives in an urban area, can do passes my comprehension.  Anybody <Col N="144" /> who knows a way of living tolerably decently on £8 per week, maintaining a wife and children, and who can yet build a house with only a 33 per cent. grant from the local authority should reveal to the community how it is possible.  He will be publicly rewarded if he can show the community how to live on £8 per week, keep a wife and family and build a house at the same time.  It just cannot be done and anybody who imagines it can is living in the clouds.</P>
    <P>This is a vain appeal, I know, to the Minister.  He will do nothing.  He will preserve the prudent and conservative line of which he spoke at an earlier stage, but this section is a dead-letter, and he should know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who discussed Section 10 showed no inclination to have any regard at all to the provisions of Section 11.  Section 10 is a very narrow section.  In reply to a question by Deputy McGrath on the Committee Stage as to the classes of persons covered by Section 11, I gave information which brought the remark from Deputy McGrath reported at column 1541 of Volume 132, No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Then the cases we were talking about under Section 10 would be covered by this?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Smith: That is so, provided they were people for whom the local authority would have to provide houses in the ordinary way.  That is what I meant, in fact, in my reference to the narrow class that would be covered under Section 10.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGrath: In that case I am quite satisfied.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: Had we understood that we might not have been so long on Section 10.  Perhaps we have learned something in the process.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the result of our discussions on Sections 10 and 11 on the Committee Stage, but let me deal with the broader aspects of the case with regard to Sections 9, 10 and 11.  These three sections contain the entire scheme presented to the House for its approval.  As Deputy Sweetman <Col N="145" /> stated&mdash;this is an important factor&mdash; these three sections are permissive sections.  The local authority can adopt them if it so desires, but if it does not like the scheme it need not have any scheme.</P>
    <P>Why did we in the Department, when drafting these three sections, decide upon these limits which, I admit and made clear on the Second Reading and Committee Stage, were limits?  Deputy Dunne has made his contribution regarding these sections.  He has castigated them because of the income limits which are specially prescribed in Section 10.  Deputy Burke from the same constituency has appealed to me to raise these limits.  Is it not peculiar, however, that those two Deputies representing the same county&mdash;and mind you, it is not one of our poorest counties&mdash;did not have any scheme at all under Section 7 of the Act of 1950? When we get to our feet here to attack the scheme provided in this Bill, could we not try to understand and, to some extent at least, sympathise with the idea I had in my mind in imposing these limitations?  This was my idea: If Dublin County Council and other county councils all over the country would not give grants wholesale to all and sundry, farmers, labourers, artisans and professional men, as they could have done&mdash;in some cases they did&mdash;if they would not give grants widespread and accept the responsibility of imposing limits as to the valuation of the farmers and the wage of the workers, why then should not I as Minister ask this House to provide in this Bill a scheme which would relieve those local authorities of the responsibility of providing a scheme themselves?</P>
    <P>It was our experience that local bodies, although admitting that it was desirable to have limitations, could not agree amongst themselves as to where these limits should be set.  In some cases, because of their failure to agree, they refused to adopt these schemes, and where they adopted a scheme that was free for all, we knew for the last 12 months that it was not their intention to go ahead.  They had met their responsibilities under the scheme adopted by them under the Act of <Col N="146" /> 1950, but it was not their intention to operate another scheme.  You would then have the position that a number of people in counties where you had Section 7 schemes, would have obtained grants under such schemes, and because of the onerous condition that the continuance of these grants would impose on the ratepayers, the local authority would drop the scheme entirely.  You would then have the injustice of a number of people getting away with the grants from the previous scheme while no grants of any kind were being made available in future for other deserving people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned the fact that the country should be zoned, but I shall not be responsible for another effort at zoning.  The country has been zoned once, and we shall not zone it again.  I do not think he has given very much thought to the effect of the valuation limits that are provided for here.  I do not believe he can be so lacking in knowledge of local conditions as to believe that a very considerable number of small farmers, even in County Kildare and County Dublin, will not come within the £35 valuation limit.  The £35 valuation will cover 80 per cent. of the holdings in Connacht, Munster, Leinster and Ulster.</P>
    <P>The £35 limit I agree will rule out a number of people who might be deserving applicants.  I am not contending that there are not people whose valuation would be in excess of £35 who would not be in need of these grants but we had the very same case made here in one of the Housing Acts which provided for reconstruction and in which a valuation limit was inserted. We had the same discussion then and it was pointed out that the valuation limit was not high enough. Deputy Norton tried to convey the impression that I was being generous to the applicant, but remember these sections are permissive.  It is not the Minister, or it is not this House that will give the applicant anything under these three sections.  It is the people who are the local representatives who will have to decide whether or not such a scheme will be operated in the respective areas, and, therefore, they will have to provide the money.</P>

      <P>The only thing that it will cost the State is this, and, mind you, it is important that the Dáil and local authorities should know it.  In these three sections I am endeavouring to say to them here and now that any money they provide to pay grants under these three sections will be provided for these local bodies from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not get it from that source under Section 7 of the 1950 Act, and they did not know where to get it.  There was no provision whatever made in that regard and the local bodies had to go around to their treasurer, to insurance companies or to other financial concerns to get these loans upon which they had to pay fairly high rates of interest.  In these three sections not alone am I providing them with this scheme but I am saying to them: &ldquo;If you decide to adopt the scheme outlined in the Bill, you will get the money required for the operation of that scheme through the Local Loans Fund.&rdquo;  I know, because I have had contact with local bodies, that that is one assurance that local authorities do appreciate and that is one assurance that will encourage local authorities to adopt the scheme outlined here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could, as I said on the Committee Stage, with the greatest ease if I wanted to do so, allow a section slip into this measure as Section 7 was allowed to slip into the Act of 1950 on the Committee Stage, that would provide for more generous provisions in so far as valuations, wage conditions and earning capacity of the applicants are concerned.  Having allowed these generous provisions to be inserted in the Bill, local bodies who would be notified of this, having regard to their experience under Section 7&mdash;those of them <Col N="148" /> who adopted a scheme under Section 7 and those who were afraid to adopt it &mdash;would lie back and say: &ldquo;Oh, it is all very fine for the Minister and the Dáil to give this council freedom to adopt a scheme of this nature but the Dáil is not dealing with the ratepayers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said on the other stages, anything provided for in these three sections is, first of all, the result of a good deal of contact and discussion with members of county councils and others who were representatives of bodies that had adopted schemes under Section 7.  These three sections are the result of a good deal of discussion with the representatives of a number of local bodies who adopted no scheme at all under Section 7 because they were afraid of it.  These three sections are the result of conversations with all those people.  I endeavoured on my part to provide local bodies with a scheme that will be accepted not only by one, two, three, four, five or six bodies, but a scheme that is complete in itself, a scheme that they will not be afraid of from the point of view of the financial obligations it may impose on them, and a scheme which shows them the way in which they will be able to finance it.  That is why these three sections are couched in the language in which they are.  I repeat that it would have been the easiest thing in the world for me, instead of arguing like people who want to pretend that they are generous with something that is not their own, to remove all limits from the section, but in doing that I am quite sure I would not be helping many of those who will build houses under the scheme outlined here.  I realise quite as well as Deputy Norton the difficulties which the erection of houses will present to many married people, but there are families, families of numbers of small farmers and workers, to be found everywhere who can take advantage of a scheme of this nature.  They may not be a high percentage, but there will be a considerable number.</P>
    <P>Is it not better that, in this Bill, we should start off with a scheme that is fairly tightly drawn, and that, when a letter is drafted by my Department <Col N="149" /> and this scheme is explained to local bodies, they will not be able to sit down and start fencing, one member saying, we will have a £25 valuation, another proposing a £30 valuation, another urging a £35 valuation, while some other member, who has a neighbour with a £40 valuation, will be asking to have the valuation fixed at £40 until, in the end, with all that kind of climbing up the ladder you will have what happened under Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  As regards the latter, local bodies kept on amending schemes week after week and month after month until, in many cases, they reached the stage when they flung the gates open.  When they did that, and then found themselves in a difficulty, they resolved that never again would they adopt such a scheme unless they did what I am doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am so confident that I am on the right road in what I am providing for in these three sections that no amount of argument is going to convince me otherwise.  I want that to be understood in this way, that I am not arguing in the sense that I want to sustain my own point of view, but rather because I know that my approach to this problem is the right approach.  This Act will only have a life of two years.  If we could, as a result of the passage of these three sections, induce all local bodies outside of Dublin&mdash;I do not think that a scheme like this would be of very much value to Dublin City or perhaps a few other areas&mdash;if we could induce the majority of local bodies to whom this scheme would apply to adopt it, then, at the end of two years, whoever had responsibility for introducing amending legislation to extend it could do so.  That has happened all down the years in connection with our housing legislation.  When the first valuation limits were introduced in 1932 they were very low.  The Housing Bills introduced subsequently provided for improvements where it was felt improvements were necessary so that we have kept on progressively increasing and improving the provisions in our housing legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a new departure.  This scheme that we are providing is not <Col N="150" /> for operation by ourselves or by any State Department.  We are providing a permissive scheme for local bodies, and, therefore, we must have regard to what they are likely to approve of and adopt.  I am approaching it in that frame of mind, and so I am perfectly confident that the local bodies will approve of what I am providing for in this Bill.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  The Minister admits that this is a permissive scheme.  He admits that he is putting no money in the kitty for the administration of the scheme.  The most that he is doing is to allow the local bodies to borrow money&mdash;at a rate of interest which they will pay and not the Minister&mdash; from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of making grants under Section 10.  Will the Minister tell me why any efficiently and prudently administered local authority such as the Kildare County Council is cannot give a full grant from its funds to a carpenter with a wife and four or five children who wants to build a house, when the Kildare County Council knows well that, by giving him a full grant under Section 10, they will be encouraging him to provide a house for himself and his family at a rate substantially cheaper than it would cost the Kildare County Council to build a house for him if they had to house him?</P>

      <P>I have already explained that, under these permissive sections, I have no power to oblige a local body to adopt them at all.  I do know that local bodies which have had a type of free-for-all scheme over the last two years have clearly intimated to me that they would not adopt any such scheme in the future.  I have also been told by these people that they would not be able to impose limitations which would be acceptable to all of them.  Therefore, in this measure, I am imposing these limitations for them.  I am doing that in the hope that they will be able to have a scheme that will apply to a considerable number of people, and I think it is better to have a scheme that will apply <Col N="151" /> to a considerable number of people than to have no scheme at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a way that was quite illogical.  He put up an argument that was not made and then demolished it.  He put up an argument against the amendment to that part of Section 10 by bringing in Section 11, completely ignoring the fact that any argument based on bringing in Section 11 can only operate at all as an argument once you come up, under the Minister's scheme, to the 50 per cent. level that he has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had made the case that, so far as my amendment is concerned, it was unreasonable in the second half of it to raise the limit in regard to those people who are unable to get the one-third grants because they had the provisions in Section 11 to fall back on, then the Minister might have had some validity in his argument.  What the Minister said is quite simple.  He has taken the line that a man with the income that is provided in this section who wants to get married, to start out on a new life of his own would not be eligible under paragraph (b) of Section 11, and is preventing him, unless he has less than £4 a week, of getting the equivalent <Col N="152" /> council grant.  I cannot see the sense of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the first part of his reply, ignored the case of the farmer altogether.  The farmer does not come in under Section 11 at all.  The Minister's case is that the £35 limit of valuation will cover a large proportion of farmers.  Of course it will, but the Minister was talking as if the farmer under £35 valuation were going to get the full grant.  He is not.  The Minister's proposal is that if the farmer's valuation is up to £35 and over £27 10s., he will only get the one-third grant.  With that provision before him, how can the Minister get up and say that the limit of the £35 valuation covers practically all farmers in the country, knowing full well, as he must know, that if their valuations are over £27 10s. and up to £35, they are going to get only the one-third grant and that if their valuations are over £20 and up to £27 10s. they will only get the 50 per cent. grant, while if their valuations are over £12 10s. and up to £20 they will get the two-thirds grant, and that in order to get the full grant the farmer's valuation has to be under £12 10s.?  I cannot see any farmer under £12 10s. being able to take advantage of this section.  In the county I have the honour to represent, this section&mdash;unless the limits are amended, at least as I suggest&mdash;might be written off as a complete dead letter and it would be much better to wipe out this power altogether instead of deluding the people.  In County Kildare one could count on one's two hands the number of people whom it would benefit.</P>
    <P>As far as I could understand the Minister's case about the provision of the money, it was that but for Section 12 there was no statutory power to grant a loan from the Local Loans Fund for a grant such as this.  I do not know whether I am unfairly interpreting the Minister.</P>

      <P>No.  The Minister tried to make the House think that it was only the provisions of Section 12 <Col N="153" /> that gave the Minister power to give local authorities money under the Local Loans Fund.  I do not think that is true.  Certainly the Minister did not make that case to the Kildare County Council when it asked for money from the Local Loans Fund. The person who refused the money was not, as the Minister would like us to believe, his predecessor: it was the Minister himself.  We asked him for the moneys from the Local Loans Fund and he refused.</P>

      <P>Then when the Minister turned us down flat we wrote and asked him to see us to explain and he would not even see us and said it was no use.  The Minister says that the statutory power was there before Section 12 was introduced.  If it was, it must be on his own head for the refusal. I think the limits I have proposed in this amendment are reasonable limits.  It is a permissive section. I think these limits are fair for that part of the country which I know, but if the Kerry County Council or the Donegal County Council consider that the figures suitable for us in Leinster are too high for them, surely they need not go as high.  This is not a zoning problem, as the Minister suggests it is: this is a suggestion to raise the limit and if there is any county that does not want to go as high, it need not go as high.</P>
      <P>If there is not in the section the permissive power to enable a county council to restrict it below those limits, when the Minister takes the Bill to another House he can make that more clear in the drafting, wherever necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 21 (2), before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) where the grant is in respect of the erection of a house, a contract for the building of such house was completed before that date or.</P>
      <P>Section 21 was inserted by the Minister on Committee in view of the representations made to him on the Second Stage against Section 5 as it appeared in the original draft.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide that where a person has actually completed a contract for the building of a house and where there was a scheme under Section 7 of the 1950 Act in operation, that person would not lose&mdash;by reason of the introduction of this Bill&mdash;the grant which he thought he was going to get at the time he signed the contract.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me in respect of two cases in Kildare, and I have seen representations made to Deputy Fagan in respect of cases in Westmeath.  In those cases, before 29th April&mdash;the date taken by the Minister as the operative date because that was the date on which this Bill was published&mdash;these people believed that the existing scheme that was operative in their county would be continued by the Housing Act that was about to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technically, previous Housing Acts, as the Minister said to-day, last for <Col N="155" /> two years, and technically it ended on the 31st March last.  They believed, however, that the powers already in existence on the 31st March would be renewed and in that belief they set out and entered into a contract with a builder for the purpose of putting up their houses.  They did that in the belief that they were going to get grants under the schemes operative in Kildare and Westmeath.  Having done that, we are presented with this Bill and we find that they are not eligible for the grant.  They cannot go back to where they were before, because they have entered into a contract and they have paid, probably, under that building contract a portion of the contract price.  There cannot be very many of these cases and my amendment suggests that, so far as they are concerned, the obvious injustice that would be caused to them by a change, after they had irretrievably committed themselves, should be avoided by ensuring that the repeal of the earlier section does not exclude them from the benefit of their applications under the local housing authority.</P>
    <P>This amendment contains a very different point from the following amendments.  If a limitation in point of time for the completion of a house were, in the view of the Minister, desirable, I should be quite prepared to agree to it.  I do not, however, think it is necessary, because where the building contract has already been entered into then the house has been started and obviously it will be completed within a very short time.  The section includes a provision that where a contract for the purchase of a house was completed before the 29th April then that contract is permitted to get the benefit of the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>If a man, instead of buying a house sitting on a site, had his own site and entered into a contract for the building of the house, he is not covered under the section as it stands.  I suggest to the Minister that when there is included in the section a very proper provision to cover the purchase of a house, as such, there should be a similar provision in respect of a contract with a builder.</P>

      <P>I have made every effort that I believed could reasonably be expected from me to meet the many views expressed by Deputies here and in the many letters which I received from Deputies from both sides of the House as to the injustices that would result from the section in the Bill as drafted and circulated to the members of the House.</P>
      <P>I believe that Section 21 makes provision for every type of case that is at all reasonable.  It gives the local body power to pay the grant where there is evidence that the applicant had started the house before the 29th April and, on the other hand, where there is evidence that a contract of purchase was entered into before the 29th April. We must remember that Section 7 of the 1950 Act and the Act itself was intended to run to the 31st March, 1952. It was only because the Bill to replace it was circulated on the 29th April that the 29th April is now taken as the date. With regard to all the schemes that were provided under Section 7 of the 1950 Act, emphasis was laid in every one of these schemes on the fact that the work of building the house would have to be completed by the 31st March, 1952.  I have personal knowledge of the fact that much publicity was given in all cases that the work would have to be in that advanced stage if the councils were to pay these grants to the applicants.  Now, in order not to do an injustice, we are going further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving them this power of taking the 29th April in the first case and allowing them to pay if there is evidence that the applicant had started the work of construction or had completed the contract for purchase before the 29th April.  Further, we are making it possible for the right of appeal to the Minister if the applicant should feel that the local authority had penalised him or her in any way.  It was one of the things which I did not like to provide&mdash;I should prefer to leave it entirely to the local bodies&mdash; but I felt that no matter how wide one might try to make a section such as this, cases may arise where a certain amount of discretion might be desirable. It was because of my desire to ensure that there would be no cases of <Col N="157" /> real hardship under this section that I made the addition of the right of appeal to the Minister.  Having gone that far, I would not be prepared to accept the amendment moved by Deputy Sweetman.  I do not think it would be just to accept some of the ideas that underlie these amendments.</P>

      <P>I am not going to withdraw the amendment, in view of the speech by the Minister.  It is perfectly clear that the Minister either has not taken the trouble to understand it or is deliberately trying to mislead the House.  The right of appeal which the Minister gives in the section is a right of appeal to the Minister to determine a dispute arising under the section.  It does not give the Minister any power to go outside the section. It does not give the Minister any power to deal with border-line cases. It does not give the Minister any power to deal with cases of hardship, as he has tried to suggest to the House.  The section, as it stands at present, is crystal clear.  The grant can only be paid under the 1950 Act where work on the house had commenced before the 29th April, 1952, or where a contract for the purchase of the house had been completed before that date. No amount of appeal to the Minister can give the Minister any authority to extend these two provisions in the section.</P>

      <P>The Minister tried to put up an argument that was not relevant to the amendment.  The position is perfectly clear.  You have, under the section, a man who is building his house.  Next door to him you have a speculative builder and next door to him you have a man who has his own site and who has entered into a contract with the builder to build a house for him.  You are allowing the first two in and you are not allowing the third in.  It is obviously unjust. There is no case whatever to be made for the restriction that has been suggested by the Minister.  There cannot be a lot of cases in the country, but there are some.  There is no reason whatever why the Minister should allow two of those sections through and not the third.  The only reason why the Minister does not want to do it is because he will not reconsider anything in this Bill.  He is throwing it at us and saying: &ldquo;There is the Bill.

      <P>The Minister, on the Committee Stage, made the case that he would not have two different schemes running contemporaneously, side by side.  I have met the Minister's objection by providing that these houses must be completed by the 31st December.  By the time new schemes are put into operation by the appropriate local authorities we will not have much time to spare up to the 31st December.  Therefore, the limitation as to the point of time included in these amendments, that the house must be finished before the 31st December under any existing scheme, will effectively prevent any possibility of schemes running contemporaneously. If the Minister thinks the date I am suggesting is too far ahead, I am quite prepared to agree to the 31st October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at the moment is that this Bill will now go to the Seanad, and it will not come out of the Seanad before the end of the month.  County councils have then got to sit down and frame new schemes.  Local government officials, like everybody else, will be going on their holidays during August, and you will not get much in the nature of a scheme framed during that month.  If you get a scheme framed during September, you will be lucky enough.  Even if you did get a scheme framed by the county council officials during August, and had it sent to the Department, the people in the Department will be very properly on their holidays too.  You will not get schemes in operation in the various authorities until the end of October or the beginning of November at least.  But by the time they become operative we will have reached Christmas.  If the principle of a date was accepted it would inevitably mean that the case which the Minister made on Committee Stage against similar amendments, which had not got any closing date for the completion of the house, <Col N="160" /> would be met by the inclusion of a date in these amendments by which the houses would be finished.</P>

      <P>The contract to purchase a house is different from a contract to build a house.  Rarely if ever is a contract to purchase completed unless and until the house is erected.  I never heard of any case where a contract to purchase was completed until the house was erected.  In the case of the construction of a house, the contract to erect could be entered into and for months and months no work need have been done.  There is no analogy, therefore, between a contract to purchase and a contract to erect.  What I think is reasonable is what has been provided in all the schemes that were approved under Section 7, including the Kildare scheme.  What was provided in these schemes was that the completion of the erection of the house would have to be effected by the 31st March, 1952.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete Section 33, lines 44 to 47, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The council of a county shall, as respects their functional area, have the like powers as are conferred on an urban authority by Section 5 of the Housing and Labourers Act, 1937 (No. 42 of 1937), as amended, and the purposes of that section shall be deemed to be purposes for which a council of a county may borrow under Section 37 of the Act of 1948, and the said Section 5 shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a notice has been served, whether before or after the passing of this Act, under Section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931 (No. 50 of 1931), by a housing authority on a person having control of a house and the authority, in pursuance of Section 20 of the said Act, has executed the works specified in such notice, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to such authority a grant not exceeding whichever of the following amounts is the smaller, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  £80 for each separate dwelling forming part of such house after the execution of such works,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> (b)  one-third of the cost of such works.</P>
    <P>(3)  In calculating the expenses incurred by a housing authority under Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, the amount of any grant paid under sub-section (2) of this section to the authority shall be deducted by the authority.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of the amendment replaces Section 33 of the Bill.  It has been suggested that the existing Section 33 is not perfectly clear as respects the area in which the county council could operate under the section and that difficulty might possibly arise in regard to borrowing powers.  To put the matter beyond doubt, the section has been redrafted.  The redraft, which is contained in sub-section (1), involves no new principle whatever.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of the amendment repairs what was really an omission in Section 5 of the Housing and Labourers Act, 1937.</P>
    <P>That section enables grants to be paid to a landlord who carries out repairs on an unfit house in accordance with a notice served upon him by the local authority under Section 19 of the 1931 Act.  Section 20 of the 1931 Act provides that the local authority may, themselves, carry out the repairs if the landlord fails to do so in accordance with a notice.  From the point of view of the national housing pool the unfit house has been made fit for human habitation and, accordingly, it is only reasonable that the State grant should be paid to the local authority. There is, however, no power in Section 5 of the 1937 Act to pay the grant where the local authority carries out repairs, and sub-section (2) of the amendment rectifies the position.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of the amendment is consequential on sub-section (2).  Under Section 20 of the 1931 Act the local authority can recover, either from the landlord or from the occupier of the house, the expenses incurred by them in putting the house into repair.  The amount of any grant paid by the State to the local authority should be deducted by them in calculating the recoverable expenses.  The necessary provision in this respect is made by <Col N="163" /> sub-section (3) of the amendment.  I think that this is a very desirable amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has provided under this Bill that the limits provided under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts shall be treated in a new way.  Instead of having the limitation there used to be on the size of the house for which the purchaser could be assisted to build under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts the Minister has now put a limit to the amount of the loan that can be made available.  According to the provision made in the Bill, a loan of £1,600 can be got in any part of the country other than Dublin, Cork or Dún Laoghaire I hesitate to say <Col N="164" /> anything about Cork, but it has been suggested to me that the limit of £1,800 is somewhat on the low side as regards Dublin and Dún Laoghaire. On the Committee Stage, Deputy Belton put down an amendment to increase the amount of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts loan to £2,200, but the Minister was not prepared to accept this amendment.  I have put down an amendment to increase the amount of the loan to £2,000 as a sort of a half-way house. At a later stage to-day, on the Estimate for the Minister's Department, we will be discussing housing progress and so forth.  I feel there is likely to be a substantial falling off on the type of building in the City of Dublin which is assisted by the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts loans.  An extension of the amount of the loan would do a good deal to offset that anticipated decrease.  It would make a valuable contribution to the purchaser and would provide a source of employment. With costs as they are at present, and as they are likely to be in the immediate future, the increase to £1,800 proposed by the Minister is very small.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading, the Minister said that the maximum value of the house that would, in fact, be assisted under his proposal would be increased from £2,000 to about £2,185, but I speak subject to correction.  There is a statutory provision that the person seeking to buy a house must put down at least 5 per cent. of the cost of the house by way of deposit over and above the grant which he receives.  Five per cent. of £2,000 is £100, the grant is £275 and if he gets a loan of £1,800 that would bring the total cost of the house up to about £2,185.  Under the new regulations the market value of a house will be about £2,185 where formerly it was £2,000.  We feel that the Minister's method of fixing a loan rather than having a market value ceiling is the better method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, because I think it does away with all the friction as to what the market value is.  At least, it does away with a certain percentage <Col N="165" /> of the friction.  I suggest to the Minister that the amount of the loan in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin, and the County Borough of Cork is not sufficient and that it should be extended by a small margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter also which has received an amount of attention. Our view is that £1,800, plus a grant of £275, plus a deposit of 5 per cent. of the cost price of the house will meet the reasonable needs of all those for whom the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts were intended.  Deputy Sweetman has indicated his agreement to the fact that the fixing of a loan rather than having a market value ceiling is the better method.  In times of rising costs, pressure was being brought to bear by builders to raise the limit, and one was always uncertain as to the advantages that might be taken as a result of any substantial increase.  We were anxious to keep these costs down, as every Minister and every Department must, and we were always hesitant about increasing the limit very far.  Therefore, I think that this new arrangement whereby £1,800 is given to applicants by way of loan in certain areas and £1,600 in other areas, plus a grant of £275, plus a deposit of 5 per cent. should meet the types of cases for whom we in this House must be most concerned.  If there are people who want more costly and more expensive houses, then we will leave it to the local authority to deal with them.</P>
      <P>If they so decide they can advance them £1,800 and if the persons concerned want a better type of house it will be up to them to seek the ways and means of providing it.  We thought that this limit was fair and for that reason I do not feel that it should be increased.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Agreed, to take the Fifth Stage to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise this <Col N="166" /> one small point which I understand can be dealt with administratively rather than by means of legislation.  I am not quite clear, to be quite honest, whether I should raise it on the Bill or on the Estimate, but it will only take a second.  There has been some reference in certain parts of the Press to the impossibility of the tenants of the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Trust houses being able to find the funds to purchase their houses when the present scheme goes through the British Houses of Parliament.  I understood that an administrative promise was given by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Keyes, that the appropriate steps would be taken under the Small Dwellings Acts for local authorities to advance to such tenants when they are making such a purchase the appropriate funds.  I understood that the position was that that could be done without legislation, that it is purely an administrative matter and, as we are amending the Small Dwellings Act under this Bill, I thought perhaps this was the more proper time to refer to it. I think the Minister would be in entire agreement that it would be absolutely desirable and absolutely essential, and I am sure the whole House will agree that it is absolutely essential that when these existing tenants get the opportunity of buying their houses, local authorities would be enabled to assist them to complete their purchase by making available to them the appropriate necessary funds under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
      <P>The matter cannot be dealt with by purchase schemes as are there for our own local authority houses and it seems to me that, as was referred to on one occasion by Deputy Keyes when he was Minister, the provisions of the Small Dwellings Acts would be the appropriate provisions.  One of the reasons I raise the matter now rather than on the Estimate is to give him the breathing space, if necessary, to go into the matter, so that he would give to the local authorities the assurance that they may within the Acts make the finances available and, going further, not only give them the assurance that they may but urge them that they should.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather disturbing that on the day on which the House is being asked to pass this Housing Bill for the purpose of chartering our housing course for the immediate and somewhat distant future, to see an announcement in the public Press to the effect that the largest housing authority in the country, the Dublin Corporation, which has the responsibility for building approximately 30,000 houses in the City of Dublin, has been notified by the Standing Committee of the Irish Banks that so far as that body is concerned, the Joint Stock Banks of this country, they can do nothing whatever for the Dublin Corporation in the way of providing money to enable the corporation to finance its house building activities.  If the Press report is to be relied upon&mdash; and it looks to all appearances to be an inspired Press report coming from an authoritative source&mdash;then we find the banks in this position, that they have informed the Dublin Corporation that not even if they pay 5 per cent. on the loan will money be made available to that body for the purpose of building houses as part of its responsibility as the most important housing authority in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the Dublin Corporation is going to go from there. Quite obviously, it is an extremely serious matter.  Everybody knows if the corporation were to go on the market to-morrow looking for money they would not get money.  They would not get money because of the fact that certain people have spent the last 12 months telling the people of this country, particularly the moneyed people of this country, that we are heading for ruin and bankruptcy and that we have reached the point of desperation.  In circumstances such as those, it is quite unlikely that a local authority like the Dublin Corporation could ever hope to get money on the open market to finance its house building activities.  The fact that the Dublin Corporation went to the banks is an indication that they knew that resort to the public would not vield for them the moneys necessary to finance their housebuilding activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation has told the <Col N="168" /> people it needs no less than £5,000,000 for house building&mdash;on the one hand for the building of houses directly by the corporation; on the other hand for the financing of house building by individuals through the medium of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Yet this body, with its long record of fruitful house building, prudent administration of its housing affairs, and with the knowledge that it has not lost one penny under the administration of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, is told by the Joint Stock Banks in this country: &ldquo;There is no money for you, even if you pay the ransom of 5 per cent. to the banks&rdquo;.  It is clear the corporation cannot get that money on the open market, and the question arises, therefore: Where is the corporation going to get money to carry on its house building activities and avoid a sag in house building in Dublin which would be deplored by everybody irrespective of their political points of view?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this submission to you.  This Housing Bill is for the purpose of doing a variety of things which are set out in the Long Title, including making provision for the building of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, the Labourers Acts and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  In so far as this Bill makes provision for the erection of houses under these Acts, which are the Acts under which the corporation are operating, and makes provision for the advancing of money under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, for which the corporation cannot now get money, I think it is relevant to this Bill.  However, I do not want to delay unduly on the matter.  I wanted to call the Minister's attention to the fact that a <Col N="169" /> very serious situation has arisen. Whatever happens, the Dublin Corporation must get all the money it needs for the purpose of enabling it to continue its house building activities. A few years ago the banks adopted a somewhat similar attitude but, as the officials of the Department of Local Government and the officials of the Dublin Corporation know, on that occasion the Government in office at the time made sure that the Dublin Corporation got all the money they needed in order that there would be no interference with their house building activities.</P>
      <P>A similar situation has now arisen with the exception that on this occasion the banks have been much more audacious.  Money has been borrowed on the open market quite recently at 3½ per cent. and 3¾ per cent.  Despite that the banks when approached by the corporation refused to lend money and said: &ldquo;You will not even tempt us if you give us 5 per cent.&rdquo;  The position has thereby been aggravated to the detriment of the corporation and to the detriment of thousands of our people who are living in filthy, ratinfested tenements.  I want an assurance from the Minister now that this problem will be dealt with immediately, and that the corporation will get all the money they need to house our people properly.  I want an assurance from the Minister that those who have the money will be required to play some public-spirited part in the provision of decent houses for our people.  The situation would be quite intolerable were we to sit idly by pouring our investments into the British market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising issues that are not contained in the Bill.  I am referring to the fact that the largest housing authority in the State with the heavy responsibility of providing <Col N="170" /> 30,000 houses to satisfy the needs of our people, and which must borrow annually substantial sums, has been told by the banks that they will get no accommodation, not even if they offer to pay 5 per cent. for the use of the money.</P>
      <P>I am now drawing the Minister's attention to that, and asking him to give the Dublin Corporation and the people living in the filthy tenements an assurance that shortage of money will not be permitted to impede the housing programme, that that money will be found for the corporation so that there will be no interruption in the excellent work of the corporation of endeavouring to house our people properly in the face of enormous difficulties, and in a city where the housing problem has been neglected for many generations, largely due to foreign misrule.</P>
      <P>It would be a great pity if the corporation should at this stage have its housing programme seriously curtailed. I hope the Minister will be able to give the corporation and the people an assurance that the corporation will not be prevented from proceeding with its housing programme because of the reluctance of the banks to provide money.  I hope the Government will indicate clearly that it intends to stand behind the corporation in getting for that body all the money it needs to continue its housing programme.</P>

      <P>First of all, I have no record of any promise made or any undertaking given, as was mentioned by Deputy Sweetman, by my predecessor to the tenants of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Trust houses.  The final clause in the agreement provides as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A right of purchase will be offered by the Trust to any tenants who are qualified ex-servicemen of the 1914-18 war.  A purchase price fixed on the basis that the purchaser is a sitting tenant will range from about £300 per house in rural areas to about £550 in urban areas.  This purchase price must be paid outright. The tenants will be free to make their own arrangements for borrowing and, if necessary, the Trust will arrange to put them in contact with <Col N="171" /> the building societies or other borrowing societies who provide the resources needed.  The purchaser will himself be liable to the borrowing agency for the repayment of the loan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Norton, the Dublin Corporation is not hindered in any way at the moment because of lack of finance.  There is no question of their being in straitened circumstances. It is the business of the corporation when looking to the future to discover the places from which and the conditions under which money may be provided for the future.  It is the business of those&mdash;it is certainly not my business&mdash;responsible for the running of the banks to look at things from their own point of view, having regard, of course, at the same time to other interest.  All this is quite understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has arisen before, as Deputy Norton pointed out.  As long as I can remember, since the housing problem of the Dublin Corporation has been pursued energetically, these difficulties have arisen from time to time over the last 30 years.  I am quite prepared to examine the steps that should be taken by the corporation to provide themselves with the necessary finances.  I am sure that all the institutions concerned are doing their business.  The Government has not failed to do its part.  There is no need to be alarmed.  As the old saying goes, there is no need to shake hands with the devil until we meet him. <Col N="172" /> The Dublin Corporation is in a position to continue for months.  It will be the duty of the Government, as it has always been the duty of the Government to help local bodies in every way it possibly can to tackle these problems and to ensure that the wherewithal is provided.  These problems have been met and solved in the past.  I have no reason to think they will not be met and solved in the future.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,792,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951, etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that office.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for 1952-53 amounts to £7,360,000, being a gross total of £7,667,840 less Appropriations-in-Aid of £307,840.  The net provision represents a decrease of £48,730 on the net provision for 1951-52.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be observed that the 1951-52 provision includes a sum of £696,730, which was actually provided for in the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and thus nominally transferred.  This extra provision covered increases in remuneration for the employees of the Department.  It is made up of £102,190 arrears proper to 1950-51 and £594,540 proper to 1951-52.  This amount of <Col N="173" /> £594,540 should be divided up and added under the appropriate sub-heads in order to give figures for 1951-52 which are properly comparable with the sub-head provisions for 1952-53. The sub-heads affected and the proportions proper to be added in each case are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The more substantial variations&mdash; those of £5,000 or more&mdash;occur on the following sub-heads as adjusted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-heads A (1), A (2), A (3) and A (4)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.&mdash; The increase of £51,060 under these sub-heads is mainly attributable to a net increase in staff and normal increments, offset by an over-estimation of the amount required last year to meet increases in remuneration, to a greater deduction in respect of the amount chargeable to Telephone Capital Funds and to changes in personnel.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C&mdash;Rent, Office Fittings, etc.  &mdash;The increase of £8,145 is due to the increased cost of electricity, gas and fuel offset to a minor degree by a reduction in the number of rateable premises.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Rail.  &mdash;The increase of £53,690 is due to the increased cost of conveyance of letter mails and an increase in the payment to the railway clearing house for the carriage of parcel mails resulting from the increased postage on parcels offset by a reduction in the provision for inter-State parcel traffic.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores (other than <Col N="174" /> Engineering).  &mdash;The decrease of £53,110 is due to the decreased provision for emergency reserve stocks offset partially by increased prices for normal consumption stores.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (2)&mdash;Uniform Clothing.&mdash; The decrease of £126,300 is due to a reduction in the requirements of serge cloth and a reduction in the provision for emergency reserve stocks.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (3)&mdash;Manufacture of Stamps, etc.&mdash;The increase of £27,325 is due to the rise in prices of normal requirements and the purchase of a reserve stock.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H (3)&mdash;Incidental Expenses. &mdash;The increase of £5,025 is mainly due to increased expenditure on the savings publicity campaign, the early Christmas posting campaign, postal advertisements and window cleaning.</P>
    <P>Sub-head 11&mdash;Engineering Establishment. &mdash;Increase £52,150.  This sub-head provides for the total pay of the engineering branch staff less a deduction for the cost of staff time devoted to the development of the telephone service (as distinct from its maintenance) which is met from telephone capital funds The increased provision is for maintenance and renewal work and reflects the growth in the size of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Sub-head 12&mdash;Travelling Expenses. &mdash; The increase of £8,750 is necessary to meet the additional travelling and subsistence for the augmented staff and also reflects the increased cost of fares by rail and road transport.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;Engineering Materials. &mdash;The decrease of £246,750 is due to a reduction in the purchase of emergency reserve stocks.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (3)&mdash;Contract Work.  &mdash; The increase of £166,950 is mainly due to the proposed renewal of Ship Street and Merrion Automatic Telephone Exchanges in Dublin, to which must be added an increased provision for work on telegraph and common service construction programmes.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (4)&mdash;Rents, Rates on Wires, Water, Light, etc. &mdash;The increase of £13,050 is mainly due to increased charges for electric light and power and arrears of rent on the new North Main Exchange, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments. &mdash;Increase £130,834.  Funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924-1951), which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue sums out of the Central Fund for this purpose. Repayment of these funds is made by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 20 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance, provision is made each year under this sub-head for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increased provision in the sub-head is an indication of the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances and other non-effective charges, exclusive of allowances granted under the Treaty of 6th December, 1921.  The increase of £5,300 is mainly due to the necessary increased provision for pensions, additional allowances and death gratuities.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (3)&mdash;Agency Payments in respect of Compensation Allowances. The increase of £5,000 is due in the main to the increase in the rate of these pensions.  It is offset by a similar increase in Appropriations-in-Aid (sub-head T, item (12)).</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q (2)&mdash;Provision and Installation of Equipment and Operating and Maintenance Charges, Rent, etc. The reduction of £6,030 is due to a less extensive programme of airport construction works.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid. The increase of £39,774 is due to expected increased receipts for work carried out for the Electricity Supply Board, from the Savings Bank and widows' and orphans' pensions, from Post Office premises sub-let and from the British Government for sums to be paid on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this Estimate last year I referred to the fact that the financial position was not satisfactory. I am sorry to say that the position has considerably worsened in the meantime. Deputies will remember that <Col N="176" /> the Post Office produces commercial accounts which are designed to show its position as a trading concern.  The figures in these accounts differ from the figures in the Appropriation Account of the Vote in that, for instance, allowances are made for the value of services rendered free to other Government Departments on the credit side and for interest on capital on the debit side.  It is unnecessary for me to go into detail as to how these commercial accounts are made up but Deputies will accept it that they do show the true position.  On this commercial account basis the deficit in 1949-50 was £167,251 and in 1950-51 £317,766.  While completed revenue and expenditure figures for 1951-52 are not available, preliminary figures indicate that there will be even a heavier deficit, something in the region of £900,000.  In 1952-53 the deficit may even exceed £1,000,000.  It is true that during these years a fair amount of stockpiling has taken place and is continuing. If the stockpiling is completely ignored the position in the current year is estimated to work out as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The deficit represents the difference between estimated expenditure and estimated receipts; it is only a balancing figure and cannot, therefore, be broken down into components.  What can be said by way of comment is that the main increases estimated in 1952-53 expenditure compared with 1950-51 (that is expenditure on the commercial account basis) are as follows:</P>

    <P>These items totalling £1,112,000 are offset to some extent by increase in <Col N="177" /> revenue mainly from the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The present serious financial position is under close and continual examination. An improvement could, of course, result from increased traffic as the available facilities could dispose of a good deal more traffic without commensurate extra expense, but on present indications it is unlikely that traffic will increase to an extent sufficient to wipe out the deficit.  So far as expenditure is concerned many measures of economy have been effected and others are being pursued, but the total resulting from even the most meticulous examination of all our expenditures&mdash;which incidentally would be a tremendous task&mdash;would be relatively small compared with the size of our deficit.</P>
    <P>It is traditional departmental policy that in the aggregate, the Post Office must pay for itself.  Being a public service, however, the Post Office cannot elect to provide facilities only where they would be remunerative or where there would be a little, if any, loss.  For example post offices serving scattered and sparsely populated communities are run at a loss.  In the telegraph service we lose an estimated £40,000 a year on delivery of telegrams beyond the distance of ½mile from the Post Office and apart from the delivery loss there is a further loss in maintaining telegraph offices with expensive equipment and lines in places which have light telegraph traffic; this applies even for some fair sized towns. Again most rural telephone call offices are run at a loss, but, as I have said, we must as a public service make these facilities available throughout the country and not merely in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the Post Office services are one indivisible whole, and in determining our charges it is the overall cost we have to recover, and it is right that Post Office users as a whole should pay for the Post Office services&mdash;there is no case for saddling the taxpaper with it.  In spreading the burden over Post Office users we will only be following what is done in the larger sphere of State finances where, in effect, taxes redistribute <Col N="178" /> income through social services.  So far as the Post Office is concerned the proportion of larger users is no different to that of the better off section of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>So I feel I must warn Deputies and the public of the likelihood that only an increase in charges will solve the problem of Post Office finances.  In this we would, of course, be only repeating the steps which other administrations throughout the world have found it necessary to take.  One example is that of Denmark, where the working of the post office resulted in a loss of £840,000 in 1949-50.  By means of increased charges that loss was reduced to the relatively inconsiderable figure of £110,000 in 1950-51.</P>
    <P>During the past year the mail services functioned satisfactorily.  In my speech on the 1951-52 Estimates I referred to the introduction a short time previously of the night air service between Dublin Airport and, Ringway, Manchester, for the conveyance of a considerable portion of the cross-channel mails.  Since its introduction this service has operated with a high degree of satisfaction.  Approximately 2,250,000 lb. of mail has been carried during the first complete year of operation.  A satisfactory degree of regularity has been acheived, and a tribute is due to Aer Lingus for the excellent manner in which it has operated the service.</P>
    <P>As indicated in my speech last year a day air mail service to Great Britain supplementary to the night mail service was introduced on the 7th May, 1951.  This service continues to be used for first class mail, i.e., letters, postcards and letter packets for a large part of Great Britain, which reach the Dublin Sorting Office between 6.15 p.m. and 5 a.m.</P>
    <P>The volume of letter mail traffic was well maintained during the first half of the financial year 1951-52 but a slight decline set in during the second half. This decline also manifested itself in parcel traffic.  The volume of mail during last Christmas was well up to the record 1950 traffic and the arrangements made for the disposal of the traffic worked very satisfactorily.  The thanks of the Department are due to the public for the manner, in which <Col N="179" /> they responded to the &ldquo;post early&rdquo; appeal.</P>
    <P>The provision of up-to-date sorting fittings and equipment was continued during the past year.  The developments in this field included the provision of electrically driven stamp cancelling machines at sixteen provincial head offices.  Owing to difficulty in obtaining mounting plates for stamp vending machines the installation of these machines has not satisfactorily progressed during the year 1951-52.  I hope that it will be possible to expedite the installations during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The work of revising rural postal services with a view to giving daily deliveries on restricted delivery posts and improving the times of arrival and despatches of mails generally in rural areas was continued throughout the year, and the services in the Nenagh, Roscrea, Thurles, Tipperary, Kilkenny and Kilmallock districts were reorganised. The reorganisation in these areas involved the introduction of 16 departmental motor services and the provision of daily delivery on 75 restricted posts.  A scheme in respect of the Cavan head office district was implemented early in May last.  Three departmental motor services were introduced and a daily delivery provided on 47 restricted delivery posts.  We have under review the frequency of delivery throughout the County Donegal area, and it is hoped that it will be possible to introduce a daily frequency of delivery on most of the restricted posts in County Donegal at a fairly early date.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have already said about the worsening of the Department's financial position, I feel compelled to sound a warning note regarding the implementation of the scheme for the extension of daily deliveries to all rural areas.  The scheme was originally undertaken on the understanding that, taking the rough with the smooth, the Exchequer would not be required to bear any additional expenditure.  The stage has now been reached when, having regard to increased staff wages and increased charges generally for mechanical transport, petrol, etc., I am not fully <Col N="180" /> satisfied that the implementation of the scheme in its entirety will not impose a burden on the Exchequer.  I am, therefore, having the whole position reviewed.</P>
    <P>During the year seven new sub-offices were opened; money order and savings bank facilities were extended to 32 sub-offices and 31 new letter boxes were provided.</P>
    <P>As a result of the enactment during 1951 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, the Department will, it is hoped, be in a position to introduce the business reply service this year and to extend the application of the special &ldquo;literature for the blind&rdquo; postage rate to many other articles intended for the use of the blind.</P>
    <P>The centenary of the death of the poet Thomas Moore occurred this year and steps are being taken to issue a commemorative stamp in his honour. The stamp will be in two denominations, and will, it is expected, be available for sale about August-September next.  As the first stamp printed in the recess process in Ireland it will mark an epoch in the manufacture of Irish stamps in this country.</P>
    <P>A departmental committee has been set up to see what improvements or modifications can be usefully effected in respect of postmen's uniforms.</P>
    <P>Telegraph Service.  &mdash;The House was informed before that the Department was carrying out an examination of the telegraph service in an effort to stem the rising loss and to bring about greater efficiency.  As part of a general scheme it was decided to instal teleprinters instead of Morse telegraph apparatus at a number of the larger centers.  This work is now proceeding. As a first step it was necessary to set up training centres for the training of learners and existing staff in teleprinter working.  These centres have now been established at a number of offices.  The training of the existing staff is troublesome and will take some time.  The training officers have in some cases to be sent from existing teleprinter centres like Dublin and the staff being trained have to carry on their ordinary post office duties during the training period.  Teleprinter operation is, of course, technically more complex than Morse, and to enable our <Col N="181" /> technicians to keep the teleprinters and associated equipment in order when installed special training classes are also being conducted at present.  It is anticipated that teleprinter circuits can be set up in about ten offices during the course of the year When that has been done, about half the initial teleprinter scheme will have been completed. Of course, teleprinters will improve the telegraph position only at the principal centres, but the largest part of the telegraph traffic is handled at these centres.  At the smaller offices where Morse working is still in operation and at the still smaller offices where telegrams and telephone calls are transmitted over the same circuits we must depend on long-term telephone developments to make the position better for telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The telegraph service to islands off the coast has been the cause of a good deal of representation to the Department from time to time because of interruptions that have taken place. The existing means of telegraph communication with the majority of these islands were provided in 1939.  The equipment installed at that time was the best that had been developed.  It was not, however, entirely satisfactory. In the absence of a mains supply of electricity on the islands the batteries for telegraphic operation had to be charged by wind chargers.  These were often damaged or blown down in storms, and could not readily be repaired owing to the difficulty of getting to the islands in bad weather. An improved type of equipment has recently been developed and tried out by the British Post Office, and it offers the possibility of a much improved method of communication with places, such as the islands, which have not got an electric power supply.  Dry batteries are used, and I understand they last for many months without replacement. The equipment is otherwise very much more up-to-date than the existing equipment.  An order has been placed for a number of sets of the new apparatus for the purpose of improving our island telegraphs.  Delivery of the equipment will not be due, however, until the 31st December, 1952.  In the meantime, a survey will be carried out to ascertain suitable locations for <Col N="182" /> the installation of the equipment, and it is hoped that actual installation can begin in the early spring of 1953.</P>
    <P>A sum of £34,000 was included in last year's Estimate to provide modern transmitting and receiving equipment for the coast radio stations at Malin Head and Valentia.  Unfortunately, it was not found possible to procure a suitable type of apparatus during the year and the work could not therefore be carried out.  Financial provision is again being made this year for the coast station modernisation and every effort will be made to get the necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>In connection with the telephone call office scheme, the Department provides telegraph facilities where practicable at offices where call offices are established in order to bring telegraph delivery facilities within the reach of residents of remote areas.  The provision of these facilities not only expedites delivery of telegrams by reducing the delivery areas of neighbouring telegraph offices but eases somewhat departmental difficulty in securing casual messengers to effect delivery. Telegraph facilities were extended to 23 post offices during the year.</P>
    <P>With the ever-increasing growth in the number of telephone subscribers&mdash; very many of whom appear to be unaware of the utility of the telephone <i>vis-à-vis</i> the telegraph service&mdash;I arranged to have greater publicity given to the facility of having telegrams forwarded and delivered by telephone. There are three important advantages in having telegrams delivered by telephone; delivery is speedier than by messenger; the addressee receives a confirmatory copy by post; the telegrams addressed telephonically usually cost less because the number of words in the address can be smaller.  There is no difficulty in obtaining these benefits.  All the sender of a telegram has to do is to use his corres. pondent's telephone address, e.g., &ldquo;Kelly, Dublin, 39124.&rdquo;  If he cannot ascertain his correspondent's telephone number but is aware that he has a telephone, the sender of a telegram may insert the word &ldquo;Telephone.&rdquo; free of charge, before the address of the message.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> Telephone Service.  &mdash;The growth of the telephone service was well maintained during the past year. Local traffic increased by 6,251,000 calls over the 1950 figure to 75,539,000; the number of trunk calls at 10,117,000 showed an increase of 683,000 over the corresponding figure for the previous year.  There was no relaxation during 1951 in the effort to provide service for waiting applicants and a total of 6,639 new telephone lines were provided, of which 4,556 were in Dublin and 2,083 in the Provinces.  This total exceeded that attained the previous year.</P>
    <P>The policy of clearing waiting applications by exchange areas was continued, priority being given to those areas where there were outstanding 1949 or earlier applications.  By disposing of the longest waiting applications in this way, a substantial improvement in the general position was effected.  All but a few pre-1950 applicants and all but about 250 1950 applicants have now been offered service.  The balance of some 5,500 applications at present on hand were all made last year or in the current year.</P>
    <P>Work on the scheme for installing call offices in rural post offices was continued during the year and 171 new call offices were provided, which is a record number since the scheme was started, the numbers for 1948 and 1950 being 91 and 73 respectively.  Over 80 extra call offices have been opened this year to a recent date.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier in the year, I have decided to speed up further the work on the rural call office programme with a view to providing public telephones in the remaining 500 odd offices still without them within a period of approximately two years.</P>
    <P>This will be a considerable undertaking, for most of the post offices in question are in remote areas and the erection of hundreds of miles of new poles and wire will be involved; but I believe the work is important and warrants a certain measure of priority over ordinary rural telephone lines for individuals, not only because it will <Col N="184" /> bring the benefits of the telephone service earlier to remote rural communities, but also because it will help rural telephone development by extending the telephone network into areas not previously served, and so facilitate at a later stage the work of providing service for prospective applicants in those areas.  The demands on skilled staff of the expanded call office programme will necessitate the deferment of applications for long rural lines involving abnormal construction work &mdash;excepting, of course, applications in the essential service groups&mdash;but for the reasons I have mentioned and in view of the improvement in the waiting applicant position generally this deferment will not be too much to pay for the speed-up in the work on the rural call office scheme.  In order to ensure that this work is planned and carried out in the most efficient and economical manner, in conjunction with the work of providing service for waiting applicants, the order of installation will be determined entirely by engineering considerations.  This will mean that some areas will not be reached at all this year, but on the other hand the concentration of engineering effort should enable all areas to be reached and the call office scheme to be completed in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain the maximum return as soon as possible from expensive new plant and equipment, exchange areas on the new cable route and where new automatic equipment has been or is being provided will receive special attention during the current year.  Twenty-three new kiosks were provided during 1951.  It is hoped to provide many more during the current year.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the Dublin automatic system was considerably increased during the year by the opening of a new main automatic exchange in Thomas Lane to serve the central city area. The automatic system was also extended to the Finglas and Swords areas. Work is proceeding on the installation of equipment in the new trunk exchange at St. Andrew Street and in the new automatic exchange in Mount Merrion.  It is hoped to bring the Mount Merrion exchange into service shortly and to have portion of the St. <Col N="185" /> Andrew Street exchange working this Summer.  Installation of a new automatic exchange at Clondalkin to serve the Clondalkin-Tallaght area will commence within the next few months and it is expected that the new system will be brought into service early in 1953.</P>
    <P>Normally the underground cable network of a city or large town should carry a sufficient proportion of spare telephone circuits to meet growth and provide alternative lines immediately for subscribers whose lines are found to be faulty.  Owing to the demands made on the Dublin underground system during the war and subsequent years and to the fact that from 1948 to 1951 subscribers were joined at the expense of essential new trunk and maintenance work, I have had to take courage and direct a considerable staff to renewing and supplementing the Dublin cable system.</P>
    <P>The staff directed to carry out this work will be unable in consequence to join annually about 500 subscribers in the Dublin area.  However, by the time the staff commence operations, we will have joined so many more Dublin subscribers than in the corresponding eight months of 1951 that no one will notice any extra delay this year and I hope to complete the work in a relatively short period. The result will release more staff from repair work later on.  In this connection, I am aware that there are undesirable delays in repairing faults and the matter is receiving attention while the volume of faults will be steadily reduced.</P>
    <P>During the year, arrangements were made to improve estimation of delay on calls and to obviate as far as possible the need for further enquiries by subscribers about probable duration of delay after such estimates have been given.  The latter object has been secured by arranging that the subscriber is advised in advance if an estimate of delay on a call already given is likely to be exceeded.  The procedure has worked very satisfactorily and has resulted in a reduction in the number of enquiries and complaints.</P>
    <P>The cycle of telephone traffic reaches its peak in the months of July, August and September each year. <Col N="186" /> The provision of adequate staff to handle the traffic at all times but particularly during the long Summer evenings and during special occasions, such as the Horse Show, when traffic is much heavier than normal, is a difficult problem.  In an effort to meet the situation, it has recently been decided to recruit a special temporary part-time force of male officers.  They are all existing employees of the Department and it has been arranged that, following suitable training, such members of them as may be required from time to time on special occasions will be called in to operate.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of providing the best possible training for telephonists, special efforts are being made to improve training facilities. At Dublin voice recording apparatus has been used to enable trainees to hear their own voices; a special training switchboard is being provided and it is also hoped to supplement ordinary instruction by the use of films.  Refresher course for telephonists who had passed the training stage and for supervisors were continued during the year.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the whole of the complex regulations governing the work of the telephone operators of both sexes in the Exchequer Street exchange have been examined and changed, where necessary, and a complete investigation of the physical conditions, rest periods, and social amenities has also been undertaken. Considerable modifications and improvements in the general amenities of the Central Telephone Exchange have been effected, under my personal supervision.</P>
    <P>All the staff grades have been most helpful in making suggestions, overcoming difficulties and reducing to negligible proportions the frictions that inevitably arise when absolute efficiency is required under conditions of tension.  The result has been, I am glad to say, highly commended by the public at large, and I hope to report further progress next year.  This is apart from representation made and examined by the staff associations concerned and which are the subject of general Civil Service control.  These <Col N="187" /> are in course of investigation and relate in many instances to the scheme of Civil Service arbitration now again in operation.</P>
    <P>In the Provinces, a new auto-manual exchange was opened at Dundalk and installation of equipment was begun in an auto-manual exchange at Waterford. Small automatic exchanges were installed last year at Castlecomer and Mitchelstown and further exchanges of the same kind have been provided this year at Carrickmacross, Trim and Tullow.  Nine small automatic exchanges will be provided this year at Nenagh, Muine Bheag and Maynooth. Switchboard equipment at 99 manual exchanges was extended.</P>
    <P>During 1951 trunk service over many routes was substantially improved, mostly by the bringing into use of circuits provided by the Southern Trunk Cable.  For some months past a demand service has been given between all exchanges on the routes Dublin - Nass - Port Laoighise-Roscrea-Limerick - Mallow - Cork; Dublin - Kilkenny and Dublin-Port Laoighise-Tullamore-Clara. The long distance co-axial circuits are now working on the Dublin-Port Laoighise-Limerick-Cork cable routes, and it is expected that the remaining circuits to be obtained from the cable will be in service later in the year.</P>
    <P>The co-axial trunk cable to the Border to link with a similar cable being laid by the British Post Office from Belfast was laid last year and recently some temporary circuits in it have been brought into operation on the Dublin-Drogheda-Dundalk routes providing a demand service, except for a short time during the busiest portion of the day when there is a little delay. More circuits which will eliminate this are expected within a few months.  It will take about another year at least to instal, test and bring the terminal equipment required for the long-distance circuits to Belfast into operation.</P>
    <P>Moreover it has now been decided to go ahead as soon as practicable with a further major underground cable scheme to serve the West and North-West but it will be at least two to three years before it can be laid <Col N="188" /> and brought into use.  This cable will run from Dublin to Sligo with a branch to Athlone to link with the Southern trunk cable.</P>
    <P>When the Southern co-axial cable is brought into service within the next few months a 12-channel carrier system now in use in the Dublin-Limerick route will be transferred to the Dublin-Sligo route.  This will double the number of trunk circuits between Dublin and Sligo.  In the Southern trunk cable circuits have been provided: as far as Athlone for extension to the West.  As far as Limerick and Mallow for extension to the South-West.</P>
    <P>In order to complete these extensions from the cable terminals as rapidly as possible arrangements are being made to purchase some new 12-channel carrier systems.  The order for this equipment has been placed and delivery is expected to commence about next September.  Installation will take a few months longer.  These systems will be installed between Athlone cable terminal and Galway; Athlone and Claremorris; Sligo and Letterkenny.  The circuits serving Letterkenny and Lifford will be rearranged at the same time; Mallow cable terminal and Killarney.</P>
    <P>The 12-channel carriers specifled above will greatly increase the capacity of the main trunk routes to the centres now most heavily overloaded in the North-Western, Western and SouthWestern areas and will enable a no delay service to be given on these routes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 12-channel carriers, however, the following other circuit additions are proposed:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It is hoped that it will also be possible to erect some additional physical circuits on other routes in those areas. The principal ones proposed are: Letterkenny-Burton Port, Letterkenny-Milford, Letterkenny-Lifford, Lifford-Raphoe.</P>
    <P>The foregoing proposals for the West <Col N="189" /> and North-West are intended to meet requirements in advance of the laying of underground trunk cable from Dublin to Mullingar with branches to Athlone and Sligo.</P>
    <P>In view of the relatively high telephone density in the neighbourhood of Dublin and Cork special attention will be given to improvement of the trunk service in these areas.</P>
    <P>Other circuits in course of construction will be as follows: Dublin-An Uaimh, Dublin-Ceanannus Mór, Dublin-Carlow and Athy, Dublin-Edenderry, Dublin-Wicklow.  When the Southern and Northern cables are in operation a number of overhead physical wires will also be thrown spare and will be used to improve local trunk services.</P>
    <P>The remaining 200 miles of trunk line constructed will be given to other routes where relief is badly needed, for example: Mullingar - Granard, Cavan-Belturbet, Castleblayney-Cootehill, Arva-Killeshandra, and the other districts in Donegal which I have indicated.</P>
    <P>During the current year special attention is being given to improvement of the telephone service in the areas around Dublin and Cork, as these areas have a relatively high telephone density.  It is planned to provide about 650 miles of additional trunk circuits including the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dublin-An Uaimh (3 channel carrier), Dublin-Enniskerry (2 circuits), Dublin-Kilcock (2 circuits), Dublin-Rathoath (1 circuit); Wicklow-Greystones (2 circuits), Wicklow-Kilbride (1 circuit), Wicklow-Rathdrum (1 circuit), Wicklow-Aughrim (1 circuit); Arklow-Shillelagh (1 circuit); Dublin-Wicklow, Dublin-Ceanannus Mór, Dublin-Edenderry (as already indicated); Cork-Dunmanway (1 circuit), Cork-Kinsale (1 circuit); Mallow-Newmarket (1 circuit), Mallow-Lombardstown (1 circuit). Work is already commenced in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Clearance of waiting applications in exchanges in the Dublin and Cork dormitory areas is also being given special attention.  Work is proceeding or will shortly commence in many of the local exchange areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> Early this year the restrictions on fixed time calls within the country were removed.  The restrictions on the fixed time service on the cross-channel route will be removed very shortly.</P>
    <P>A new service known as the alarm clock service whereby subscribers may arrange with the local exchange to call them at a specified time in the early morning or at any other time has recently been introduced.  The service should be useful, for example, to subscribers who wish to be sure of catching an early morning train.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to obtain a supply of coloured telephone instruments (i.e., in colours other than black; for example, ivory, red, green), and these will be supplied to new subscribers, if required, in place of the standard black instruments at an extra charge.</P>
    <P>Because of the volume of urgent engineering work on hand and in prospect, it is not proposed, for the present, to accede to requests for replacements of existing (black) instruments by coloured instruments.</P>
    <P>Some 500 post offices out of a total of 1,500 equipped with public telephones are not provided with silence cabinets, which are a form of telephone booth used to afford privacy and quiet for the making of calls on the public telephones.  Of the 500 without cabinets very few can show any considerable user; cabinets will be provided in all cases where any appreciable use is made of the public telephone.</P>
    <P>The present type of cabinet, costing about £90 each new, is an expensive item, owing to the superior standard of construction (for example, double glass panels) used for sound-proofing and exclusion of noise.  It is not, therefore, the practice at present to provide cabinets at offices where the user does not exceed an average of about 3s. 6d. a day (this would represent only one or two trunk calls), nor are cabinets provided for new rural call offices unless it is clear they will be warranted by the user.</P>
    <P>Owing to the high cost of the present type of standard cabinet, the question of designing a simpler and less expensive kind of cabinet for <Col N="191" /> smaller offices is being examined, but it will be some time before much progress can be reported because of the volume of urgent work in hand.</P>
    <P>There is still abnormal delay on calls to Great Britain because of shortage of circuits in the cross-channel cables. Arrangements have been made with the British Post Office to fit submarine repeaters on two existing cables which will increase the number of circuits from 47 to 108.  It is hoped to have the additional circuits in service some time next year.</P>
    <P>During 1951 continouous telephone service was provided at 31 exchanges where the hours of service were previously restricted.  Facilities were also provided whereby emergency calls may be made after normal post office hours from a number of post office call offices in areas where a day service only is given.  In areas where the Garda station is vacated at night and where there are doctors, nursing homes and hotels suitable arrangements for night-connections are made whenever possible.  I should like to add that my Department is anxious to provide continuous service for all subscribers and has gone a considerable distance in this direction as indicated by the fact that over 94 per cent. of subscribers' lines have 24-hour service. The cost of providing all-night attendance at small exchanges where not more than one or two night calls would be made in the course of a whole week would, however, be out of all proportion to the revenue from such calls. It is always open to the subscriibers concerned to obtain extended or continuous attendance by bearing the extra cost themselves.</P>
    <P>It is yet too early to assess the full effects of the increases in telephone charges, some of which did not become operative till 1st January last. Although there has been, as might be expected, some falling off in the number of applications for new telephones, demand still continues at a fairly high level and there has been no reduction in call traffic.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of replying to certain criticisms of the increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> It has been represented that the increased charges are intended to fleece telephone users for the benefit of the telegraph and postal services. This, of course, is not true.  The telephone service had been practically unique in maintaining its charges at little more than pre-war rates until late last year but wage rates had increased by over 90 per cent., the cost of engineering materials had advanced on average by over 180 per cent., and the plain fact was that the service could not operate on pre-war charges plus 5 per cent. indefinitely.  If telephone charges had not been increased last year there would have been a substantial deficit estimated at £100,000 on the working of the service in 1951/52 and a deficit of at least £250,000 in the current financial year.  The increases imposed will only be about just sufficient to save the general taxpayer from having to bear a loss on the telephone service in addition to the losses on the postal and telegraph services.</P>
    <P>It is surprising what misconceptions exist in regard to the provision and cost of telephone service.  We have had critics comparing the rental of a telephone with the cost of an instrument and there are many people who think that telephone service is laid on like electricity or gas&mdash;by tapping a common supply in street mains outside the subscriber's gate or by tapping the line of the subscriber next door.  They do not realise that not only does every telephone subscriber have individual plant at his premises but he is also provided with a pair of wires for his exclusive use running all the way to the exchange which may be several miles distant.  Moreover, at the exchange each subscriber's line must be provided with terminating equipment; in automatic exchanges this may cost up to £50 per line.  Heavy capital cost must, therefore, be incurred in providing a telephone for each subscriber and, of course, expert engineering and operating staff must be available at all times to attend to calls and keep each circuit in proper working order.  The public may be interested to know that the annual charges for interest and depreciation alone on telephone plant is at present about £10 per line which <Col N="193" /> is considerably more than most subscribers pay in rental.  Moreover, the average capital cost of providing a telephone line is now roughly about £150. The cost of providing a single rural line may run to several hundred pounds towards which the subscriber pays only a comparatively small rental.  Contrary to popular belief, there is no installation charge.</P>
    <P>A departmental committee has been set up to examine telephone rates and charges and to make recommendations. In particular, the committee will examine the rates for rural telephone lines and the possibility of offering party line telephones (with secrecy if practicable) at attractive and economic rates.</P>
    <P>In this connection I am completely dissatisfied with the long-established tradition, unchanged since 1921, whereby it has been made as difficult as possible for farmers to have telephones. Every obstacle in the way of deposit charges, rental charges, to be paid in advance, is placed in their way.</P>
    <P>We have about one-tenth of the telephones installed with farmers of any given acreage compared with any agricultural exporting country in Europe.  Compared with cigarettes, wireless, motor cars, rural electrification, the telephone is virtually unknown in rural districts.  It is true that farmers have not been vociferous for a change, but they have never been properly canvassed by methods similar to those used by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The difficulties to be surmounted are grave.  Insufficiency of electrical engineers graduating from the universities not only makes it difficult to overcome the existing backlog of applications for service, but to extend planning on any very large-scale basis beyond that indicated in the Estimate.  However, the committee will carry out my instructions as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that we will receive a subsidy for rural telephone development work, and we may have to ask our subscribers, as a whole, to invest in rural telephone development, knowing that when the telephone habit has become universal the cost of telephones <Col N="194" /> will be less compared with other non-expanding services.</P>
    <P>Buildings and Supplies.  &mdash;In regard to the Department's building programme, a fair amount of progress was achieved during the past year.  New telephone exchange buildings are nearing completion at Waterford and Athlone, and have already been completed at Dunboyne, Maynooth, Muine Bheag, Trim and Tullow, at Hamman Buildings, Dublin, and at Clondalkin and Stillorgan, County Dublin.  Demolition operations were carried out on sites at Drogheda, where post office and telephone exchange buildings are to be erected, and Limerick, where a new telephone exchange is proposed.  Structural improvements to existing post office premises were carried out at Cork, Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle and Wexford, and a newly-acquired premises at Cahirciveen was converted to serve as a post office.  As a result of major alterations in the General Post Office, Dublin, substantial additional studio and ancillary accommodation for Radio Éireann has been made available. Other building works or schemes of structural alterations in course of completion are: a new post office and telephone exchange at St. Andrew Street, Dublin, improvements scheme at Ballyhaunis Post Office, construction of a new mechanical transport repair shop and garage at St. John's Road, Dublin, and extensive adaptation of premises in Distillery Road, Dublin, to serve as an engineering garage and workmen's headquarters.</P>
    <P>Building operations are due to commence in the current year on the erection of new post office and telephone exchange buildings at Drogheda, Kilrush and Rath Luire, on Telephone exchange buildings at Sutton, Mullingar and Limerick, and on improvement schemes at Ballina, Bray, Birr, Cahir, Clonmel, Clifden, Enniscorthy, Port Laoighise and Tralee Post Offices.</P>
    <P>Preliminary arrangements for the erection of new buildings or for structural improvement schemes at Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Naas, Wicklow, Athenry, Galway, Youghal, Port Laoighise, Sligo, and at a number of other places are well under way.</P>
    <P>In all the building projects to which I have referred my Department has <Col N="195" /> had due regard to the question of suitable welfare facilities for its staffs, and there will, I think, be no cause for complaints on this score.</P>
    <P>I have been trying for some time past to have set in motion a campaign having for its object the brightening up of my Department's public offices throughout the country.  I consider it highly desirable that the post offices in our provincial towns should present a really attractive appearance.  Not only is this desirable in the interest of our own people who use the post office all the year round and for the bulk of whom the post office is probably the only State buildings in which they ever have occasion to transact business, but also in the interest of the passing tourists whose opinion of the standard of our State buildings, and perhaps indeed of our State services, may very well be based on the general appearance of the provincial post offices they visit during their stay with us.  The present appearance&mdash;both internal and external&mdash;of our post offices does, I am afraid, leave much to be desired, but I am hopeful that the full co-operation of my colleague in the Office of Public Works will be forthcoming in ensuring that there will be a progressive increase in the amount and an improvement in the quality of the redecoration work each year henceforth until the stage is reached when we can feel satisfied that a standard of appearance has been achieved which is beyond reasonable criticism.</P>
    <P>In order to improve the interior appearance of post offices and to end the present haphazard practice whereby public notices are affixed to walls and windows, thus creating a general impression of untidiness, it was decided last year, in consultation with other Government Departments interested, to introduce a system whereby notices for public exhibition would be of standard sizes for exhibition in standard size notice boards.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works was accordingly requested to supply a hundred boards, each capable of accommodating eight 18'' × 12'' notices and three 12'' × 9'' notices for issue to <Col N="196" /> Head Offices, Dublin Branch and District Offices and Class VI Offices.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that an extensive new site would need to be acquired for a Central Sorting Office in Dublin.  Agreement for the acquisition of the site was reached and legal arrangements for completing transfer of the property are in train.</P>
    <P>I intimated last year that considerable quantities of stores and materials were in course of purchase to provide against a shortage of supplies.  Very substantial deliveries have since been effected, the stocks concerned constituting an emergency reserve for the maintenance of services and the continuance of telephone development.</P>
    <P>Staffing.  &mdash;Everyone must, I am sure, realise that staffing costs represent the lion's share of post office expenditure. This is necessarily so as so much of the facilities given by the Department involve personal service by someone or other&mdash;the counter clerk, the sorter, the postman, the telephonist, the telegraphist, the technician, the electrician and the installer.  In fact, of the present gross Estimate figure of over £7,000,000 no less than £4,585,160 is provided in the various sub-heads for staff, the A group, I (1) and Q (1), and adding the £377,300 for superannuation, the total required for the human element is not far short of £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>With a wages bill of such dimensions it is obvious that any increase in pay, no matter how small it may appear to the individual officer who gets it, will have a substantial effect on the Department's finances.  In fact the increase in wages effected last year requires the provision of an additional £592,000 in the current year's Estimate. Of the total £75,580 covers all supervisory grades from Staff Officer, Grade III, in the general service and Overseer in the departmental grades and upwards, over £516,000 going to the rank and file grades.  Had it not been for this pay increase the overall deficit would work out at under £500,000.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I must point out, in regard to staff costs, that the number of Post Office employees has not had to be increased to anything like the same extent as the increase in <Col N="197" /> traffic handled.  For statistical purposes the Post Office reduces the various items of work to a unit value. Using this system, postal traffic in 1951 was 47 per cent. above 1939, telegraph traffic 105 per cent. above 1939, telephone trunk traffic 104 per cent. above 1939 and local traffic 115 per cent. above 1939.  In striking contrast the total staff increased by only 26 per cent. in the same period.</P>
    <P>While these figures are striking it might well be asked whether this represents the limit in efficient working and whether in fact the organisation of duties and the methods used are the most economical that can be designed. To that question I would answer that the search for greater efficiency is a continuous thing in my Department. Seeing that the operation of the various services run by the Department are so much influenced by outside factors, e.g., changes in population, changes in the method and timings of transport, improvements in technical processes, it is inevitable that the idea of change in method is accepted as something normal, and throughout the Department many different blocks of staff are engaged wholly or mainly on the job of altering services to meet changed conditions or improving them within the same set of conditions.</P>
    <P>The idea that procedures and methods should not be static naturally permeated the sections dealing with internal clerical work and during the years very many changes have been made.  For instance, when the Savings Bank was set up here in 1923 a mechanised system of accounting was adopted from the start designed by officers of the Accountant's Branch after examination of the systems used in European countries.</P>
    <P>Just as in manufacturing and commercial organisations, however, it is true that the idea of special campaigns to improve methods in the sphere of clerical working was of much later date than similar campaigns on the manipulative side.  Organisation and methods as such, that is, the assignment to particular officers of the fulltime job of improving methods only started here about 1945, though it is relevant to point out that in this the <Col N="198" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs were pioneers in the Civil Service of this country.  This special examination of organisation and methods, on which two officers are engaged at a cost of approximately £1,300 per annum, has produced not alone greater efficiency but economies in staffing which in the aggregate amount to at least £16,000 a year.  And as already indicated, very many important improvements in procedure were made as bright ideas occurred to individuals during all the years beforehand.  This process still goes on.  In general people on clerical work do not wait for an O. &amp; M. investigation if they themselves can see some way of bettering things.  Literally hundreds of improvements, some big, some small, have been made even without the help of the O. &amp; M. scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department's O. &amp; M. officers keep in touch with similar officers in other Departments here so as to keep abreast of any improvements which have been effected elsewhere.  Moreover, both the O. &amp; M. officers and those officers who are concerned with the manipulative working in the postal, telegraph and telephone services keep in touch with practice in other postal administrations by means of the information services run by the international organisations and by direct discussions with officers of other countries where necessary.</P>
    <P>Akin to this subject is that of the training of staff.  The Post Office was also a pioneer in staff training so far as this country was concerned.  All over the world it has been proved that while you can learn by experience you can learn very much better&mdash;and much easier&mdash;when experience is supplemented by formal training courses. Training systems are in operation&mdash; some have been in operation for quite a few years&mdash;for postal staff in Dublin and Cork, for telephonists throughout the country, for engineering branch workmen, and for the clerical, etc., staffs in Dublin.  In addition, periodical conferences are held for telephone supervisors and a conference for postmasters is held every two years, in the course of which there is a two-way interchange of information between postmasters and the administrative <Col N="199" /> staffs at headquarters.  Conversely, members of the headquarters staff go on short visits to provincial centres to study the provision of the various services to the public and the organisation, procedures and problems of postmasters' offices.</P>
    <P>Savings Banks.  &mdash;A fairly substantial increase in business is reflected by the figures for 1951 both as regards the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Banks.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the former rose from £11,285,000 in 1950 to £12,658,000 in 1951, withdrawals from £8,190,000 to £8,650,000 and the net receipts, or surplus of deposits over withdrawals, from £3,095,000 to £4,008,000.  Interest earned during the year is estimated at £1,218,000 and the addition of this sum, plus the surplus receipts, to depositors' balances brings the amount due to them at the end of 1951 to approximately £53,359,000.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the year by the Trustee Savings Banks amounted to £991,000, withdrawals to £268,000, and interest earned to £217,000.  The deposits were £183,000 more than those for the preceding year, the withdrawals £174,000 less.  The balance to credit of the Trustee Banks at the end of the year was approximately £8,048,000.</P>
    <P>The combined balances, Post Office and Trustee, at 31st December amounted to £61,406,000, as compared with £55,241,000 at the same date the previous year.</P>
    <P>Savings Certificates.  &mdash;Business for the year showed little change as compared with the previous year.  Receipts from sales amounted to £1,479,000. Repayment of principal to £1,015,000 and interest to £417,000.  Corresponding figures for 1950 were £1,409,000, £958,000 and £397,000.</P>
    <P>The amount of principal due to investors at the end of the year stood at £13,477,000, as compared with £13,012,000 at the end of 1950.</P>
    <P>A new issue of Savings Certificates, giving a more attractive return for the initial investment, was placed on sale in May, 1952.</P>
    <P>Conciliation and Arbitration.  &mdash;Prior to the suspension of the conciliation <Col N="200" /> and arbitration scheme on 31st May, 1951, a number of recommendations had been made by the departmental council on staff claims covering large numbers of staff of various grades in the engineering branch and in the postal and telegraph services.  All the recommendations made, which involved substantial increases in pay, were accepted and eventually implemented. When the scheme was suspended there were six staff claims in course of hearing by the council, and a further six on hands awaiting hearing, with others in preparation.  When operations can be resumed every effort will be made to expedite treatment of the outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I should like to pay tribute to the zealous and efficient service which has been rendered throughout the year by the staff of all grades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back.  We are somewhat disappointed with the Minister's speech.  It has been in conformity with the speeches which we have heard from him during the last 12 months. With regard to &ldquo;stores other than engineering materials,&rdquo; I notice that under sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores&mdash;there is a decrease this year of £53,100, and that under sub-head G (2)&mdash;Uniform Clothing&mdash;there is a decrease of £126,300.  I find that under sub-head K &mdash;Engineering Materials&mdash;the decrease amounts to £246,750.  We are told now, 12 months after, that, as a result of the accumulations of uniform and engineering materials which had been stockpiled, we are able to have these decreases.  We find that these accumulations are now of benefit to the present Government.  That is the position, although the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have stated that the only stockpiling that was done was in the matter of mouse-traps and consumer goods.  The stockpiling, however, was such in regard to engineering materials and uniform clothing, which is supplied not only to the Post Office but to every other Government Department, that it has been sufficient to enable the Minister to reduce expenditure under these sub-heads this year by the figures I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, gave us, <Col N="201" /> as in the case of the curate's egg, the good portions and the bad portions. He sounded a note of warning, and said that, if we are going to demand the continuation and extension of the daily delivery of letters in the rural areas, there will have to be further increases.  I appealed to him last year to stand up to the Department of Finance which is always out for economy. Over the last 20 years, its first move, in the line for economy, always was to attack the daily delivery of letters in the rural areas, while giving extra deliveries in the cities and the towns. What that means, of course, is that we are to make the people in the rural areas suffer all the disadvantages and inconveniences for the sake of giving extra facilities in the cities and the towns.</P>
    <P>The Minister points out that he is afraid that there will have to be increases unless we can give a guarantee to the Department of Finance of being able to avoid extra burdens on that Department by a continuance of the policy of grouping areas in regard to the facilities afforded to the people. Why should the people in the rural areas have to suffer?  Why should they have to make sacrifices for the sake of the people in the cities and towns who have all the facilities?  The Minister has said that if Deputies are going to press for further extensions, in the case of the rural areas, he will be faced with the problem of increasing charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister points out that a committee is examining the rates and charges, to arrange attractive and economic rates.  Does that mean that they are to be further increased, even if a lesser demand is made for telephones? I maintain that the Minister is making the user of the telephone pay for the loss on telegrams.  There was a loss of over £40,000 on telegrams and a surplus of about £45,000 on telephones.  Why not continue and expand into the rural areas and not refuse business people and others there the telephones they need so badly?  If there is a surplus, that would increase the amount of that surplus.</P>
    <P>The Minister points to the experience <Col N="202" /> of Denmark.  We do not need to go to Denmark.  We understood that wonderful things would happen after the Minister's previous visit, but he only points out that Denmark has reduced the deficit by increasing the charges.  We all know you can increase charges, but will that bring in extra customers?  Will increased charges mean that many business people and others will continue to use telephones? We must view this from our own national point of view&mdash;not that of the Department of Finance, that a particular section must pay&mdash;and we must look on the Post Office, as a whole, as a national service.  Why should the person in a backward rural area not have similar facilities to those people in the cities?</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to continue the reorganisation of the rural areas, to give the people there daily postal deliveries, instead of two deliveries a week, as in many of the outlying areas. Quite often, a person may not get a letter, telling of the illness of a relative, until after they have received a telegram telling of that relative's death.  We know that if the delivery is on a Friday, the school may be closed and the letters not delivered until the children are returning from school on the following Monday or Tuesday.  Letters mean nothing unless there is a daily or frequent delivery. As I know for the last 20 years, every time the Department of Finance is out for economy they attack a section of the rural areas by reducing the postal deliveries.  They were reduced ten or 15 years ago, and we have been unable to get them back since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of facilities in Donegal.  I understood two years ago, according to the report given to me, that an arrangement was made with the British authorities for the supply of new equipment.  I was surprised that some of the equipment had not been installed on the islands.  Surely when the data had been supplied to the engineering section and the apparatus was ready there was nothing to prevent the Department putting that apparatus on the islands so that we would have some report by now as to its usefulness or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of improving the <Col N="203" /> building scheme.  There can be no hope whatever for that while he is depending on the Board of Works, which is faced with providing schools, Garda barracks, harbours and things like that.  If the Post Office is ever to improve the facilities in the provincial areas, they will have to use their own labour scheme or their own building scheme.  They must have architects in provincial areas to carry out the plans submitted to and approved by the Board of Works.  If they wait for the Board of Works architects, it will take too long.  The Minister must realise how necessary it is to provide proper sanitation in some of these provincial offices.  If he leaves it to the Board of Works, the offices will be condemned by the county medical officer of health. If they were private property and a business man had a staff working there, instead of it being a Government Department, the county medical officer of health and the public board would be sending resolutions denouncing that private individual and ordering him to put in proper sanitation, amenities and accommodation for the staff.  If he waits for the Board of Works, not one of the offices he has visited, where he is anxious to see repairs done, will have those repairs carried out.</P>
    <P>I intended to arrange a scheme for our own architects and engineers and for our own building schemes&mdash;as has been done in the last 30 years in my constituency, in conformity with the regulations of the Board of Works and the Department of Local Government. In that way we would have our own staff and need not wait for the Board of Works, but could carry on from one area to another.  There is no use in building a big office in Dublin while the staff in provincial areas are left in houses and offices that a private individual would not be allowed to use. I am glad that a start is being made on a central sorting office in Dublin.  I know the difficulties there are in trying to secure a site.</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with a complaint in regard to a question here some time ago.  Where a Deputy puts down a question I maintain that where it interests the public he is entitled to <Col N="204" /> get an answer without any equivocation. I raised a question here and the Minister told me it was a private matter.  I thought at the time there were some special arrangements concerned. Then I received word&mdash;which was not marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; nor was there anything private in the document from the Minister.  I raised the point here over priority being given to a subscriber in a very remote place in my constituency while a large number of subscribers in my constituency&mdash;at the time, even a doctor&mdash; had made several applications for transfers of telephones, and were not able to get them.  The Minister gets into the public Press, even the local paper, to try to make a case.  He states that it was during my time that this application was decided on.  During my time I remember the difficulty in the Department that where you had a large number of poles or wires to erect, unless you could prove exceptional circumstances, the Department would refuse.  Anyone can see the answers here in the House where various Deputies made such appeals.</P>
    <P>None of us forget the answers we received when we made representations for the installation of a telephone in certain places.  We were told that the Department would not agree to it.  The Minister states that some official sent out a letter to the effect that the application in question was to be given priority.  I do not know all that happened.  I was not aware that the person applied for a telephone. If my attention were drawn to it I should never have agreed to the use of over 11½ miles of wire, 156 poles and an expenditure of £750 to provide a telephone in one particular place while the rest of the people in the area had not the use of a telephone.  The people in a few houses in the area could not believe what happened.  We did not get down a photographer from the <i>Irish Press</i> to take a photograph in that connection.  Why?  Was it not simply and solely because the public were under the impression that, due to the outbreak of war in Korea, this country might be involved and that we were transferring the President from the Phoenix Park to this isolated place and that that was the <Col N="205" /> reason for all the rushing about and the putting up of poles and telephone wires in that part of County Wicklow? The applicant for the telephone got priority because undue influence was brought to bear on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to tell us the cost and the rent for installing this particular telephone.  He has refused to give us the information. He states that it is not in the public interest to do so.  Then I received a letter which proved that over 11½ miles of wire and 156 poles were used to install that isolated telephone while at the same time people in various constituencies were refused the facility of a telephone.  We are told now that there will be a further restriction on the installation of telephones.  Before the Minister gets into correspondence in the local Press I think he should make a statement on the matter in this <Col N="206" /> House.  The Minister has other men to deal with the correspondence.  An explanation is required as to why other people were unable to get these facilities while one solitary individual was able to get a telephone at an expense of £750 to the taxpayers.  Of course, you had a surplus of engineering materials in the Post Office at the time.  You had a surplus of wire and of poles and, therefore, I suppose, it was no harm to spend more than £750 on one individual.  Portion of that land will now be submerged, under the Electricity Supply Board scheme, and I suppose the people concerned will be looking for compensation in that respect.  There might be some justification for the installation of that particular telephone if the individual concerned had not a fleet of motor cars or had illness or priority.  That was not the case, however.  There was no sickness and no case whatever for priority, and a fleet of cars was available. The granting of that application was a mistake and was unjustifiable, while other more deserving applicants were refused.  By means of a motion in this House, we can get particulars of the official or officials who were responsible, as to the documents which were sent out and as to all the other things which were done.  I shall probably take that step to clear up the matter.  If what the official did is contrary to the policy of the Department and if priority is given only for certain reasons then I think we should have more information on the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with staffing but it is frequently brought to our attention that there is an urgent need to erect new offices or to improve existing offices in various areas.  I am glad to see that progress has been made with the extra staff called up from rural areas: it will be some facility for the people in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never known a departmental committee which did not recommend an increase and which did not look at the matter from the Civil Service point of view.  They will always try to safeguard themselves and will recommend an increase to satisfy the Department of Finance.  If there are further increases in telephone charges either in the rural areas or in the towns I <Col N="207" /> warn the Minister that there will be fewer applicants.  Quite a fair number of people at present will not avail of the telephone service.  Does the Minister think that the reason for the smaller number of applicants for new telephones is the increase in the rental charge?  It is argued, with some justification, that you have to pay for ever the rental for telephone equipment.  A telephone may cost £10 to £20 and the subscriber must pay the rental charge for the equipment for the next 40 or 50 years.  A number of representations have been made to me, as I am sure they have been made to the Minister, that when the equipment is paid for the rental charge should cease and that we should not have a charge such as the Electricity Supply Board has for the meter.  Some years ago the meter cost a few pounds but now the people are being charged a certain amount every six months or every year.</P>
    <P>If we are to be successful in our efforts to develop the telephone system in this country and to get farmers to avail of the service then we must offer greater facilities and some inducement to them to avail of the system.  Any business man will argue: &ldquo;Why should I pay a rental on equipment and hand it down to my children and let it become their liability?&rdquo;  A business man would prefer it to be free after five or ten years, as the case might be. In my opinion, you can develop the telephone system among the farming community only if you offer them some inducement or some facilities.  I know of a number of farms which availed of the system and it proved a great boon. Instead of losing a day coming in to get their wheat, seed or oats, all they would have to do would be to phone up the seed merchant, when delivery would be effected within a few hours.  To my own knowledge, these men often waste a whole day in coming to town and having to queue up outside the merchant's premises.  The Minister should grant these men the facilities I mention.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister painted such a gloomy picture of the state of <Col N="208" /> the Post Office.  He told us of the further deficit that will take place. While the Post Office is a business concern, it is also a State concern and, as such, should be used for national purposes.  It should not be asked to show a surplus each year nor should the people be deprived of the facilities and amenities to which they are entitled from a national point of view. You have many other State services, such as the Army.  In return for the money expended on the Army you get the protection of the country.  They need not show a surplus, but the Post Office, which is supplying services to all the people of the community, is expected to show a surplus.  While we should aim at that, I do not think it should be the primary consideration. What we should consider is not having a small deficit, but whether the people will be deprived of some of the benefits to which they are entitled.  The Post Office is supplying services for all the other Departments.  They do work for the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Social Welfare.  The people should not be expected to pay extra charges simply because some of the staff was employed in other Government Department work.</P>
    <P>If the Minister increases the charges the service will not pay and there may be less work.  At one time there was an appeal made to increase further the charges on the air mail deliveries. The Minister can look that up if he wishes.  The appeal to increase the charges was resisted in the Post Office, with the result that the delivery of air mails is not now a losing proposition. If other Departments' requests had been acceded to, I believe you would have had a higher price, less work, less mails and a bigger deficit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, perhaps, the one Department of State which is closest to the business community by virtue of the service it does for that community, and because it is run somewhat on business lines.  In that connection, I am sorry to see that there will be an increased deficit this year.  I would urge upon the Minister to examine the position very closely before he increases the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> One of the most important services carried out by the Department is the telephone service, and I am glad to see that there has been a continuous increase in the number of subscribers. The more subscribers there are, the better value there is to each person who has installed a telephone.  One of the things we have suffered from in the country in the past is that, when a telephone subscriber went to the expense of getting a telephone, he found so very few other people were on the telephone service that he did not get the benefits which he might have expected.  Now, with the ever increasing number, the benefits of the service are having a sort of snowball effect.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the question of rural telephones is being kept very much to the fore in the Department.  A 24-hour service to telephone subscribers is the ideal which should be aimed at. Anything short of a 24-hour service is only a makeshift.  The Department should set about removing that bar.  I think a 24-hour service is something that every subscriber should expect to get.  To be quite fair to the Minister and the Department I think they fully realise that themselves.</P>
    <P>In connection with the telephone, I am glad to say that I have personally noticed fewer delays in dialling &ldquo;O&rdquo;, &ldquo;31&rdquo; and &ldquo;39&rdquo;.  I have noticed less delay than before.  In my personal capacity I have made a special note of that.  There has been a speeding up in the reply when you dial those particular numbers.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in connection with the telephone service which I have mentioned before.  At the beginning of the telephone book there are a series of instructions for the use of subscribers. Those instructions are very comprehensive.  If one reads them it would well repay the trouble.  The difficulty is that when a number of people are in a hurry to make use of the telephone&mdash;they may want to get on to inquiries or perhaps they may want to send a telegram&mdash;it is not very easy for them to find out what figures or letters should be dialled.  I have raised this matter before and, although there has been an improvement in the lay-out of the instructions, I still do <Col N="210" /> not think they are quite as clear as they should or could be.  I think it is still too easy to spend a long time looking for the particular figures you have to dial.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the Minister mentioned that training facilities were continuing and that refresher courses were taking place from time to time in his Department for telephonists.  I am glad of that.  Does the Minister think that commercial firms would avail themselves of opportunities for training their own switchboard operators if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were prepared to make such opportunities available? I have no idea whether or not this would be feasible, but I would like the Minister to inquire as to whether such a scheme would be availed of by the public.  It seems to me that it would be of great use.</P>
    <P>I notice that local trunk call facilities have been extended and are being continuously extended, which is a very important development.  In rural areas in the past considerable delay has been experienced in getting trunk connections. The speeding up of these facilities would be a means of helping the public to appreciate fully the value of the telephone service.  The Minister mentioned the delays in getting connections to Great Britain. Although the delays are not as long as they were formerly, they still exist.  I wonder could the Minister tell me why it is that phoning Great Britain from Ireland is sometimes a lengthy process while phoning Ireland from Great Britain is usually only a matter of a few minutes?  I have phoned up Ireland from the North of Scotland and got a connection in less than five minutes.  In fact, I could not believe that the call had gone through so quickly.  I have found, and I have heard it from other sources, that it is always quicker to phone Dublin from Great Britain than vice versa.  This is something which the public do not understand and, perhaps, the Minister might like to refer to it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>During the course of the last few years, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs generally has shown a <Col N="211" /> great improvement.  We are all aware that this Department has experienced considerable difficulties with regard to staff and that there were wartime and post-war shortages of materials of various sorts.  Nevertheless, the public feel that, above all others, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a Department which tries to meet their demands.  I am glad to see that the Minister and the Department are endeavouring to brighten the appearance of the post offices.  As Deputy Everett said, some of these offices leave a great deal to be desired in the way of cleanliness and decoration.  It is of great importance that the post offices should be as bright and as cheerful as possible.</P>
    <P>Notices are pinned up in post offices directing the public to the various counters, but I do not think that these notices always set out clearly the position of particular sections.  The particular section to which the public should go to get their children allowances forms stamped is not always clearly shown in the post offices.  The counters dealing with various matters should be clearly indicated.  In some offices they undoubtedly are, but not in all of them.  A commercial concern, in its own interests, informs the public of the departments in which various items can be purchased, and the post offices should adopt the same method.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to Aer Lingus for the regularity of its postal services, especially during last winter, which was one of the worst flying winters with which pilots have had to contend.  All during this period, the mails arrived safely, punctually and expeditiously.  This entailed a great deal of work for which Aer Lingus should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>There are not as many postal collections as formerly in the City of Dublin area.  Sometimes that has an undesirable effect as regards commercial undertakings.  Members of this House do not like to see the commercial community in any way handicapped by a lack of postal services.  The difficulty, I suppose, is that the more services provided the greater the expense and the greater the deficit.  However, I <Col N="212" /> would urge on the Minister and his Department to bear in mind the responsibility that rests on them to provide sufficient postal services in the interests of the commercial community.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the efficiency experts which he had in his Department and to the organisation and methods schemes which they carried out.  We are all glad of that. In my view, the improvements which have been brought about in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the last two years have been due to these various schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his introduction that Thomas Moore Commemoration stamps were about to be issued in August and September. Many philatelists are very curious as to the denominations in which they will be issued, so perhaps the Minister, in his reply, would tell us whether they will be 2½d., 1d., or what?</P>
    <P>We can be glad that the Post Office is continuing to do its work in a good fashion.  There are difficulties but, nevertheless, in the main the work of this Department is carried out well. We regret on this side of the House that the Department is continuing to run at a deficit but we appreciate that in a country such as ours, where we have thinly-scattered communities, it is very difficult to make this Department pay in the way it does in thickly-populated countries and where there are not the long distances over which to deliver mails.  In conclusion, I would say that we hope the Minister will continue to increase the efficiency of his Department and will continue at the same time to reduce the deficit that falls to the revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene only very briefly to impress upon the Minister in connection with a few matters which I think are of great importance as far as they relate to the general scheme of things in his Department. We are well aware that the Minister took over a Department that lagged behind very much in so far as facilities are concerned in comparison with that same Department in other countries, and I believe he is making <Col N="213" /> an earnest effort to bring it up to the required standard.  In some areas reorganisation is taking place and better facilities are being given by way of everyday delivery in rural areas and backward areas.  This in many instances has resulted in throwing up other problems of almost as great a magnitude as those which he set out to solve.</P>
      <P>I particularly refer to the redundancy caused in rural part-time postmen in the Donegal areas.  It is a pity that when an effort is made to economise in the Department the officials, in trying to see where economies can be effected, never seem to think that any economies could be effected within the Department in relation to indoor staff. They always manage to take a few hours from a rural postman and consequently reduce his weekly allowance that is already far too small.  This has happened in a number of cases in Donegal, and I would impress upon the Minister the necessity to amend that situation wherever it exists and to try to find alternative employment for those postmen who are rendered redundant as a result of the reorganisation of the area.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the case of a man working 13 years in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for a wage of £3 7s. 6d. per week.  As a result of the rearrangement of his area he finds he has to support himself, his wife and seven children on a reduced wage of £2 14s.  That is not in accordance with any Christian principles whatever economy it may effect in any Department. I wonder whether the officials in the Department who seek to effect economy in that way, would examine the situation within the Department and thus find greater opportunity for greater economy in their staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of these cases is definitely few, but the fact that they are there is all the more reason why a serious effort should be made to put those people back on the same basis on which they were working or to find alternative employment for them. There is no justification at this stage for reducing the weekly wage of any part-time postman, a weekly wage which was already very inadequate to <Col N="214" /> meet rising costs and to maintain a family as most of those men must.</P>
    <P>In my opinion there is no such thing as a part-time postman.  A man who starts at 9 o'clock in the morning and finishes at 4 in the afternoon or sometimes about 6 is very often regarded as a part-time postman because he has a break during the day and the number of hours do not conform with that required before he can be regarded as full-time.  The fact remains that he is not in a position to take up employment in any other capacity to supplement his income in any way.  He has scarcely time to work the plot attached to his labourer's cottage when he returns in the evening after the long route either on foot or on bicycle.  I would urge upon the Minister to examine personally these cases with a view to having the persons concerned put back in the position in which they were before or to find alternative employment for them.  The number of these cases would be few and, as I pointed out, they were brought about by reorganisation, much of which was for the betterment of the general service in the area as a whole.  I should also, in fairness to the Department, point out that, in some cases, reorganisation has resulted in improvement in the wages of certain rural postmen as a result of hours being added to the number of hours worked weekly.</P>
    <P>In connection with telephones, we have a right to hope for increased services in regard to rural post offices during the year ahead.  One of the previous speakers mentioned the advantage a telephone can be to the farming community.  I think many areas would be quite content if they were sure that the rural sub-post offices in their immediate district would be provided with public telephone facilities in order to give them that more immediate contact with the outside world.  Most farmers do not expect telephones installed in their house, and I am sure there are very few such applicants on the waiting-list at the moment.  However, there are a great many rural areas where the sub-post office has no telephone facilities and the entire <Col N="215" /> district is at a great disadvantage on that account.  I would ask the Minister to speed up as much as possible the installation of telephones in sub-post offices in rural areas where they are not already installed.</P>
    <P>In the matter of priority it is difficult sometimes to understand why people are required to wait so long. The type of applicant I find most inconvenienced is that type of person who runs a guest-house but which is not registered as a guest-house.  I understand there is a certain priority for hoteliers and proprietors of guesthouses in the matter of the installation of telephone facilities, but there are a great many people who give very good service in this way although their premises are not registered as such. These people are entitled to be recognised and the necessary priority given to them because they are giving just as good a service to the nation as is given by the proprietors of those houses which may be registered with the Tourist Board.  I appeal to the Minister to give particular attention to these matters.  As I said at the outset, we all appreciate the fact that he took over a Department which was lagging behind in relation to the provision of those modern facilities that may be expected from any Department of Posts and Telegraphs to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear Deputy J. Brennan put forward the sensible and reasonable suggestion that when reorganisation of the rural delivery services is taking place it should not take place at the expense of rural postmen who have given long service and worked for a rate of wages, if one can call it a rate of wages, which was less than the agricultural rate prevailing in the district.  I hope the Minister will take serious note of that sensible and reasonable suggestion.  It affects other areas outside of that represented by Deputy J. Brennan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always encouraged every Minister in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to use his powers and influence with his colleagues in the Cabinet in an endeavour to extend the daily delivery system to every section <Col N="216" /> of the community irrespective of the areas in which the people live.  I am referring now to the rural areas.  Inside the past five years there has been a considerable extension of the daily delivery system in my constituency, but I am now encouraging the present Minister to use the influence I know he has with the Minister for Finance and his Department to obtain the necessary money for the purpose of further extending that system.  Every section of the community is entitled to the same service from a public utility department like the Post Office.  I do not know how any Deputy can claim a daily and better delivery system for the cities and towns when he knows that facilities of that kind are sadly lacking in many of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The most significant point in this Estimate is the huge reduction in the sub-heads providing for stores.  There is a reduction of £53,110 for stores. For uniform clothing, as compared with the previous year, there is a reduction of £126,300.  For engineering materials, as compared with the previous year, the aggregate reduction is £246,750, practically a quarter of a million.  Is it not a wonder the Minister did not pay a tribute in his well prepared speech to his predecessor and to the members of the inter-Party Government for having built up stocks to such an extent that he can now justify, or attempt to justify, huge reductions of this type?  Whether or not that stockpiling was done by the inter-Party Government and the Minister's predecessor does not affect my argument. These huge reductions in the sub-heads to which I have referred will have very serious consequences on employment. We are repeatedly told about the recession in trade and the effect that recession is having upon employment, unemployment and the circulation of money.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us any estimate of the loss of employment that must follow as a natural consequence as a result of the reduction in the Estimate under the sub-head covering uniform clothing?  There are huge quantities of surplus material lying in the premises of the clothing manufacturers. Yet, this year we have a <Col N="217" /> reduction in the supply of uniform clothing.  The clothing trade generally is suffering to a greater extent from unemployment and part-time working than any other section of industry outside of the boot and shoe industry. On what grounds then does the Minister justify the large reduction under the head of uniform clothing?  Apart altogether from that, I suggest that it is desirable to maintain a reserve supply at a fixed minimum figure in connection with uniform clothing and engineering materials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On what grounds then can the Minister justify these huge reductions?  Is it on the ground that the Minister for Finance has drummed it into his head that the country is supposed to be on the verge of bankruptcy? Is it the type of economy that old Deputies like myself understand so well, namely the pressure that is brought to bear upon a weak Minister &mdash;if there is one&mdash;by the Minister and the Department of Finance?  I am not suggesting that the present Minister is a weak Minister.  I am satisfied he is an efficient administrator.  Is he, however, submitting to the pressure of his friend and colleague, the master Minister for Finance, in effecting these reductions which will create unemployment in the industries that supply uniform clothing, engineering materials and other stores to the Post Office? There is bound to be a reduction in employment in so far as the suppliers of these commodities are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it a fact that the Minister and his advisers are in favour of the abolition of horse-drawn transport in the Post Office, particularly in Dublin city?  I am one of those who disagree completely with the mechanisation of everything.  I foresee the day&mdash;I hope I am wrong-when we will have mechanised transport in the Post Office, mechanised agriculture and mechanised Ministers and we will all be left standing to attention if and when another world war breaks because such a war will affect an island country like this to a greater extent than it <Col N="218" /> will affect many other countries.  As the son of a small farmer I have never lost the outlook of the countryside where I was born and reared. I regard the horse in agriculture, the horse used in Post Office transport or the horse anywhere else as something that provides useful employment for the harness maker and a market for the oats grown by the farmer.  We are making a serious mistake in abolishing horse-drawn transport.  Nobody was more delighted than I was to be present at the inauguration of our worthy President last week but I was both sick and sorry at the sight of the mechanised escort provided for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If that is so, I object and strongly protest against such a proposal and against every proposal that will encourage the use of imported motor cars, imported petrol, rather than horses.  Horse transport brings in its train useful employment to many sections of citizens. I will stop at that and let my old friend Deputy Kennedy defend the mechanisation of transport in the case of the Post Office and in the case of the escort for our worthy President when he goes on tour around the city or country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before I got my breakfast I had to go out and feed horses and cattle.  That is a thing the Deputy never did and perhaps is not fit to do.  I have made representations on many occasions for the extension of the telephone service.  I have no serious complaint to make in the matter.  It is a question of organisation, I suppose.  But I cannot understand why an application for the installation of a telephone in the City of Dublin area cannot be met inside a period of 12 months or six months or, at any rate, a much shorter period than must elapse in the case of rural areas. In the case of an application in my constituency I can understand that, when the engineering staff have provided all the telephones that have been applied for in a particular area, any application that comes in after that could not be dealt with immediately. It is not feasible to go back immediately to the area to deal with <Col N="220" /> one application.  In a well-organised, concentrated area, such as the City of Dublin, where there are mobile gangs, it should be possible to provide telephones within a couple of months of application.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation of that matter. In the case of people who apply for new telephones, especially if they are on the priority list, an attempt should be made by the engineering department to meet such applications in a concentrated area like Dublin in a much shorter period than has been the case recently.  I am speaking from knowledge and experience gained as a result of making representations to the Minister's Department in this matter.</P>
      <P>Could I encourage the Minister also to provide better telephone facilities after normal working hours through the sub-offices in rural areas?  What is the objection to using the sub-offices after, say, 10 o'clock at night?  Is it based on finance?  These men and women who operate the sub-offices in rural areas are not too highly paid. Some of them get miserable allowances. The sub-offices in rural areas should be used as far as is reasonably possible to provide whatever facilities may be required in cases of urgency. I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to go as far as he possibly can in the extension of daily deliveries and in that case as well as in an extension of the telephone service to do whatever he can to provide for all sections of citizens the services that are provided in centres of large populations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the use of mechanised transport for rural deliveries and the danger of unemployment as a result, I do not think that it is the wish or the objective of the Department to create any such effect. I have discussed the matter with a number of postmasters in connection with the improvement of deliveries and they have assured me that mechanisation will not result in unemployment or dislocation of employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that I do resent. I object to postmasters splitting hairs <Col N="221" /> in estimating the time it takes a postman to do his daily delivery.  Such tactics, for the purpose of saving a very small sum, should not be encouraged.  When the postmaster does the route normally taken by a postman he may find that the delivery takes half an hour less than the postman normally takes and the postman's pay is cut accordingly.  That is not a very high standard to adopt.  Postmen are not highly paid and many of them have no sideline from which to augment their income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin was quite right when he referred to the abolition of horse-drawn transport in Dublin.  We all regret the disappearance from the streets of the picturesque equine outfit of the Post Office.  I am afraid we must bow to the march of time in this regard as in other matters.  The time will come when even the subject of cruelty to horses will cease to be raised at Question Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have no Minister for Agriculture then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a Minister who did not encourage the use of the horse in agriculture.  He was very vociferous on that subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett described the Minister's statement as a gloomy one.  I cannot see that the description is correct.  I do not think there was anything gloomy about it.  In fact I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the fact that the Minister did foresee the time when he hoped that the deficit would be rectified.  It is only what one would expect from a person with the business aptitude of the Minister.  I have no doubt that he will be able and that he has been applying his business ability to making the Post Office a paying proposition.  We have enough deficits in Government Departments without having the Post Office winding up each year with a deficit.  If the Minister can see his way to make it a business proposition and a paying one, let him go ahead.  I do not believe any Deputy will say &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to him.  He should get every support in making it a business proposition and a paying one at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> If it becomes a paying one, I feel that it will be no less efficient in the service it gives because of that.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear from the Minister the details of the cost of the installation of telephones generally.  I was quite unaware of the magnitude of the expenditure in that regard.  It has made me, and I am sure it will make everybody else, a lot more appreciative of the service and also appreciative of the Minister's difficulties in satisfying everybody in regard to the installation of telephones.  I was also pleasantly surprised, although I was aware that an improvement had been effected, that 171 telephones had been installed in sub-post offices.  It is most pleasant to think that a step in this direction has been taken and shows signs of being pursued, as the Minister stated that there were 500 outstanding and that he hoped to install them within the next two years.  It is certainly an encouragement to people in the rural areas to look forward to the end of their isolation even in the space of two years. Despite the magnitude of the cost.  I have no doubt that this social service. as I regard it, will make a fruitful return in time and enable the Post Office to stand on its own legs.</P>
    <P>Regarding kiosks in sub-post offices. I do not think the Minister need worry about them at all.  People are quite satisfied to have a telephone anywhere in a post office until such time as it becomes possible to have kiosks erected without any great expenditure. They are expensive to erect.  But conversations in country places are not that dreadfully secret.  Perhaps the most that one might divulge is what one fancies for such a race on such a date.</P>
    <P>As to kiosks in rural areas, we are rather behind the times in this regard as compared even with our Six County neighbours.  We find them scattered here and there throughout the countryside. They are a great help and provide encouragement and safety for the people, as well of course as the telephones in the sub-post offices.  It is a great thing that the people should have a feeling of security that in times of need they are at least within striking distance of doctors or clergymen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> I am all out for farmers getting the benefit of the telephone service.  I know that a number have applied for telephones and that the Minister has been most sympathetic in regard to it, particularly where the farmer is giving employment to a number of people over and above those whom he employs on the farm by carrying on a side line.  If he can show evidence in that regard, I know that his application is most sympathetically considered.  As against that, I think it was Deputy Davin stated that the farmer is quite happy if he feels that the telephone is within striking distance until such time as the Department finds itself in a position to give telephones to those who want them.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention in connection with the kiosks. Deputy Dockrell referred to the notice which is in the kiosks.  The notice says that local calls are limited to five minutes but it does not say how long is given for non-local calls.  It says that pips will start at four and a half minutes after the local call commences and that you will be cut off at the end of five minutes.  But there are no warning pips for a long distance call. There is no provision made to indicate to the person telephoning as to how long his call will last.  I understand that generally it is three minutes, but there is no notice to that effect.  Not alone that, but when the three minutes are up you appear to get summarily disconnected and, as has happened to myself on many occasions and to others desirous of renewing a call, you are given no opportunity of having the extra money ready.  If the Minister could make some arrangement in regard to this matter it would be a very good thing to have notice of that in case a person might desire to renew a call so that he should have the exact money ready.  It is most unpleasant to have to go out to look for change and then come back and get reconnected again.  I think that could be simplified.</P>
    <P>I should also like to contribute my meed of praise to the Minister for the manner in which he has speeded up trunk calls.  It is most pleasant now when one wants to get a trunk call to <Col N="224" /> find on inquiring how long it will take that you are asked just to hold on or, if that is impossible, you are agreeably surprised to find that it will only take a very short time, that you will not have to go away and come back to the kiosk.  That has been a very great improvement generally.  As one who has had occasion once or twice to complain of delay in this matter, I should like to pay tribute to the courtesy and co-operative attitude of the operators generally and those in my own town who bear so patiently with my impatience.  I should also like to pay a tribute to the Minister's desire to make this service, not alone an attractive one, but a profitable one.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that during the period of office of the last Minister and of this Minister as well the telephone service has been expanding, but I feel that it is not expanding rapidly enough.  The details of the Estimate and the Minister's statement go to show that the telephone service is the only one of these services which is showing a profit.  In many parts of the country, and particularly in my own district, innumerable people are looking for telephones. That they are not able to receive service is not, I realise, the fault of the Minister or anybody else.  It is probably due to lack of sufficient staff for the installing of telephones and I think it would be a very good thing if more money were expended on procuring staff, if such staff are procurable, for this purpose and if we went ahead as quickly as possible with the installing of public telephones in every village in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Particulars are available only for the total employment by firms which make wool jersey (knitted) fabrics, but these firms usually make other goods and it is not possible to distinguish separately the number of workers who are engaged in the manufacture of knitted fabrics.  The number of persons employed by firms engaged in the manufacture of wool jersey (knitted) fabric was 2,053 at mid-December, 1951 and 2,004 at mid-March, 1952.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the Deputy's question, there are clothing factories other than hosiery factories which purchase but do not manufacture wool knitted fabrics, but the employment on the making-up of the fabrics by such factories is only a small fraction of their total employment.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any conception of the injustice being imposed on the section of the community I refer to, these small shopkeepers, by this action?  Has he any conception of the difficulties which confront many small traders, due principally to limited storage accommodation? The containers in any of the small shops I know are from ten to 30 gallons capacity and in order to comply with these regulations, the shopkeepers would have to buy containers of around 70 gallons capacity.  In the first place, they have not got room for such containers and, in the second place, many of these people have only limited funds <Col N="226" /> and it is not possible for them to buy kerosene in substantial quantities.  If they are to be cut off now it means that they will lose custom in other directions, because if a person goes into a small trader for a gallon of oil and finds that he cannot supply it, he will go to some other shop for it and buy whatever other commodities he wants there as well.  This is going to apply to other commodities in the future and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the case of sugar, the quantity to-morrow may be fixed at two cwt. or in the case of tea, at a minimum of so many lb.  All that is going to cut out the small trader and I believe it is the bounden duty of the Minister to take particular cognisance of the situation and to take steps to see that these people will not get away with what I term the outrageous moves they are making.</P>

I cannot see any reason why the telephone should be shut off at 8 o'clock in the evening, nor do I think the Department are giving service to the public by giving a telephone service from 8 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the evening, and for a couple of hours on Sunday morning In other countries, one does not find these extraordinary <Col N="231" /> telephone facilities, and I, as a medical man, know perfectly well the difficulties that arise through the shutting off of the telephone at 8 o'clock.  It is safe to say that practically all emergencies in respect of medical and veterinary work arise at night and I have had firsthand knowledge of that situation myself.  Being in a particular district and perhaps trying to contact a hospital in Dublin in order to get a patient away urgently.  I find the time coming to 8 o'clock.  There is perhaps an hour's delay in getting the call through, and, by the time I have a chance of getting on, the telephone exchange is cut off. It means that I have had to pack up and go to the nearest town to get my call.</P>
      <P>I must say that there has been a very great improvement in the extent of telephone facilities.  Some few years back quite a few of our bigger towns, towns with a population ranging up to 5,000, had limited telephone facilities.  Ten years ago some closed at 8 o'clock, some were subsequently extended to 10 o'clock, some are closed at midnight now.  I cannot see any sense in that.</P>
      <P>I can see that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is not a very profitable concern, but I think it is fair to admit&mdash;and the Minister agreed in his statement&mdash;that it carries out a function which is very necessary to the nation and one that it is very necessary to carry out whether it loses money or not.  Surely this is a vital thing and surely telephone services should be extended everywhere.  I can see no reason why in rural districts people could not be switched to a main exchange.  After all, Garda barracks in the country have a round-the-clock service.  It is not a very good one but they can always get through.  It is worked on the system of so many rings for one station and so many rings for another.  If you can connect the Guards' barracks to a big centre why not the other telephones as well?  If you give people telephones&mdash;and they pay enough for them&mdash;why not give them a decent service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that there is a new system for choosing permanent <Col N="232" /> postmen which was instituted, I think, by the Minister's predecessor whereby they are taken in in their youth and must pass an examination. That is probably a very good system but there is an old saying that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs and that system has caused a good deal of hardship throughout the country.  I know several cases of people who, during the emergency when these posts were not filled, served as postmen in a temporary capacity but who served as fulltime postmen and worked all day for 12 or 14 years.  They now suddenly find themselves faced with the situation where they are losing their employment.  They have been State servants over that period and are entitled to consideration from the State. I admit that during the period I have been in Dáil Éireann the present Minister has met the case, so far as possible, by giving those people temporary employment.  The working man is dependent on the revenue he can get each week which he hands over to his wife.  That is a thing which we in this House should remember.  In dealing with postmen we are dealing with the working class.  A man who has been employed for 12 or 14 years as a postman and had a weekly payroll suddenly finds himself superseded by one of these youthful people who have been appointed and he is put out of permanent employment.  He is given any temporary employment there is but it means a state of uncertainty. Many of them are middle-aged men who are at an expensive time of life with a young family growing up and they should be given favourable consideration for any jobs which are going anywhere.  I know that they are given temporary employment but that is only a few months in the year.  I would ask the Minister to consider a sliding scale.  At present, men who have been employed for years are told: &ldquo;Get out; there is no more employment for you.&rdquo;  Surely the thing could be done gradually and there would be less hardship then.</P>
    <P>We do not get complaints about the delivery of telegrams as often now as in the past because there are more <Col N="233" /> telephone exchanges and post offices, so that telegrams can be phoned through and delivered more rapidly. There are still complaints, however, in rural districts.  A case came to my notice recently, not in my own constituency. I was shown the letter.  It was the case of someone who had cattle on land belonging, I think, to the Board of Works.  There was some sort of caretaker there who was to notify this man if anything went wrong with the cattle. He sent a telegram about a sick beast, but it was not delivered until the next day, and when the owner went there the beast was dead.  Representations were made to the Department concerned, but there was no redress.  That would indicate that there is still delay in the delivery of telegrams.  It is only fair, however, to state that is not confined to this country alone.  One often sees in the Press how tragedies here and there were not notified in time.  That was noticeable in the case of a British submarine which was lost in pre-war days, the <i>Thetis.</i>  The telegram was not delivered and the Admiralty was not communicated with until the following day.</P>
    <P>Let us be fair and say that trunk facilities have improved a good deal. Up to recently in Gorey, North Wexford, where I live, trunk facilities hardly bore mention.  If you wanted to get on to Dublin you had to go to Enniscorthy or Wexford, and as soon as you got Dublin you were shut off again.  I think we have now got one direct and one superimposed line.  We claim to be a fairly important centre with a tourist traffic, visitors and one thing and another, so I would ask the Minister to consider giving us better trunk facilities.</P>
    <P>I would like to agree with Deputy Dr. Maguire regarding trunk calls.  He has probably had the same experience as I have had myself.  I feel that three minutes is a very niggardly time for a trunk call.  It is very hard to get Dublin people to appreciate the difficulties of the country.  In Dublin if you ring a person there is no hurry, and you can spend half an hour on the phone without paying anything extra. A person living in the country goes to the telephone book to put through <Col N="234" /> a call; he must get his money ready and put it into the box; then he gets on to Dublin but it takes two minutes before he can get the particular person, say, in an office whom he is ringing; by the time they exchange pleasantries he is cut off again unless he puts through another call.  Rural areas should be given facilities to talk for at least five mnutes.  I do not know if this would cost the State a lot of money.  I do not see why it should, and certainly it would facilitate things greatly.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is a decrease in the Estimate of £246,750 on engineering materials.  I think it is fair to claim that there has been a tremendous amount of talk in this House about finance, stockpiling and waste of money, but the fact that you have a decrease in respect of materials like that sanctifies the policy of the Minister's predecessor.  The last Government were accused of not stockpiling, but that shows that it is untrue.  They did stockpile, and here is the proof in this Estimate.  They stockpiled these non-perishable materials which are there for the benefit and service of the Party in power at the present moment. Not merely in this Estimate but in every Estimate which comes up that is proved.</P>
    <P>There is just one other item to which I should like to refer&mdash;telephone capital repayments&mdash;which shows an increase of £130,834.  In this matter we get on to another subject in regard to which there has been a good deal of controversy in this House.  Surely that goes to prove the justification of capital expenditure.  The same principle applies whether you are using capital for the extension of the telephone system or any other development.  The fact that these capital repayments are provided for in this Estimate shows that this method of financing expenditure is justified.  If it is justified to treat expenditure for the purpose of providing telephones as capital expenditure, you are justified in regarding as capital expenditure, any sum expended for the benefit of the Irish people which, after all, is the interest that every member of the Dáil should have.</P>
    <Col N="235" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his very comprehensive and complete statement in introducing this Estimate.  He laid before the House an outline of many interesting features of the work of his Department. I think he must have convinced the House that he, at least, is very much alive to the need for extension, development and improvement in every sphere of the activities of his Department. There were some small matters, or what might appear to be small matters, in connection with his statement in which I took a particular interest. I was glad to hear the Minister state that he is considering the question of introducing improvements in postmen's uniforms.  I should like very much to see rural postmen&mdash;perhaps my remarks would apply to urban postmen also&mdash;who have to travel considerable distances and carry a fairly heavy load of mail, provided with a light suitable uniform in summer-time.  That I think is essential and I do not see any reason why such uniforms should not be provided.</P>
      <P>In the same manner, it will be recognised that there are a number of postmen&mdash;the Minister may have the facts and the figures more clearly in mind than I have&mdash;who have to travel up to 20 miles delivering letters.  That is a fairly considerable ordeal which entails a substantial physical effort.  I do not know what is the maximum weight he has to carry but it is fairly considerable.  You can imagine his having to travel, say, 20 miles on a wet day, when he has to wear a waterproof cape or overcoat.  I would say without exaggeration that he is doing a horse's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I have often wondered whether any investigation has been carried out into the possibility of providing postmen who have long distances to cover with a motor-cycle or a motorised bicycle.  I think such vehicles would be helpful, particularly on the longer routes.  I am not suggesting that any very heavy additional expenditure should be incurred but I think that where there is a case for it, it is desirable.  On the whole it is desirable, from the viewpoint that it might be good policy to extend the <Col N="236" /> mileage of the routes of postmen so as to ensure that each man would be able to earn a good week's wages.  We often hear complaints in this House about the very low earnings of some postmen. In most cases where postmen are earning very low wages, they work a rather short day.  By extending the mileage route of each postman&mdash;it could be done gradually as men retire &mdash;it would be possible to bring up the average weekly wages of each postman to a reasonable level.  It is all right to say that if a man has a short day, he is entitled only to a low wage but it must be remembered that in most cases where a man is not employed for the whole day he will find it very hard to supplement his earnings during the few hours that are left him.  That, I think, is a very important consideration.  It is particularly desirable where the State is employing men that it should set a good headline in the matter of wages and conditions of employment. I know that the Minister is sympathetic in this respect but it means, I suppose, a considerable amount of reorganisation. It is not a thing that can be carried out immediately or hastily but it is a desirable development towards which the Minister should direct his attention.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the desirability of establishing an all-night telephone service.  I am in complete agreement with that, particularly in supplying a service for urgent calls.  I think that such a service should be provided in every area. There should be at least some means by which every citizen in the country, no matter in what area he has to reside, can get in touch with such medical or veterinary aid as he may require in an emergency.  I feel that in this connection there is room for complaint in regard to the manner in which some sub-postmasters are paid for nightly service.  I believe that their remuneration has been very low.  This may not be true in regard to a very large number of sub-post offices but in so far as it is true it should be rectified.  I know that the installation of automatic telephones will eventually remedy this position but, pending the installation of such telephones, I think that any <Col N="237" /> person employed on a night service of this kind should be adequately remunerated. It is not enough to say that the person may be called very infrequently during the night.  The very fact that he has to be on duty all through the night is sufficient to warrant proper payment.  Even if it were necessary to increase the charge for night calls in order to meet the increased cost of remunerating these postmasters, I think that should be done.</P>
    <P>Farmers, it has been said, are rather reluctant to install telephones.  I can see a fairly good reason for that reluctance. The installation of a telephone costs a certain amount of money and the service costs money.  The farmer is a person who has been over a long period of years accustomed to a small and precarious income.  He is not anxious to take on his shoulders additional liabilities or to add very considerably to his outlay.  In a great number of areas farmers are taking, and rightly so, the additional liability of paying for rural electrification&mdash;an amenity that is very desirable.</P>
    <P>They find that such an amenity is very desirable.  If the choice for a farmer is as between rural electrification and the telephone, I think he will decide in favour of the former.  I think that the movement towards the extension of the telephone is steadily growing. It is particularly desirable for farmers who go in for a specialised line of farming, for those who go in extensively for poultry keeping and vegetable growing, and want to put their produce on the market speedily. It also has its advantage in regard to veterinary services.  The value of the telephone will, I believe, be further increased by the introduction of the A.I.C. system in regard to cattle.  I believe that the introduction of that system will eventually become widespread, and that it will be almost essential for a farmer with a dairy herd to have a telephone.</P>
    <P>The Minister has even gone so far as to seek to provide an alarm clock service, so that we will be able to get out of our beds a little bit earlier in the mornings.  It is rather a pity that we had not that service available a few <Col N="238" /> weeks ago when we had a division in the House at a rather early hour in the morning.  Possibly, the next time we have a similar occurrence this new service can be more widely availed of. In that connection, I would like to say that, in the case of the semi-luxury services, they should, I think, be at least self-supporting.  I do not think that the general taxpayer should be penalised in order to get his neighbours up out of bed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the principle that the Post Office and telephone services should, as far as possible, be self-supporting.  The Post Office is, if you like, a business concern, and is one of the Departments of State in which an effort should be made to run it on business lines.  I think it is only right that it should pay for itself.  I am not suggesting that it should yield a profit, but that, as far as possible, it should at all times be self-supporting.  That does not mean that every section of the service should be self-supporting. There are certain services which are essential to the community which ought to be provided for all districts and all parts of the country, but which might not be able to pay completely for themselves.  While I would say that the postal service&mdash;the delivery of letter&mdash;should be self-supporting, I am not suggesting that that should apply to every area and district.  I am of the opinion that every citizen has the right to expect a daily delivery of letters except, perhaps, people living in very out-of-the-way places altogether. The revenue derived from the sale of stamps and other sections of the service should, I think, be sufficient to cover the cost of the whole service.  It might be necessary, perhaps, for the more thickly populated areas to subsidise, to some extent, the provision of a service to the more remote districts, but not to the same extent so far as the telephone service was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I was rather amazed at the performance of the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Deputy Everett gave the impression, <Col N="239" /> long before this Estimate was introduced, that he was going, as it were, to blitz the present Minister and his Department.  Yesterday, there was a preliminary skirmish when it was announced that the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs was going to be taken.  It looked, from the protest made yesterday by Deputy Everett's present leader, as if he, apparently, was afraid that Deputy Everett might not be in a position to take the field to-day.  Anyhow, Deputy Everett took the field to-day.</P>

      <P>If it is, I apologise. Anyhow, Deputy Everett took the field to-day and never, I think, in the history of this House did such an enormous amount of effort produce such a ridiculously small mouse.  His entire attack on the Minister boiled itself down to his criticism of the installation of one telephone in the County Wicklow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a most extraordinary performance.  At any rate he condemned the Minister for installing that telephone.  The distance from the exchange is five and a half miles.  He forgot or completely overlooked the fact that the application for the installation of the telephone was made in 1948.  The applicant was informed in 1950 that the telephone would be installed within six months.  Deputy Everett was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in December, 1950, when the promise to install the telephone within six months was made to the applicant.  I believe that the installation of the telephone was completely justified, and I would be very much annoyed if it was not justified because the responsibility of the installation rests on the shoulders of Deputy Everett.  While I would be deeply grieved if Deputy Everett had to carry on his shoulders for all eternity these 170 poles and the 11½ miles of wire, I believe that the installation of the telephone was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application was made in 1948 <Col N="240" /> and it was granted in 1950.  It was one of the last of the applications made in 1948 to be granted, thereby showing that there was no priority given and no favouritism of any kind.  While Deputy Everett, in the debate to-day and in the course of his speeches in his constituency, has frequently attacked the Minister in regard to that installation, it is true to say that the person to whom the telephone has been supplied will have to pay £17 10s. per year as a rental for the installation. That is a very considerable amount of money.  It is, I think, desirable that people living in remote areas, if they can afford to pay £17 10s. a year for a telephone service, should be supplied with it, because they, by accepting the telephone service and by paying the rent five years in advance, enable the Department to bring the telephone service into a district where it has not existed hitherto.</P>
    <P>In a remote rural district, once a line is installed the telephone poles are of benefit not only to the applicant but to others who may desire a service in the future.  The whole case that Deputy Everett made for referring this Estimate back falls flat to the ground in view of the fact that it was he himself who gave consent.</P>

He was ill-advised to have raised this matter at all.  There is no injustice to anyone, and the suggestion that the applications of doctors were held back while this particular application was being granted is ridiculous. So far as I know, there was only one application for a telephone by a doctor in County Wicklow during 1951 and that application was made after the telephone had been installed in Roundwood, so that doctor could not claim his application was delayed in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I hear a little red hen cackling on the other side of the House, but I cannot catch the nature of the cackling.  This House ought to be fairly well satisfied with the account of his stewardship that has been given by the Minister here to-day. There is every indication of progress, and I hope it will continue.  I know that farmers are not too enthusiastic about the telephone, but I will be one of those who will advise them to install it, just as I advised them to take advantage of rural electrification and other modern amenities.  All these things impose some additional cost, but they raise the standard of living and the standard of efficiency in rural life.</P>
      <P>There is no reason any longer why those who live five and a half miles from a telephone exchange should have a lower standard of living or be less in touch with modern life than those who live in towns and cities.  We talk about the flight from the land but in the postal service the Minister is endeavouring to improve the rural areas and bring them up to the standard of the cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I would like to plead for better conditions for the postmen who have to travel mountain roads or carry heavy loads in the delivery of their letters. As far as possible, a daily service should be provided in every area. Again, I would appeal on behalf of those who have to carry on a night telephone service, even temporarily, that they should be adequately rewarded. Those who avail of the telephone at night or occasionally require it at night would be quite satisfied to pay an increased charge so as to ensure that those who operate the service would be properly rewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is interested in brightening up the post offices.  That is something which is overdue.  There is no reason why the larger, State-owned offices should not be made as clean and as bright as the banks.  They do not handle as much money and may not have such resources, but they could be made to look well and that would reflect credit on <Col N="242" /> the country and on the Department. The cost would not be great and would be nothing in proportion to the good achieved.  In the case of the smaller offices owned by sub-postmasters, it might be no harm to offer some prize or reward for the best, the brightest, the most attractively kept post office in each grade or type.  I do not mean that rural offices should have to compete with those in larger villages or towns.  Within each grade there could be some prize or special inducement to the proprietors to improve and beautify their premises.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is going ahead with the reorganisation of his staff to ensure the maximum economy and efficiency.  That is desirable in every Department and particularly in one which employs such a very large staff.  In the postal service a large number of people are employed and we would all like to see them get decent salaries and wages and good conditions of employment.  It is absolutely essential that there should be no redundancy, overlapping, waste or inefficiency.  I am sure that all members of the postal staff will cooperate with the Minister in achieving that good result.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask how contracts for the supply of materials are placed.  I am admitting ignorance in this matter. I would like to know how contractors are selected or goods are purchased and if that includes telephones and all other material for the Minister's Department.  Very large sums of money are involved, as the Book of Estimates shows, and we would all like to be sure that the money is spent to the best advantage, that there is the utmost care, economy and fair play in the selection of those appointed as contractors for the supply of goods to the Post Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to assure the Minister that the people of Cork appreciate very much the new post office which he opened recently, and also the automatic telephone exchange opened by his predecessor. Most Deputies are aware that the contracts were placed in 1947. While we give the Minister and his predecessor every credit for pushing <Col N="243" /> through the schemes we must not forget that the contracts for them were placed during Deputy Little's period of office.</P>
      <P>The people of Cork are now very pleased about the post office and the automatic telephone exchange.  However, I think something must be done to speed up the installation of new telephones.  I heard some Deputy say to-day that fewer applications are now made for telephones.  I believe that one of the causes is that people think it is not worth their while applying for a telephone because they will have to wait for a couple of years for it.  It is absolutely necessary for a speeding-up of the installation of telephones.  It is a drawback to people with telephones that other people have not them because if they had them they could contact each other very often and thus save themselves a lot of running about.</P>
      <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for kiosks in certain places around Cork. In my opinion we have plenty of them in the centre of the city.  I think we have more than we really require in certain parts of the city, while in other parts of the city, out in the suburbs, we have no telephone for miles.  For instance, we have no telephone kiosk between the South Mall and Blackrock. That is a thickly populated district.  In addition, a lot of dockers work on the south jetties where there is no public telephone, and if one of the dockers met with an accident the only way to get an ambulance is to use the telephone in a private house.  Years ago, the harbour commissioners and several Deputies appealed for a public telephone adjacent to the jetties.  Numerous other places need a public telephone also, especially in view of the built-up areas around the city where there is no post office, no police barracks and no place where a person can make a telephone call, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett suggested to-day that the rental on telephones should not be permanent and that the people who had paid the rental for a certain period of time should not have to pay it any longer.  If I understood the Minister correctly, I think he said that the maintenance of a line costs about £10 <Col N="244" /> a year.  If that is so, then I am afraid we cannot get a reduction in the rental.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett also asked why this Department should have to pay its way when Departments such as the Department of Defence were not paying their way.  I do not know whether or not he meant that the soldiers should pay the costs of that Department.  The only army I ever heard of that made an attempt to pay its way was the Irish Republican Army.  They paid for their arms out of subscriptions, and so forth.  I do not think Deputy Everett's comparison between the Department of Defence and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was a fair comparison.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a suggestion was made in relation to the telephone directory, and it was indicated that it was not feasible to divide the book into sectional areas and giving, say, an area for each exchange.  It is pretty difficult at times when a person is looking for the telephone number of a man named, say, Pat Murphy or John Murphy, to find his telephone number easily, because some names are very common in this country, and, in order to find the particular number which you are seeking, you have to go through the telephone numbers of all the people of that name in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Surely it should be possible to devise a system of dividing the directory into certain areas and thus make it easier to use.</P>
    <P>I come now to the present method of appointing sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses. As most people are aware, there was a great deal of public indignation in connection with the appointment of a sub-postmaster in Baltinglass.  The person who had been running that office efficiently for years for an aged relative was not appointed. Due to the wave of public opinion at the time, the Minister was forced to dismiss the man whom he had appointed and to appoint the lady who had been running that office so efficiently for a long number of years. Then, apparently in some kind of a panic, he set up a selection committee for the appointment of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied that that is the best way of appointing people to those positions.  The Minister <Col N="245" /> must be aware that, in the appointment of temporary postmen and other minor postal officials in his Department &mdash;provided they are qualified to fill the post&mdash;preference is always given to men who have rendered service in the creation and maintenance of this State. Consideration has also been given to men with large families, provided, as I say, that they are qualified to fill the post and, all other things being equal, those people get a preference.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that this selection committee, with the usual Civil Service mentality, takes these matters into consideration.  I believe it is very important that those people should get the sympathetic consideration which is their due.  People who served in the I.R.A., Cumann na mBan and in our Defence Forces during the emergency should be entitled to a certain amount of preference when those jobs become vacant.  After all, they have voluntarily given a good deal of their time towards the creation and maintenance of this State.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong that that service should now be forgotten.  I think the Minister should seriously consider this matter.  He should not in any way shirk responsibility for those appointments.  If some people did wrong, I would say that there would be as many wrongs done under this committee as was ever done in any other way.  After all, it has always been considered that the person occupying the place where the Minister now is took responsibility for making those appointments.  I would be grateful to the Minister if, when replying, he would deal effectively with that matter.</P>
    <P>It is recognised by everybody that the Minister has put more drive into his Department than was ever put into it before.  I believe he will continue that drive.  He seems to me in every way fitted for the post.  As far as the City of Cork is concerned, the officials of his Department have always been most courteous, most obliging and efficient.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the points I have made about the installations of telephones and the matter of the selection committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always advocated that the people who have telephones for years should not be asked to continue paying the rental for them year after year.  I made inquiries as to what it would cost to install a telephone. I did this on a previous occasion also.  I understand there is no regulation except that a charge for rental is made every year.  The Minister, in his statement, said there was a surplus from telephones of £54,000. I think it is a great hardship that the people who have telephones in their homes and offices for years should be asked to continue to pay the same price for them all the time.  In his statement the Minister explained that it costs about £10 a year to maintain service for the telephones.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what the gas company would say to that.  If you buy a gas stove it becomes your own property after paying for it over so many years.  A person who has had a telephone for the past 15 or 20 years should be free of that annual payment. I think that is a matter to which the Minister should give serious consideration.</P>
      <P>We have a similar position in the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister's Department is not responsible for the Electricity Supply Board.  I know a person who has had a telephone for the past 34 years.  Not only had he to pay the rental for it, but since January he has had to pay 25 per cent. extra.  I think that is wrong. Having regard to the fact that there is a surplus of £54,000 from telephones, I think the Minister should reconsider the matter of the rental.</P>
      <P>It is well also to mention the fact that the Minister, in his statement, said that we are paying £151,000 on interest on money to operate our postal services.  There is some room for improvement there.  If we are compelled to pay that on interest on money to give us decent postal services there is no justification for making those who have a telephone in their homes or offices continue paying yearly taxes.  I maintain it is wrong to tax people in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can purchase a gas stove for £20 or £30 and pay it off over a number <Col N="247" /> of years.  Having paid the cost, you have the gas stove free.  I would suggest to the Minister that the gas company have also to maintain a service from the gas main to the house, just as the Minister has to maintain a service from the main wire to the house.</P>
    <P>I have every reason to complain about the slowness of getting phones into houses in built-up areas.  I do not expect the phones to be installed immediately but they should be put in as quickly as possible in building schemes where people are completely out of contact with one another.  I think a special effort should be made to deal with this matter.  The local superintendent and engineer should be informed that a telephone service should be installed.  I am as anxious as any man that the telephone service should be extended throughout the country.  There is a good telephone service in the cities but in the built-up areas and especially in the country villages there is not the service one would expect in these modern times.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of postmen and temporary employees, I have raised this matter for many years.  I got a shock when I discovered the position in regard to temporary postmen. As an illustration of that I would like to point out that, when a postman's job became vacant in County Cork, I got a letter from a clergyman to say a man was looking for the job. The clergyman could not understand why the applicant could not get the job.  I investigated the matter.  I discovered that this man entered the postal service when he was 15 years of age and at the time the postman's job became vacant he had given 43 years' service without a break.  He was doing the senior postman's job but, because he was not established, he was getting £1 a week less.  That was very bad.  He was not established after 43 years.  Is it not a shocking thing that a man, who had given honest service from the time he was 15 years, should be asked to do the job of a senior postman and yet receive £1 less than the senior postman was getting?  He could not be appointed <Col N="248" /> postman.  A man with very junior service got the job because of the regulation. I do not expect the Minister to change that state of affairs immediately. The previous Minister tried to do something, but I would urge upon the present Minister that a serious effort should be made to prevent that sort of thing.  I think it is a terrible thing that any person should be in employment for a number of years without being established.  It is wrong that a person should be 25 or 30 years in a State Department without being established.  I hope the Minister will change that as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I referred to the telephone directory.  I think the time is ripe to reconsider the rearrangement of that directory.  I would suggest that a zonal arrangement would meet the case.  It is rather annoying to find all the Pat Murphys from Dublin to Donegal and from Donegal to Cork bundled together. They should be put into zones. Cork City and county represents one-twentieth of the area of Ireland and I think that the Pat Murphys and the Sullivans who live in that area should be shown thus in the telephone directory. That would be a far better arrangement to that which exists at the moment where the names are mixed up.  That is a matter to which the Minister should give some thought.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat all the requests made to the Minister but I was struck, on reading the papers, by some of the cases which appear in court.  I wonder if we are giving sufficient remuneration to postmasters and postmistresses. This is a matter which merits the Minister's consideration. Whether the offices be large or small, postmasters and postmistresses have great responsibilities.  It is very undesirable that people in charge of money and in charge of deposited money should be paid inadequately.  It is regrettable to find, when cases of dishonesty on the part of postmasters, postmistresses or their assistants come before the courts, how inadequate their remuneration really is.  Their pay is certainly not in accordance with our concept of justice, and I trust that the Minister will give this matter serious <Col N="249" /> thought.  I have nothing further to say except to repeat that it has been my view for a long time that the annual rental for telephones, whether they be in private houses or in business premises, should be immediately reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long.  My reason for speaking on this Estimate is to draw attention to the fact that, in page after page of the Minister's Vote, the words &ldquo;unestablished&rdquo;, &ldquo;supernumerary&rdquo; and &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; appear.  It will be noted that temporary and auxiliary postmen do not get the same advantages as permanent postmen with regard to holiday pay, sickness allowance and other allowances.  This subject has been raised in the House over a number of years by many speakers, and especially by speakers on the Labour Benches, who have been continuously agitating for better conditions for postal officials.  In page 311 of the Book of Estimates, in reference to postmen, Deputies will come across the words &ldquo;Thirty-one unestablished&rdquo;. It will be noticed that their wages range from 65/6 to 116/3 per week. Surely these wages cannot be regarded as adequate in the year 1952.  I do not know how men can possibly exist on these wages.  Even though we are hopeful that their pay will improve, I ask the Minister to impress on the Government the desirability of making temporary postmen permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey referred to the fact that there are postmen with 30 years' service who have not yet been employed in a permanent capacity.  We may criticise other employers, but do we realise the bad example which this Department is showing?  I earnestly hope that the Minister will find time to look at pages 295, 300 and 311 of the Estimates which set out the salaries and non-pensionable allowances of clerks.  These sums range from 59/4 to 168/-.  Surely 168/- per week at the present time does not represent a decent wage for a clerk in any sort of business, much less for a clerk engaged in the service of the State.  I do not know what types of officials are in receipt of 59/4 per week, nor am I aware what service they have.  Reference <Col N="250" /> is made to 56 auxiliary postmen and to 16 unestablished postmen.  What does all this mean?  Does it mean that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is expecting that business will get slack and that they can dismiss these men at a few days' notice?</P>
    <P>We should show good example to other employers by paying our own employees adequately.  All postmen should be put on the permanent staff, and given hope in the knowledge that they are Government employees, and that after 40 years' service they will retire with a fair pension.  While they are working, and fit to work, the State should pay them a decent wage.  I maintain that the wages in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be increased substantially, and that the words &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;, &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; and &ldquo;unestablished&rdquo; should be changed to the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the inadequacy, from the point of view of the workers, of post office buildings, especially where postal workers in the City of Dublin are concerned.  Deputies should visit the ramshackle post office building in Pearse Street.  This building should be improved, a canteen provided, and decent shelter made available for the men when the weather is bad.  The State should provide proper accommodation for its own staff.  Passing daily by the Amiens Street Post Office buildings, I notice that the old corrugated iron sheds are still acting as an annexe to the main buildings.  It is some years ago since I first asked the question: &ldquo;Why cannot the sheds acting as an annexe to the Amiens Street Post Office buildings be removed?&rdquo;  The post office itself is a fairly passable building, but it would be considerably improved if the wooden huts next door to it accommodating the workers were removed.</P>
    <P>The type of clothing worn by our postal officials does not appear to be made of first-class material, and the style is certainly out of date.  In fact, the style puts me in mind of 50 years ago.  Our postmen are worthy of the best the country can provide for them. However, I am not so much concerned about their appearance as about the number of them who are temporary, <Col N="251" /> auxiliary and unestablished.  The Minister's Estimate shows that the wages of temporary postmen range from 63/- per week to 111/9 per week. Surely, that cannot be looked on as an adequate wage.  I ask the Minister to listen to the appeals of Deputy Hickey and other speakers on the Labour Benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech this evening, Deputy McGrath appealed to the Minister to get back to the system whereby he made appointments as sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  I hope the Minister will set his face against any attempt to make the filling of these appointments a monopoly of the Minister's. Everybody knows perfectly well when there is a vacancy for a post as sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress Ministers are plagued with representations not merely from Deputies from one Party but from Deputies from all Parties and the local branches of the political Parties all go into action on behalf of their respective fancies.  They create a political ferment by getting all the local branches of the local political organisations pulling and tugging with the aid of local celebrities to get each of the Deputies who represent the constituency to pull and tug at the Minister in the hope that by the time they have all finished somebody will be dragged out and crowned as the underpaid sub-postmaster of some place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a thoroughly disreputable method of appointing people to the public service.  It is thoroughly disreputable from every standpoint and a wise Minister who realises that he has nothing to gain politically by appointing one pal and disappointing the other 19&mdash;and the one pal would probably become ungrateful when he sees the scale of pay&mdash;will without hesitation give that job over to somebody who will approach the problem from the standpoint of finding the best man or woman there is for the job, who will take into consideration perhaps service in the national movement or service in the National Army but at all events they will be people who will approach <Col N="252" /> it not from the point of view of doing what the local political organisation wants done but from the point of view of appointing a person who will render the most efficient service to the Post Office Department.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will stand firm against any proposal to get back into his hands this scheme of distributing political jobs to political supporters, who regard Ministers as the fountainhead from which all privilege or place and all preferment necessarily descend. I hope the Minister will leave this work in the hands of the committee which was appointed to do this job.  It was one of the most beneficial developments in the matter of eliminating patronage in recent years.  My only comment is that I would like to see it continued and extended to other part-time posts of one kind or another, to full-time posts of one kind or another which are still under ministerial patronage, and to that whole job of making these appointments in this manner.  It would be better if responsibility in this connection was taken away from the Minister and given to a group of impartial people who would look at the problem from the point of view of getting the best people to serve the State rather than have this horse-trading which goes on at present in the way of who has got the best pull with the Minister and as to the person to whom the Minister is likely to give the job in response to somebody being able to exercise the pull more efficaciously than somebody else.  In any case, if there is any proposal to go back to the old system I hope there will be men and women in this House public-spirited and public-minded enough to resist any attempt to get back to that method of Tammany Hall, which is the only way by which one can describe the horse-trading that is supposed to be making appointments to the public service in so far as sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us a very lengthy review of the activities of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There is much meat in the speech he made and in the documents which he circulated.  Quite properly a good deal <Col N="253" /> of the speech is given over to the question of post office buildings and I am glad to see the Minister felt it desirable to refer in his speech to the necessity for the provision of better post office buildings than those which are available to-day.  I want to make some comment on this Estimate with a view to enlisting&mdash;and I hope it will not be difficult&mdash;the co-operation of the Minister to find a solution to the problems to which I propose to advert.</P>
    <P>One of these problems is the question of post office buildings.  It is hardly possible to exaggerate the inadequacy and insufficiency of the accommodation provided by the Post Office Department for the transaction of public business to-day.  Probably the worst public buildings in the State from the standpoint of inadequate accommodation are those which are described as post offices throughout the State.  Many of those buildings, of course, were built away back in the opening years of this century, some probably towards the end of the last century.  They were built before the Old Age Pensions Act came into operation in 1908, built before the National Health Insurance Act came into operation, which compelled them to sell national health insurance stamps; built before the Unemployment Insurance Act came into operation, which also compelled them to sell stamps; built before the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act; built before the Children's Allowances Act, built before rationing came into operation; built before wireless licences came into operation.  They were built when a whole lot of those transactions which are now railroaded through the Post Office were unknown so far as post office business was concerned. They were built, too, when the Post Office was not the only carrier of parcels in the country, built when the letter and postcard traffic was substantially less than it is to-day, built when telephone traffic was in its infancy and when telegraph traffic was struggling to see the light, and, in fact, built in many cases before the Post Office operated the entire telephone service which, up to 1911, was operated in part by the old National Telephone Company.</P>
    <P>Those are the kind of buildings which <Col N="254" /> we have to-day serving as post offices for the enormously expanded public service which the post office operates to-day.  Is there any wonder that the accommodation is grossly inadequate, grossly inadequate from the standpoint of efficiency, of providing accommodation for the staff and inadequate, too, from the point of view of affording adequate accommodation for the public who use the public counters of the offices.  It is nothing unusual&mdash;I am sure the Minister has seen it both as a Minister and as a Deputy&mdash;to see people herded together around the public counter.  There is no order, no system.  There is a miserable little counter and on the other side of the counter a few clerks trying to operate in the very limited space available and trying to satisfy irate members of the public on the other side who cannot understand why the State cannot provide a better system of accommodation than that which is provided for the local post offices.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not necessary to impress this on the Minister and I feel sure that it is not from discussions I had with him on the subject.  The whole position we have to-day is the legacy of years and years of neglect.  I do not think making the Board of Works responsible for the provision of post office buildings is the happiest solution of that problem.  I agree a case can be made for it in certain respects but when you look at the existing post office buildings and realise how inadequate they are and remember the Board of Works has been responsible for constructing or maintaining them for the past 30 years, it is permissible if one loses faith in the system by which the Board of Works is the sole authority for erecting, renovating and reconstructing post office buildings throughout the country.  But if we must use the Board of Works for some time to come pending the examination and perhaps adoption of another and better system of providing decent post offices, then at least the Post Office ought to be able to get attention from the Board of Works. My experience of the Board of Works was that it operated on the principle that the crying child gets the most attention.  Anybody who can screech <Col N="255" /> loud enough will get the best attention from the Board of Works.  If you are decent and patient and just wait for the circulation of files, your case is hopeless.  The Board of Works have the most fantastic contempt for files.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; is unknown in the Board of Works from the point of view of trying to get work done quickly.  One can only get work done quickly by that office by getting some kind of Cabinet arrangement which gives the Post Office, in urgent need of proper public buildings, some lien or some right to operate on some particular section of the Board of Works in order to get it to provide the many decent post office buildings required to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a long list of buildings in his speech in connection with which something was being done. He gave us a list of other buildings in connection with which it is hoped to get something done.  If the Minister would reveal his innermost thoughts on this question of public buildings he would be compelled to confess that even in his own experience of dealing with the Board of Works over the past 12 months it has not been possible to get that body to move with the speed and acceleration the situation so urgently demands.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister that he should by means of ministerial or Cabinet action get something effective done in the way of providing additional accommodation in post office buildings throughout the country.  The problem is becoming one of extreme urgency because of the deterioration in the standard of accommodation and because of the many additional transactions which are being unloaded on to post office staffs as being the best agency in the country for the transaction of certain business and the operation of national services, such as our wireless service and the newly coordinated code of social security.</P>
    <P>In these days when the operation of an efficient telephone service has so much to commend it and when there is unanimous recognition of the necessity for efficiency at a high level on such a <Col N="256" /> technical question as telephone operation, I am glad that the Minister devoted some time in his speech to an exposition of what the telephone service is, how it is costed, how many subscribers it has and how its volume of business continues to mount.  If we are to have an efficient telephone system we must have as a prerequisite a satisfactory telephone staff. In that connection I want to call the Minister's attention to two aspects of the staffing problem, again in the belief which, I think, is well founded on my part, that the Minister will make a serious effort to find a solution to the problem of which I complain.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to do something quickly in relation to the recruitment, appointment and retention of night telephonists.  At the present time that class is recruited as a temporary class.  Having recruited a big batch of night telephonists in one year the Department may, as the Miniister knows, lose more by resignations in that same year than the number that was recruited.  That is a phenomenon that good administration ought to probe.  If it is probed it will be found that the reason why so many resign is because they are dissatisfied with their conditions, their wages, accommodation and hours of attendance. At present they are required to work six nights per week the whole year round.  I believe an enormous improvement could be effected in their conditions, leading to a substantial measure of contentment in the class as a whole, if the Minister would accept the principle of giving them two nights off per week and permitting them to adjust their hours of attendance over the other five nights.</P>
    <P>These matters have already been brought to the Minister's attention and, when he is replying, I hope he will be able to tell us that he proposes to apply a remedy at an early date which will, I believe, do much to retain in the service of the Post Office those night telephonists on whom the Post Office spends a substantial sum of money in training so that their services will not be lost because the staff are fed-up with the conditions under which they are required to work. <Col N="257" /> I am certain that the Minister would not permit such conditions to occur in any private firm with which he might be connected.  Mass resignations go on year after year and the Post Office has taken no effective steps to get down to an examination of the cause and to find a remedy.  Public money is wasted on the training of these telephonists and at the end of their three months' training they leave because they do not find the conditions of work acceptable.  These night telephonists should be recruited by open competitive examination.  Their appointment should be permanent.  Some effort should be made to improve their attendances.  If the Minister will attempt a solution along these lines, as I hope he will, I venture to say he will find a substantial improvement in the efficiency of that section of the service.</P>
    <P>A good deal of attention is being given to-day by public health authorities and by the Press generally towards the promotion of cleanliness and to exposing the danger of dirt.  I think it is appropriate to call the Minister's attention in that connection to the rather primitive conditions that exist for the cleaning of mail bags.  An enormous number of mail bags are used each year.  Very often the bags are too heavy to carry and they are dragged along the ground from the post office to the van and vice versa.  Clearly it is quite impossible to keep the bags clean for any length of time.  The only solution is to clean the bags as frequently as possible so as to keep the dirt down to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The present method adopted by the Post Office is to send the mail bags to some prison where they get some kind of beating.  One can imagine the pride of craft a prisoner takes in beating a mail bag while he reflects on the number of years he will have to spend in jail.  When they have been beaten by the prisoners they are returned to the Post Office as &ldquo;clean bags&rdquo;.  One would almost think they were being returned, judging from that description, from some well-known cleaning agency in the City of Dublin.  There is often very little difference in the condition of the bags when they come back from the <Col N="258" /> prison according to the people who have to handle them.  I believe there is one firm to which the bags are occasionally sent.  I do not know whether or not it regards the Post Office order as up to expectations, but now and again it does clean post office mail bags.  It is acknowledged that it cannot do all the cleaning that the Post Office requires, even if it had the equipment or enthusiasm for the work.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is unique in a number of respects.  It is unique in that it is the only Post Office in Europe which has no machinery at its disposal for cleaning mail bags.  Whatever changes have taken place in the last 30 years, nobody succeeded in inducing the Post Office to change their notion that it should not have cleaning apparatus for mail bags.  Many devices and gadgets have become available to mankind in the last 30 years, but the Post Office remains impervious, and have not attempted to equip themselves with such apparatus.</P>
    <P>Whatever our financial position is, the Post Office is not so hard up that it could not afford to buy a few bag-cleaning outfits which would be installed at various centres, where dirty bags could be cleaned and put into circulation again.  That is so elementary that one would imagine it would have been in operation long ago.  If the Minister makes inquiries, he will find that this country is unique in that it has no cleaning apparatus for mail bags.  If one raises the question, one is told about the cost.  Every other Administration regards such apparatus as essential.  I do not think that things here are so perfect from a hygienic standpoint that we can afford to do without apparatus that is regarded as essential in every post office in Europe and, I am sure, in places outside Europe.</P>
    <P>I commend that suggestion to the Minister for examination in the hope that he will see the value of getting proper apparatus for cleaning mail bags instead of committing them to prisoners and asking them to beat the dirt and germs out of them and, perhaps, to throw some disinfectant on them.  In 1952, common sense dictates that we ought to invest in such <Col N="259" /> apparatus.  It is scandalous that our methods of cleaning mail bags are as bad as they are.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's speech a reference to the fact that a departmental committee has been set up to inquire as to what improvements or modifications can be usefully effected in postmen's uniforms.  I do not know what sartorial specialists are in the Post Office.  They are quite unknown to me.  There are many people who could produce a better design of uniform for postmen than the present one and who know that there are better cloths on the market than the cloth at present used.  If postmen have to wear uniform they should have some say in the design.  They should not be asked to appear in public in a design prescribed by people who have never worn uniform and who certainly never wore postmen's uniform.  I do not know where this departmental committee came from.  I do not know how it is constituted.  I do not know what qualifications the members have for designing a uniform.  I do not know what they know about the value of protective clothing, waterproof capes, coats, etc.  I suggest to the Minister that, as a matter of ordinary prudence and good sense, if this committee is to deal with the question of designing uniform and with the quality of the cloth used, he should invite the co-operation of those who represent postmen in the work of this committee in the hope that, with the practical experience of those who know the problem and the theoretical views of those who have no practical knowledge of it, it may be possible to evolve a uniform more suited to postmen, more suited to conditions in this country than the present type, and that is made of better cloth than is at present used.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the cloth that is used suffers from the basic defect that if there is any dust near a postman it it only a matter of minutes until the uniform picks it up.  The dust shows on the uniform in the same way as dust shows on the hedgerows when motor cars pass by.  My complaint is that the <Col N="260" /> cloth is too prone to pick up dust because it is too soft.  An effort should be made to find a cloth which will attract less dust.  The co-operation of those who know a good deal about this problem and who are anxious to assist in this matter should be invited.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the St. Andrew's St. exchange.  I gather from what he said that portion of it will be open this summer.  This is July and I suppose normally summer would be regarded as ending in September.  Do I take it that the exchange, or part of it, will be opened and staffed, say, by September?  I would ask the Minister to tell us about that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the Pearse Street office.  As Deputy Alfred Byrne described it, the Pearse Street building is a ramshackle one.  Originally, it was a distillery, then for a long time a disused distillery, then a gaunt rookery and finally it blossomed out as a central sorting and postmen's office. Since 1922 it has functioned in that capacity.  If ever money was misspent, it was surely misspent in trying to hold the Pearse Street office together.  I do not know what the situation is at the moment.  The roof had two rather unusual moods.  In the winter-time the rain would percolate through the roof on to the letters and one had to move about and sort the letters where there was no rain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better than that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It had a summer-time mood also.  The Board of Works&mdash; charming people&mdash;discovered that the real remedy for the leaking roof was to smother the holes with tar.  In due course, the men with the buckets of tar arrived and tumbled the tar on the roof, swept it up and down and said, &ldquo;That has finished all these holes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The following summer the tar came into the office in place of the rain. That cycle has been going on for years and years.  Ultimately, the tar beat the rain, but how long the tar will remain the conqueror of the rain nobody knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building at Pearse Street is an utterly hopeless one.  When post office <Col N="261" /> people come to this country and ask where is the central letter sorting office you have to tell them: &ldquo;Do not go near that; you will only irritate yourself and carry away a bad impression.&rdquo; The only thing they have to be shown is this ramshackle place hidden away in this particular quarter of the city.  I am not blaming the Minister personally for that.  It is a dreadful legacy which has been left there by Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs for the last 30 years.  I am trying to focus the Minister's attention on the matter, so that somebody will not be talking about the Pearse Street building in this House 30 years hence.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Post Office authorities have got alternative accommodation.  It ought to be put on record that after promising to rebuild at Pearse Street for about 28 years, and saying that everything was now clear except the title to one piece of land, the Board of Works woke up and said: &ldquo;That place is no good for a sorting office; we must change it&rdquo;. Now Pearse Street is to be abandoned as a sorting office, and the new site on which the office will be raised is down near Amiens Street station at a place known as Sally's Garden.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's speech that negotiations for the taking over of the site are nearly completed. I wonder if the Minister will be courageous enough to venture to say when the plans and specifications will be prepared for this Sally's Garden site, when it is likely that tenders will be invited, and when the credulous people who believe in the speedy policy of the Board of Works will have their curiosity satisfied to such an extent as to know in what year or perhaps in what generation the new office will be erected at the Sally's Garden site.  I take it the Post Office, having just got possession or being about to get possession of this site, will &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; on this site and that some effort will be made to erect the sorting office there. I should like the Minister to tell us what the Post Office proposals are and when it is likely that a satisfactory letter and sorting office will be erected.</P>
    <P>The question of part time postmen in provincial offices was raised by a number <Col N="262" /> of Deputies.  I ask the Minister to look into this matter personally. For many years the Post Office averred that it was their policy to expand part time posts to full time where possible and at the same time sympathetically to consider the question by dividing a part time post which became vacant amongst the holders of other part time posts at a particular office so as to build up part time posts in that office or, where possible, to make full time posts there by using the vacant part time post to build up the other posts there.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, it seems that the Post Office have been disposed to get away from that policy on the ground of cost.  I hope that has no official sanction at a high level and no ministerial benediction.  Cases have come to my notice which appear to indicate that if the cost of creating a full time post in likely to amount to something which displeases somebody&mdash;I do not know who is to be pleased in the matter&mdash;then the Post Office refrain from upgrading the part time post to a full time post.  There is nothing more detestable about Post Office employment than the large number of persons employed on part time duties.  Part time employment, when you have the responsibility of feeding a family full time, is a very objectionable form of employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister devote some attention to that matter with a view to eliminating as far as possible all part time posts either by finding additional work for those holding part time positions or by utilising the occurrence of vacancies in part time positions to build up to full time existing part time posts.</P>
    <P>Much valuable work can be done in that direction.  In fact, very useful work was done in that direction in the revision of services which were carried out in a number of head office areas during the past few years.  Not only did these rural revisions result in improving the deliveries and collections, but they also resulted in expanding a number of part time posts to full time posts.  That again resulted in the provision of departmental motor vans which accelerated the service in these areas and helped to improve the conditions <Col N="263" /> under which rural postmen and auxiliary postmen work.  I should like, however, to see the Minister carry the revisions to the stage of endeavouring to create full time posts wherever possible, so that we can as far as possible reduce part time employment by providing full time employment at full time rates of pay for those whose part time posts are expanded to full time.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate I notice reference to O. and M. methods and the benefits which flow from the O. and M. scheme operating in the Post Office Department.  I am a firm believer in efficient methods of organisation, because where you have efficient methods of organisation and where you provide for the human element and understand that the human element is not just a pawn on a chess board, a cog in a wheel, or a piece of human flesh to be moved about hither and thither without any regard to a person's personality or individuality, such a scheme has much to commend it. What I want to do is to contrast this organisation and methods scheme with what is happening in respect of the delivery of parcels in Dublin.  The Post Office has an excellent fleet of motor cars in Dublin engaged in the collecting and delivery of parcels and their transport to and from railways and bus centres.  Nobody will deny that it is a first-class fleet and that it is doing a first-class job.  The Post <Col N="264" /> Office is entitled to be proud of the efficient way in which the fleet works not only in Dublin but wherever it operates throughout the country.  The introduction and extension of it has brought about many improvements in Post Office organisation.</P>
    <P>It is a little odd, therefore, that while you have a fleet of motors engaged in the delivery of parcels the local administration in Dublin should still insist that a walking postman engaged in the delivery of ordinary and registered letters should have to take out parcels with him for delivery at the same time as he takes out the ordinary and registered letters.  That is operating in this way: the letter-carrying postman may arrive at a house at the same time as the parcel delivery postman, one with one parcel and the other with another parcel. That does not seem to make sense.  If there is a motor van operating in a district, the sensible thing to do is to ensure that the van takes out all the parcels, and that the van should be used for delivering all the parcels.  With vans available and being engaged in particular districts, it seems odd that the Post Office should not utilise these vans for the delivery of parcels.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 8th July.</P>
