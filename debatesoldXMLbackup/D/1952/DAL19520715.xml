      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the amount in freights earned by Irish registered ships in respect of cargoes between ports outside the State in each of the years 1949, 1950 and 1951, and which may be regarded as contributing towards the reduction of the adverse balance of trade.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy requires information with regard to earnings in respect of cargoes loaded and discharged at ports outside the State. These particulars are not available. Estimates are, however, available of gross freight earnings of Irish shipping companies less payments made outside the State (in respect of equipment, charter hire, repairs, bunkers, stores, harbour dues, etc.).  These net earnings, which are relevant to the Balance of International Payments Statement, and are included in item 23 thereof, amounted to £713,000 in 1949, to £700,000 in 1950 and to £1,410,000 in 1951.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a large number of men have recently become unemployed in the agricultural machinery and edge tool <Col N="808" /> industry in Wexford town; and, if so, whether he will state why so many operatives have been laid off in these industries.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some unemployment has taken place in this industry in Wexford town.  From inquiries which I have caused to be made I understand that it is largely attributable to a decline in the demand for horse-drawn farm machinery, particularly mowing machinery, which is being supplanted by mechanically operated units.  The firms concerned have stated that plans to convert production to the latter type are well advanced, and it is likely that when these are put into effect, they will alleviate the present unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the date on which he received a recommendation from Kildare County Council that Naas Fever Hospital should be used for the accommodation of persons suffering from tuberculosis; (b) the date on which he gave his approval to the recommendation; (c) the conditions, if any, upon which this approval was given; and (d) whether, having regard to the urgent need for the provision of this extra accommodation, he has satisfied himself as to the causes of the delay in making this accommodation available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) I was informed by letter dated 11th October, 1951, that Kildare County Council, at a meeting on the 24th September, had approved of a recommendation in regard to the conversion <Col N="809" /> of Naas Fever Hospital for use for the accommodation and treatment of tubercular patients.</P>
      <P>(b)  My approval in principle of the proposal of the local authority to use the Naas Fever Hospital, as proposed, was conveyed in a letter dated 27th February, 1952.  The delay between the time the proposal was made and the date of the sanction was due to inability to get from the local authority information which satisfied me that the hospital could be converted, as proposed, without impairing the efficiency of the service necessary to deal with other infectious diseases, including smallpox, should an epidemic occur.</P>
      <P>(c)  the approval mentioned was given subject to the condition that the county medical officer was satisfied that satisfactory alternative arrangements had been made for the care of persons from County Kildare who would normally have been admitted to the Naas Fever Hospital and to arrangements being made whereby, in the event of an outbreak or suspected outbreak of smallpox in County Kildare or in any of the adjoining counties, either the Nass Institution or Firmount Sanatorium would be evacuated within 24 hours and made available as a regional smallpox centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  I have not satisfied myself as to the causes of the delay in making this accommodation available.  I had understood from the date of the sanction given in principle to the proposal, viz., 27th February, 1952, until a letter was received in my Department dated 26th May, 1952, that all arrangements were in train for the conversion of the hospital. It was only on the last-mentioned date that I was informed that the matter of acceptance by the council of the conditions laid down in the sanction had not been cleared up and that it would not be before the council until 30th June.  The reason given for not having made the necessary local arrangements earlier was that matters which had been raised in a report of the Kildare chief medical officer dated 12th June, 1951, which had been transmitted to my Department without comment on the 27th of that month, had not been settled by the Department. There were 12 such matters, <Col N="810" /> including&mdash;I am quoting from the report&mdash;&ldquo;the precise amount of additional remuneration proposed for any substantial additional responsibilities accruing to the county medical officer from the proposal&rdquo;, &ldquo;the bringing of arrangements to press-button level of operation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;definite cutting of operation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;definite cutting of red tape when and if emergency arises&rdquo;.  Those of the 12 matters which had any substance were matters to be dealt with by the local authority in the light of prevailing local circumstances, some to finality without reference to my Department and others to be the subject of definite proposals from the local authority to my Department, and I am unable to understand why the local authority in this instance should have greater difficulty in bringing this matter to finality than the other local authorities which made very considerable rearrangements of their hospital accommodation so as to meet the need for increased beds for tuberculosis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind the limitation to two of the number of dependent children of whom account is now taken in determining rates of unemployment assistance. Section 97 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, fixes the rate of 38/- per week as the maximum payable to a person resident in an urban area who has an adult dependent and two or more child dependents.  The present rates can be altered only by amending legislation which I do not propose to introduce.</P>

This resulted in a postponement by the board to see what response the applicant would make to hospital treatment which he was undergoing.  A report received from the Army Pensions Board on the 7th April, 1952, indicated, however, that the applicant was incapable of self-support.

      <P>On this amendment, I wonder has the Minister considered the discussion which arose on amendment No. 11 in Committee in relation to the possibility of either of the persons referred to and the child not having a religion.  I know that there is a presumption with regard to the religion dealt with in the Bill, but has there been any further consideration of this other than the proposal contained in this amendment?  The Minister will recollect that he told the House that he had had certain advice and discussions with regard to this matter.  Is it agreed that, in relation to members of the Catholic religion, it is desirable that all should be of that religion except in the cases dealt with in the amendment?</P>

I was not right in saying <Col N="827" /> that.  The position will be that the child will have been brought up by somebody, and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the child will be taken as being brought up in the religion of the person taking care of him.  That is understood to be the view that will be taken by the board. As I have said, I was wrong in stating what I did say in Committee.  The board will have regard to the religion of the person who has had charge of the child.</P>

      <P>Under the sub-section, as it stands, the board would have to satisfy itself that a mother who gave her consent understood that an adoption Order would deprive her of all her rights in respect of the child.

    <P>This amendment is intended to ensure that the foster-parents of a boardedout child can adopt it now even though the child is over seven provided the child has been in their care since before he was seven.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned on Friday afternoon last I was speaking of the need for the decentralisation of industry.  I asked the Minister if, when he gave the Industrial Development Authority a list of imports valued at £20,000,000 and which commodities it was proposed to manufacture in this country, he asked that authority to endeavour to place the new factories in our rural towns and villages.  Where there is no danger of jeopardising the success of an industry, I think it is essential that the rural towns and villages should receive full consideration.  That would be good economic policy for the industrial life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody with a knowledge of the small towns and villages of rural Ireland will agree with me when I say that the life-blood of the population is slowly being drained away by the emigration of our boys and girls.  If some of the many factories which have been erected and are in course of erection in Dublin City, and in the areas immediately adjoining it, had been located in rural Ireland they would help to bring back prosperity and employment there.  Take, for instance, some of the towns in my constituency&mdash;towns such as Mallow, Lismore, Cappoquin, Kilmacthomas, Ardmore and so forth&mdash;where there is no employment except for an odd man here or there who is employed in a shop or in a yard attached to some <Col N="830" /> store.  An industry is badly needed in these areas.  If it is proposed to manufacture in this country commodities valued at £20,000,000, or some portion of them which hitherto have been imported, I suggest that it is the duty of the Government to endeavour to locate the factories in our rural towns and villages.  The Government have a responsibility to do something for our rural towns and villages similar to what the Labour Government did in Great Britain for the areas there known as the &ldquo;depressed areas&rdquo;. Not only should the Government encourage private enterprise in our rural areas but it should use State money to erect factories for employers or else aid employers by means of a money grant.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the erection of factories in rural areas the Government should give a guaranteed monopoly to the manufacturers who will decide to help the industrial life of this country by establishing their factories in places that, so far, have not been as well developed as other districts.  I feel that such a step is essential for the industrial progress of this country.  One-sixth of the total population of this country is located in Dublin.  Should the industrial life of Dublin continue at its present rate, within a very short time that population will increase considerably with the result that we shall have a completely lopsided industrial economy.  Practically all the people and all the industries will be confined to a very small part of the country and the other towns and villages will deserve the name of the Auburns of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister suggested that the difficulty in regard to hides has been partly removed.  He indicated that a certain amount of hides had been exported to Great Britain and elsewhere.  I am glad to note that some market has been found.  I understand that the system is that we keep sufficient for our own home needs, picking the best for that purpose, and that we export the balance.  I have wondered why we have not found an export market in the United States, which would be a dollar market.  It has been indicated to me by a man in that particular business <Col N="831" /> that he has an unlimited market in America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position. However, at present, when we are exporting, I cannot understand why we are not exporting to America, which is a dollar market.  I can give the Minister the name of the man in question.  He is quite prepared to meet the Minister and, through the Minister, the exporters.  He will make available to them the names of the contacts he has in America, provided the Minister and the exporters are agreeable.  He believes that he can dispose completely of the surplus hides in a dollar market.  That should be welcome news to the Minister.  I know the man in question.  He is a man of standing in the hide and skin business, and I am quite satisfied that what he says is correct.  Should the Minister so desire, I shall give him, in private, the name and address of the man in question and arrange an interview.</P>
      <P>Whatever troubles may have arisen in the leather trade, everybody will admit that there has been a considerable easing-off of employment in the boot and shoe industry as well as in the leather trade in general.  I believe the cause of a good deal of that trouble is the policy of the restriction of credit which is carried out by the banks at the suggestion of the Central Bank.  Because of that policy, employers throughout the country have been slow to open up new projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment has become more prevalent.  A worker who is unemployed is unable to purchase his footwear requirements.  I am quite satisfied that the recent Budget will lessen the spending power of the ordinary person so that, in the coming winter, less boots and shoes will be bought by the ordinary working man not because he will not need them but because he will not have the money <Col N="832" /> to purchase his requirements.  All our tanneries and all our factories should be in a position to employ their full complement of workers because in their time they gave a good return to this country and paid decent and fair wages to their workers.</P>
    <P>There is one question which I should like to ask the Minister on the subject of the storage of raw material which, the Minister indicated, he was anxious should be carried out.  I understand that a certain factory in my town is the sole supplier in this country of the commodity which they manufacture.  Work was stopped in that factory for some 11 weeks due to an industrial dispute.  When that dispute ended and the men resumed work it was found that the raw material essential for the working of that factory was exported to Great Britain during the time the men were on strike.  I feel that that should not have been permitted.  I suggest that the Minister should ensure that, should a similar situation arise in any other factory, no licences will be issued for the export from this country of raw material essential for the working of the factory in this country.</P>
    <P>The Bank Committee, according to the Minister, have the view that too much credit is tied up in stockpiling. I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is not in accord with that view.  The former Government are to be congratulated, I believe, on the precautions they took by making available credits to manufacturers to store sufficient raw material to last for some period, if an emergency arises.  It would be well if the Government followed the lines of refusing to accept the other view of the Bank Committee because if the restriction of credit is to be carried out in this country it will mean a further increase in unemployment and there will be a vicious circle where unemployed people, failing to have the money to buy the necessary goods in this country, will, by the very fact of being unemployed and being unable to spend money, cause still further and greater unemployment because their needs will not require to <Col N="833" /> be met since they will have no purchasing power.</P>
    <P>This Government should act in accordance with what the Tánaiste himself stated when we were discussing the Central Bank Report here.  He said that it was the duty of the Central Bank to make a report and it was the duty of the Government to decide what they were going to do.  If the policy of deflation which is being carried out is continued, it will cause so much unemployment that we will be back to the old days when we will have to send our men and our women across to Great Britain to seek employment to which they should be entitled in their own country.</P>
    <P>There is one case to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention, even though I believe that he himself is already in possession of the details of it.  It is in connection with a merchant who found in the United States of America a ready market for an unlimited supply of rough wool, wool which is not normally used in Ireland.  He went to his bank and asked for a considerable amount of credit, offering as security proof of the sale that he could make in the United States and believing that because he could be guaranteed dollar payments, he was doing both a national service as well as a good business deal for himself.  To his surprise, he was informed by his bank manager that it was not the function of the bank to advance money to any trader to the amount he required, and he was told he would have to carry on with a much lesser amount.  As a result, valuable dollars which could be earned in the United States had to be left there and the wool was sent to Holland and to other countries in Europe, and exported from those countries to the same market in the United States, with the difference that the American dollars, instead of coming direct to Ireland, did not come to Ireland at all. I feel that, in cases such as that, the Minister should have powers or should take to himself powers to enable him to see that people who are working and acting in national interests should be given the best facilities that the banks in Ireland can afford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> The Minister is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 10th July, 1952, as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Profits of manufacturers and traders were regularly reviewed, and his personal opinion, as a result of the investigations carried out by the Prices Advisory Body, was that there was no evidence that the profit margins taken either by manufacturers or traders were excessive.  A representative cross-section of manufacturers engaged in the production of 15 commodities of an essential kind, and with an aggregate turnover of £68,000,000 annually, showed that the rate of net profit was 5.66 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister make a statement such as that.  I have here in my hand a copy of <i>Trade Union Information,</i> dated January-February, 1952, Volume 6, No. 31.  In that there is a list of 69 public companies which over the past five years have shown a considerable net profit.  Anyone who is anxious to get the names of the companies can secure them by obtaining a copy of <i>Trade Union Information,</i> but I would like to quote from page 1 of the same paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The net profits of 69 public companies over the past five years are given elsewhere in this issue. The figures show a most remarkable buoyancy.  The net profits last year of 58 of the companies (i.e., excluding the banks and Guinness) amounted to £1,230,296, an increase of £294,975 or 32 per cent. on the figure of £935,321 for the previous year.  The increase in the preceding year was 12 per cent.  A rise of almost onethird in the profits of a large selection of public companies in a single year must surely be unprecedented.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a complete list showing the different profits of the various companies for the past five years.  Some may have increased all right, but there is no denying the fact <Col N="835" /> that those 69 companies have over the past five years shown an increase of up to 32 per cent.  Surely there is very little justification for the Minister to say that the profits of certain companies do not appear to be unduly large.  We in the Labour Party believe that not only is an undue profit being made but there are certain things happening such as one company having a bogus company, if I may use that word, or a front window company, such as a trading company, out of which they get profits from one company, the genuine company, and then they have another company which markets their goods and earns another set of profits. In my constituency we have a good example of such a company.  The secretary of the manufacturing company is also the secretary of the trading company.  He writes letters to himself as secretary of one company and addresses the letters to himself as secretary of another company, going from one office to another to answer the letters.  As some of the people say in my constituency: &ldquo;It is all right so long as he only writes to himself, but what will he do if he has to make a telephone call?&rdquo;  In that particular company the parent company was paying a 15 per cent. dividend and the trading company was also paying a 15 per cent. dividend.</P>

      <P>They have it both ways. We are not suggesting that is happening merely under this Government.  It happened under the inter-Party Government too.  There is no difference so far as this company is concerned as between the last Government and the present Government.  This particular matter was brought to the attention of the last Government in the same way as I am now bringing it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that he believes prices will not go down because of increased wages and increased <Col N="836" /> transport charges.  May I quote again from the <i>Trade Union Information:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;Last year the volume of production in transportable goods industries increased by about 3½ per cent. compared with a rise of 10 per cent. in 1950.  Production in these industries is now about 70 per cent. higher than pre-war.  The greater part of last year's rise in production was due to higher productivity since the numbers engaged rose only 1 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the workers are giving a greater output and doing a better day's work, is it not reasonable to expect that that should be reflected in some slight decrease in the price of the manufactured article and in the price of the retail goods also?  No matter how much the worker increases individual production it is my belief that the only result of that increase will be a bigger profit for the employer.  Employers seem to have formed themselves into rings and associations and have agreed between themselves that, no matter how cheaply they may be able to produce an article, they will only sell it at a fixed price.  In the old days, private enterprise and competition influenced prices and helped to reduce prices. Because of the high degree of organisation that has now developed as between manufacturers and retailers, the day of competition has gone.  I think the Minister has a responsibility to see that prices will bear a relationship to the actual cost of production plus a reasonable profit.  The Minister should take responsibility for fixing prices and he should ensure that his inspectors pay numerous visits throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Lower Prices Council and the Irish Housewives' Association are to be congratulated on the work they have done in fighting the consumer's battle in Dublin and Cork.  They are doing essential work.  They are doing work that should normally be carried out by Government inspectors.  It is regrettable that these organisations have not spread further than the two principal cities.  I believe there is need for them in every village and town.  Excessive prices are being charged.  If we had organisations <Col N="837" /> similar to these throughout the length and breadth of the country public attention could be focussed on the prices charged and the Minister's attention could more easily be brought to breaches of price control regulations. I think the effect of that would be to force down the excessive prices charged at present.</P>
    <P>I suggest that all applications for increased prices should in future be referred to the Prices Advisory Body. The meetings of that body should be held in public and where there is a recommendation to the Minister for an increase the reason for that increase should be made public so that the people may have an opportunity of understanding that it is no longer possible to produce the article at the low price and that, therefore, an increase has been recommended by the Prices Advisory Body and sanctioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Work has slackened off considerably in our clothing factories.  I believe that is directly attributable to the high prices being charged for clothing. If prices were reduced the ordinary people could afford to buy clothes. Even those who are in urgent need of clothing at the present time are unable to buy clothing.  If prices were reduced the people would buy and those who are unemployed at the moment would be re-engaged immediately in the manufacture of clothing.  Unless the prices charged are reasonable the people will be unable to buy and the Minister should urge on those engaged in the clothing industry the desirability of reducing prices to a figure within the reach of the ordinary man. I believe there is a gradual drop but the Minister was reported as saying some few days ago that he believes prices are not likely to fall much lower.</P>
    <P>I am glad that new tonnage is on order.  Many people have made representations to the Minister as to the desirability of procuring ships of a certain tonnage.  It has been suggested that ships of approximately 6,000 tons could enter the ports of Limerick and Waterford for instance. I believe that in the orders placed regard was had to that request.  I am <Col N="838" /> sure that if port authorities knew that they were being catered for in any new shipping they would do what we have done in Waterford, erect larger and better wharves and provide better facilities for the ships entering the ports.</P>
    <P>A week ago I received a complaint from a tea wholesaler.  He said that certain wholesalers, mainly those in the south of Ireland, are being victimised by the tea distributors.</P>
    <P>He states that sugar is normally distributed at a flat rate and at the same cost throughout the whole of Ireland.  Tea was distributed in like manner, but just prior to the 4th July, when tea came off the ration, certain wholesalers were notified that, in future, there would be an extra charge of 1d. a lb. on tea charged to them as compared to wholesalers in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  He indicated that perhaps it was not without significance that the people who control Tea Importers, Limited, reside in these three particular cities.  He said that the fact that the tea came ex-warehouse from these three cities did not have any bearing on the fact that the extra penny was charged in the other places, because, he said, in Sligo, a reserve of tea had been held up to some time ago and suddenly, and for no apparent reason, that supply was moved.  He also indicated that, in my own town, Dungarvan, and in Waterford, reserve stocks of tea are held, but that still the extra penny must be paid by wholesalers in Waterford.  I feel&mdash; and I have the correspondence to prove &mdash;that his case is correct, and that the Minister should make representations that there should be no discrimination by Tea Importers between the different types of wholesalers.  It is well known that if these wholesalers have to pay increased charges that will be immediately passed on to the consumer.  I feel that the people in Waterford and throughout the rest of Munster have the very same right to have tea as cheaply as the people in Dublin, Limerick or Cork.</P>
    <P>The fact that Córas Iompair Éireann appears to deteriorate, as the Minister says, despite increased charges, is one that all Deputies will regret.  The <Col N="839" /> railways are of such national importance that we cannot measure their use or usefulness by the profit or loss they show.  The men employed, because of the essential work they are doing, which has a bearing on the whole national life, should not be asked to make sacrifices by losing their work, by working short time or by working for a smaller wage than that given to other groups of workers.  I know that, on Friday last, the Minister was discussing policy with the representatives of the trade unions.  I wonder if he would see fit to give the House some of the points on which it is said he advised the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not he advised the trade unions on what he decided to do, but certain papers are carrying certain information.  I suggest that if any outside bodies have got that information from the Minister the same information should be made available to this House, where the final implementation of the Minister's suggestions will have to be carried out. Whatever policy the Minister and the unions agree on, we all hope that it will bring prosperity to the company. Unless you have satisfied and contented people working in that company they will not carry out their duties as they should, irrespective of what policy you pursue.  The workers in Waterford station, one of the most important in Ireland, are being required in the traffic section to work for 9/- a week lesser rate than the people in Limerick, Dublin and Cork.  The resentment they feel will certainly show itself in their work.  I realise the Minister has not a function in this matter but I make the point only to show that the importance of giving a decent rate of pay and decent hours and conditions to our railway workers is not to be measured against a possible profit or loss at the end of the year.  Unless the conditions are satisfactory and pay is reasonable and fair, these workers will and, unfortunately, sometimes do, not only in that industry but in many others, show their resentment by careless work and that shows, in the final analysis, a bigger loss than if decent rates of pay and decent conditions <Col N="840" /> were given to the working people.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that he intends to introduce legislation in connection with the Factories and Workshops Acts.  I welcome that statement.  There is definite need for improvement in the present legislation.  In the industrial revival in the past we have used converted stores and old workhouse buildings and similar structures for starting off factories.  We welcomed that at the time, but the workers who are required to give eight or eight and a half hours per day, day in and day out, for the whole year in these badly ventilated, badly lit old buildings are beginning to find that the strain on their health is terrific.  Many of these old buildings have very poor sanitation. They have practically no wash-up facilities and canteens are very often not available to give a workman a midday meal.  I suggest that much more regular inspection be carried out and that when the Government inspector does call, he not only contact the employer but also the representative of the workers, so that his attention may be drawn to defects that he may not have noticed in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he regretted that a number of industries had gone over to coal-burning, when the Electricity Supply Board could supply them. While I agree with the Minister in that, I would draw his attention to the fact that the Electricity Supply Board sometimes appears to be a very important body and is not subject to advice and does not take kindly to criticism. In the small town of Tallow, where practically every house has electricity installed and where a good many small machines are run from electric current, the Electricity Supply Board have decided that the maintenance man for Tallow shall reside in a town four miles away, with the result that very often when the Sunday dinner is being cooked and a breakdown occurs in the electricity supply they have to telephone to Lismore and wait for perhaps an hour while the serviceman is sent for.  Unfortunately, despite repeated requests from the county council, from Muintir na Tíre and other public bodies, the Electricity <Col N="841" /> Supply Board have absolutely refused to make a local appointment in the town.  There are many qualified people available, but the Electricity Supply Board have refused to deal with the question.  If the Minister has any function, he should recommend, certainly as an encouragement to the people to install as much electricity as possible and use it in every available way, that at least they be given the opportunity of having a man to service the electricity when he is required at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>New legislation for the trade unions is foreshadowed by the Minister. While we in the trade union movement will welcome any progressive legislation, it would be well that no new legislation be enacted without, firstly, a discussion with the representative bodies of the workers and, secondly, without the consent of these bodies, because the trade union movement has fought too hard and too dearly for the rights that they have won to give them up very lightly now.  The rights won by Connolly and Larkin in Dublin, in Cork and in the other cities throughout the rest of Ireland from 1913 onwards were much too dearly won that we would give to anyone these rights unless we were satisfied that it was in the interests of the working people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very attentively to the speech which has just been made by Deputy Kyne. Deputy Kyne drew attention to many detailed grievances but I looked forward to some suggestions that would enable these grievances to be removed and remedied.  Undoubtedly, the Minister, the Government and the country are faced with very many major problems and I feel that the major problems must be considered and solved before it is possible to deal with and solve those minor points that have been referred to in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does strike me that one of the big problems confronting the country is the problem of population.  Is our population big enough to maintain our industries in full work?  I feel that that is one of the big problems that must confront the Minister and the country.  Year by year for over a <Col N="842" /> century the population has been going down.  I think a recent census showed some slight improvement, some stabilisation, but, nevertheless, taking it over a period, there has been a gradual and a continuous reduction in population.  Obviously, if we have not a bigger population to feed, to clothe and to maintain, we will not be able to maintain and keep our industries going.</P>
    <P>Associated with this reduction in population is the problem of emigration which confronts the country, and in respect of which a commission is sitting at the moment and hopes, I understand, to submit its report within a few months.  Every one of us must anxiously await the report of that commission because emigration is a drain of the life blood of the country.  The younger people&mdash;the boys and the girls&mdash;who should be helping to maintain this country, to maintain the older people here, are leaving the country and are increasing the wealth of another country while their great services are lost to us at home.  I think that the Minister, the Government and every person who is anxious for the well-being of this country must give serious attention to the solution of the problems that are posed by this decrease of population and by the increase in emigration.</P>
    <P>Associated with that is the other problem mentioned by Deputy Kyne&mdash; the problem of the drift, as it were, from the land to the cities.  We have in Dublin, the capital city, an increasing population.  My view is&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that nothing can stop the growth of Dublin, and that within the foreseeable future there will be a population in Dublin of 1,000,000 people. That tendency to drift from the land into the cities and the towns is not peculiar to Ireland.  In all small countries in the world there is that tendency at present and for some time past to go to the cities.</P>
    <P>Many people bewail that fact, and many suggestions have been made that there should be some decentralisation of industry, that Government Departments should be sent out of Dublin and distributed round the country.  That again presents new problems that have not obviously been considered by the <Col N="843" /> people who made the suggestions.  For a long time it was the general idea that if you could increase agricultural production you could increase employment on the land, and thereby prevent this drift to the city, but modern machinery has more than offset the increase in employment that increased agricultural production should mean.</P>
    <P>Those, to my mind, are the problems that the Minister, the Government and the country must face in the near future.  I think that the combined wisdom of this Dáil and of all citizens interested in the welfare of the country should be devoted to a consideration of and a solution for those problems.  If emigration means, as it does, unemployment, then an effort should be made to stop emigration.</P>
    <P>Emigration can be stopped only if a policy of full employment at decent rates of wages is adopted.  The operation of such a policy would necessitate very hard work, not only on the part of the Government, but on the part of the trade unions.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in the way of adopting a policy of full employment is the regrettable cleavage in our trade unions.  This is a small country with a population of approximately three million.  Our organised trade unionists are split into two sections, one known as the Congress of Irish Unions and the other as the Trade Union Congress.  While I agree with what Deputy Kyne has said in regard to the rights of trade unions, trade unionists as a whole must face up now to new responsibilities, the first of which is to bring unity into the trade union movement.  Within the trade union movement there is outstanding ability.  Undoubtedly, the trade unions can supply solutions for many of the problems that confront us but they can do that only if they are united in their efforts and determination to do it.  They cannot do it while they are divided as they are.</P>
    <P>The disunity that exists at the moment, in my view, hinders industrial development.  Without industrial development we cannot have full employment and without full employment <Col N="844" /> we cannot increase our population or bring about the ideal conditions here which we ought to have.</P>
    <P>I cannot do much more in this debate than draw attention to that important matter and to request the Minister to use all his efforts, as I know he has been doing for years, to bring an end to the disunity in the trade union movement that has such serious effects for the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne and other speakers have referred to the position in Córas Iompair Éireann.  Undoubtedly it is very serious.  During the past week dismissal notices have been issued to quite a number of employees of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I hope those notices will not be put into effect, because dismissals in any industry at the moment will lead to emigration, as alternative employment is not available here. Dismissals would be serious.</P>
    <P>Each and every one of us must face up to the fact that rail traffic, particularly passenger rail traffic, is no longer popular.  People travel by rail now only when they cannot travel by any other way.  It was suggested recently that there should be an air service to Killarney and an air service to Cork. I agree that there should be such air services.  But, if we had an efficient and adequate air service to Killarney and to Cork, as we would have if we established such an air service at all, nobody would travel by train from Dublin to either of these places.  There does exist the competition that has been referred to between the buses and the railway.  That cannot be avoided. People want the bus services which bring them to their doors.  It is regrettable that they will not travel a mile, two miles or three miles, as the case may be, to a railway station and take a train.  They will not do it, and they cannot be compelled to do it.  In view of that position, I think the Minister has acted very wisely in consulting the trade unions that cater for employees of Córas Iompair Éireann, because their combined wisdom must help to solve the very serious problem that confronts the Minister.</P>
    <P>I had intended in the few remarks I am making on this Estimate to deal at some length with tourism.  On reflection, <Col N="845" /> I think it is just as well that what I had intended to say should be left unsaid for the present.  A really serious effort is being made to expand our tourist industry.  The proposed festival of 1953 will result in a very large number of people coming to Ireland at a time when, as a general rule, we have not visitors here.  Local authorities are being asked by the Tourist Board and by the organisers of the festival to co-operate in every way to make it a success.  The organisers have in mind something very different from the Festival of Britain.  They have in mind something that will bring to the forefront many of the cultural aspects of our nation.  Historical events will be re-enacted by means of pageantry and otherwise.  It is hoped that this will result in drawing across the sea many friends of this country&mdash; people who left their homes years ago and families of people who left years ago&mdash;to see the places about which they heard and to meet the people whom they knew or about whom they heard their parents speak.  If local authorities in Dublin and throughout the country co-operate with the organising committee and if this new national festival receives the publicity abroad which it ought to receive, I feel we can look forward to a great improvement in the tourist industry next year.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the group of Estimates before the House, the Minister's responsibilities are many and varying, but each one of them touches some important aspect of Irish life.  It seems to me that the tone of the present debate may be summarised as a genuine attempt by members of the House to appreciate the efforts of the Minister and to assure him of their full co-operation in dealing with the many difficult matters with which he has to deal as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cowan has stated, industry and commerce are of considerable importance to the House and to the country.  In introducing his Estimate, the Minister quite rightly devoted a considerable length of his speech to a survey of the industrial <Col N="846" /> position of the country, and of the conditions that obtained during the past 12 months.  In my view, any Deputy listening to the Minister's speech would draw from it a rather depressing view of industrial and commercial conditions in this country.  It is true the Minister referred to new industrial projects which have reached the production stage, and that he was slightly optimistic with regard to work under the Undeveloped Areas Act but, generally speaking, his account with regard to the conditions obtaining in this country in the last 12 months was a depressing one.</P>
      <P>I feel that one must discuss the Minister's speech in relation to his policy and to the policy of his Government. In discussing it from that point of view one cannot dissociate from it the general financial policy of the Government and its impact on this country's trade and commerce.  The Government's general financial policy has a very important bearing on the economic conditions of the nation.  I do not seek to suggest that the present serious trade recession in this country has all been due to the incompetence of the present Government.  I do not think that such a suggestion would be fair to the present Minister and to the members of the present Government. However, I do think that much of the harm caused by the present trade recession was avoidable, and that it could have been avoided if the Government, when it assumed office 13 months ago, had any settled conviction or policy.  I feel that many of the ills of which business people complain to-day in this country are attributable to the fact that, during the last 13 months, the present Government has had a policy like the veering flaw that blew in one direction one minute and in another direction the next minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a trade recession began to become apparent in the summer of last year, when money began to become scarce, when business activity began to decrease and when all the signs of a trade recession were visible, one would expect that that would have been the time for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be hopeful and determined in combating such an incipient recession in trade. <Col N="847" /> That is the sort of lead that this House expects from the individual Deputy charged with the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is well known that many recessions in trade in different countries have been averted and their effects avoided by a determined lead from the Government of the day, whether that lead showed itself by means of a public works programme or something of that kind.  It is quite true that a trade slump can be avoided, or its effects reduced, if there is a Government in power that knows its business.  It is regrettable to have to state in this House, while discussing this Estimate, that the present Government and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce have shown no evidence, during the past 12 months, of knowing their own or anyone else's business.  When this trade recession became apparent last summer, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce stumped around the country telling everyone that they were overspending, making into panic any feeling of anxiety that the people might have, endeavouring deliberately to create a feeling of insecurity and alarm with regard to the individual spending of the people who comprise the population.</P>
    <P>That campaign, initiated by the Minister for Finance in June 1951 and carried on by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, magnified out of all proportion the effects of the trade recession.  I do not think that, looking back on the past 12 months, there can be any doubt that these speeches and that campaign caused irreparable damage to the trade and commerce of the country.</P>
    <P>The fault would have been grievous if that had been done out of ignorance. One cannot afford to have an ignorant person as a Minister of our Government, but the fact is that this campaign was not carried on out of ignorance.  It was initiated with a political motive, to try to suggest, contrary to the facts, that the economic <Col N="848" /> and financial policy of the Government's predecessors was not a sound one.  That was the political motif of this disastrous campaign indulged in by the Government during the past 12 or 13 months.</P>
    <P>They know well, as the people know, that warnings were given to them by the Opposition in August, September, October and November of last year with regard to the harm and damage they were doing.  These warnings were not heeded.  Deputies will recollect that, in the fall of last year, the Opposition had to go to the length of proposing here what was in effect a motion of no confidence in the Government by reason of the campaign to which I have referred.  But nevertheless, the campaign was continued, and here, at the end of 12 or 13 months, we, as representatives of the people, have to consider the results of this unfortunate campaign on the business life of this community during the 12 months that have passed.</P>
    <P>It is a little Gilbertian that this debate should have been introduced by the Minister the day after he made a speech to the Drapers' Chamber of Commerce, in which he struck a new note, in urging the people, whom he had been telling for the past 12 months that they were overspending, to spend more money on the purchase of drapery goods.  What effect did he think would be created by that speech of his last week, coming, as it did, at the end of 13 months of banshee wailings by certain members of the Government? What evidence does that give to the people that the Government has any policy, good, bad or indifferent, with regard to these important matters?  It illustrates clearly that Government policy is stated by different Ministers according to the condition of their liver when they get up in the morning.  Ten days ago the Minister's liver suggested that he should state that the people were spending too little and that they should go out and empty their pockets in the drapery shops of this city.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the four or five Deputies responsible for the continuance in office of this Government can have any easy consciences with <Col N="849" /> regard to the conditions now obtaining in this country.  After some 12 months of strictures by the Minister for Finance and other Minister to the effect that each individual was spending too much, and after the introduction of a Budget which sought to restrict compulsorily the spending of wage earners and other people in the country, we have it all capped by the Minister appealing to the people to spend whatever farthings or pence they may have left.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that conduct or these speeches can give any assurance to Deputies or to the country that the country is well governed at the moment.  Having referred to that, one can only be regretful that the ill-effects that followed that campaign should now be a problem which the House has to discuss.  The campaign in the past 12 months has caused unemployment; it has caused bankruptcy and insolvency for many business people; it has caused short time for men who are still lucky enough to hold down a job; it has caused suffering and hardship and has substantially increased emigration.  These are the problems which we now have to discuss in considering this Estimate.  I do not say that some unemployment might not have taken place, even if an inter-Party Government were in power, nor that some business recession would not have been experienced, but I say that the unemployment which the country has experienced in the past 12 months has been magnified and aggravated as a result of Government action, and I say the same with regard to the recession in trade.</P>
    <P>We are now in a situation in which we have more unemployment than we have had during any period in the past quarter of a century, and more emigration than we had during the worst years of the war, together with less business than at any time since the State was formed.  These are the problems we have to discuss, and we have one of the main architects of the Government, Deputy Cowan, coming in to discuss that problem, with the suggestion that the first thing we have to do, before we get industries and a proper commercial life in the country, is to stop <Col N="850" /> emigration.  I should have thought that one thing we have learned since this State was formed&mdash;and if we have not learned it, the past 12 months should have taught it to us very clearly&mdash;is that the only way you can shape up to stopping emigration is by providing alternative employment and an alternative way of life here at home. You cannot stop emigration by anything else.</P>
    <P>Emigration, however, is a problem which has assumed very serious proportions during the last few months. It is rather a coincidence that with the assumption of office of the present Government the obtaining of reliable figures in relation to emigration has become an impossibility.  Up to 13th June last year it was possible for members of the then Opposition to elicit by parliamentary question the yearly figures&mdash;indeed at times the quarterly figures&mdash;for emigration, but since the present Government assumed office and the present Taoiseach went out tilting at windmills like Don Quixote last August on the subject of emigration all emigration figures have ceased.  Now if you ask a question of the Taoiseach regarding emigration figures for the last 12 months you will be told, as was told the other day, that it is now impossible to give them. So well it may be impossible because, as members of the Government and in particular the Minister are aware, the flight from Ireland during the last 12 months has been far in excess of anything the country has experienced in recent years and it is not getting any better.  Down in my constituency important industries have been compelled &mdash;I assume by business requirements&mdash; to lay off or put on short time skilled operatives.  You will find that when the recession ends, if it does end, these operatives will no longer be available for the service of the industries in which they were once employed.  When you are out of work in Ireland under a Fianna Fáil Government with high food prices and high taxes you sail, you gather together your passage and get out of the country.  There is no alternative and if the Government think that people who find themselves suddenly unemployed can afford to kick their heels for a couple of months <Col N="851" /> waiting for conditions to improve they are very much mistaken.  The cost of living in Ireland is far too high for that and, accordingly, hand in hand with the harm the present Minister and the Government have done to trade and commerce during the last 12 months has gone the increase in emigration.</P>
    <P>I am prompted to refer to&mdash;and spend some time on&mdash;the problem of the cost of living because I noted one remarkable omission from the Minister's speech.  On this Estimate in 1948, 1949 and 1950 and indeed on other occasions in 1951 I listened to the Minister, then a member of the Opposition, devoting a considerable amount of his energy and time to the problem of the cost of living.  He sought to suggest that the inter-Party Government was taking no effective action to curb rising prices.  He and his Party while in opposition availed of this debate and the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill to suggest that only by them could prices be properly controlled. Deputies will recollect the onslaught made on Deputy Cosgrave two years ago with regard to the problem of rising prices.</P>
    <P>The whole effect of the action of the Fianna Fáil Party while in opposition was to suggest to the people of the country that they, and they alone, were capable of controlling prices and tackling the problem of the cost of living.  They suggested, time and again, that whatever increases might have taken place after the outbreak of the Korean war in the price of the commodities our people had to buy could have been avoided by the inter-Party Government.  It was no use for Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Morrissey or anyone else to point out the increase in the cost of imported raw materials as a result of the rearmament in Europe and the outbreak of war in Korea.  That was of no use to the Fianna Fáil Party.  They still suggested again and again that the inter-Party Government could have avoided the few increases&mdash;and they were very few &mdash;which took place in prices after September, 1950.  What they left unsaid in this House was said very clearly on the cross-roads throughout <Col N="852" /> the country.  All Deputies recollect the propaganda and campaign in connection with rising prices.  I think that Deputies will also recollect Fianna Fáil's campaign during the general election of 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Administration must be considered in relation to the statement of Government policy, and that is what I am endeavouring to do.  All Deputies appreciate that the present Government assured the people of the country that they would implement a policy designed at price control.  That was done time and time again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I think it is proper that we should now consider how far, if at all, that policy has been carried out.  One of the first actions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to decontrol meat and decontrol bacon.  I recollect that when meat was decontrolled an optimistic cheery note was issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to all the women of Ireland. It was contained in the ordinary official departmental announcement of the Minister's decontrolling of meat, and was to the effect that the decontrol of meat would mean that meat would cost less.  I should like to know from the Minister whether that optimistic note has been justified in the last 12 months. The same suggestion was made when bacon was decontrolled within the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>All Deputies are aware that in fact the prices of these commodities have increased and that people now have to pay more by reason of decontrol for these essential foodstuffs.  I suggest that the Minister decontrolled meat and bacon because he was afraid to face up to his responsibilities in that matter.  He decontrolled meat because he had present to his mind the attack and the onslaught made on his predecessor during three and a half years by those interested in an increase in the price of meat.  He was not going to place himself in that situation.  Therefore he decontrolled meat and said that it would result in a fall in the price of meat.  I do not think that that is the type of conduct which the people of the country are entitled to expect from a Minister responsible for the control of prices.  Again in relation to the action taken by the Minister in the last six months with regard to the price of milk in rural areas, the Minister showed that he was not going to take the responsibility of doing his job because he allowed the price of milk supplied to towns and villages to be fixed by the suppliers' association themselves.  I do not think that that shows any evidence of a sense of ministerial responsibility by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months, the country has experienced a series of decontrols by the Minister.  Anything awkward <Col N="854" /> that had to be faced up to, he washed his hands of it and removed all control. He said, of course, that free competition and the ordinary rules of supply and demand would bring about a fall in prices.  Accordingly, we are discussing here 12 months later a situation far different from what the Minister found when he took up the office.  The cost of living has increased substantially in the last 12 months because of direct Government policy.  As a result of Government action, or lack of action, in the last 12 months many price increases have now to be faced by the consumer. Because of that, it is not unreasonable that the Opposition should complain and complain bitterly of the lack of policy of the present Government in the last 12 months, having experienced the vicious campaign conducted without reason and without excuse by the present Government when in opposition.  They have fallen down on the job.  Clearly in the last 12 months, they have made no attempt to help the people to fight the problem of rising prices.  On the contrary, the present Minister has tried to convince the people that clothing prices will not fall and that therefore they must accept the inevitable and pay whatever price is now being sought to be charged.</P>
    <P>If the present Minister were speaking from this side of the House on this important problem of rising prices and the cost of living he would tell his opposite number that his job was to fight for the people against rising prices, and that if he did not fight he was not doing his job.  That is the kind of speech one learned to expect from the Minister when he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  Now we find that his actions in Government are quite the other way.</P>
    <P>I also noticed from the Minister's speech a remarkable lack of attention by him to a matter that used to figure largely in his speeches as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and that is the problem of hand-won turf.  The walls of this House used to resound for weeks and months from 1948 to 1951 with complaints about the conditions of the hand-won producer, and the suggestion was made, spitefully and, <Col N="855" /> indeed, maliciously, by certain members of the Party opposite in 1948 and 1949, and indeed even in 1950, that the inter-Party Government were out to kill the hand-won turf industry.  The producers of hand-won turf, certainly in the Midlands, the part of the country that I represent, experienced in 1950 and the early part of 1951 a measure of prosperity which they had never experienced before because of the policy and the action of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Now, 12 months later, let us examine the position.  The Minister has given an assurance that if there is any hand-won turf left unsold after next winter, the Government will buy it.  I should like to tell him that the Government is going to have to buy an awful lot of turf because, despite the efforts of the marketing section of Bord na Móna&mdash;a section established by the Minister's predecessor&mdash;in fact, the bottom has fallen out of the hand-won turf market.  There is the greatest lack of knowledge on the producers' part with regard to where possible markets can be found.  We used to be assured by Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party that there was no difficulty at all in putting hand-won turf production on a proper basis to assure every producer of a clear market with expanding prices.  Suggestions of that kind were made here time and time again.  Now we find that the hand-won turf industry is in the doldrums. There is no lead given to those who produce, no real effort made to convince them that they are producing a worth-while article, an article that will find a ready market in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in that connection, made a passing reference to the fact that, in the Midlands, many institutions had turned over to oil fuel.  That is perfectly true.  In the last 12 months much of that market, which might have been available for hand-won turf, has been destroyed by the change over to oil as a fuel.  I should like to know what has the Minister been doing about it.  Many of the institutions that are now burning oil, when they should be burning hand-won turf, are under the control of the Government.  I am told that even the <Col N="856" /> building we are in now is heated by oil.  It is in those circumstances that we are entitled to know from the Minister what action he has taken in the last 12 months to stop this kind of conversion.  It is very little use coming to this House after the conversion has taken place to express the Government's sorrow.  That is not going to sell a sod of hand-won turf. I think that in view of the campaign we experienced here in the last three years the Minister will have to go a little further than that kind of expression of sorrow on the conversion to oil burning that has taken place.</P>
    <P>One has to appreciate that the condition of the hand-won turf industry to-day is caused by competition from alternative fuels and one of the greatest competitors with the producer's hand-won turf industry is Bord na Móna.  I should like to know from the Minister whether any action will be taken in the next 12 months to ensure that Bord na Móna machine-won turf will not continue as a competitor to hand-won turf.  Again there is very little use for the Minister in introducing his Estimate to express apprehension on that score. The fact is that for the last 12 months much of the market for turf that would have been available to the hand-won turf producer has been absorbed by turf produced and sold by Bord na Móna.  The other competitor, and of course the more serious, is coal.  I do not know whether we shall ever reach the day in this country when our domestic fuel will be turf only and when it will be accepted by our people, not because of necessity, not because of direction but because of knowledge and appreciation of the value of turf as a domestic fuel.  Apparently that day is still very distant.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that many of the opportunities that we were given in the last two years for the education of our people in relation to turf as a fuel should have been mishandled.  However, the fact remains that to-day the great menace to the turf industry as a domestic fuel is coal.  I know that it is a very large problem and I am certainly not going to pass any strictures <Col N="857" /> on the Government in relation to its policy in that direction, but while I am on the subject of coal I should like to know from the Minister whether any effort can be made to maintain the country's production of low-grade coal at present levels.  I am told that much of the low-grade coal produced here is now unsold by reason of the excessive imports in recent months of Welsh anthracite coal.  That appears to me to be an avoidable situation. It should not be difficult to ensure for the limited production of low-grade coal that we have in this country a domestic market.  I should like to know from the Minister what the policy of his Department will be in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the Industrial Development Authority. Judging from his remarks in relation to that authority, one must come to the conclusion that he now appreciates the benefit of that authority and the justification for its establishment by the inter-Party Government.  The Industrial Development Authority was the target for considerable attack by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Its abolition was to be one of his first actions if he were again Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is consoling to know that those bold words of his were not put into practice, and that, as a result of his forbearance in that direction, the country will have the benefit, shortly, of at least five new industries.  I think that the Minister's speech, in relation to the Industrial Development Authority, can be regarded as the greatest justification for the policy of his predecessor in this connection.</P>
    <P>Another body, which the Minister was going to abolish overnight when he got back into office, was the Prices Advisory Body.  I have had some hard things to say in relation to the Government's lack of policy on the control of prices, but I do not think that any words of mine could praise sufficiently the work and the activities of the Prices Advisory Body during the last 12 months.  The work of that council has been the only ray of sunshine in the confusion created by the present Government's policy.  I think <Col N="858" /> that the Minister's mind should incline him to state that he now agrees that the establishment of the Prices Advisory Body was a very good step taken by the previous Government.  Its justification has been the confidence that the people have in its work and in its activities.  I am certain that, were it not for the work of that body in the last 12 months, the situation in connection with prices could have been very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>The other matter that I want to refer to is the question of transport.  The Minister did not give the House any clear indication as to what the Government's plans and policies are going to be in relation to transport. In the last few days he did, apparently, meet representatives of the different unions and discussed the matter with them.  If one is to judge from announcements contained in certain British papers the Minister proposes a drastic curtailment of the private haulage industry.  I would like to know whether these rumours do, in fact, represent the intentions of the Government. I know that some of those proposals were contained, as recommendations, in the Milne Report.  If they were put into operation, or were seriously proposed as Government policy, one would have to consider very carefully the damage that might be done to certain industries and businesses in the country.  I recognise, as most Deputies do, the serious financial condition of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Presumably, that financial condition can be improved by compelling every concern to use Córas Iompair Éireann.  If, by law, you prevent people from using any means of transport except that provided by Córas Iompair Éireann, then, presumably, Córas Iompair Éireann will earn more money and, possibly, pay its way.</P>
    <P>That seems a rather crude way of achieving one's purpose when one recognises that to-day, in relation to the use of Córas Iompair Éireann, the Government sets no good example, and I do not mean particularly this Government.  I would like to know how many military movements are carried out by rail or by using Córas Iompair Éireann, and how much of the rural electrification machinery and poles that <Col N="859" /> are being sent all over the country are dispatched by rail?  I would like to know how much of the beet from the Midlands and other parts of the country is dispatched by rail.  These are important industries.  The freight used by the Army, the sugar company, the Electricity Supply Board and other semi-State bodies would represent a considerable measure of business for Córas Iompair Éireann.  So far as I know&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;all these semi-State bodies provide and use their own transport for the carriage of the goods and materials they require to use.  I think that if any restriction on the liberty of ordinary business people, and on the ordinary licensed hauliers is being considered by the Government, the Government should first consider doing something in relation to these semi-State bodies.  I do not think that it would mean a lot of inconvenience if a number of Army lorries were put into a garage with a padlock on them.  It would not throw this country open to invasion if, when soldiers have to travel, as they occasionally have, from Islandbridge to the Curragh, they went by rail instead of going in five or six Army lorries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If not, I certainly pass from it.  May I make one passing reference to that?  We have been told and, of course, we recognise in relation to the maintenance of our rail communications, the military importance of them to the country.  That is one of the reasons advanced for maintaining our railway system at all costs.  Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that, if the maintenance of our railway system has that military importance, there should be a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the military authorities.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to cover as many matters as I could in relation to this Estimate.  May I conclude by saying that the Minister has not convinced us that things are well for the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 12 months he has not shown the consistent policy which this country is entitled to expect from its <Col N="860" /> Government.  On the contrary, he and other Minister have shown diverse policies in a very short space of time. The result has been the creation of marked confusion in the minds of our people.  They feel that it is extraordinary that, in the middle of a very bad slump, their Government, in effect, stops them from buying not merely by methods such as were taken in the Budget but also by exhortations from responsible Ministers to spend less and to economise.  Naturally, business people feel confused on that score. Their confusion is worse confounded by the recent exhortation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, after all, the best thing to do is to spend more.  All that has meant, in the past 12 months, an exaggeration of a condition that, perhaps, could not have been avoided, but the harm that has come from the trade recession has, in large measure, been an avoidable harm.  The trouble is that, in the past 12 months, we had not in power a Government with a clear and decisive policy.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to refer again to other matters illustrating the lack of policy of the Government.  After 12 months of Fianna Fáil Government, the position in this country now is that there is less work, less business, higher prices and increased emigration.  The facts themselves&mdash;known to all members of this House and to the people generally&mdash;point clearly to the implementation of a wrong policy and that, in its turn, points to a bad Government. I only hope that the harm which has been done in the past 12 months has now reached its limit and that, in the coming year, if the present Government are still in office, some consistent policy will be followed so that we shall not be told one day that we are spending too much and the next day that we are not spending enough.  I hope that, in the course of the next 12 months, the Minister will reassess the position with regard to prices.  I hope that he will recognise that the House expects him to face up to his responsibility to control and curb, if possible, rising prices&mdash;and that cannot be done in the present situation by a decontrol of the prices of commodities.</P>
    <P>The lesson which we should all <Col N="861" /> have learned since 1939 is that while price control is not perfect and may, in many instances, not be effective it is the only weapon a Government can use to maintain some stability in prices.  In unsettled world conditions, the decontrol of prices means considerable price variations and generally of an upward trend.  I hope that, in the coming year, the Government will review the matter of price control and that we shall see in operation some of the brave and grand promises which the Fianna Fáil Party made while in opposition.  I hope also that in the coming year some measure of control will be brought to bear in respect of the prices of essential foodstuffs. If that is not done the people, and business people in particular, can look forward to unsettled trade conditions which will be worsened by unsettled labour conditions.  Strikes will undoubtedly continue to occur unless and until the Government take some action to maintain the value of the workers' wages.  That is not a very alluring prospect but it is the only prospect before us if the present lack of Government action is allowed to continue.  The present situation in relation to the value of wages and the value of money is as serious as any this country has had to face in the past 12 years.  The fact that there is not a war does not mean that a fall in the value of wages by way of rising prices will not cause harm.  Undoubtedly harm will be caused and the people expect the Government to take some action in the matter immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the position of Córas Iompair Éireann, with particular reference to the conversations and discussions which took place last Friday between the Minister and the representatives of the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would give way to nobody in the House in appreciation of the Minister's approach to the unions in consultations with regard to matters of crisis and difficulty and particularly with reference to a national industry but, in this case, I wonder if the Minister's approach was of the wisest <Col N="862" /> character and likely to get the best results.  In the first place, one would be inclined to think that matters of policy and legislation could more fittingly be disclosed in this House of elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>Representatives of every union who had members in Córas Iompair Éireann were, I understand, called together by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He outlined his plans but when he was asked about the dismissals which are taking place at the moment the Minister said that that is a matter of administration by the company. That is the information which we have got from the Press.  The Minister said he was talking of policy.  It is not easy to expect representatives of trade unions&mdash;some of whose men are under notice of dismissal&mdash;to assimilate matters of policy especially when they cannot elicit a reply to a question about those dismissals or about their proposed extent.  The Minister took the line that that was not a policy matter.  I find it difficult to understand how the Minister can differentiate between policy and dismissals on a wide scale.  The policy in 1947 of the then Fianna Fáil Government, in conjunction with the company, was one of wholesale dismissals. It was expected that 2,500 men would be affected by the closing down of branch lines, the putting of men on short time and dismissals generally.  It was current at that time that there were about 2,500 men to lose their employment but on the coming into power of the inter-Party Government and when Deputy Morrissey became Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Government took a hand in shaping policy.  There is no question about that.  The net result was that such retrenchments as were considered necessary to be made by the company were to be got by retirement at the age limit and by deaths.  That seemed to be a rather slow method for securing reductions in the staff but I was rather surprised to learn within the last few days that 3,000 men have been dropped from the company's service by that process in about four years. The number employed has been reduced in that period from 22,000 to 19,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> That was a big reduction, and no one could conceive it possible to obtain such a reduction in that space of time, but that information has been conveyed to me from the railway company.  The information was obtained by some of the union representatives who came as a deputation to the Minister last Friday.  They gave me and other Deputies in the House last Thursday information which they got from the company in discussions the day before, that the amount of retrenchment involved was 3,000, a reduction from 22,000 to 19,000 employees.</P>
    <P>Evidently that reduction is not considered drastic enough, and now retrenchment by the method of wholesale dismissals is going to be put into operation.  If the Minister must take drastic steps to put the company on a solvent basis, I do suggest that he might embrace the question of dismissals in his policy.  I cannot see how he can divorce them.  It is difficult to imagine how the company can keep sacking on the one hand and the Minister keep talking on the other.  I do not believe that any progress can be made with the unions if they cannot get some assurance in regard to dismissals, an assurance that will steady the nerves of the members of those unions.  There is trepidation in the minds of the men.  Rumours in this connection are spreading.  I do not know if there is any foundation for them, but information has been conveyed to several of the trade unions that steps in that direction are about to take place.  If this sentence has been given to the employees, that may lead to anything.  Talk has been going on in the various shops&mdash;I speak about Limerick particularly, but it has also happened in Cork, Tralee and elsewhere. They are going to worry as to what is going to happen next if some authoritative statement is not made and if they have no idea as to the extent to which dismissals are likely to take place.  I can assure the Minister that when the trade union representatives came up for the discussions the dominant idea in their minds was to obtain some information <Col N="864" /> from the Minister as to when and where the dismissals are going to stop. If the figures which I have quoted here are correct, that they have succeeded in holding 3,000 people less in employment than there were four years ago by the process not of dismissal but of ordinary retirement and death, I think that method ought to be considered. You are not going to make the company solvent by dismissals alone.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned here by Deputy Davin and others there are very big schemes of co-ordination that must be put into operation if Córas Iompair Éireann is to survive and attempt to pay its way.  That aim is not going to be achieved by wholesale slashing of the staff.  There must be some bigger approach and some bigger outlook, a putting of heads together so as to get the road and rail service put into a better system of co-ordination in order to make the company solvent.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful and anxious that further discussions will take place between the Minister and the trade unions&mdash;I have always been anxious to encourage that&mdash;but if he is to get the best from those discussions, the line of approach ought to be somewhat different from that of last Friday.  The Minister stated that he is only concerned with policy and legislation.  If he wishes a successful outcome to the discussions there is no use in telling them that.  The trade unions are not interested in legislation.  They are more interested in the dismissal of the men whom they represent.  I do not believe it is a good approach for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I am not in a position to say anything about dismissals.  The company does the sacking and I do the talking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would suggest that before the next deputation comes to the Minister he ought to take a hand with the company and suggest that as he is taking steps which we all hope will be for the betterment and improvement of Córas Iompair Éireann, this can be achieved without such drastic action as the wholesale dismissal of employees which seems to be under consideration at the moment.  I think they should attempt to carry on with their staffs <Col N="865" /> until the plans the Minister has to put before the Dáil in the form of legislation come into effect.</P>
    <P>If the figures I have given are correct&mdash;I have had them conveyed to me at second hand&mdash;it is evident that, if they were able to reduce the staff by 3,000 in four years, otherwise than by dismissals, in another six months there will be a further reduction due to retirements at 65 years.  I believe that the company should be able to reach a solvent position without resorting to those dismissals.  Furthermore, it would create a better atmosphere with the trade unions and there would be more co-operation from the union leaders who would give helpful suggestions and advice if they were not coming with the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.</P>
    <P>There has been great disappointment and alarm amongst the ranks within the last couple of weeks.  The whisper got around that there were going to be large scale dismissals. There were 17 at Limerick, ten at Cork and so on and that was how the rumours started.  I would appeal to the Minister in the interests of the company and of his future plans to do something to set the minds of the men at rest and to talk to the company.  I would ask him not to allow the company to take such drastic action, but to give an opportunity to the Minister's legislative proposals to improve the service of Córas Iompair Éireann for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, in dealing with this Estimate, to consider it on broad general principles rather than deal with it from the narrow approach adopted by many other Deputies to whom I have listened.  It would appear to me that, first of all, in discussing the whole question of industrialisation in Ireland, and even in offering suggestions or criticisms to Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, it might be presumptuous, in so far as the present Minister more than any other Deputy&mdash;and I think both sides would concede that point&mdash; has been responsible for the degree of industrialisation which has taken place in Ireland up to the present.  At least <Col N="866" /> he has certainly made the most significant contribution.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that he fully appreciates the very considerable responsibility which rests with him just at this phase in the economic development of Ireland in so far as it is largely on his shoulders will rest the success of the Government policy in attempting to cope with the problem, which is beset with dangers for the country, dangers in the line of employment, emigration and the economic subjection associated with bankruptcy.  Deputy Lemass, in the Department of Industry and Commerce, must make a really outstanding success of his Department if we are going to meet the very serious challenge to our community in the next ten to 20 years.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that he shares this burden with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  Having considered the possibilities in industry and in agriculture, depressing though agriculture is and has been, the only conclusion one can arrive at is that there is very little real hope that agriculture will answer this challenge.  It now rests, therefore, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to so gear up industry as to make it possible for us to compete in world markets in the industrial field.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister, in particular, must appreciate that, largely to the credit of the Minister, we have ended one phase in the industrialisation of our country. Following on the acceptance by the Government here of the status of the kitchen garden supplying the manor house and buying from them industrial products at whatever price they chose to sell, the Minister took over the establishment of industries in order to ensure that we would, at any rate, be self-sufficient in relation to our own daily requirements.  He achieved his object by a somewhat curious mixture of private enterprise and State-sponsored companies.  Great as that achievement is, it is now an accepted fact, and the time has come when the tremendous challenge of the future must be faced and overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest challenge has, of course, arisen as a result of the high <Col N="867" /> degree of mechanisation in industry the world over.  Our industries are capable of supplying the home market and we must now consider the possibility of competing in the world markets with long-established industries, protected in the countries of their origin by various tariffs and quotas. This will be a very formidable undertaking. In order to understand its full impact, we need only study the British problem, where the people have unlimited supplies of the raw materials of industry, namely, iron and coal, easily accessible and relatively cheap. We have only to study the struggle between labour and capital in the forward step of an aggressive Labour Government in the post-war years in Britain.  Due to stress of world competition, the industrialists in Great Britain are now finding it practically impossible to hold their markets.  They cannot compete against the cheap labour in Japan or the competent and efficient labour of Germany, and the country is gradually being forced back into an internal economy, in which neither Great Britain nor the United States of America can accept and hold their present standard.</P>
    <P>The problem of competing in world markets, therefore, presents a very formidable challenge to a relatively young country such as ours.  It might be opportune for the Minister now to consider a number of general problems in relation to this Department. I think it was Deputy Breanndán Mac Fheórais who drew attention to the tremendous volume and scope of the work attaching to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I always had great sympathy with my former colleague, Deputy Morrissey, in attempting to cope with the responsibilities placed upon him.  The Department does not require additional Parliamentary Secretaries.  It could indeed be easily divided into three Departments&mdash;industry, tourism and transport.  For the life of me I cannot understand how any one man can cope with the work of this Department at the present time, despite some delegated responsibility through the medium of State sponsored <Col N="868" /> companies and so on.  The Minister has to cope single-handed with all the intricacies of this Department, including such things as the desirability of imposing odd tariffs and quota restrictions and all the other routine details that could perhaps be delegated to a Parliamentary Secretary once a general decision on policy has been taken.  The Minister is facing a very serious crisis in the development of the State.  The task that lies ahead is a very formidable one and if it is to be tackled and successfully consummated, as we all hope it will be, the Minister must be given more time and relieved of many of the responsibilities he has at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest faith in the Minister and my assessment of him is based not so much on promise as on performance.  In my view, judged on the test of achievement, he stands alone.  The problem of greater industrialisation requires serious consideration.  This whole question of prices is one of the Minister's problems.  There has been a considerable rise in prices generally&mdash; naturally, in the price of food, because of the removal of the subsidies, but also in the retail price of textiles.  The present situation seems, to a casual observer&mdash;and I have no intimate knowledge of it&mdash;to be rather serious, in so far as there has been a recession in buying, a buyers' strike.  That is the apparent immediate result of a slight panic on the part of traders generally, who have marked down their prices fairly considerably.  The fact that a person has marked down a shirt from 37/- to £1 and apparently is still making a profit and still satisfies the Prices Section of the Department has caused a considerable degree of suspicion to enter the minds of the people as to the efficacy of the Prices Section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other result of this buyers' strike must naturally be a trading slump and the laying off of workers in shops and industries.  That again, as everyone knows, will cause an extension of the buyers' strike and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>, <Col N="869" /> with the inevitable end in a complete trade slump.  I wonder if the Minister agrees that that is the situation and if so whether he has any other solution than the suggestion he made to the people to buy now because prices will not fall any more.  I am afraid that, so far, that advice has not been taken, whether it is because people do not believe that the prices will not fall any more or because they simply have not got the money to buy.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to this aspect of prices.  One of the troubles of being in Government and being surrounded by either friends or enemies is that you find it very difficult to know what is the truth.  If I might class myself as an independent observer of these things, I would assure the Minister that in relation to prices generally neither the Prices Section nor the Prices Tribunal have the faith of the people throughout the country at the moment.  I would like to say this, for fear I might be considered as attempting to be derogatory to the civil servants of his Department&mdash;I am one of the few people who are very great admirers of the Civil Service generally and certain civil servants in particular&mdash;I do not think it is any lack of anxious intention on the part of the civil servants to try to find out the truth in these matters that has brought about the position but rather that the Prices Section appear to &ldquo;have had their eye wiped&rdquo; over the years by the industrialists.  One of the occasions when I experienced worry as a Minister was when I was praised in public at great length by R.G.D.A.T.A. and on another occasion&mdash;that is a long time ago&mdash;by the Medical Association.  One of the first things I did on going back to the Department was to inquire what we had done that was wrong since it was quite obvious to me that neither of these bodies was particularly interested in praising me for what I had done for the public but they were expediting some little game they had on for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have read a number of these industrial journals&mdash;they are sent to all Deputies&mdash;and also I have spoken to many industrialists about prices.  I know that when any complaints are <Col N="870" /> made or letters are written to the Press, the answer is always the same:&mdash;&ldquo;These prices have been submitted to the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and you may take it that they are legitimate.&rdquo;  Rightly or wrongly, I feel that I cannot agree that the prices at present being charged are above board. I know it is not really fair to make such allegations without being able to substantiate them, but the Minister can take it from me for what it is worth that if the public could find expression here in the Dáil they would join with me in saying that they do not trust the methods used by the Prices Section for catching out these people who put their case before them.  One of the things which people say outside is that it is remarkable how prices, agreed upon by the Prices Section and marked or labelled, particularly on textile goods, have now been slashed, sometimes even halved or more, during the present trading slump.  There was the recent example where the motor car people went to the Prices Section and were authorised to fix a particular price; then there was a slump in car sales for one reason or another and they proceeded to reduce prices, using the slump as an excuse and everyone was satisfied.  The most important thing from the car buyers' point of view was that they secured a reduction in price.</P>
    <P>If the Prices Section is to be competent to handle these problems, they must have access, first of all, to the most private business documents of these people.  In addition, they must be competent to anticipate the many stratagems built up over the centuries by industrialists generally, not alone in this country but in every country where you have free business enterprise. In the old days of gangster wars in America, one of the cleverest and most important assets to any group of gangsters was the shyster lawyer.  He was a man who could go along at any time and by using apparently legal methods he could get his gangster out of any difficulty or trouble.  He could plead his case before the court and so bemuse and befog the judge that he got his man off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Again, completely legally and within the definition and so on, I believe that the villain of the piece in industry&mdash;if I may call him that&mdash;is the chartered accountant.  I believe that to really make your way in industry and to make it pay, which is more important still, a chartered accountant is very much more important than raw materials, labour, factory or anything else.  He is the backbone of the business and he can so wriggle accounts within the law that it is impossible for people like me and civil servants to really find out what is the fallacy in the apparently fair-minded, honest reasoning of the case put forward before the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not intend this to be any reflection whatsoever on the profession of chartered accountants.  Everything they do is done completely legally and apparently above board, but due to the manipulation of the laws they are apparently able to make a fair case and so get away with the present prices.</P>
    <P>The Prices Tribunal is likewise composed of men and women of the highest integrity.  They are obviously doing everything in their power to exercise their functions as efficiently and as competently as they can.  Unfortunately, rightly or wrongly, the public has no confidence in the Prices Tribunal any more than they have in the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If the Minister is not merely retaining both of these bodies as a face saver to which he and industrialists can refer when they want to get out of a tricky situation, I would urge him to review the whole position in relation to these bodies and give them whatever powers and personnel they require in order that they may compete with business men in attempting to protect the people from the unfair and dishonest prices which are being charged throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I say, that may appear to be a plethora of wide charges against our industrialists and the Prices Section, but it is not intended as such.  It is intended as a simple reflection of the <Col N="872" /> comments by the ordinary man in the street.  I think it would help the Minister very much indeed if he can prove beyond yea or nay that there is no justification for these charges in this way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of industry generally, I do not accept the view that all our industrialists are out merely to screw what they can out of the people.  I think many of our industrialists were men of great courage and men of considerable ability who started their industries when there was little real hope on their part that they would ever get anything out of them. Unfortunately, as is the case in every other aspect and walk of life, the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; in industries have tended to give industrialists generally a bad name in the country.  I do not think they worry very much about that, but, at the same time, I would suggest to the Minister that, as we are entering into a quite different phase in industry, the Minister could examine the whole situation.</P>
    <P>In the first part of the industrialisation of the country the Minister's target was a fairly small country, requiring a fairly small output and offering the industrialists, the honest and dishonest ones, a limited market, and, what was very much more important, a protected market.  What happened, as is the normal sequence in regard to uncontrolled private enterprise anywhere, was that a lot of the small men were driven out by the bigger ones and the bigger ones basked in the sunshine of protective tariffs and a safe market.  By merely turning out the goods, no matter how old or obsolete or inefficient their methods or machines are, they are guaranteed a gilt-edged security for their investments.</P>
    <P>In the beginning, the man had to be a man of courage, ability and considerable competency.  Unless we move on to the next phase, the expansion of our industry to take in world markets, then Irish industry in my view is merely a very pleasant and charming but extremely expensive business.  Leaving wars aside, we should be prepared to move out and compete.  Nobody can <Col N="873" /> deny that our tradesmen and our craftsmen and many of our managers can deal with any opposition.  But if our industrialists are content merely to refuse to take on the challenge of outside competition, then they are being most unfair to the rest of the community and I do not think we can afford it as a community.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I believe the time has come for the Minister to carry out what I think was one of his own ambitions discontinued in 1948 or thereabouts, that is, legislation in relation to industrial standards, the question of examining our industries and assessing their potential, their efficiency and their competency, and, either by dropping tariffs or removing quotas, the elimination of the incompetent businessman and the incompetent industrialist, leaving behind only the good, hard-working man who is prepared to use the best methods.  If the Minister intends to go on with this private enterprise type of business which he appears to favour, that is his own responsibility.  I believe that those who are left, after you have ruthlessly eliminated the incompetent and inefficient incubus on the community are entitled to think that it is the duty of the Government to facilitate to the maximum the businessman who remains and the industrialist who survives that pogrom or whatever you like to call it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the industrialists who have made a real effort to improve their methods should be given every possible encouragement.  They should be facilitated in capitalizing their industry and in the replacement of obsolete equipment; and they should get protection in the earlier years in which they go out to meet competition from the protected markets abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any facility which should be denied to that man if we are really intent on meeting the challenge of world markets.  It is quite useless and it is unfair to ask the good and competent industrialist who is anxious to compete in world markets, and thereby bring money and prosperity to Ireland, to take the limited resources at his disposal and <Col N="874" /> to meet the terrific competition of Government-subsidised and protected companies in other countries.  That is the most important problem facing the Minister in the coming months and, I hope, years.</P>
    <P>The position is that we can no longer be content with the small industries producing for our own needs.  That phase is finished.  From what I understand, mechanisation has wrought such changes that, in the average industry, it is possible, by introducing certain types of machinery, to supply the home market in a couple of weeks, a month at the most, and one is left then with the alternative of exporting or closing down.  I do not think we should be afraid to enter into the really big-money industry.  If we do not enter into it, we are only playing with the balance of trade problem with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of industrialisation which could be considered. It is a truism that one of our greatest problems is raw materials. For instance, in the pottery industry, if we have to import the clay from Staffordshire, and the coal, our industrialists are at a very unfair disadvantage in competing against the British, Belgian, French or German producer.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the only advantage we appear to have is the relatively low wages paid to our workers.  Due to different circumstances, different standards of living, social services, and so on, generally, the wages paid to our skilled craftsmen and workers are lower than in other countries. Consequently, there is an advantage. Just as the British have cheap coal, we have, not exactly cheap labour, but labour which is relatively cheaper than in other countries.  That is an advantage when considering the final price of the particular article produced.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister has the power of direction as to the type of industry that would be established.  I do not suppose he has any degree of power in that matter. It would appear to me that such industries as would produce nylon, synthetic materials, plastics, and all <Col N="875" /> the industries deriving from the advances that have been made in chemistry generally, would be more appropriate to Ireland than those which we appear to be attempting to develop which are based on the importation of heavy raw materials from other countries, particularly the North of England.</P>
    <P>What I have tried to put to the Minister is that we should not adopt the orthodox policy of industrialisation if we intend to industrialise our country.  To a large extent, many British factories, because of geographical nearness, have decided to establish subsidiaries of their companies in Ireland.  The only purpose of that is to dodge tariffs and to get the benefits of quotas, and to see that they get our market.  These companies, of course, are no use to us as a people.  They are no use to us in our attempt to increase the wealth of the country. They are merely coming here for their own private gain, and will add nothing of any great value to the country, as a whole, and they certainly will not solve the Minister's problems.  So, it would appear that, if the Minister leaves the problem, as he has left it up to the present, in the hands of the private speculator, he is largely tied by whatever whim or fancy may take them as to the particular line of production that they will engage in and as to the site at which they will produce.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister reconsider the whole line of his policy over the years or the line of our policy as a country over the years?  Some of our most competent and efficient industries flowed from the establishment of State-sponsored companies&mdash;the Sugar Company, the Electricity Supply Board, Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna and, I have no doubt, in time Córas Iompair Éireann.  There is no clear case that private enterprise is inevitably or essentially the line on which our industries generally must develop.  I can quite see that it is something which has been tried in most other countries and has failed.  I do not want to enter into that argument at the moment.  The position is that we <Col N="876" /> have a number of companies which have been established by various Governments to carry out certain very difficult tasks.  Most of the tasks which have been tackled by the State-sponsored companies have been the most difficult tasks in any country and the tasks that have been left to private enterprise are tasks which, having regard to their record, State-sponsored companies could have performed in their sleep, as it were.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles with a private company is the fact that they are satisfied merely with their own private gain and exploit labour and capital for their private gain, to the exclusion, not necessarily entirely, but almost entirely, of the community's welfare. In the Minister's present dilemma, which calls for vast expansion of exports, he cannot influence in any way the degree of expansion or the lines of expansion to which these companies will turn their energies.  He may have ways of doing it but I do not know that he can.  On the other hand, he has a number of these Government-sponsored companies, which have done extremely well, with odd exceptions. Most of the appointments to these companies have been very good appointments.</P>
    <P>Of course, they have depended entirely on this particular fact.  One of the things which helped the whole conception of the State-sponsored company&mdash;not exactly the nationalised company but the company which lies in between a private enterprise undertaking and a nationalised company&mdash;is the fact that the men were appointed for their own special merit.  I think that is reasonably true of appointments made by each Government.  The thing which would have destroyed the whole conception of the State-sponsored company would have been an attempt to make political jobs in these particular companies.  The point I am making is this: would it not be possible for the Minister to explore the likelihood of some such companies taking on some of the tasks which await Irish industry at present in its attempt to break into world markets generally? Up to the present, industrialists have <Col N="877" /> done the limited job put before them relatively well.  Serious complaints are made about high prices, but I do not think that these are of much importance at present compared with the big problem which faces industry.  I cannot say that the present-day industrialists, taking them as a whole, will be able to cope with the task ahead. For one thing, many of them are not sufficiently competent or hard-working, and those of them who have these qualities have not got the necessary money.  I do not see how the Minister can cope with his task unless a fairly revolutionary method is adopted.  We can meander along the course we are taking at present, but it is quite obvious to anybody studying the problem that we are being protected entirely from the results of the inadequacy of our present policy, which is the policy not only of this year, but of last year and of the past 20 years. We are being cushioned against the real effects of that policy and our lack of expansion by the fact that those who are laid off employment are emigrating and that, consequently, we do not have the bread-lines.  One Government after another play about with the figure of 50,000 or 70,000 unemployed and try to blame each other for it.  They get away with the illusion that this figure represents the total number unemployed.  In actual fact the total number is very much greater over the years but it does not show itself, due to the fact that some of the unemployed in this country go to industries in Great Britain and elsewhere.  They could easily be doing some job here and making money for Ireland instead of for Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>My own particular <i>penchant</i> is for the State-sponsored company.  I believe that the only criteria for membership of a particular board or company should be those of competence and efficiency.  Efficiency of management is, of course, a tremendously important factor in industry.  I do not believe that either the worker or the son of the owner has any right <i>per se</i> to management in industry.  There is a certain amount of talk about the rights of workers in industry.  In my view, a worker in industry has the <Col N="878" /> rights which derive from his ability as manager and no other rights.  My objection to the private enterprise approach to business is that the incompetent and inefficient son of the competent and efficient father, who started the business, walks into the board room and takes his place there, no matter what kind of a half-wit he may happen to be.  In my view, the sane approach to the management of industry, which is the very important problem facing us at the moment, is to provide the most competent man to run a business.  Our industrialists did the job up to the present.  As a result of the particular set-up in business, we are now facing the next generation who will walk into the board room and make decisions in relation to industry. They may be highly competent and highly efficient.  However, generally speaking, it would be expecting too much if all the hard-working, efficient, competent fathers who start our industries were to produce highly competent, efficient and hardworking sons.  I am not interested in the particular kind of sons they produce, but I am interested in the kind of business or industry they will bring to this country.  I do believe, with regard to a particular firm or a particular set-up in business, particularly where it refers to private enterprise, that neither the son of the father or the worker <i>per se</i> has any right in the board room except that which he derives from a proper knowledge of management.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the whole question of the organisation of the community generally with which, a Cheann Chomhairle, I do not think you would allow me to deal.  In passing, I will just say that it is a scandalous thing if a competent worker, through lack of educational facilities&mdash;an accident over which he had no control&mdash;does not find himself in the board room directing an industry.  I hope I will have an opportunity of dealing with that question some other place.</P>
    <P>Another question which must concern the Minister is the provision of capital for his industries.  I do not know how he is going to produce a fair amount of capital to establish his industries, <Col N="879" /> to maintain them or to get people to establish and run industries bearing in mind the price of money as controlled by the banks at present.  My view, of course, is there can be no real progress in the community and no real expansion of industry to the extent required unless the power to control the banks is taken over by the State.  Short of that, the problem means that the amount of money required for industries necessary for the welfare of the community will not be available.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by the present Minister for Finance was that a considerable amount of dollars were spent on trivial, idiotic goods such as lipstick, hair curlers and so forth. While this was very foolish, it illustrates the point that dollars were made available to anybody who wanted them.  The sad part of the matter is that those dollars should have been used to purchase tractors, farm equipment, farm implements, industrial equipment, mechanical equipment, to re-equip our factories, to replace obsolete machinery and so on.  Through no fault of the then Minister for Finance, these dollars were not so spent.  The necessary machinery was not purchased and that, of course, is the very serious problem which faces the country&mdash;that, both in industry and on the farms, our people do not appear to have, or to be able to lay their hands on, the capital to buy equipment necessary to make this into a prosperous State.  I do not see how that is to be done.  In the case I mentioned of the buying of lipsticks, hair curlers and what you will, these people bought them for the simple reason that they knew they would sell them rapidly, but from the community point of view, the country's point of view, the prosperity of the nation point of view, it was a waste of dollars.  But, again, it does illustrate the very important question of provision for replacement of machinery in industry and on the farms.</P>
    <P>If I might say a further word on the question of industrialisation, I mentioned this matter of plastics, resins and chemical processes of different <Col N="880" /> kinds as a reasonable line of development for our industries, a line in which we might compete abroad in so far as it seems very unlikely that we shall be able to sell knives to Sheffield and that type of thing.  My view is that industry must largely be based on agricultural products.  I do not mean the old kitchen-garden mentality or the fat cattle-tillage mentality.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous scope for development in the processed food business generally and if it were possible to make agriculture efficient&mdash; and I know what a thorny subject it is&mdash;if it were possible to encourage agriculture by means of co-operative farming, increased mechanisation, facilities for cheap loans and by educating farmers to produce food cheaper, then the Minister would have a relatively easy task.  But it is because I have no reason to feel that agriculture is likely to become efficient, under the present system at any rate, that he is thrown back entirely on his own resources for the expansion of industry.  I do not know to what extent he can influence agricultural policy, but it must be quite obvious to him that there is no expansion in relation to agricultural products, and due to that lack of expansion he is denied a relatively easy raw material of industry because there is no doubt that the one negotiable commodity is and will be for many years to come food, because other countries are busy arming and have not got time to develop their own agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that the main task facing the Minister is the weeding out of the incompetent and then the offering of every facility, if he does not accept the idea of establishing Government-sponsored companies of some kind or other, to the established good and efficient industrialist.  One of the great dangers facing us is the fact that many of our industries are subsidiaries of English companies whose only interest is the supplying of our market.  Secondly, many of our industries, being as they are of the private enterprise type, must now pass on into the hands of possibly not as hard-working and competent young men as were their fathers.  That is a very serious consideration and I <Col N="881" /> have the greatest sympathy with the Minister in his problem, because, with the Department of Agriculture, his Department really shares all the responsibility for the prosperity or otherwise of the State in the years ahead.  The success which the Minister in the past has shown by his approach to these problems, his readiness to examine new methods, his great courage in trying new methods and breaking with the old traditional ways, gives most of us on both sides of the House hope that he will tackle these problems energetically and successfully.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, however, that the immediate situation is serious for the people.  There is no doubt that there appears to be a slump in trade, and there is no doubt that there has been a considerable rise in prices, particularly in relation to foodstuffs.  We all expected that, but we also all anticipate and expect that the trade unions will press, without delay, for equitable and fair increases in wages to meet these rising costs.  It is obvious to most of us that the niggardly agreement by the Congress of Irish Unions to a 12/6 wage increase is accepted by many as a sad betrayal of the workers, if they are limited to this increase.  However, I have no doubt that that will be dealt with in the proper place, but it must be accepted that, for different reasons&mdash;some of which have their origins outside the State and others due to governmental policy within the State&mdash;considerable increases in prices have taken place and further increases will probably take place.  The only normal sequel to that must be a fairly steep increase in wages.  That is a very sad, and, for the country, a very dangerous consideration, but it is a normal sequel to the Government's policy in attempting to introduce a deflationary Budget and must be accepted as such.  It would be quite impossible to keep wages in any way in step with the rise in prices which has taken place.  The Minister has a very formidable task ahead of him and he has the sympathy of the whole people in his attempts to accomplish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is more <Col N="882" /> important than any other debate on an Estimate because this Estimate covers the greatest field of Government activity.  The Department of Industry and Commerce concerns itself directly with all industrial matters, the regulation of prices, tariffs, exports and imports, public transport and civil aviation, as well as tourism.</P>
      <P>There is one point on which I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne: the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is so great that it is high time that the Government should consider the establishment of a Ministry of Labour as well as a Ministry of Tourism.</P>
      <P>The people of this country are faced with one of the major problems of their history in having to provide over £2,000,000 to defray losses that will be incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann during the coming 12 months.  There are, I am quite certain, several remedies and I think it is time that the responsible Minister should take proper action.  It is well known that the transport services in the city areas show a profit and, when they were run by private companies, showed a very considerable profit as well as being of great benefit to the residents of the municipal areas.  They are subsidising the railways throughout the country. In an island the size of ours we have far and away too many miles of railway. In 1952 when motor transport has made such strides the tendency is to transport all goods by lorry rather than by rail.  Any person of common sense can realise how simple it is for a lorry to take a load of goods directly from a factory in Dublin to a business premises in Cork in comparison with transporting those goods from the factory to the railhead in Dublin, from there to the railhead in Cork and from there to the business premises.  Labour charges are reduced considerably by employing road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention a matter which affects the smooth running of all businesses and which becomes directly involved with almost every major labour dispute in the country.  I refer to a dispute which is starting its third year in Córas Iompair Éireann, the electrical trades dispute.  Its effects <Col N="883" /> are now being felt very seriously by the people of Dublin, particularly the residents of suburban areas.  A certain constituent of mine wrote to Córas Iompair Éireann complaining about a service on the Drumcondra route.  The reply given by the board of directors of Córas Iompair Éireann was that they had a lot of trouble in the servicing of their buses at the moment because of this strike which has been two years in existence.  Several very good excuses were made on behalf of the company for the serious complaint of the residents of the district.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also responsible for air transport in this country.  His Department were responsible for abolishing the food subsidies and yet they propose to purchase, naturally at great expense, more Constellations. When they do this it is quite reasonable to expect that Dublin Airport must be expanded.  This terminal should get very serious consideration from the Minister for several reasons. We, as Irish people, as Dublin people, boast about our beautiful airport and compare it very favourably with any airport in these islands, in Western Europe, in big capitals on the Continent. Some 18 months ago, however, I had a discussion with the manager of Northolt Airport and when I mentioned this he more or less laughed at me and said that the Government of the day were ill-advised to build any permanent building in any modern airport because, with the rapid advance of air transport, we do not know to-day what we may require in ten years' time.  The Government should be commended for building temporary buildings at Shannon Airport, but a grave mistake was made, I believe, in building a permanent structure in Dublin because it is now found to be completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is under the direct control of the Department of Industry and Commerce and therefore a 2½ mile radius of undevelopment has been created around the Airport.  If I am in order I would like to mention that this radius seriously affects the Howth main drainage scheme which we were discussing last week on the Local <Col N="884" /> Government Estimate.  No building development can occur within this radius but yet, I presume on the advice of the Department of Industry and Commerce, an industrial area was built up in Finglas, a small industrial area in Santry and another at Coolock. This free radius will seriously hinder the providing of houses for the workers in these industries.  It should be shortened to a one-mile radius.  In my little experience of other airports I failed to see that a 2½ mile radius was preserved.</P>
    <P>From the policy point of view I believe that we should have another cement factory in the country.  As a representative of a Dublin constituency I am not suggesting that this factory should be in Dublin.  There is a good export market for Irish cement.  As a user of cement I find that Irish cement compares very favourably with the best we have imported.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister also to do something, if he can, to develop Irish state quarries.  I do not know to what extent these slate quarries can be expanded, but I do know that anybody in this country who undertakes a housing scheme, no matter how small, cannot get a proper supply of slates and when a housing scheme is commenced with one type of roofing material it is expected to be completed with the same type of roofing material.</P>
    <P>We are told that tourism is our second major industry.  This year, I believe that the benefits derived from the tourist industry will be better than ever before.  It is high time that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should put to his Government the suggestion that a little more concrete work should be done for the development of the tourist industry than the establishment of boards and associations and things like that.  If there was more co-operation between the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance more could be done for tourism than by the establishment of various boards.  All over the country, roads, hotel entrances, golf and sports clubs, places of interest, historic buildings, etc, should be put into better condition <Col N="885" /> than they are at present.  There are historic buildings all over the country on which you see a plaque on the wall, generally in Irish.  I do not want to run down the Irish language, but tourists coming to this country do not understand the Irish language, and these are the places of interest which they come to see.</P>

      <P>I should also like to point out in connection with the development of the tourist industry that facilities for bathing should be developed around the coast.  Possibly that is a matter for the Local Government Department, but, as I said, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance should get together and do something.  If we want to develop the tourist trade here we must spend more money to attract tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the abolition of the food subsidies has been thrashed out both in this House and on public platforms and it is not necessary for me to say much about it.  Deputy Dr. Browne, judging by his speech, seems to be very concerned about the workers and the poor people.  I wonder is he just as concerned with what they will have to pay for their bread, tea, butter and sugar from now on.  He started that there is a slump in trade.  The slump in trade is quite obvious to everybody <Col N="886" /> except a few Deputies on the Government Benches who say that there is not a slump, that there is no increase in the cost of living, that there is not a greater number of unemployed than there was this time last year.  I would ask Deputies on the other side of the House, and the Minister, to inquire how many people have been let off from breweries and distilleries, the agricultural machinery industry, the textile business, the building trade and, within the last two months, from the licensed trade.  All these people are feeling the pinch.</P>
    <P>We have been asked by various Ministers on several occasions to spend less money and to save money, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few weeks ago asked the public to spend money.  I should like to point out that the unemployment in a lot of these trades has been caused by the imposition of penal taxes.  I suggest that they are penal taxes because the Government are not deriving the benefits from them which they expected to derive.</P>
    <P>The taxation on a lot of these commodities reached saturation point long ago and next year the Government will find that the revenue derived from these increased taxes will not be what they expect.  The building trade and the textile business are experiencing very serious unemployment because of a complete lack of credit and nothing else.  Money is not being made available for them in the way it was this time last year.  Until conditions in the business world come back to what they were, things will disimprove rather than improve.  In spite of all the promises made 12 months ago when the Fianna Fáil Party were seeking to be returned as the Government when they criticised the inter-Party Government in regard to the cost of living and unemployment, the Minister for Industry and Commerce now admits that there can be no reduction in the cost of living.  I believe that the policy of the Government is doing nothing but causing emigration, unemployment and uneasiness in business generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said, the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="887" /> caters for the most important phase of our national life next to agriculture and the first concern is, of course, the development of our national resources in every possible way.  Our coalmines are few and in consequence the development of the turf industry is of considerable national importance. It is known to everybody that for a considerable time the great progress that was being made in that regard was thwarted and then an effort was made to produce in one year turf for three years ahead, with the result that there is again an upset in normal development.  These things occur from time to time but it must appeal to everybody as being in the national interest that in matters of industrial development a continuous programme should be decided upon and carried on in the interests of workers and in the interests of the economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by the last speaker of the development of our slate quarries which, of course, would be a primary industry, because we would be using our native resources just as in the case of turf.  One of the great difficulties that arose in the past was due to the haphazard development under which the discarded material was left too near the quarry face.  In consequence, it would now cost a considerable amount of money to clear the surrounding area, and make these quarries capable of economic working again.  With the modern development in machinery, however, that should not be an insuperable difficulty, and I think it presents an opening for development at the present time that would be of considerable advantage in some of our outlying districts.  Everybody knows where the slate quarries were carried on in the past and where the best type of material for roofing was available. Every encouragement should be given towards the development of slate production in this country again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go deeper still in that regard, I think that no proper survey has been made of our mineral resources.  People are inclined to say: &ldquo;Well, we have not many minerals&rdquo;.  In the past whatever was done in that direction for a <Col N="888" /> certain number of years was carried out when we were dealing with a colonial empire, and the few industries that were in existence at that time were just exploited in the interests of a foreign Power.  Very little regard was given to the development of these industries for local purposes, which should be the primary consideration.  I mentioned in this House before, for example, and I repeat it, that a few miles from Cork at a place called Ringabella, 400 men were employed ten years before the Famine mining lead.</P>
    <P>These lead mines are still there, but, so far as I know, no effort has been made to explore the place to ascertain what its potential is or what was the reason why the mines were abandoned. Possibly one or two considerations affected the position.  Perhaps the Famine and the general circumstances attendant upon it were responsible for the abandonment.  Another reason may have been that lead was found in another place and could be produced more economically there, with the consequence that people went there for their supplies.  However, these local developments are of primary importance to the nation and should be looked into again.  Right up to comparatively recent times, copper was being mined in the Castletownbere peninsula.  It was being mined successfully until the period of the commencement of the national struggle and was then abandoned.  I do not think that any effort was ever made since to look into the matter to see if that very important commodity could be produced there economically.  These are only a few instances which indicate what our resources may be in other parts of the country, resources which, if exploited properly, might be of tremendous national importance.</P>
    <P>Turning to the building industry, in which cement is so largely used, to my mind there is still room in the country for considerable expansion and for at least another cement factory in the South of Ireland.  During the emergency and even later, cement for Cork City and County was all imported. Within my recollection, a survey was made at a place called Rabbeen, on the western side of Cork Harbour, and <Col N="889" /> it was found that the necessary materials were available for the establishment of a cement industry. That is again a primary industry, involving the use of a considerable amount of local material.</P>
    <P>These primary industries are very important in providing employment for the sons of both farmers and workers who may be surplus to the land.  Such employment would be available near their home, would preserve the population in these areas and provide these young men with a means of livelihood which would be of considerable advantage to themselves and to the country.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the use of native timber, and some stress was laid on the fact that it is not suitable for everything.  It can be used only when it is treated in some specialised way.  We know that, owing to the soft nature of our climate, native timbers are inclined to warp unless they get a considerable time to mature, and are treated afterwards in a very special way.  There are many smaller industries and crafts such as the making of furniture, the manufacture of certain transport vehicles, and the making of such things as lead pencils that would provide considerable employment if properly developed.  The country at the moment is being flooded with lead pencils from the Continent of Europe which are used by thousands of our school children.  It may not appear a very big thing, but at the same time an industry for the making of lead pencils would be of considerable advantage to any of our Irish villages or towns.</P>
    <P>In the matter of transport, coaches are sometimes brought into this country by Córas Iompair Éireann which could be manufactured here at home with advantage.  That is a development which I think should be considered.  No permission whatever should be given for the importation of vehicles for our transport system, vehicles which could be made by our own skilled workers.  We have had too much of that in recent times, and it is about time that steps were taken to expand our own production in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> With regard to the textile industry, we all know that the flooding of the markets in the past and the purchase of wool at peak prices in the early days of the Korean war, and even subsequently when that conflagration threatened to expand, was responsible for much of the recession in the textile trades.  That position is only gradually settling into its normal channels again.  The same remark applies to other kinds of manufacture where stockpiling did cause a temporary glut on the market.  Whether or not the policies that were adopted in that regard were wise is now a thing of the past, so that what the Minister has to do is to grapple with the present situation and try as far as he possibly can to put the wheels of industry running their normal course again.  I think that the whole country has every confidence that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce is the most competent, knowledgeable and experienced man that the country has for this particular Ministry.  The country has every confidence in him.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment is, of course, a serious one.  There is a gradual improvement, but it is gradual in some spheres only.  In other spheres, such as Córas Iompair Éireann, the tendency, as far as we can judge from the reports we get, is the other way.  That is not as it should be.  We know that there have been constant strikes in Córas Iompair Éireann and that advantage was taken of them in various directions.  We know that heavy transport was put on the roads during these strike periods, and that very little was done to try and fix up the strikes quickly or at all events to try and handle the situation when it was menacing and before the strikes occurred.  That would have been the proper way to handle the situation.  In consequence the aftermath has been bad for the workers and for the country generally.  It has been bad, too, for the roads to which this heavy transport has been diverted. In my opinion a good deal of this long distance heavy transport could go back to the railways with advantage to the country, the county councils and the rating authorities who have the <Col N="891" /> responsibility of providing for the upkeep of the roads.</P>
    <P>We were told some time ago that the railway company would turn out a railway carriage per week and improve the rolling stock of the company. We had a sad experience in that connection last Sunday when there were not enough special trains to convey people to an important fixture such as the Munster hurling final at Limerick.  Arrangements had been made for 20 special trains.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, has already mentioned, the people of Cork city were obliged, or would have been obliged, to leave at 6 o'clock in the morning to travel 60 miles to witness a fixture which was to take place at 3.45 p.m.  Even during the emergency, when people had to cycle that distance, they had not to leave at 6 o'clock in the morning.  When we approached the railway company they said they had not enough rolling stock, and that what was in use at certain race meetings in County Dublin on the previous evening would have to be transferred to the south. We were told, in connection with the arrangements for 20 or 22 specials to Limerick, that some would have to start at 6 o'clock in the morning to enable people to travel a distance of 60 miles.  If that is the kind of service that is given to the people, then we cannot expect success. Neither can we expect success when the railway company is able to fall back on a strike such as the electricians' strike in regard to the putting of vehicles on the road.  When that is the position we cannot expect very much progress.  If the suggestion which I have made were adopted, the employment that would be given, particularly on the technical side, would be very important.  We can only hope that in the coming months the present situation will be remedied to the advantage of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree with what previous speakers have said as regards the dismissal of workers who have given long years of service in Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is a wrong system to put them off after <Col N="892" /> all their years of work.  I think that could be avoided if the railway management only woke up to the situation and bestirred themselves into giving the people the services they require to meet their needs in various ways.</P>
    <P>I would again express the hope that the Minister will re-establish the heavy industry that he had in hands some years ago for the manufacture of chassis bodies.  A certain amount of assembly work is being done in that regard, but the development of this heavy industry is of such national concern that I think steps ought to be taken concerning it in the near future, so that we may make progress in that direction in the same way as we are making progress in other directions. People had thought that the production of steel and tin was not possible here. We see, however, what the result has been of efficient management in Haul-bowline, Inchicore and elsewhere, when an undertaking is taken properly in hands and worked out on right lines.</P>
    <P>References have been made to tourism and to the sale of Constellations. The sale of these was made at a time when contacts could have been made which would have been of permanent advantage to the country.  It was the time when the Holy Year was approaching, and when, if retained, they would have been available to our own people.  If they were available, the travel agencies would have been able to make valuable contacts.  They would have been able to promote travelling on a very large scale.  At the present time, we know from reports from America, from people who have gone there, that it is just quite ridiculous to be trying to ask American tourists to come to Ireland when there is no transport for them.  They just say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when asked to come here.  That is an absolute fact.  The travel agencies in America tell our people that if they could charter a liner or build a liner or get airplanes for them to travel here, they would be able to get twice as many tourists to come to this country from America.  That is an actual fact, and it was just a disaster that the Constellations were sold at the time they were.  Anybody who wishes to examine the position officially can get that confirmed.  There is no doubt in <Col N="893" /> the world about it.  There is another aspect of that very undesirable sale which I should like to mention.  It is this, that the 250 or so skilled men who had been recruited here for the repair of airplanes had, consequent on the sale, to go to Bristol and other places.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have said that this is not a suitable development for this nation because we are only a small country.  It should be borne in mind that there are countries in Europe not the size of the Province of Munster. These small countries have larger populations than we have, but that is because they have developed their industries. They have taken their national life to themselves and looked ahead and made progress in that direction.  The reason for our small population is the fact that the industrial potentialities of our country were exploited in the past by a foreign Government.  When they established in their own country an industry similar to one which was flourishing here they took steps to close down the industry in this country so as to foster the one in their own country.  That, in its turn, led to a dispersal of the population of this country.  Every progressive step should be encouraged.  I think that much of what has been said in this House has not been very helpful.  We should aim at developing our primary industries and at exploring all our resources.  We should endeavour to make greater progress in relation to our secondary industries for which, perhaps, we have to import the raw material.  We should also endeavour to provide some little industry near our towns and villages in order to provide employment and to improve the lot of the people there.  Such steps would help to improve national progress.</P>
    <P>I represent the City of Cork, and I must say that I find the present position of Córas Iompair Éireann there extraordinary.  In the past, about six railways ran into Cork&mdash;the main line from Dublin to Cork, the branch line from Cork to Bandon and Bantry and the West, the line to Passage and Crosshaven, the line to Cobh and to Youghal, the line to Muskerry and Coachford, and the line out to Macroom.  Many of these are <Col N="894" /> now gone and some of them have fallen into disuse.  Perhaps one or two of the railway stations are in use at present.  Instead of using the available space, Córas Iompair Éireann have established a depot for road transport and the removal of furniture in the town.  They are paying rent, rates and taxes for that depot, and they have a superintendent there to look after it.</P>
    <P>Would it not be much more economical to make use of the accommodation at the railway and to have one superintendent there to co-ordinate all the different services?  At the Cork Show we had the spectacle of representatives of the road transport service and of the railway service actually competing with one another to get business.  To my mind, the whole thing is a complete muddle.  Limerick is the only place where I saw any sign of progress in that respect, although I could find fault with the position there as regards excursion trains, and so forth.  The bus there starts from the railway station.  If a passenger wants to take a train at a particular time he can do so, or, if it suits him, he can take the bus.  If, however, the bus and the train leave at the same hour from different depots in the one city, you have superintendents in two different places running their services in competition with each other instead of co-ordinating their services so as to ensure that there will be no overlapping and that the people will get the service to which they are entitled. Arrangements should be made to ensure that there will be an adequate bus service to cater for school children and business people in areas which are not conveniently situated to the railways, but the road and the rail services should not run parallel at the same hours, because that is merely general wastage.</P>
    <P>I consider that it was a very bad mistake from the very first, and that it is the cause of the redundancy now, that it was not possible, for example, to transfer porters from the railway to the bus service or to the parcels office, and so forth, so that when they became redundant in one place their services could be availed of elsewhere within the company.  Matters of that kind <Col N="895" /> must now be remedied.  I consider that the dismissal of staff is no remedy. Men who have given years of their lives in the service of the company are now being thrown out of employment, and, because of the nature of their employment with the company, it is virtually impossible to find suitable alternative employment for them.</P>
    <P>The system is unfair to the men themselves, to their families and to all concerned.  In addition, it has proved of no advantage to the company. A general co-operative development is required in that respect.  No concern in the country needs such a shaking up as Córas Iompair Éireann. We have men in this country who have developed industries such as Irish Steel, the sugar factories, and so forth&mdash;industries which are now running efficiently and progressively. These men are not confining themselves to their own particular spheres of activity.  They are going out and developing the bogs: if the farmers will not grow the beet there, they will grow it themselves.  That is the type of initiative that will help to build up this country and create employment for our people.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about unemployment.  Unemployment can be attributed to various causes but it will continue until national progress is made along the right lines.  We read in the newspapers and we hear on the radio that unemployment is not confined to our own country.  Why should we continually come down on our own country and talk about our number of unemployed while, across the artificial border which exists in this country, there are 56,000 unemployed despite the fact that there they have the backing of all the resources of an Empire.  We should look after our own country and co-operate in building it up.  We should strive to raise the prestige of our country in every way we can.  We have been held back too long by a foreign Government and we should make more progress now under a native Government.  I have every confidence that, with the foresight and experience of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, he will <Col N="896" /> lead this nation along the right lines of national development.  I feel confident that, with proper development, our people will be encouraged to stay in those parts of the country where they are most needed and that they will not crowd into our towns and cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's ears must be burning because of all that has been and is being said about him by the plain people of this country as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  It is true that the people did not expect the subsidies to last for ever but they expected that they would be withdrawn gradually so that they would not have to bear the full burden all at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is overloaded and a proper check is not kept on it.  There is far too much bungling there and nobody seems to be able to right matters.  For years past, large sums of money have been written off as irrecoverable in that Department.  Somebody should be made accountable for it.  I will give credit to the Minister for many good undertakings established by him but I do not intend to fall over him because he has made some fierce statements and fierce blunders in his Ministry over a number of years.  It is only last year that he and the Minister for Finance set off to Great Britain to cross the t's and dot the i's for a Minister over there and came back here and adopted the Central Bank Report, telling our bankers to raise by 1 per cent. their credit system.  Those are things which represent the immediate cause of the depression which we are in at present.  We are in the midst of a depression which will probably last a good while longer and will give a great deal of weariness to industry here.  The present Minister is a great face saver and a first-class bluffer.  I do not mean that in an impudent sense, but he is a first-class bluffer.  He would almost wriggle out of anything.  He was one of the first Ministers of the Government last year who made one of the most gloomy speeches which put a chill up the spine of the people.  The country was down and out and was facing a crisis.  He was responsible for <Col N="897" /> bringing that crisis on; the crisis is on his own shoulders to-day and I do not know how he intends to get over it.</P>
    <P>Industry is in serious difficulties. During the war years industry here got a good chance of survival.  It had very little competition, but I see now a trial of strength between the home industries and industries in foreign countries, for instance, Germany and France.  It will test our industries to the utmost to stand up to those countries where goods are sold cheaper than in almost any other country.</P>
    <P>As far as my own county is concerned, it is not a great industrial county but take, for instance, the town of Navan.  There was great prosperity there over a number of years.  Good industries were started mostly of the one line unfortunately, the furniture line.  Those industries were giving good employment and good wages, but at the present moment most of them are in their death throes.  Most of the employees are on part-time; many of the old timers who earned big and steady money over a long period of years have left the industries and tripped across to England.  That was a town in the height of prosperity. Everyone was doing well, but with the first breath of the industrial storm it has foundered.  Now it is up to the Minister to see that these industries which were well established get a chance.  At least he should make every effort to see that those industries do not crumble at the first sign of depression.</P>
    <P>At the same time I am not going to follow the line adopted by others here in speaking about industrial development. This country is small.  I do not care what Deputy MacCarthy or anybody else says; you can only create industries to a certain extent.  You cannot over-industrialise.  We have had native government over the last 30 years.  As regards the industries which have been established, have they absorbed idle men and women, or have they interfered directly with those living on the land and brought them into the towns?  I believe the latter has occurred, and the surplus population of the towns has veered off to <Col N="898" /> England.  Industry is not absorbing the people of this country in the proper way.  The land is being denuded of its population and the towns have their population going to Britain for years and years.  Therefore, industry is absorbing people from the land for employment, and instead of helping agriculture it is killing it and leaving the countryside a wilderness.  It is all very well to build up Dublin, Cork and Limerick, but you are building up white elephants that will eat themselves up when the day of depression comes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have a full review of the general situation and to try to find an immediate remedy. Do not think that because we can count on our fingers and in our minds hundreds and hundreds of factories we are starting for this country we are making progress.  They are not worth a rap if you are building those factories at the expense of the rural areas and drawing the rural population into the towns.  I stand for a balanced economy where agriculture is prospering and where, with every industry that is established, agriculture will keep prospering, but I do not think that the rise of an industry at the expense of agriculture is a good sign, and that is happening in this country.</P>
    <P>It is time we realised the seriousness of the situation and took stock of the position.  We are in danger of entering a worse period of depression where industries will be closed and mass unemployment created overnight.  Those people, finding no outlet in their own country, will be forced to take to the emigrant ship, and when they once go they will never come back.  As I said, we have had over 30 years of native government in which to try to build up this country, and it is time that the country was able to stand up to a storm when it comes.  The fact is that we have had only two months of a depression, and the country is choked with idle men.  We were told a little over a year ago that if there was a change of Government there would be sunshine overnight, but the clouds are still there, and there is no one trying to remove them.  As far as I see, this whole industrial development was created on a false foundation.  There <Col N="899" /> are in this country at the head of industry a whole combine of foreigners and semi-foreigners who have industries absolutely in their grip and who are monopolising the bigger enterprises. Surely it is not for that purpose that our native Government was established.  The Government was established for the native Irish and to build up an Irish tradition.  We are in the grip of that yellow streak from all over Europe with all types of names that people cannot spell.  They are only here a fortnight when they change their names to Paddy this or Paddy that, and start up an industry with Irish money and use Irishmen to get their money's worth.  We are definitely in the grip of those foreigners.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether they are Jews, British or Indians they have a strangle-hold on the Irish people.  They do not give two hoots about Irish industry except what they can make out of it. They are a soulless group; they are a group that we must watch, and they have a grip on the country that we must break.  I would ask the Minister to be up and doing because he is the unwilling tool of these people.  I see them myself stringing into this House trying to find the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and they are always led by someone of doubt as far as Irish Ireland is concerned. They are brought in here; they obtain financiers' money and start industries.  I do not want to see that. I do not want to see one industry started here by that type of people. They have been the cause of great misery and distress over the last number of years.  These things should not be allowed to go on.  It is time we took stock, and gave Irish industry into the hands of Irishmen.  We have plenty of money at home and plenty of money abroad, and there is no reason why we should not spend that money for our own people and let other people look after their own country and their own industries.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be to start industries native to the soil in this country.  We have no coal, iron, steel, zinc or copper in sufficient quantities to establish big industries here.  There is no use in talking about big industries.  If you <Col N="900" /> try to establish them you do so at a desperate cost, far greater than the people are able to pay.  If you concentrate on establishing industries in the cities and big towns, you open the road to socialism, and from socialism you progress to Communism.  If we keep on in the way in which we seem to be tending at the moment, with a vast Cork and a vaster Dublin, we will eventually finish up in the position in which many countries in Europe find themselves to-day with a breakdown in society.</P>
    <P>If the Government is anxious to establish industries, let it establish them in the country and thereby induce our people to remain on the land.  I visualise industrialisation at the moment as something employing young boys from 16 to 18 years of age. When one group reaches 18, the age at which they would normally qualify for an adult wage thereby increasing the wages bill, they are dispensed with and another group of young men is taken on instead.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable growth in cheap female labour over the years.  Young girls go into factories where they are paid from 50/- to £3 per week.  They would be far better off working as domestic servants, a decent honest occupation, preparing themselves to be the wives of our labouring men throughout the country.  At the moment they are crowding into these new industries in the towns.  I would prefer to see the young men get these jobs and the young girls preparing themselves to be the wives of these young men and the mothers of a future generation. The present tendency is a bad tendency. We have tens of thousands of idle males.  The big industrialists want cheap labour so that they can make bigger profits.  The Minister should take stock of the present situation.  He may pat himself on the back because of all the industries he has established.  It is not patting he should get.</P>
    <P>These tinpot factories will never stand the storms of the future.  More than 50 per cent. of them will founder in face of world competition.  Japan <Col N="901" /> is in the market.  So is Germany. They have millions behind them. They can sell their products all over the world because they can afford to lose millions where we cannot afford to lose thousands.  It is time the Minister took steps to ensure that the industries we establish will be able to stand up to any bad weather in the future.</P>
    <P>We have made some effort towards industrialisation in so far as State-sponsored industries are concerned. Twenty-five years ago the beet industry was sneered at by the present Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and described as a &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo;.  It has become a gloriously golden elephant now, lavishly praised from every platform and on both sides of this House.  It has stood the test of time and proved a satisfactory investment.</P>
    <P>Transport now appears to be our worst problem.  Almost any man in the country can tell one what is wrong, but no one in authority seems to make any effort to remedy the situation.  Road and rail transport are running in competition.  One sees a train leaving Navan at a certain hour and a bus leaving Navan at the same hour, both bound for the same destination, and travelling over an almost identical route.  One sees Córas Iompair Éireann lorries going out to collect beet.  The lorry driver and his helper stand idly by while the farmer loads the beet. They may not help him to load, and, if they do, they are in peril of dismissal. Many of these men have told me that they would prefer to help rather than stand idly by shivering with cold.  The Minister and the trade unions should get together on this matter.  It seems ridiculous that men who would be prepared to take off their coats and give a helping hand are not allowed to do so.  If these anomalies were not permitted to occur, I am satisfied transport would pay its way, and the unfortunate taxpayer would not have to dig deep into his pocket every year in order to subsidise it.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty to make transport a paying proposition.  There should be no necessity to dismiss any <Col N="902" /> men.  Put the country's transport into order.  The Minister may tread on some people's corns in doing so, but it is better that he should do that rather than let the present situation continue.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the position of Bord na Móna.  I know it is giving a good deal of employment but the Minister should be careful not to become bogged down because of this body's activities.  If Bord na Móna continues to scour the country, sending out big lorries looking for men to work on the bogs, it will not pay.  In time of emergency we must work our bogs to the very utmost, but the same necessity does not arise in time of peace.  I am not too sure that these turf generating stations will prove successful and I think some committee of experts should be appointed to examine into this question of turf production, because turf production will not pay so long as it is continued on its present basis.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to embark on an air service to America. Such a service would prove to be a real white elephant.  The Minister should wait and see whether other countries can operate these services successfully.  These aeroplanes eat money.  A small little island like ours cannot hope to succeed where big empires like America, France and England are steadily losing money.  Is it not time we took stock of what these countries are doing to try to make their air services self-supporting? Aeroplanes become obsolete in six months.  After 12 months they are scrapped and are replaced by entirely new and more up-to-date machines.</P>
    <P>It is a waste of the people's money for us to do anything like that.  We would love to see a big air service, but we are not able to pay for it.  I ask the Minister to cut it out and not start that nonsense all over again, as if he does, some Government later on will have to cut it out if it is not paying its way.  At present it could not be a paying concern, and well the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>In regard to our own coalmines, I want a clear statement.  Have we coal of any value and, if so, why do we not <Col N="903" /> develop it?  What is wrong with the Arigna coalmines or the Castlecomer collieries in Kilkenny?  Is it good coal or bad coal?  We should let the nation know with one word and let us develop it or cut it out.  The Minister should not be saying we have coal and if not we may utilise this or that.  There have been surveys over the past 15 or 25 years, and it is time to let the people know.  If these coalmines are worth developing, we should get the Irish people's money&mdash;and plenty of it &mdash;to develop them.  If they are not worth developing, we should spend no money, but should close them down.</P>
    <P>Cement is an important industry, and should be developed.  It is an industry that has a fair foundation, and the people need this product.</P>
    <P>In my own county there is an important industry, the gypsum works between Cavan and Meath.  I want to see them developed to the utmost. There you have the native product in the ground for the taking of it.  It is wanted all over the world, and chiefly in our own country.  There could be a vast export trade in it, but the industry is not half developed.  It has been started in a very poor, over-populated area, where the land is very bad and the farms are very small.  That industry could be a major one.  I ask the Minister to see how far it can be developed, and how quickly that can be done, as it is something of major importance.</P>
    <P>In regard to mineral exploration, what was the result from the gypsum area?  We were told there was gypsum and, further down, coal, and possibly oil.  I hope it turns out as we thought, but it is time to have a survey and find out what is in those areas.  If the coal or oil is there, let us develop it as soon as possible and not be sitting for years awaiting results&mdash; which may be negative&mdash;after ten years of great expectations.</P>
    <P>The present Minister and his Department deserve plenty of censure, as most of their own misfortunes are due to the gloom they have created themselves.  Millions have been sunk in industrial development over the last 15 years.  There was £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 worth of muck in the <Col N="904" /> Park.  Each county council has had to pay £60,000 or £70,000 extra for the white elephants they were asked to make of the bogs.  I hope we will not go back to these things again.  Let us cut our losses as quickly as possible and develop our country in a reasonable and businesslike way.  The people have too big a price to pay and it is unfortunate that it is the ordinary people who have to try to pay it, the small struggling farmers.</P>
    <P>There is no effort being made to stop the eternal flow of emigration. The boys and girls at 16 and 18 are off to Britain or somewhere else. Unfortunately, it is sad to have to say it, it is the earnings of those men and women in Britain that are keeping this country afloat.  That is a sad and sorry plight after 30 years of native government, after all the grand things that were said from platforms 30, 20 and even ten years ago, that we would stem emigration, that the wheels of industry would go round and round, that instead of trekking off they would be coming from America and Britain to the prosperous little Ireland.  Where is that prosperity to-day?  I would ask the Minister to tell us the truth and not be bluffing, saying that there is prosperity around the corner.</P>
    <P>Three months ago, if you mentioned floating a loan, the Minister would have gone wild.  He would have said: &ldquo;How could you float a loan in this miserable country, which is down and out and on the verge of bankruptcy?&rdquo; He had the neck to come in the other day and say he would float a big loan and use our external assets in developing the country.  We told him that three or four years ago, but he said we were mad and crazy, and were squandering the people's money.  Here he is now, eating out of our own hands, yet he will say to-night: &ldquo;I am the author of these things.&rdquo;  I would ask him to stop bluffing&mdash;he is the nation's greatest bluffer, there is not the slightest doubt about that.  He should pull up his socks and give us responsible government and not gangster government.  This country is in the hands of Jews and gentiles of every type, coming in with false names and taking Irish names.  They are hanging <Col N="905" /> round the Minister's neck, but I hope he will be strong enough to shake them off.  If not, it would have been far better if we never saw freedom.  We have these gentlemen swelling out their capacious stomachs and carrying on a big way of living at the expense of the country.  We have the country becoming denuded of its population, male and female, by these kinds of people, by having at the top of this prosperity those Jews and gentiles. The Minister knows that as well as I do.  I ask him to give them the door, as they are coming in to him by the score to get the good things of life while our people are getting the bad things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy mentioned the grave difficulty of transport last Sunday from Cork to Limerick, but unfortunately he made one omission.  Realising that there are no Dublin papers, Deputy MacCarthy should have finished up by reminding the House, and particularly Deputy Davern, that the only satisfaction we had in Cork was that Cork beat Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Giles mentioned an item that has been discussed here and throughout the country year after year&mdash;the question of people coming in from other countries and starting industries here.  We are all anxious to see industry in the hands of Irish nationals, but it is not sufficient to stop at that.  We must be prepared to get over another particular difficulty. On many occasions we have found that Irish nationals engaged in industry here and with plenty of capital at their disposal are not prepared to extend their own premises or make a move forward in order to enter into an additional line of industrial activity.  They are satisfied with the rate of interest being returned on their capital outlay, as they feel it is sufficient to keep themselves in a certain standard of living.  We hear the rumblings of some of these Irish industrialists from time to time, complaining if we suggest that we could do with other people coming in to start industries here that some new Irish industrialists would not attempt to start themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one constituency alone, South <Col N="906" /> Cork, there are areas such as Passage West which are available for industry. That area is a depressed one where there were thriving industries noticeable very many years ago.  Unfortunately, that is not the position there at the present time.  If we were to ask some of our own Irish industrialists whether they were prepared to move into such an area and start an industry we know they would refuse. They have refused.  They have made no attempt to move into such areas.  Very often the demand is much greater than the supply but they are neither prepared to extend their premises nor move into other centres to get such industries going.</P>
    <P>In some of these areas suitable for industry, many conveniences being available there, we have the unfortunate spectacle of Irishmen and Irish girls having to go to England in order to earn their living.  That has been the position, not during the past 12 months or the past few years, but for the last 25 or 30 years.  I am prepared to admit the right of giving the first opportunity to Irish industrialists or Irish nationalists to start an industry in the places to which I have referred if they are prepared to do so.  If they are not prepared to do so, I must ask myself whether it would be better that the men and girls from these areas should go to England to earn their living and send home a few pounds to their people, or whether it would be better to permit other industrialists to come into this country, and let the Irishmen and girls earn their money from them in their own country.  I am not advocating the handing over of all industry to foreigners.  Very often the Irish industrialist refuses to extend his business because he believes that his net returns are satisfactory enough at the present time, and he objects to any danger of competition by foreign industrialists. That is one of the problems with which we are faced at the present time.</P>
    <P>We know that there can be and were abuses in relation to the 51 per cent. and 49 per cent. capital.  As long as Irish industrialists are prepared to move into such areas we must give them all the possible protection we can. If we are satisfied, from the returns <Col N="907" /> in the Department of Industry and Commerce, that these industrialists are not at present supplying the full home market, not to mind speaking of the foreign market, and are not prepared to endeavour to do so, then we will have ultimately to decide what we are going to do about letting the other type of manufacturer into this country.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that matter, I cannot agree that every foreigner coming to this country is a vulture ready to rob. Some of them may come under that category.  I think it is true to say that some of our Irish nationalists, not the majority of them, are as big a lot of vultures as any that will come into the country.  The small minority in Irish industry should not have nor be given the right to rob the working people here.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to draw attention.  In my opinion, it is a matter deserving of attention from the Minister and his Department.  I refer to the question of the staffing of the Department of Industry and Commerce in Cork City. Those of us who come from the South or any of the counties adjacent to Cork understand the importance of Cork City as a trade distributing centre.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems which are sent to Dublin for decision could be dealt with in Cork if the Minister, in relation to the staff in Cork City, empowered either a senior official or a senior inspector to come to decisions on small matters that arise in everyday business.  Why should it be necessary that, in respect of any small bit of business which the public may wish to transact in Government buildings in Cork City, it should be sent to Dublin for a decision?  Why cannot the staff at Cork, in respect of the majority of such cases, take the responsibility of giving a final decision?  Why should these matters be transmitted to Dublin for a decision?  What is behind it and why is it that Cork City should appear to be such a small provincial town in the eyes of the Department or of the Minister so far as matters in relation to the Department of Industry and Commerce are concerned?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> I am not making this statement, by way of a reflection upon the present Minister.  In approaching this Estimate, I have no intention of picking out matters on which it might suit me to attack either a Minister or a particular administration, nor am I going to pick out the points suitable to myself and to the Party to which I belong.  I believe we are justified in looking at the points that existed, whether in the last 12 months or in the last 20 years, and refer to them.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that the Minister should consider giving greater power in so far as this matter is concerned to the officials in Cork. These officials are as capable, as trustworthy, and as dependable as are the officials in Dublin.  I know that the Minister would not for one moment say otherwise.  Neither would any of his staff in Dublin.  If we want to get this Department into full swing and if we want to have the everyday work, the small items that crop up from day to day, dealt with expeditiously, then we should start off by giving greater power to the local officials of the Department in Cork. A senior inspector should be put there and he should be given the right of coming to a decision on these everyday matters in order that they might be finally decided upon.  We should have these matters dealt with immediately rather than have them sent up to Dublin for decision.</P>
    <P>There is also a matter I would like to touch upon, the food subsidies. There is no need for me to dwell on this matter nor have I any intention of doing so because the question of the food subsidies has been mentioned all through this debate.  With regard to the price of butter, I was informed very reliably that some people in village areas were not entitled to their butter rations the day before the increase.  The day the price of butter was increased was the day these people happened to be drawing their weekly ration of butter.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed of cases where the shopkeepers got that butter at the lower rate, the rationed rate, from the wholesalers but yet when their customers upon whom they are <Col N="909" /> depending to keep them in business went to get their ration of butter, although there was a free market on the first day, they were charged the higher rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been completely misinformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Such cases have been reported to me.  I am speaking for the county that defeated Tipperary. It is in respect of this county that I speak in relation to these matters.  I was informed of the case to which I have referred.  While the shopkeeper got the butter at the lower rate on the first morning of the derationing these customers were charged the increased prices.  I am standing by that statement.</P>
      <P>There is another matter about which there is a good deal of discussion in rural areas.  It is the problem that is created for the housewife by the high price of meat.  I do not intend to take sides with the farmer or the butcher, but the fact is that from the point of view of the housewife or the ordinary worker the price of meat is prohibitive. While we all agree about the necessity and the advantage of exports, our first consideration should be to see that our own citizens can have meat available to them at fairly reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to a man in the Ringaskiddy area.  He told me that on Saturday his wife goes down to the local butcher with 10/- in her hand, and comes home with a small bit of meat and 3d. change.  On Sunday the meat is cooked and, in the words of that old man, she has two forkfuls and he has two forkfuls.  That is all they have for their 9/9.</P>
      <P>The increase in the price of meat has not taken place overnight or even within a short period of time.  For some time back the prices charged for meat have been high.  It is important that this matter should be investigated to see if it is possible to reduce the price of such a necessary commodity to the people in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the position regarding Irish shipping.  There is no need for me to dwell on that matter, but I do say that it is a great advantage, and a matter of great pride that <Col N="910" /> we have a satisfactory shipping line of our own.  Those of us who live in coastal areas can take particular pride in this respect.  Just before the 1939 war, we explained at certain conferences in Dublin the necessity and the urgency for securing a shipping line of our own.  We were scoffed at at that time by many people and many public representatives.  We were told that our views were those of cranks, that it would be impossible for us to have a shipping line.  We know that the few ships we bought cost a lot of money.  By waiting as long as we did, we had to pay extra money for those ships, but even during the emergency they paid for themselves.  It is gratifying that, in the event of an emergency, the people will feel safe in the knowledge that they have at their disposal Irish ships manned by Irish seamen, as fine a type of seamen as can be got in any country.  It is well to know that in that respect we are certainly advancing towards the goal that was envisaged in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the present position regarding rural electrification. Rural electrification can be of the greatest advantage.  I know that it is difficult to satisfy every member of this House who asks that the areas in his particular constituency should come under the scheme in the shortest possible time.  While I realise the capital cost involved in this great venture, I say that it is incumbent on the board to provide the amenities and the advantages which accrue from electrification on an easier basis than is the case at the present time.  I am not blaming the officials.  They are acting 100 per cent. according to the rules laid down.  I do not know of any case where one place was favoured more than another, except on the basis of the revenue which was anticipated would be derived.  As areas which will produce most revenue are brought within the scope of the scheme, I hope that that will be an incentive to the board to move into other areas and to give to these less thickly populated areas the advantages of the scheme and ultimately bring the whole country into the scheme.  I hope the policy will not be the policy adopted by the Electricity Supply Board in all the <Col N="911" /> years back.  Instead of charges being reduced to the consumer by the Electricity Supply Board over a number of years, the plain truth is that, in addition to a high meter charge, charges have soared considerably to the consumer in the rural areas that were connected with the Shannon scheme lighting, as it was called at that time.</P>
    <P>The people are prepared to pay their share in order to get the advantages of electrification, but the Minister should consider the number of increases that have been imposed on customers by the Electricity Supply Board for a number of years.  It is because of these various increases that people in areas where rural electrification could be carried out at the present time are slow to accept the scheme.  I, therefore, consider that, instead of being classified as a concern which must get back a full return in the shortest possible time, our policy should be to expect to get back the capital expended over a greater number of years, plus whatever small remuneration may be necessary to cover running costs.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here by a number of Deputies of the position of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister himself mentioned the losses that must be faced in the coming year.  These losses are very big, and it is a tragedy that the country should be faced with them.  I am not satisfied that Córas Iompair Éireann should be consistently demanding from the ordinary people increased bus fares in order to keep revenue up to a certain level.  I firmly believe the Minister is anxious that Córas Iompair Éireann should pay its way.  How can the company hope to continue to make a profit on the running of the buses when they are continually increasing the fares, although they are aware that there is a large element of competition in the form of private cars?  How can they continue to make a profit on the buses when they introduce a distinction between Dublin residents and the residents in rural areas?  While I could elaborate on this point and say that Córas Iompair Éireann make dozens of <Col N="912" /> such distinctions, I will confine myself to one.  Why is it that Córas Iompair Éireann charge 1/3 for a distance of 13 or 14 miles between Dublin and Bray while they charge 2/- for a distance of 13 miles between Cork and Crosshaven &mdash;towns which the company admit are on the second and most important roads in the Twenty-Six Counties?  That is one of the hidden methods of Córas Iompair Éireann which the public fail to understand.  By this distinction and by continually increasing bus fares, the company are doing all they possibly can to prevent people from using the buses.  I might say, in passing, that the public get little or no satisfaction by pointing these things out to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied as regards the measured distances Córas Iompair Éireann have fixed in certain parts of County Cork.  I maintained in this House before that they have made certain incorrect measurements and charged certain rates.  I maintain that, in many cases, the distances are not as much as they are claimed to be by Córas Iompair Éireann.  If such a policy is maintained, the public will be forced to abandon the buses&mdash;the one branch of Córas Iompair Éireann which could easily give a profit.  It would be to the company's advantage if the road services were improved.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned bad management.  I drew attention to it last year, and I will draw attention to it now by mentioning one particular instance.  Sea sand was brought by rail from Courtmacsherry&mdash;a small seaside town&mdash;to Bandon.  There was lime in the town of Bandon ready to be sent to Courtmacsherry.  Instead of this lime being sent to Courtmacsherry in the train which brought the sea sand, Córas Iompair Éireann decided to have it transported by lorries, and the lorries then returned empty to Bandon.  Yet these are the great Czars of industry about whom we hear so much.  That goes to show that, wherever the fault lies, there is bad management in the company.</P>
    <P>I would not say that the incompetency and the inefficiency are the fault of the ordinary worker.  A flaw in the organisation which needs investigation <Col N="913" /> exists somewhere between the management and the ordinary worker. The Minister is the only person who can bring the company to heel.  He can tell them what he considers to be the proper way for them to act.  He can point out to them that they should not charge the people in Cork a higher bus fare than they charge Dublin residents for the same number of miles.</P>
    <P>Members also mentioned the conditions prevailing in industries in rural areas.  Deputies MacCarthy, Kyne, Michael Patrick Murphy and others dealt with Irish slates.  Much has been said on this subject.  I know of men in portion of south-west Cork who have been engaged in this industry for many years.  They are industrialists in a small way only, and they are not in a position to get the improved machinery which they desire.  That is one of their biggest difficulties, but there is also the question of a loan. While I am not suggesting to the Minister that he should give large grants to small quarry owners, I think that he should try to understand their difficulties and help them out of them.  We would then be on the road to improving an industry which would mean a lot to this country.  Of course, there is another side to the picture.  The proprietors of the large tile concerns in this country and the manufacturers of concrete tiles do not wish for competition from the Irish slate.  However, those of us who have been connected with building for many years know that no comparison can be drawn between the concrete tile and the good Irish slate.</P>
    <P>The Minister discussed the problem of tourism.  We all know the benefits which can flow to us from this industry. The line taken by most speakers here was that we should greet with open arms the tourist from America who comes here to spend his dollars and the tourist from other countries.  We are willing to welcome them and to treat them as well as we possibly can. However, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to another matter which was brought to my attention no later than a few days ago.  Inquiries were sent from Carrigaline in the South Cork area to a noted tourist centre as to accommodation and the <Col N="914" /> cost of meals for between 80 and 90 people.  One of these tourist concerns about which we shout so much here and which we say we must do all we possibly can to help did not even bother to reply.  The others replied by giving a blank refusal, saying that they could not cater for these people.  A further inquiry was sent asking if it would be possible if the party were divided up and catered for by four or five of these hotels, instead of one hotel catering for the whole party, but they told us that even the four or five hotels could not cater for these people.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we have the tourist, the foreigner, coming in here being received with outstretched arms, and if, when he goes back to the United States, to Great Britain or elsewhere, we see a letter in the papers here referring to the grand feeding he had in this country, the pleasant way he was treated and the nice and hospitable way in which the Irish hoteliers received him, we are delighted.  On the other hand, we have Irish people, working people, who are willing to pay their way but to whom, because they are not the elite, people who come across the salt water, facilities are not alone not granted, but even the courtesy of a reply in one case is denied.  When we speak of tourism, we must keep in mind giving facilities to our own people if they find it convenient or possible to go on holidays. They are entitled to the same respect as any tourist&mdash;if not more respect&mdash; who may come in here.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned recently the danger of prices not going down and of the possible danger of their increasing. On a certain occasion he made a statement encouraging people&mdash;perhaps he believed he was justified&mdash;to buy. He expressed doubts as to the wisdom of a continuation of controlled prices, but I should like the Minister to remember&mdash;I am sure he knows&mdash;that there is one section which during the emergency years fleeced the people.  I say that without any desire to take advantage of the privileges of this House.  These are people concerned in the drapery trade and it is fantastic to suggest that, in many instances, they did other than fleece the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> I am aware of cases in which large drapery stores had certain fixed prices and immediately on the notification from the factory of increased prices of goods which they had not got, they put up the price of goods which they had in stock for a period and which were listed at lower prices.  I have heard some of these industrialists, these new men of wisdom, justifying themselves by putting up the case that, while they held stocks at certain prices, they must be in a position to reap such rewards so as to indemnify themselves against possible losses on stocks in the future.  Yet we have the Minister making a statement, from his own knowledge not alone as a Minister but as a man who has studied the problems of industry&mdash;a statement which he believes is correct and which I am not disputing&mdash;about the danger of prices not alone not holding their present level but going up further.</P>
    <P>I consider that at present the greatest fallacy that can be put forward is an argument in favour of decontrol.  I know that these traders and many others like them did see to it that the maximum prices fixed were always their minimum prices and then we have some of these people ready to pounce on the worker and to say that the worker is not giving the return he should, and, at the same time, these self-appointed lay apostles of honesty take advantage of the situation by making the maximum prices fixed their minimum charges.  I want to say with regard to prices and stocks carried by some of these wholesalers, retailers and manufacturers that the prices they are charging are not in true conformity with their costs and undoubtedly, so far as certain stocks are concerned, they are always ready to go with the market, so long as it is in their favour, that is, so long as prices are increasing, but are never prepared to make any move towards reducing prices when they are in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that affects people outside Dublin.  I can assure the Chair that I will not create any difficulty by being out of order, but Dublin always has the advantage.  No <Col N="916" /> matter what Government is in office, Dublin seems to be the only part of the country that counts, except when the Government depend on the votes of the country fellows.  When Ministers have got on to the Front Bench, however, the country fellows are forgotten. I am not referring to any particular side of the House, but the fact is that neither we nor the constituencies we represent are even considered when it comes to a question of industry.  It is Dublin which gets all the consideration, although Dublin is top heavy, and, in some years to come, the position will be that there will be no county, because the city will have spread over the whole county.</P>
    <P>One of the other abuses in connection with cheaper prices for Dublin and dearer prices for the country is in the matter of petrol.  We heard about the problem of the alcohol factories, but, now that that spirit is being exported, I suggest that the Minister should look into this matter of petrol.  Although the Minister did not give me any satisfaction when I raised this matter in a parliamentary question some months ago, he did not say that the matter was outside his jurisdiction. His reply was that it was the custom over the years to give petrol companies, Irish companies and subsidiaries of other companies, the right to rob the people of rural Ireland.  It is time for that to cease.  That has been going on, not for 12 months, not for three years, but for many years back.  Considering the enormous amount of petrol used in the country, surely the people are entitled, as taxpayers, as ratepayers, as people living under an Irish Constitution, to an assurance that no industry, firm or combine, Irish or foreign, will be given the right to rob them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy mentioned two undeveloped areas in which I have naturally been interested.  I have attempted to raise their problems by way of question here during the last three or four years.  I refer to Ringabella, where the old lead mines were, and Raffen, near Passage West. They are not so much undeveloped <Col N="917" /> areas as depressed areas.  Deputy MacCarthy intended well&mdash;and I give him credit for that&mdash;when he stressed the importance of industries for these areas.  A survey about 1932, however, reported that the lead mines at Ringabella were in such a condition that they could not be worked economically. Is there a possibility for a cement factory at Raffen?  The answer, of course, will be that it must queue up with all the other places which are seeking a cement factory.</P>
    <P>As Deputy MacCarthy said, we are getting no closer to solving the problem of industries for rural Ireland. The curse of the country is this overawing, over-powering idea of Dublin over all.  It is useless for Deputy MacCarthy, myself or any other member, to stress continuously here the necessity for industrial employment in rural areas.  Like my colleague, Deputy Kyne, I was sorry that neither the Minister nor a majority of the House was prepared to face this problem when they had the chance offered by the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  Every part of the country does not come within its scope but people in depressed areas must live and the people of Kinsale and Passage&mdash;some of the oldest towns of the country with a longer history than most others&mdash;have to live too. Surely the people there are not intended for export.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise&mdash;as I believe he does&mdash;that as we cannot get industrialists to move into those areas in spite of certain advantages there, we have no alternative except the State to move in.  After all the State has advantages which no ordinary industrialist could have or expect to have.  In the south and south-west we have the raw material of an industry manufacturing by-products of kelp and seaweed.  Some industries based on this important raw material have, of course, been commenced in the west, but that should not be the beginning and the end of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the views expressed by Deputy MacCarthy and by others of us here.  We are not simply an Opposition in this House. We are not prepared simply to come <Col N="918" /> here and oppose anything proposed by a Government with which we are not connected.  We are here to co-operate with any measure which will foster the prosperity and progress of our people. Whatever Government may be in power, we will co-operate so long as it recognises the urgent need to establish industries in rural Ireland.  The Minister may think that our criticism is destructive, but we are endeavouring to the utmost of our ability to do the best we can for the people of our constituencies. On the other hand, how can we be expected to co-operate unless the Government do their best for the people of these areas?  The Undeveloped Areas Bill, from the point of view of the south-west at any rate, was shortsighted and fell far short of the target.  I know nothing of the west; my responsibility is to the south and the south-west.  That was a Bill which will never result in our being able to tell the young men and girls of our areas that the time has come when they need not emigrate.  All we can tell them is that that Bill and the measures which will flow from it will never give industries to areas which are forsaken, lonesome and depressed. As a result of a vote in this House, unfortunately, these towns have no hope of industrial development in the foreseeable future.  So long as we have that policy, the country will be denuded of many of its best men and women, who must go to foreign countries for employment, as they have no hope in their own country.</P>
    <P>There is no use in speaking of our small population; there is no use in pious resolutions; there is no use in the Taoiseach himself saying, as he did about 1934, that the country could hold a population of 16,000,000 people.  It could&mdash;provided we had industries.  If we had 2,000,000 more people here at the present time, however, what prospect could we hold out to them? Every member here is furnished with a document from the statistics branch showing the numbers drawing unemployment assistance and home assistance, the number of people classified as having no means.  Surely it is degrading in the extreme that we have to admit that such a number of people are unemployed in a country which, as <Col N="919" /> the Taoiseach believed in 1934, could feed and support 16,000,000 people.</P>
    <P>We have a large number of people emigrating every year.  For three years members of the present Government when in Opposition continuously harped on the problem of emigration. They believed they were justified. They believed it was a curse to this country.  Now we have no hope of seeing the tide of emigration stopped. There seems to be a full tide in this country all the time so far as emigration is concerned.  That seems to be the unfortunate position all the time. It has not been remedied during the last 12 months.  Therefore, I say to the Minister that the less politics we have on this issue and the less control we have of the activities of small business people by the banks in this country the better.</P>
    <P>Small builders down the country who have been in the building industry for a long number of years are now unfortunately going bankrupt.  There is a certain amount of money coming to these people from local authorities on account of houses which they built, but on account of a clause in their contracts, a certain portion of that money has to be held back for roughly eight or nine months.  While they are assured of getting every penny of that money, the unfortunate position is that some of these small contractors who helped us enormously in the last couple of years by building houses in rural areas, and who are men of honesty and integrity, because their money is tied up in the hands of local authorities and because of the policy of the banks and of the Central Bank, are now bankrupt. That policy is going to prove ruinous. Whatever mistakes have been made in the past, there is no use in crying over spilt milk.  The Minister should realise that the policy of restriction of credit is proving disastrous for the small businessman and the small building contractors who built houses in the rural areas.  As long as that policy is in operation we will have very great difficulties in connection with industry, and we can never hope to bring commerce to the point of success and efficiency to which it must be brought if there is to be any hope for the people <Col N="920" /> to live as citizens in their own country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding feature of this debate up to the present has been the feeling of anxiety in regard to the future expressed by those who took part in the debate and the feeling of disgust with the present Government owing to the fact that the speeches of many Ministers from July last have accelerated the trade recession and the position that exists at present in regard to unemployment.  Up to last year, when the present Government took responsibility, aided by a few dependent Independents, we have enjoyed a period of stability and security and one that held out great prospects for the future.  No sooner had the Government changed than an effort was made by Ministers to make people believe that they had been ruled by a bad Government.  One speech after another was designed to create that impression in the minds of our people and that resulted in the creation of instability and further unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce deals with the second largest sphere of our activities.  Industrial development had its origin in the introduction of the hydro-electric scheme into this country in spite of opposition from the Party now forming the Government.  A few days ago we heard the Minister appealing to the people to buy now.  But the general complaint by the Government during the last year was that our people were over-spending, that they were living beyond their means.  Now the Minister tries to retrieve the position brought about by himself and the other members of the Cabinet by asking the people to spend now.  In order to try to get them to spend he tells them there is no prospect of prices coming down and that they might as well spend their money now. That, apparently, is the new attitude. It is an effort to bring to an end the trade recession which was deliberately designed and planned by several of the Ministers in the present Government. Their gloomy speeches and the doom they predicted for this country <Col N="921" /> inflicted a cruel blow upon the trade and commerce of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that the impression which the Minister tried to create in the minds of our people a few days ago by asking them to buy now will mark a change in the attitude of the Government towards the betterment of conditions in this country.  I hope that it will mean the turning point in the artificial recession deliberately brought about by the present Government.  The &ldquo;pep&rdquo; talks which we have had from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the fantastic plans must now find some kind of basis, and it is up to the Minister to make a practical approach towards applying a remedy to the position that exists now.  Public confidence has been shaken, and it will have to be restored if we are to expect the return to the conditions which the people enjoyed for three and a half years under the inter-Party Government. The Minister and his colleagues will have a very difficult task in trying to retrieve the position which has been deliberately thrown away, and recovery will be difficult.  The Government must face the consequences for the position that now exists.  There was a good measure of prosperity during the period of office of the inter-Party Government and a good measure of employment.  Fewer people were unemployed in the country at the time of the change of Government than at any time since we became responsible for the management of our own affairs. We were told before the change of Government that Fianna Fáil had 400 projects in hands before they went out of office in 1948.  We have not heard anything about them yet since the Government returned to office, although they have been 13 months in office now. Certainly, during the last year, some efforts have been made towards the establishment of boards and different authorities to investigate the possibility of industrial development, but surely the details of these 400 projects must be somewhere and should have been produced during the last 12 months when the number of unemployed was increasing at the rate of 1,000 per month.</P>
    <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil Deputies <Col N="922" /> speaking here it was remarkable to observe that they apparently deliberately avoided any reference to the cost of living.  Last year the complaint was that butter had gone up by 2d. a lb. and the loaf by ½d.  That was the cry last year when they were seeking the support of the people at the elections. Statistics show that the increase in the cost of living from 1948 to 1951 was 3 per cent., whereas the national income and incomes generally were increased on the average by 20 per cent. leaving a balance of 17 per cent. in favour of the people.  In the last 12 months, the cost of living has increased by 17 per cent., leaving the people as bad as they were when the inter-Party Government took office in 1948. Speaking at New Street on the 26th May, 1951, the Minister as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> said: &ldquo;The cost of living was now 5 per cent. higher than the highest point reached during the most difficult period of the war.&rdquo; Well, if it was 5 per cent. higher on the 26th May, 1951, it is 22 per cent. higher now and nobody knows that better than the people in the country. Every week and every month since last July, increases in prices have been announced, increases have been sanctioned and prices have been decontrolled, resulting in fantastic increases in the cost of living over the period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I feel that the decontrol of prices and the sanctioning of increases in many cases was not justified.  It was a case of trying to please pressure groups who had been resisted continuously by the inter-Party Ministers. The dual price system has also been abolished with the withdrawal of subsidies and the ending of rationing. The people now can decide for themselves whether it would have been better to continue the dual price system.  It would have ensured at any rate that the poor people would get rations at the old price.  Now there is rationing for the poor people and none for the rich people because the new prices in themselves will be a very effective method of rationing for the poor.  The better-off people will not be rationed but the poorer people will certainly find that they must cut their cloth according to their measure <Col N="923" /> inasmuch as they will not be able to buy unlimited supplies of essential foods.  It is obvious, as a result of the withdrawal of subsidies, that the poor people will have to eat less or they will have to change from the types of food which they have been accustomed to eat.</P>
    <P>The most remarkable change in prices has been in relation to meat.  I propose to give an example of some of the changes that have taken place. When the change of Government took place last year, the price of sirloin steak was 2/10 a lb., now it is 4/-; roast beef was 2/6, now it is 3/3 a lb.; round steak was 2/2, now it is 3/-; minced steak was 1/6, now it is 2/6, and even then it contains excessive fat and poor quality meat.  Housewives in many cases are obliged to have rib and round steak minced: it seems to be more economical.  Rib steak at the change of Government was 2/1 a lb., now it is 2/8; neck mutton was 1/8 a lb., now it is 2/8.  Suet was 1/2, now it is 1/8 a lb.  Similarly the price of bacon was decontrolled and the price of the various cuts of bacon and of sausages have increased in much the same proportion as the price of other meats during the last 13 months.</P>
    <P>Last year, when meat was being decontrolled, I read in the <i>Irish Press</i> that it would mean cheaper meat.  I have read out there the prices of seven different cuts of meat, every one of which shows a remarkable increase. It has resulted in putting meat from the dining table of many people.  Certainly it has had the effect of compelling them to have fewer meat days than they had before.  The Sunday dinner is certainly an expensive item at those prices at the present time. The price of butter, as compared with that which prevailed at the time of the change of Government, has gone up by 1/-; flour has gone up from 2/8 to 4/9 and tea is going to cost at least 4/- or 4/6 per lb.  The loaf of bread has gone up from 6½d. to 9d. I should like to say in connection with tea, that certainly the dear tea that has become available is of very good quality.  I think most people who <Col N="924" /> have bought the higher grade tea can see that it is of very good quality.  I should like to know whether in fact the cheapest grade tea, available now at something round 5/-, is the inferior tea made available to the people when rationing was in force.  Certainly the tea made available to the people on the ration could only be described as inferior.  There was a large proportion of dust in it.  One wonders now where has all the dust gone.  Is it going to be sold to the people at the 5/- rate?  Many of the poorer families as a result of the increase in the price of butter will be obliged to change back to margarine.  One happy development which took place during the years from 1947 onwards was that our people ate more butter.  In fact, in 1950 the average consumption of butter was 13 ounces per head per week&mdash;nearly 1 lb. per head per week for every man, woman and child in the country.  The poorer families will now be obliged to turn to margarine and to animal fats, as they cannot afford butter, particularly in the case of larger families.</P>
    <P>The change, as far as food prices is concerned, comes very badly from the Fianna Fáil Government when we remember point 15 of their programme, which indicated that, if elected as a Government, they intended to maintain the subsidies and control prices.  They have been busy decontrolling prices and sanctioning increases since they came into office, and now they have withdrawn the best part of the subsidies.  The real purpose of the Prices Advisory Body is being defeated, and has been defeated by the policy of decontrolling prices.  It was set up in order to maintain a fair balance in the matter of prices between the consumers and distributors of goods, and was called in as a referee.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of emigration during the last 13 months.  If all that emigration had not taken place, it would be hard to estimate how many more people would be on the unemployed list at the present time.  It is remarkable, too, that the figures for emigration cannot be given to us now.  When the inter-Party Government was in office, it was <Col N="925" /> being constantly asked to give those figures, and they were always available. It was always able to produce the figures and explain exactly what was required by those who were interested.  Now, when we ask about emigration, we are given all kinds of excuses, but we are not given the figures.</P>
    <P>Emigration has risen very rapidly since the change of Government.  The inter-Party Government put 38,000 people into new jobs during the 38 months it was in office.  That is to say, we put 1,000 people per month into new employment.  Now, even excluding all the people who have emigrated, the number who have lost their jobs in the last 13 months exceeds more than 1,000 per month.  The unemployment figure was reduced to its lowest level during the inter-Party régime.  Yet the Fianna Fáil Party, who were in opposition at that time, did their best to make the people believe that conditions could be improved if they had a Fianna Fáil Government.  They have certainly seen the difference during the last 13 months.</P>
    <P>During the inter-Party régime, workers were on full time and on overtime, working three shifts round the clock in many factories.  In similar factories they are now on short time or on slack time.  The Balbriggan hosiery factory has practically closed down, and yet we have English nylons on sale here.  The Balbriggan factories are capable of producing them, but they just cannot go into competition with the English nylons which are on sale here.  We are also busy importing finished clothing.  In the time of the inter-Party Government, if an article in its finished state was imported, the Government was criticised very bitterly.  Now, in spite of the difficult times that exist, with an increase in unemployment and a trade recession, we are busy importing finished clothing.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that he did not propose to abolish the Industrial Development Authority.  I think the setting up of that body was a great step forward in the effort to industrialise this country to the maximum.  We have been trying to industrialise <Col N="926" /> it during the last 25 years, aided mainly by electricity.  During that period many industries have been firmly established here, but the 25 years were not sufficient to establish here all the industries which could be established to provide the goods we normally use.  That process is continuing, and we are still importing goods which we could make here.  I am quite sure, however, that in a practical and progressive way, factories with capital will be established so that it will not be necessary for us to import goods which could be manufactured here.  The position exists at any rate that we are importing goods that we could manufacture.  I believe, myself, that it is only a matter of time &mdash;the sooner the better&mdash;until we have factories established that will cut out the need for importing goods which we need ourselves.</P>
    <P>I believe that the real worth of the Industrial Development Authority was that it could gather together all the statistics necessary for the purpose of making a study of the prospects of establishing industries such as I have referred to.  I would like to know from the Minister whether, when these investigations have been carried out by this authority, if he finds that private enterprise is not inclined to put forward the money and does not appear to be interested in some particular project, the Government will publish some kind of a prospectus to encourage people to invest their money in industry.  We read in the newspapers, for instance, that &ldquo;Jones (Ireland), Limited, with £500,000 capital, propose to establish an industry&rdquo;, and invite people to buy shares.  In that way, subscriptions are obtained from the public.  Where private enterprise and private capital do not appear to be interested in establishing some industry which the Government and the Industrial Development Authority consider to be desirable, I wonder could the Government issue a prospectus inviting people with money to invest it in a project of that nature.  If the Government were to do so, it would probably catch the eye of somebody who otherwise would not be aware of the possibility of investing money in such a project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> I was wondering, too, whether the Control of Manufactures Act should be relaxed.  That Act was brought in for a purpose, and it served its purpose. At this stage, however, it might be desirable to invite the investment of capital from outside the country for the purpose of giving worth-while employment to Irish workers.  There are people outside the country who might become aware of conditions in a certain industry which might be quite new to people within the country.  The experience of those with foreign money would be valuable, and for that reason I was wondering whether it would be possible to encourage the investment of foreign capital here to a greater extent than at present.  Of course, at present, such investment is controlled by the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to trade protection and tariff levels, I would like to know from the Minister whether he has any proposal in mind to make goods available cheaply to our people: in other words, to ensure that they will not have to pay too much for the protection of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for our people to pay heavily for goods produced in Irish industry when it is first established and in the initial years but, as time goes on, those industries should become efficient and should be in a position to make goods available at a cheaper rate to our people.  I feel that the only way of ensuring that position would be to bring down in a very gradual way the level of protection. I believe it would result in making Irish industry even more efficient and certainly it would result in the goods being made available to our people at a lower price.  When our people pay, and pay heavily, for the establishment of Irish industries through the operation of tariffs and protection walls it is only fair that, in the long run, they should get the benefit of the industry which their money established in the earlier years.</P>
    <P>There was much talk from the Minister and his colleagues during the past year regarding our adverse trade balance.  The present Government <Col N="928" /> were in office for half of the year and they did nothing about it.</P>

      <P>References were made here to the possibility either of expanding the existing cement factories or establishing new ones.  Every Deputy seems to want a cement factory in his own constituency.  I suppose I will not be out of place when I suggest that the land owned by the Portland Cement Company near Skerries should be considered as a suitable place for a cement industry.  As a matter of fact, the Portland Cement Company had that land before the cement company down at Drogheda. Some references were made here to the need for an expansion of our cement factories and the production of <Col N="929" /> our own cement but no attempt was made after the war to expand our existing cement factories.  In fact, some of the cement being produced at our own factories was being exported to Great Britain for the purpose of rebuilding the towns and cities demolished during the war.  I feel that that was the time for us to set about expanding the existing cement factories or creating new ones but nothing was done about it.  The inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 and began a vigorous housing drive.  The full production of cement in this country was absorbed and, in fact, it was necessary for the inter-Party Government to import as much more cement again in order to keep pace with the housing development which was taking place during those years.  Even at this stage, I feel that it will be necessary for us in the long run to expand our existing factories or to find a new source from which we can obtain native cement.</P>
      <P>Nearly 400 factories were established during the three years of inter-Party government.  I agree that 20 or 30 of them were established in 1947, before the inter-Party Government took office, but then they are balanced by the 50 new factories that have gone into operation in the past year and the plans for which, of course, were already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to bring to the notice of the Minister that there appears to be at present a great number of second-hand cars.  In nearly every garage you can see a large number of second-hand cars.  It is obvious either that the people are not going to buy these cars or that they have now satisfied their full requirements in the matter of private transport.  For that reason, I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of permitting the export of these second-hand cars which are lying up at present and are out of use.  It is obvious that they are not wanted here in this country.  If they were, they would be purchased by people wishing to provide themselves with private transport.  I am sure that the Minister can verify from the motor industry that the position is as I have stated it to be, namely, that there is a large number of second-hand <Col N="930" /> cars.  The people in the industry would be glad if we could find a market for the cars outside this country.</P>

      <P>The position is different if there is no waiting list, but I should like to be sure that there is no waiting list.  I understand that there is a waiting list and that it is a very long one&mdash;almost three years.  I am aware that, as a result of the cut in the export of cars to Australia, it is possible that more cars are becoming available in Great Britain to the people there.  I should like the Minister to allow these second-hand cars out of the country as quickly as possible.  It is obvious that there are more cars in the country at the moment than the people need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Minister towards the hand-won turf problem? We have been confused by several statements from the Minister regarding this matter.  When the inter-Party Government came into office they decided at that time not to go ahead with the programme of the previous year when, during that year, four years' supply of hand-won turf was harvested and gathered in the Phoenix Park which eventually went to waste. It was indicated by the Minister and his colleagues when the inter-Party Government were in office that they would insist on the use of hand-won turf, certainly in factories and institutions if not in private houses.  I know that many institutions have gone over to oil burners for heating purposes and many others will take coal in preference to turf.  We should have a statement of policy from the Minister regarding that matter so that the institutions concerned will do something <Col N="931" /> in relation to turf if the Minister considers that he ought to continue in the attitude which he adopted in previous years towards hand-won turf.</P>
    <P>Regarding electricity, we now propose, apparently, to establish some fuel generating stations and I would like the Minister to indicate how much extra these will eventually cost in relation to, for instance, a hydro-electric scheme, or take wind velocity or tidal waters.  I think a fuel generating scheme is the most expensive type of electricity for which our people would have to pay.  We have a couple at the present time, but is it desirable for us to pursue that line or would it be better for us to examine our own resources and proceed with the establishment of hydro-electric schemes for the purpose of supplying electricity?  I feel that in the long run hydro-electric schemes would provide our people with plenty of cheap electricity compared with fuel generating stations.  There is a limit to the time during which these stations can be provided with fuel even if it is a very long time and then there is always the danger of stoppages. There is also the cost of the material being supplied to those stations.  If the cost moves upward, the cost of the electricity to our people will move upward but in the case of hydro-electric schemes what supplies the electricity does not alter in cost.  Only the operation of it might alter.  Hydro-electricity is cheaper than electricity which we could get from oil, coal or turf.  In the long run it would be much better for us to pursue that line and we should only provide fuel generating stations so far as it is considered necessary in the national interests.</P>
    <P>Meter charges in towns and cities are a problem for many people at the present time, particularly the people going into new houses where valuations in relation to the size of the house are much higher than the valuation applied to houses of similar sizes which were constructed many years ago.  It is a heavy burden on many people going into those new houses. People in the fringe areas of Dublin <Col N="932" /> City, probably Cork City and in many of the towns consider that some kind of adjustment should be made which would ensure that the meter charges would not be so heavy and that they would be related in some way to the cubic capacity or the size of the house rather than the modern valuation which is very different compared with the valuation which was applied to similar houses years ago.</P>
    <P>Tourism.  Early this year great hopes were expressed that the tourist industry would bring to this country a greater income than agriculture itself. Up to the present, I do not think that these hopes will be realised.  It appears from many holiday resorts that the tourism that was expected as a result of the restriction in the allowance to £25 for people leaving Great Britain and going to the Continent would cause great numbers of people to come into this country.  For some reason, however, that great influx that was expected is not taking place and I, do not think we are going to get the numbers we had expected this year. But whatever it may be, I would like the Minister to ensure through the boards that he has established that the visitors will be treated well and facilitated in every way, realising the real value of this industry even if it is not going to bring as much to us as it did in previous years.  It was regrettable that no effort was made by the Government to settle the hotel strike, which went on for 37 weeks. Many hotels during that time were not able to give a specific undertaking to people inquiring about accommodation that it would be available to them during the holiday season.  That strike probably has had an adverse effect so far as tourism in this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>The air service in Collinstown is now paying.  Great credit is due to the management there for the manner in which they have developed the air service and given the facilities that anybody going through Collinstown airport knows about.  I do not know whether they are absolutely in the clear yet or whether they are slightly in the red owing to the fact that aviation is subsidised to a certain extent. I think subsidisation amounts to <Col N="933" /> £500,000.  The Minister would be able to give me the correct figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that Collinstown is absolutely in the clear. I am not in favour of the proposal thrown out by the Minister for the establishment of a transatlantic air service.  I feel that a transatlantic air service could only be a paying proposition for a country with a reasonably large population, but with a population of a bare 3,000,000 people, I do not believe that it would be possible for this country to have a transatlantic air service which could pay its way, and at the present time it is desirable to ensure that air services should pay their way like any other activities, considering that we are so anxious that Córas Iompair Éireann will come nearer to paying its way than it is now.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister the fact that at least 100 Córas Iompair Éireann workers were laid off recently.  The position is becoming worse.  Many of them are under notice and the prospect for them appears to be pretty bad.  It is difficult to visualise how the railways will ever pay. Many of us have had the experience of seeing quite long trains on the Dublin-Belfast or Dublin-Cork route carrying a very small number of passengers.  That is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to make the railways pay.  Under those conditions no railway could show a profit.  It seems to me that the future prospect for the railways lies in the direction of carrying goods rather than passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister complained that Deputy Dillon had purchased 100,000 tons of fertilisers without consulting <Col N="934" /> anybody.  What has happened to those fertilisers?  It is odd that fertilisers that were purchased at £9 per ton should now cost £16 10s. per ton.</P>

      <P>That is so.  Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke about the steel industry at Haulbowline. That industry is entirely dependent on steel and iron imported from Great Britain and if such imports should cease for any reason the industry would have to close down.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned shipbuilding. It is regrettable that an effort was not made prior to the war to provide a graving dock for the purpose of shipbuilding. Apparently it was the threat of war which originally caused the Government to consider shipbuilding here.  It is desirable that we should build our own ships but we will have to wait until the new graving dock is completed before we can proceed with that very essential work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have alcohol factories which <Col N="935" /> function at the moment through the medium of charging motorists and lorry owners an extra 6d. per gallon for petrol.  These factories seem to be a liability rather than an asset and the Minister should examine into the position. When they were established it was alleged that their function would be to take potatoes off the farmers' hands at 30/- per ton.  It was on that basis they were considered to be economic.  It is a long time since potatoes were 30/- per ton and motorists are now obliged to pay 6d. per gallon more for petrol in order to keep these factories in operation. It was pointed out that if these factories were closed and the State paid the staffs their wages for the rest of their lives that would be cheaper in the long run than continuing the factories in operation.</P>

      <P>I wish I knew what did.  Whatever was done between the Minister and Mr. Butler has had an adverse effect on trade and industry here.  The policy of the present Government has brought about the instability and anxiety that exists at the moment.  I have noticed that on a few occasions the Minister has taken a different line from that of his colleagues. He did state that he would pursue a policy diametrically opposed to that recommended by the Central Bank.  His colleagues, on the other hand, accepted the recommendations of the Central Bank and so far they appear to have had things their way. The Minister now appears to be <Col N="936" /> changing direction again.  I hope his colleagues will change direction with him.  Such a change might be for the better.  It certainly could not be for worse.</P>

      <P>Speakers on the Government Benches last week talked as if it would only take time for the people to become used to the increased prices of essential commodities.  If those Deputies went to the small towns and rural areas and asked the people there if it would take them some time to get used to the increases, they know what reply they would get.  Deputy Killilea wants us to believe they will get used to the increases in a short time.  What are the increases?  Deputy Rooney read out some of them.  Surely the housewife will take some time to get used to the increase of 1/- a stone on flour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>These increases will not show themselves in a week or a fortnight.  It is next November or December or next March the increase will show itself.  The people will not get used in a week or a month to an increase from 1/- to 2/- in the stone of flour or from 6d. to 10d. for a 2 lb. loaf, or an increase from 2/8 to 5/-or possibly 6/- or 7/- for a lb. of tea. The farmer who must purchase a stone of sugar will not get used in a week <Col N="937" /> or a month to an increase of 3/- in that, by the removal of the subsidies, nor will people become used in two or three months to paying 3/10 for a lb. of butter that used to cost 3/- when it was subsidised.  Those are a burden on the poorer sections of the people living in the cities and big towns and poorer areas.  Three-quarters of the people in North Mayo have to depend on flour, tea, sugar, bread and butter for their existence for nine months of the year.  They are areas where they could grow only sufficient potatoes and corn to give them food for three months.  They will have less to spend and will have to eat less and adopt a lower standard of living.</P>
      <P>In those areas there is unemployment. There was never a bigger number unemployed than there is at present.  In my area, which is turf producing, there are stocks of hand-won turf on the roadside, produced by the people there.  The head of the household made arrangements to cut the turf and the family saved it and put it on the roadside.  That was a great income to that family but that income has disappeared as there is no market for that class of turf this year. Last year there was a market for it, as the institutions in the county purchased all the available hand-won turf.  They stored it and it is in stock.  The Minister should make an Order that a certain amount of turf be cut every year and stored by institutions in the county and by institutions in the adjoining counties where local turf is not available. That would give a big outlet and would increase the income of the poorer sections of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The withdrawal of the subsidies will have a serious effect on local authorities. Next year it will affect the rates. The Estimates were made out last March for the year commencing 1st April.  Those increases will show themselves this year and the authorities will have to meet the extra cost over a period of nine months, plus the increase next year for 12 months. That will mean increased rates.  The increased cost of food in institutions is due to the withdrawal of the subsidies by the Government.  The Minister <Col N="938" /> put a tax on tobacco, beer, cigarettes and whiskey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not responsible for those taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While not directly responsible, the point I was raising&mdash; and, if I am not allowed, I do not want to push it any further&mdash;is that before the increased tax was put on beer, cigarettes and tobacco the manufacturers, through this Department, had to get this Minister's permission to increase the prices of those things from the point of view of the production cost.  They got the opportunity to increase the prices of those three articles, before the tax was put on, so it was a second increase, put on by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The railways are meeting with a bad time.  One of the big dangers to them is the times at which the buses are being run.  From my part of Mayo a bus and train leave at practically the one time.  Competition like that is unfair.  The train should leave at one time and the bus some hours later.  That would encourage people to go on the train rather than by the bus.</P>
      <P>With regard to employees on the road service, I have here a notice received by an employee terminating his employment.  This man had been working for Córas Iompair Éireann for some time.  I feel that is very short notice having regard to the fact that it came from a Government Department. If such short notice were given a person by an ordinary employer or if an ordinary employer took up the same attitude towards his employee, I think the public would feel that the employer was not treating his employee in a proper way.  I could not tell the Minister in what part of the country the man who received the notice worked.  The notice is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Owing to the unsatisfactory financial position, the company finds it necessary to make reductions in staff.  I regret, therefore, to have to inform you that your services with <Col N="939" /> the company will not be required after the 9th July.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That notice is dated the 2nd July which means that the man's employment terminates in seven days.  I feel that that is not a proper way for the Government or a Government Department to treat an employee.  You have men working on those railway lines for a number of years who have given good and faithful service.  When rationing comes to an end in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the civil servants engaged in the rationing section will be transferred to some other position in the Civil Service.  If there is a surplus employed on both the railway lines and road services, there should be some way of transferring them to some other Department where they could be kept in employment.</P>
    <P>They should at least be given time to look out for alternative employment for themselves.  Some of these employees would be ideal men so far as Bord na Móna is concerned.  Bord na Móna have schemes in operation which would be suitable for a number of those people who are under notice. The same thing applies to reclamation. Big schemes of reclamation are in progress all over the country.  Those people under notice could be transferred to some of these schemes.  I am certainly satisfied that seven days' notice is very short notice to give anybody.  These people should be given at least three months' notice within which to be able to get some alternative employment that will keep them going for the time being.</P>
    <P>Business was never worse than it is at the moment.  The business people are finding it harder than they ever found it before in their lives to meet the ordinary demands so far as the needs of the people are concerned.  The banks are not prepared to give the credit they were in the habit of giving. Curtailing credit may be all right but if credit is curtailed by the banks it will also be curtailed by the wholesalers. Traders need ready cash in order to pay for goods ordered from travellers.  Credit is being tied up in that way and traders are finding it <Col N="940" /> very hard to meet the ordinary needs of the people.  It is the shopkeeper who is the bank for people in the country areas.  People in those areas could go into a shop and get credit for a reasonable length of time.  They got that credit without any security. Had they to go to the bank, however, they would have to produce security. The business man gave them credit. He knew those people.  He knew they were honest and that they would pay him back.  Credit is so curtailed at the present time and the demand for cash is so great that the business people are not in a position to give credit.  As a result, the people in the country areas are finding it very difficult to get some of the necessaries of life on credit, which was available to them up to this.</P>
    <P>As far as the labour exchanges and unemployment are concerned, a reduction has been made in the moneys made available to local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The money spent for this purpose was money well spent.  Every £ that was spent in this connection was money that repaid itself on the double. People who were normally employed on works of this nature are to-day signing on at the labour exchanges.</P>
