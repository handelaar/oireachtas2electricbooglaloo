    <P>Generally, the export of iron and steel scrap suitable for the requirements of Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, is prohibited.  A substantial portion of the export figures quoted consists of baled steel scrap, etc., which cannot be used by the Haulbowline mills.</P>
    <P>The export of scrap steel arising from the break up of vessels acquired for demolition is permitted because of the additional employment thereby given by the shipbreaking firms.  In such cases, however, an arrangement exists whereby these concerns dispose of the shipbreaking steel scrap, which is of high quality, to Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, and are permitted in <Col N="542" /> lieu to export an equivalent quantity of inferior steel scrap.  It is not proposed to interfere with this concession as, if export facilities were not made available, shipbreaking firms would be unable to tender for vessels for demolition at competitive world prices with a consequent loss of employment and no gain in the supplies to Irish Steel Holdings, Limited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is the policy of the Government to further and encourage the popular use of the motor-assisted pedal cycle, which provides cheap, go-as-you-please, door-to-door, effortless personal transport at a cost of approximately 1d. for six miles, particularly in view of the fact that this form of transport is increasing rapidly in continental countries, that it solves many parking and transport problems, and that it helps to promote good health and if, as an earnest of this encouragement, the Government will suspend the customs import duties on assembled engines and accessories for this form of transport for a period of one year from 1st March, 1952.</P>

      <P>The existing revenue duty on engines for assisted pedal cycles, which is 10 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, has no appreciable effect on their use.  I understand that these units sell at about £30 retail and the duty payable on the engine unit would be approximately £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what reduction the consumer may expect in the price of the pint of stout due to the fact that the price of next season's malting barley has been reduced by 9/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the stout and porter to be brewed during the current year will be produced from barley purchased at the higher price, the question of an immediate reduction in the price of the pint of stout does not arise.  The position will, however, be subject to review when the lower-priced malting barley from the 1952 crop becomes available to the brewing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the price was fixed on the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body, is there not a case to refer it back for further review?  Is it not a fact that the price of barley <Col N="545" /> was fixed by Deputy Corry and not by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy knows it is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You told me yourself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the person who asks a question is entitled to ask a supplementary question.  The supplementary question I was about to ask the Minister was this: when the Prices Advisory Body decided that 1d. should be put on the price of a pint of stout they stated that that was, to a degree, owing to the increased price of barley and to other increased costs.  Even these combined costs did not justify the 1d. increase and an undertaking was got from the brewers that they would increase the gravity of their stout to justify the 1d. increase.  Now, there is a reduction of 9/- a barrel for barley. Will the Minister tell us is that going to go into the British Exchequer in the form of excess profits as it did before, or is it going to go to the consumer of stout in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to answer that question now.  The position will be reviewed when this year's barley comes into use, reviewed both in relation to a variation of other costs and the practicability of reflecting that reduction in the price of barley in the price of stout.  The increase in the price of barley this year did not by itself justify the whole of the increase of 1d. per pint in stout.  There were other costs involved, and even then there was the necessity of adjusting the position in favour of the consumer by increasing the gravity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in the past, when the price of barley in this country was artificially depressed, the result of that was that the British Exchequer got considerable sums of money running into millions of pounds in the form of excess profits from Messrs.  Guinness because they are a British registered company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="546" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that is so or not.  There are, of course, other brewers of stout in this country besides Messrs.  Guinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the price fixed this year for barley is in excess of that paid by one of the Cork brewers last year and will he give the producers an increase now to make up to them for this increase in the price of malting barley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

The question of rearrangement is entirely dependent generally on the acquisition of additional land. If we could secure the consent of the occupiers to the rearrangement, failing the provision of the additional land, nobody would be more delighted than I; but, as the Deputy knows, the Land Commission strives in every way possible to secure additional land to improve the holdings before consolidating <Col N="559" /> them and they cannot take up housing until there is a fair prospect of completing the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to which the Deputy refers was taken in 1949 and was based upon the assumption that there were 1,200,000 acres of land which should, in the national interest, be devoted to afforestation.  F.A.O. was subsequently asked to have this assumption and various allied questions examined independently.  The report of that examination was furnished in February, 1951, and was circulated to Deputies in November, 1951. Its implications are being carefully examined by the Government as part of a review of forestry development possibilities generally.</P>
      <P>In any event, the available reserve of plantable land at the disposal of my Department would not justify the planting in the 1952-53 planting season of an area of 25,000 acres.  The remainder of the Deputy's question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

Have they in mind that within the next two or three years they intend to reach a ceiling of, say, 25,000 or 30,000 acres per year, or are they just working on a haphazard basis of planting from year to year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no haphazard basis.  There is a regular progressive policy of development.  As the Deputy knows from the answers given to previous questions of his, the amount planted each year has increased considerably. I am hopeful that that increase will continue.  To lay down a fixed target for a particular year may look very well in a political speech, but it does not necessarily get us any further with planting.  Whether we have a target or not, we have not got the land.  We should have about three times the area that we expect to plant in a particular year in the pool if we are going to continue the policy of increasing forestry development.</P>

      <P>There are 4,000 acres of land in Kilworth 200 of which are arable.  These 200 acres are intermingled with the 4,000 acres so that an endeavour to fence in the 200 acres <Col N="567" /> would not only be difficult but would also prove very costly.  The Curragh is administered by the Commissioners of Public Works and governed by the Curragh of Kildare Act which confers certain grazing rights on residents in the area.

      <P>A grant was sanctioned by the Department in December, 1950, towards the cost of carrying out a scheme for the enlargement and improvement of Milford National School, County Donegal.  The scheme included the provision of new water-closets, but the Commissioners of Public Works, who make the arrangements for the execution of the works in such cases, could not prepare the working drawings and specification until there was definite information that the local authority would extend the public sewer to the school site.</P>
      <P>While there is still no definite information available in regard to the extension of the public sewer, it is now understood that the local authority proposes to proceed with the work.</P>
      <P>The question has recently been raised, however, as to whether, in view of a probable increase in the attendance, as a result of the erection of new houses in the district, it might not be preferable to build a new school on a new site, instead of carrying out the scheme for the enlargement and improvement of the existing school.  The Department is having this question examined and a decision in the matter will be arrived at as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would like to add, in reply to Deputy O'Donnell, that the information which I have now given shows that there could have been no question of taking the case of a new school at Milford out of the priority list.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very terrible conditions that have come to light since that date, apart from the cruelties suffered by horses in the actual journey across to France?  I should like the Minister to realise that reports have now come to hand of the appalling conditions under which these horses, which were sold in Dublin and which were formerly Irish racehorses, were brought across to France, suffering hardship on the way and then were brought up to Paris where at the Vaugireard abattoir, they were put to death under what can only be described as appalling conditions. Mares in foal were half-killed and whilst they were being killed other horses were brought into the chamber. <Col N="607" /> The details, which I have received from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and from the International League for the Protection of Horses, have been absolutely vouched and are almost beyond belief.  The cruelty, brutality and suffering which these horses undergo are something that no Irish person can read of without very great emotion.  I am sure the Minister is not aware of these new facts and, in view of what has transpired, I would ask him to look into the question very closely to see what he can do, if necessary to the extent of making representations to the French Government concerning these conditions. We owe so much to the horse industry in Ireland that it seems a terrible thing that we should subject our horses, when they are old and unfit for further work here, to these conditions. They are really terrible.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was indicating that I am in wholehearted agreement with the policy of the progressive development of electricity and the production of electric current at the cheapest rate possible to the consumer. Cheap power is fundamental to any programme of national development. Everything that can be done should be done to bring the cost of production down to the lowest possible level.  I have indicated that I felt uneasy about the high charge levied on the consuming public by reason of the high cost of money necessary to finance electricity development and I feel that the Minister should direct his attention to that matter.  Deputy Dillon, in the course of his speech, indicated that he was in favour of the Central Bank issuing the necessary money for works of this kind.  Personally, I think that there is something to be said in favour of such a policy.  I have not so much enthusiasm as some Deputies have for the bringing back of money from abroad to this country.  The money that is abroad is coming back quickly enough by reason of the annual deficit in our balance of payments.  If we were to continue for three or four years having the same deficit in the balance <Col N="615" /> of payments as last year, we would have no money invested abroad.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon in the course of his oration last night returned to his age old attack upon turf producers in this country.  I do not know what the unfortunate turf producers did to Deputy Dillon that he avails of every conceivable opportunity to launch a fierce onslaught on them.  He told us that he does not know what the price of turf is, and he could not give us any indication of what price coal is likely to be for the coming year or what price imported fuel oil is likely to be.  He is, however, very determined that the turf producer must be put out of action at any cost.  It has often seemed to me that Deputy Dillon's one guiding principle is &ldquo;burn everything Irish except Irish turf.&rdquo;  He has followed that principle all through his political life and he managed in some way to impose that policy on the progressive Labour Party and the progressive Clann na Poblachta Party which always talks about developing our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is essential that we should get our cost of production down to the lowest possible level and I would go all out in pressing on the Minister to seek all the ways and means at his disposal to bring down the cost of turf production as turf is an essential raw <Col N="616" /> material for electricity development. Anything that can be done to make turf production more economic and more efficient should be done.  There is a good deal of waste all along the line in regard to the production of turf even where it is mechanised.  There is need for further mechanisation and there is need for covered storage for turf wherever it has to be stored for use. By ways such as these we can increase the value of this native raw material.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the steps indicated by the Minister for the further development of hydro-electric power.  It is recognised that until development of atomic power reaches the stage that it can be utilised water is perhaps one of the cheapest sources of power available.  I am not looking forward with any enthusiasm to the day when water power will be supplanted by atomic power.  I am glad that the Electricity Supply Board decided to investigate and are in the course of investigating the possibilities of some of our Wicklow rivers.</P>
    <P>I have often felt that the fast-flowing mountain streams and rivers of Wicklow are a potential source of electric power.  I am glad that the Avonmore has been selected for investigation. We all know that that river must offer, by reason of its gravitation, very considerable possibilities.  I have very often thought also that the Avonbeg river should offer possibilities for development.  Of course it is impossible for any person without engineering experience to express an opinion on a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that any scheme of development in this respect will not infringe on or interfere unduly with the life of the people in the villages and towns in the areas affected.  I am hopeful in particular that the beauty spots of Wicklow which are in close proximity to the Avonmore river will not suffer as a result of this development. We know that Glendalough has almost a world-wide reputation and is one of the beauty spots of Ireland.  We know, too, that the Meeting of the Waters, and the Avonmore and the Avonbeg have always been very highly spoken of, and so I sincerely hope that <Col N="617" /> the Electricity Supply Board will not do anything to incur the displeasure of the late Thomas Moore by interfering with the beauty of Avoca's Vale where these two celebrated rivers meet.</P>
    <P>I often feel that there are possibilities with regard to the development of electric power from fast flowing rivers, even though it may not be possible to do much in the way of providing storage.  I have often wondered why electric turbines could not be installed on rivers where there is a fast current of water so as to use that power, even where it is not possible to erect a storage reservoir.  That power, though it might fluctuate from season to season or from month to month or from week to week, would, at the same time, be useful in supplementing our national supply.  Deputy Dillon referred to the possibility of actually turning the course of a river and forcing it to descend as in the case of the River Moy.  I would not be one of those who would scoff at any proposal of that kind.  It is a matter that could, at least, be examined by those qualified to do so, and even if, after a brief examination, it was found that the proposal was unworkable there would be no harm done.  Any proposal designed to develop our resources and to utilise unused water power, tidal power or any other type of power, should be applied with the utmost vigour because we, as a nation, both industrially and economically, suffer a disadvantage by reason of a dearth of mineral resources, and particularly of mineral fuel resources.  It is only right, therefore, that whatever resources are available to us should be harnessed and used to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural electrification, I think there is not much room for complaint as to the rate of progress which has been made in extending the system.  I think that the Electricity Supply Board is doing a comparatively good job of work.  While complaints may be made, and can very well be made, as to the small districts, or even large districts, which are put back in the order of priority, I think it is well to remember that, eventually, all of them will be reached.  There is a case <Col N="618" /> in certain areas for dealing with, perhaps, a smaller area than the 25 square mile area.  I think that if a particular district offers possibilities and appears to be economic, even though it may not be as large as the regulations of the Electricity Supply Board demand, work could be undertaken in such an area.</P>
    <P>There is one matter about which I have always been inclined to be rather puzzled, and that is why the Electricity Supply Board concentrate on obtaining the main portion of their revenue from fixed charges.  We know that one of the problems which the Electricity Supply Board has to face is that, once a large portion of the country is linked up, there is a tendency at times, particularly when there is a shortage of supply, for the demand to exceed the supply, and so appeals have to be issued in the public Press to consumers requesting them to use the current more sparingly.  I think that the whole system of charging is an inducement to consumers to use power extravagantly.  If, for example, a consumer gets his premises linked up he has to pay a substantial flat rate charge.  It may be £2 or £3 each two-monthly period.  Having paid that substantial charge, he gets the electric current at a comparatively low rate of charge per unit.  In these circumstances, having been compelled to pay a high flat-rate charge, there is a natural anxiety on the part of that person to get and to use as much power as possible so as to offset the heavy flat-rate charge.  I think that if the charges were on another basis, that is a reduced flat-rate charge, with the charge per unit a little more, there would be a real incentive to practise economy in the use of the current.</P>
    <P>That incentive does not exist at the present time.  As a matter of fact, under the present arrangement, the incentive is to use current as extravagantly as possible in order to get as much benefit as possible from the high fixed rate of charge.  I think that the Electricity Supply Board should consider the question of reducing the flat-rate charge and then, if necessary, compensate themselves by increasing <Col N="619" /> the charge per unit.  I think that one of the desirable developments in regard to the use of electricity is the low rate of charge for current used off the peak periods, that is, during the night-time. I think that is a very good thing.  It enables current that would otherwise go to waste to be utilised, and it provides an amenity for people by enabling them to heat bedrooms and spare rooms so that the effect of dampness and cold may be to a certain extent mitigated.  I think that is a good development.  I am of opinion that the extent to which electricity could be used to improve the standard of living of our people is almost unlimited. For that reason, I think it is only right that the Dáil should be unanimous, and I think it is unanimous, in supporting this measure.</P>
    <P>I hope that one of the things to which the Minister will turn his attention in particular is the cost of the money to finance this project.  I feel very strongly on this matter and I regard it as a matter of very grave importance.  There is no truth in the allegation, which I know is frequently made, that the present Government are against intensive development of our resources by the investment of capital in them, so as to make our country more productive.  Everything that has happened during the past few months since the change of Government has indicated a determination to go ahead as quickly as possible with development of every available resource in the country and the development of electricity is fundamental to all other development because it produces a source of power for our industries&mdash;I will not describe it as cheap, but it is a native supply&mdash;and also produces an amenity for our people in their homes, whether in rural or urban areas.  For that reason, the Minister will be complimented on every effort he makes to push this electricity development scheme forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in opening the debate, and Deputy Dillon later, made reference to the relationship that exists between the proposal in this Bill to authorise a heavy capital <Col N="620" /> expenditure on electrical development and the financial difficulties of the State to which the Minister for Finance has made frequent reference. I think that these references&mdash;both those of Deputy Cosgrave and the more irresponsible statements of Deputy Dillon&mdash;show that our efforts to get an understanding of the State's financial problems, so far as these two Deputies are concerned, have up to the present completely failed.  The attitude of the Government has, I think, been clearly stated and can be summarised in a very few words.</P>
      <P>We recognise that this country needs very substantial new investment in productive capacity.  We feel, however, that with the savings of our people running at their present low level and having regard to the contraction which has already taken place in the available resources, to the extent that these resources are usable at all for investment purposes, we are going to find it barely possible to complete the investment programme we consider to be necessary.  We know that it will be impossible if any part of our resources, either current savings as they arise or available reserves, is dissipated in financing Budget deficits, in tax avoidance or even in meeting the cost of desirable public services which are unproductive. Any measures which the Government may propose to the Dáil for the adjustment of the State's finances will be measures intended to facilitate and make possible the type of investment in productive capacity which this Bill contemplates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say also that on these aspects of financial policy there is no difference whatever between any two members of the Government and much less between the Minister for Finance and myself? We know that Deputy Dillon finds it hard to understand how a normal Government works.  He only had experience of one Government and his statements from time to time based upon that limited experience are, probably unconsciously, a revelation of what the procedure of that Government must have been.  We do not regard Cabinet meetings as a battle-ground where Ministers with conflicting view-productive <Col N="621" /> points endeavour to score victories over one another.  We regard the Cabinet rather as a planning council, the members of which are all in general agreement as to what it is desirable to do and argue amongst themselves only as to how best to do it.  In case anybody may have been misled by statements made by Deputy Dillon, I want to make it quite clear that the Minister for Finance is a most enthusiastic advocate of this Bill, and, in so far as electrical development is concerned, would be far more likely to criticise my efforts on the ground that they were not taking development far enough than attempt to be a drag or a brake to restrict its development.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies expressed interest in the development of smaller rivers. Deputy Cogan has just referred to it and I should say that not merely am I personally very interested in the possibility of finding new sources of power in these rivers, but the Electricity Supply Board are also very anxious to proceed with their development.  I explained that the difficulty they have is that their top planning staff, the limited number of highly experienced engineers in their service, are likely to be not merely fully occupied but heavily burdened with the problems of carrying through the programme for the building of main stations which I outlined in introducing the Bill.  We got down to discuss how the capacities of that staff could be increased and there emerged from the discussion the possibility of bringing in outside engineering firms and entrusting to them the job of investigating each of these rivers, making a plan for the utilisation of their water power and bringing the preparation of that plan to the stage at which contracts for the construction of works could be placed.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned that idea, Deputy Cosgrave apparently misunderstood it. He seemed to think I had suggested the possibility of entrusting the task of developing these rivers and the production of power from them to private enterprise, with the Electricity Supply Board coming in after, either as purchasers of power or of the plants when established.  That is certainly not <Col N="622" /> intended.  When the plans have been brought to the point at which contracts for construction work can be placed, these contracts will be placed by the Electricity Supply Board and the stations will be constructed to their order and form an integral part of their production system.  The board hopes, out of some ten or 12 schemes of that kind, to get an annual output of around 200,000,000 units.  It will help Deputies to understand that each of these schemes will be of comparatively minor importance in the board's system when I mention that 200,000,000 units are the addition to the board's productive capacity which may become available in this year from the development of the Erne alone.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of speeches concerning the utilisation of turf as a fuel for power stations&mdash;some critical, some enthusiastic.  Deputy Cosgrave said he had doubts as to the economics of milled peat, that, while he had himself supported the development of sod peat as a fuel for power stations, his recollection of the discussions that had taken place concerning milled peat had left in his mind a doubt as to the economy of it.  I think his recollection has let him down.  There never was and is not now any doubt about the economics of milled peat as a fuel.  In so far as the delivery of a tonnage of peat fuel off a bog is concerned, it can be done much more cheaply in milled form than in sod form.  That is not a matter of speculation.  Bord na Móna is producing milled peat at Lullymore at the present time to supply the raw material for the briquette factory. They have developed the machines necessary to produce it and they have costed every operation down to the last penny.  They know what can be done in that regard and can enter into firm contracts with the Electricity Supply Board on the basis of present wages and prices, for the delivery of milled peat in a prescribed tonnage at a predetermined price.  There may be and possibly will be some adjustments of the present techniques required to meet the circumstances of individual bogs, but these adjustments are not likely to give serious trouble.</P>
    <P>A great advantage of the milled peat process is, in fact, that it produces a <Col N="623" /> much cheaper fuel than sod peat; but there are other advantages as well. Firstly, because it is completely mechanised, it permits of more satisfactory conditions of employment for workers and reduces the labour problem which Bord na Móna had anticipated might become serious and opens up the prospect, for the first time, of utilising for power purposes the Mayo bogs and other shallower bogs in the West of Ireland on which it had been decided that the heavy type of machinery needed to be used for the production of sod peat would be impracticable.</P>
    <P>The question that arose, and the question which was submitted to the American experts who came over under the technical assistance project, related to the most suitable type of boiler equipment for the burning of milled peat.  On that issue there was some difference of opinion.  The report submitted under the technical assistance project indicated various types of equipment now in use for the burning of other fuels which were suitable for the burning of milled peat and the views of the experts who prepared the report upon these types of equipment. I think that issue is now completely resolved.  In so far as Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board are concerned, there is now no question that there is available boiler equipment suitable for the economic utilisation of milled peat and which will be constructed by the engineering firms that produce it under guarantee as to its performance.  The Electricity Supply Board will undoubtedly have to make adjustments from time to time in the boilers constructed by them in order to get maximum efficiency, but they have to do that in relation to coal even yet, much less in relation to the newer types of fuel like oil or sod peat. Every installation of that kind undergoes a period of test and adjustment before its maximum efficiency is realised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked about the publication of the report that we received.  I do not think that would be practicable.  It would not be merely one report.  The report was submitted <Col N="624" /> and on it the Electricity Supply Board made various observations and submitted a list of queries.  These observations were commented upon and the queries answered in a second report. Unless all three documents were published&mdash;which I think might be undesirable&mdash;the publication of the first or second report alone would not be of much use.  In any event, the reports are so highly technical in their nature that only fully qualified engineers could understand what they are all about.  I do not profess to have understood them.  I was concerned only with the general conclusion arrived at&mdash;that there is no technical problem likely to emerge in the utilisation of milled peat as an efficient and economic boiler fuel.</P>

      <P>I do not think they could be summarised at all and the conclusions, in so far as the Deputy would be interested, are summarised in the phrase I have just used, that there is boiler equipment already being produced commercially by various firms in the world which can be utilised or adapted for the utilisation of milled peat and the makers of which are quite willing to guarantee their performance.</P>

      <P>No, the boilers there are designed for the utilisation of sod turf and cannot be utilised for anything else.  The Electricity Supply Board may install at Portarlington the pilot plant to which Deputy Cosgrave referred, in order to have some of these calculations and adjustments made before the main plants&mdash;the first will be at Bangor Erris&mdash;come into use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said he could not get any information about the cost of turf and suggested that information as to the cost of producing turf for the power stations was being concealed and clearly had in mind that it is so high that we think it undesirable to publish <Col N="625" /> it.  In fact, all the information that the Deputy could possibly desire is contained in the Tuarascáil of Bord na Móna for 1951.  I would direct his attention to page 15 of that Report, which showed that the average cost per ton of all the turf produced from all the bogs operated by Bord na Móna in the year was £2 6s. 9d.  That cost included all overheads and interest on the capital invested in the projects. However, I want to explain that figure slightly, as it is to some extent unfair to turf.  The actual production cost at Clonsast in the year was £2 0s. 8d.  That again is an inclusive figure, covering not merely all the cost of production but the overheads and interest charges as well.  The average cost of all the turf produced by Bord na Móna in that year was higher than the Clonsast figure mainly because turf was being produced from a number of bogs which are not yet fully developed, and where the incidence of overhead charges per ton produced is heavier than it will be when these bogs are in full production.  No doubt, costs vary from year to year, as Deputies know, but having regard to the known prices of other fuels in 1951, the average cost of £2 6s. 9d. for all turf and of £2 0s. 8d. for turf in Clonsast makes it quite clear that what I said by way of interjection to Deputy Dillon is correct, that the cheapest kind of fuel that we have is turf.</P>
    <P>I want to express strong resentment of the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that the utilisation of turf for power purposes is something in the nature of a relief scheme.  It is nothing of the sort.  It is good business. No doubt the cheapest method of producing electricity is by water power.  That is true and that is why both the board and myself are keen to utilise every resource of that kind that we have.  But, in so far as it is necessary to link in with any system of water-power generating stations a series of steam stations, then there is no doubt about the economy of utilising turf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are different there.  I was going to mention, as a matter of interest, that there was last year in this country a technical mission from Great Britain which was investigating the methods of producing turf for power purposes with the intention of applying it to power stations in Scotland.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies have made reference to the rural electrification scheme and criticised various aspects of it.  I think it is necessary to refer Deputies back to the scheme.  The legislation was passed by the Dáil following the presentation to it of a report prepared by the Electricity Supply Board as to the form that the scheme would take.  It did not contemplate that it would be possible within the limits of the scheme to supply every rural household.  The cost of doing that was calculated and shown to be prohibitive.  It was proposed instead, and accepted by the Dáil, to proceed upon the basis of connecting only those households from which the fixed charge revenue bore a certain relationship to the capital cost of bringing in the supply.  It was estimated that within that formula 69 per cent. of the rural dwellings would be supplied.  According to that report, what the board had to get was an annual income equivalent to 12 per cent. of the capital charge of constructing the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must, perhaps, say at the present time it would require something less than 12 per cent.  The 12 per cent. calculation assumed an interest rate of 5 per cent.  I do not want to get Deputy Hickey going on the question of interest.  We assumed that 5 per cent. would have to be paid.  In fact, the board has received advances for rural electrification at a lower rate of interest since, and probably about an 11½ per cent. return would be all that the board would require at the present time.  I cannot calculate that exactly because, while the reduction of the <Col N="627" /> rate of interest reduces the return the board requires, it also, of course, reduces the yield which the board itself gets on the reinvestment of its own reserves, so that an elaborate calculation would be required to determine the exact percentage return the board would need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They have drawn interest on their own reserves&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will debate this question some other time with the Deputy. It would be too involved a subject to get into now.  It was quite obvious that the board could not get anything like the 12 per cent. from the fixed charge revenue payable under the Electricity Supply Board rural tariff and the proposition was to provide electricity on the basis of that rural tariff without an increase.  That is where the proposal to give a free grant of half the cost from State funds arose.  The costs have gone up, as I mentioned, at least 75 per cent. above the estimate prepared in 1943 when that scheme was formulated.  It is now clear that even the 50 per cent. grant is insufficient to give the board the return on its expenditure that it needs.  In fact, at the present time a 100 per cent. grant would seem to be necessary.  We have not provided for that, as I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Some part of the cost of rural electrification is at present being carried upon the board's general funds.  I intend to look at that position again. I do not want to rule out the possibility that we may decide to allow some part of the cost of the rural electrification scheme to continue to be carried by the board's general receipts, but I would not like to take that decision until the full implications of it had been worked out, not merely with reference to the present time, when only one-fifth of the scheme has been completed, but in ten or 15 years' time when the whole scheme has been carried into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputies spoke about pockets of potential consumers in rural areas having been passed over, I assume they are referring to consumers whose houses were so isolated from the <Col N="628" /> other residents in the locality that the board could not bring them within the limits of the formula set out in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The houses in question are not so isolated at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the case some Deputies referred to and, in fact, Deputy Cosgrave suggested that the case of those isolated houses could be met by contributions from the local authority.  So far as the board is concerned it will be quite prepared, I am certain, to bring the supply to any houses provided it gets the prescribed return, whether it be in the form of a contribution from the local authority or a higher fixed charge payment by the occupier of the house.  As every Deputy knows, the board is prepared to bring the supply to any house provided they are recouped the actual capital cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not, in fact, what they are doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They will, provided they get the prescribed return. The difficulty that other Deputies referred to arose out of the arrangement adopted by the board for choosing the areas for first development.  It was perhaps reasonable enough for the board to say: &ldquo;We will start in the areas from which we are getting the best return,&rdquo; which are the most economical from their point of view. They prepared this formula relating the total fixed charge revenue to be received to the capital cost of wiring up an area and made that known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the basis upon which they are selecting one area as against another.  It has been said that it favours the more wealthy areas and operates to put back the extension of the scheme to the poorer areas, the areas of lower valuation.  That is why I suggested to the board the possibility of substituting for it the simple calculation <Col N="629" /> of the percentage of total householders in the area that would accept the supply.  The board showed me that that might not work out to the advantage of the poorer areas at all. In fact, an area like Spiddal in Connemara qualified quite early because of the number of households in the area willing to accept the supply and the short distance between them.  My device might operate in favour of a rancher area with large houses scattered widely apart but all of whom were prepared to take the supply.</P>
    <P>We have been considering whether it is possible to combine the two ideas, but the board are likely to decide that if there is to be a departure from the present arrangement it should be on the basis of taking the congested areas as a separate problem and laying down a different formula for these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is in mind to deal with the congested areas specially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want to get the board's view on that point before I could give a decision.  Personally, I do not mind what the formula is so long as it is clearly known to everybody that it is the formula that is going to be applied impartially and that there will be no juggling around of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>You will never achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board have demonstrated to me that they can stick rigorously to the application of their formula.  It is desirable that it should be governed by whatever formula is there, that it will apply the formula and that the areas that can come earliest under the formula will, in fact, be the earliest to be wired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument against special arrangements for the congested areas is that there are areas in other parts of the country where somewhat similar conditions exist and which may be put back further, to their detriment, if there is a special scheme for the congested areas.  In fact, it was a district in County Tipperary which emphasised the character of the problem to me personally.  When I <Col N="630" /> got the particulars of the case in that district I found that no less than 95 per cent. of the householders there had agreed to take a supply and yet, because of the peculiarity of the area, being a mountainy one, it did not come in under the scheme as early as another adjacent area where a lower percentage of the inhabitants had agreed to take a supply.</P>
    <P>However, the main solution for many of the difficulties which have been mentioned in connection with rural electrification is to get on with the job as quickly as possible.  Acceleration was secured by the Electricity Supply Board last year, and I hope they will be able to show still greater acceleration this year.  In so far as their difficulty arises out of a shortage of technical staff, they have been urged to do everything possible to overcome it.  They had supply difficulties as well, but they have been taking every possible measure to procure, well in advance, necessary supplies of transformers, wires and the other equipment both from home sources and from elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should be aware that I am most interested in that point.  I think it is true to say that all the equipment required could be produced at home subject to the availability of raw materials.  Factories are in production producing conductor, that is, wire or cabling, transformers and much of the equipment necessary. I should hope that that process of extending our own manufacturing activities on the basis of the Electricity Supply Board's programme will continue. I emphasised, in my discussions with the Electricity Supply Board, my appreciation of the fact that they are now one of the biggest economic forces in the country&mdash;one of the largest consumers of equipment of various kinds&mdash;and that the power that they have should be exercised, directly and intelligently, to help us in our task of industrial development.</P>

      <P>I do not think I would approve of the undertaking of that by the Electricity Supply Board directly. It seems to me they have enough on their plate without putting more on it. Factories for the production of equipment are already in existence and should, I think, with their present capacity, be able to meet the demand unless there is a very substantial increase.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde criticised the administration of the Electricity Supply Board generally, particularly what he described as their disregard for the interests of the farmers when erecting transmission lines.  Deputy Esmonde has not been in this House very long, but I have been listening to that complaint for the past 25 years.  I feel it is true to say that the Electricity Supply Board have been reasonably considerate of the problems of farmers and are conscious of the difficulties they are creating for them.  It is true, however, that a transmission system must, in the main, be erected on a straight line.  If the line were zig-zagging around the country it would not merely double costs but would create risks and dangers for the population. A straight line is a much more safe arrangement under story conditions than a zig-zagging one.</P>

The Electricity Supply Board will endeavour to keep damage down to a minimum and, should they create damage, they will compensate farmers to the full.</P>

      <P>No, there is not. Deputy Hickey and Deputy Esmonde were critical of the arrangement under which the board was set up and thought that the board should be responsible to the Dáil for the exercise of their powers.  I do not think that it would have been practicable to have set up the board on any other basis. Deputies who are interested in the matter may refer back to the debates in this House in 1926 and 1927, when Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, put through the Electricity Supply Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people are critical of the wide powers given to the board.  The answer to these Deputies is really this: that the board has powers which the Dáil gave it.  It is not acting in defiance of the Dáil or ignoring the rights of the Dáil but is proceeding to carry out the duties placed on it by the Dáil and using to that end the power which the Dáil gave it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Hickey was correct in saying that Deputies have been refused information about the activities of the Electricity Supply Board.  If the Deputy will examine the Order Papers of the last two days he will find a number of questions put down by Deputies relating to the <Col N="633" /> activities of the board, all of which were answered.</P>
    <P>I think that these Deputies in talking about making the Electricity Supply Board subject to the Dáil are thinking of more than the right of Deputies to ask questions.  They are thinking of the Dáil passing a resolution to the effect that the board must not put up a pole in Tom Murphy's farm or charge more than a certain rate in certain circumstances, and that the Electricity Supply Board should obey the terms of any such resolution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, amongst other Deputies, referred to the provisions of the Electricity Supply Board Act which prohibit a member of the board or an employee of the board from being elected to the Dáil, and urged reconsideration of it.  That section of that Act could not be put into effect unless corresponding provisions were put into the Electoral Act.  In subsequent measures where a similar provision was intended it was turned the other way round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to have the corresponding provisions in the Transport Act and in the Turf Development Act which provide that if a person is elected to the Dáil then he should cease to be a member or a servant of these boards.  I think that is desirable.  I think there are many reasons why it would be objectionable to have in the Dáil members of statutory bodies sitting as Deputies and speaking upon Bills affecting the activities of the board of which they were members, and perhaps influencing decisions that might affect their own personal positions.  As Deputies know, one of the problems in adjusting the remuneration of Deputies and Ministers is that everybody has a feeling against people voting on their own salaries.  That is the situation you would have if members of these boards were present here. The only suggestion I would make is that no members of the Dáil may be an employee or an official of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Away back in 1946, on the Turf Development <Col N="634" /> Bill, I said as contained in the Official Debates, Volume 100, column 203:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to suggest to the Dáil that it is desirable that this whole issue of membership of this House by persons who are ordinarily employed by authorities or organisations supported out of public funds should be examined by an inter-Party Committee or some other tribunal of inquiry.  Having regard to the different courses adopted in the past, to the fact that no uniform practice has evolved in the course of time and to the obvious implications of the issue, I think we should make an attempt to see whether we cannot get some agreed statement of principles that would apply in all cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to renew that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some references were made to the pension provisions in the Bill and I think I might make some reference to what was said in order to clarify the position.  Deputy Cosgrave is apparently under the impression that the increase in pensions for which the Bill provides operates only in the case of transferred officers, that is to say, employees of the board who are transferred to its service from the service of local authorities.  That is not correct.  In so far as any member of the board's staff was affected by the limitations of wages up to 1946, that position is being rectified retrospective to 1949 in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also mentioned the position of men who entered the board's service rather late in life.  In the Act of 1942 I made provision to meet that case.  The board got the right to establish a pension scheme for its staff by that Act and there was clearly recognised that there were likely to be difficulties, as there always are, in bringing a contributory pension scheme into operation for the first <Col N="635" /> time in an established organisation.  It is a contributory pensions scheme&mdash;one half being contributed by the employees and the other half by the board.  For men over 40 years of age it was realised that the contributions necessary to provide a reasonable pension on retirement would be very heavy under the provisions of that Bill, so the board was given power to provide supplementary pensions free of contributions to men who were then over 40 years of age.  Deputy Cosgrave thinks that there were men under 40 years of age who were rather harshly affected by that limitation.  There always will be the borderline case.  I do not think he recollects the Bill made other provisions also.</P>
    <P>It is open to any member of the board to buy back past service.  In other words, to increase his contribution so as to get a higher benefit on retirement.  In fact, the board was bound to pay into the fund its contribution in respect of the whole of the service so that, even if an employee does not elect to increase his contribution, he still gets credit for half his service prior to the establishment of the pension scheme.  That works out in the borderline case to which Deputy Cosgrave referred.  A man who was 38 years of age in 1942 and who had 14 years' service prior to that, and who has 27 years' service yet to run before reaching 65 years&mdash;he would have pensionable service of 34 years&mdash;will get a pension equivalent to 34 eightieths of his pay on retirement. That is a more favourable position than, in fact, exists in the public services.  People who enter the public service rather late in life, such as professional men, do not get pensions on that basis and can never qualify under any arrangement for a full pension.</P>
    <P>I would normally agree with Deputy Cosgrave, but it is undesirable to appoint members of the Electricity Supply Board for short periods.  It is true that, for a number of years prior to 1948, members of the board were appointed from year to year.  I explained at the time that I was entertaining the idea of having a different <Col N="636" /> type of board from the present arrangement of a board consisting of three or four full-time members associated with an equal number of part-time members. It was in anticipation of a possibility of a change of that kind and because of certain other considerations which applied then that these year to year appointments were made.  But while I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that it is not desirable to have short-term appointments, I would not say that we should put in a minimum period of appointment in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy McGrath who referred to another problem in relation to the Electricity Supply Board staff.  There are men on that staff who came into that staff from other employment, and I do not think that the Electricity Supply Board can take responsibility for service in determining pensions with other employers except in connection with local authorities where the question of compulsory acquisition arose.  If a man entered the service of the board from Fords in Cork, we cannot expect the board to carry responsibility in respect of that service which was not itself pensionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as pension is concerned, if the man was over 40 years of age in 1942 when the pensions scheme came into operation, then the board have the right to give him an <i>ex gratia</i> addition to pension payable under the scheme.  In so far as people who were under 40 years of age at that time were concerned, they have half their previous service calculated without any additional contribution. They have also the right to make contributions in arrear.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That has been the position since 1942.  The scheme of course is a contributory scheme.  It is a fund which is managed by a committee and which is fed by equal contributions <Col N="637" /> from the staff and the board.  It was prepared on an actuarial basis and of course we could not start putting additional charges on the fund without altering the whole basis of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, to the year ending 31st March, 1953, and so continue the agricultural grant on its present basis for a further year.</P>
      <P>The basis of distribution of the grant was established by the Act of 1946 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate on land valuations not exceeding £20, and the first £20 of higher valuations.</P>
      <P>2.  A supplementary allowance at the rate of one-fifth of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation above £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  An employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation above £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance <Col N="638" /> does not exceed £6 10s. in respect of each man at work on the holding.</P>
    <P>This method of calculation embodies the principle that the grant varies automatically with changes in the local rates.  Prior to 1946, the grant was always a fixed amount.  Due to the operation of the 1946 Act, the amount of the grant increased from the figure of £1,870,000 at which it had been fixed from 1935/36 to 1945/46 to over £2,900,000 in 1946/47, and to an estimated £4,230,000 in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I have had the whole matter of this form of rate relief under preliminary review recently.  It is my intention to pursue this examination, with a view to considering whether this comparatively large subsidy might be applied to a greater extent to assisting those landowners who are engaged in those forms of agricultural production which afford the maximum employment, and who in present conditions are best serving the needs of the community as a whole in regard to agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of this review I would ask the House to agree to the continuance of this rate relief in its existing form for the coming financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be agreed to by us.  The Bill is in ease of a section of the community.  It eases the burden of the rates in so far as it affects a large section of the community. I think it is proper, however, that the Minister should appreciate the effect of the entire burden of rates in the country at the moment.  I think it was some two years ago that much effort was put into a demand for lower rates by the Minister and his colleagues and by Deputy Cogan.  I recollect Deputy Cogan leading a circus from county to county, from constituency to constituency, heading an organisation that was going to reduce rates in respect of agricultural land and bring tremendous reliefs to all of us.  He sits now, Deputy Cogan, with Deputy Smith as Minister for Local Government and all the people who joined in this campaign are together now in a new Coalition Government. They have now the power, and as they have the power they have the responsibility <Col N="639" /> to wave the magic wand and reduce the burden of the rates.  I want to know whether the Minister now thinks that is possible.  I want to know whether the Minister now thinks that the local authorities can by any action they may take reduce the burden which this form of local taxation imposes on the people throughout the country.  It is not so very long ago since the Minister and his colleagues thought that that could very easily be done.  We find now after some seven or eight months of this Government's office a continuation of the same form of rate relief which has been in operation for some years back.  I would not suggest that there is anything very effective which the Minister can do now, except possibly to express sympathy with the farmers whom Deputy Cogan tried to delude and whom the Minister himself tried to delude some years ago.</P>
      <P>I think there should be a realisation that rates based on poor law valuations, which were originally imposed as a form of local contribution to very trivial expenses, have now become, by the passage of the years, a major form of revenue which finances most of our local administrative machinery.  A great portion of the burden of the rates is devoted to road maintenance and matters of that kind which are national in their importance to the country.  I think that the time must come when some inquiry or investigation must be held into the entire question of rates.  I do not think that there is anyone in this country who can make a political campaign of rates, because the people who tried to do it are the people who now have power and responsibility to ease the burden. We in the Opposition certainly do not intend to do so, but we do say that the problem is a very grave one and that sooner or later a thorough investigation and overhaul must be carried out with regard to the entire rating position of the country.  We welcome the Bill and there will be no opposition to it from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is a non-controversial Bill I know that it will pass through the House unanimously.  It is <Col N="640" /> merely a continuation of certain relief measures provided some years ago for the agricultural ratepayer.  These reliefs were not granted to the farmers as any special gift but merely in realisation that the present system of rating is fundamentally unfair to the agricultural community inasmuch as the valuation of land is much higher in proportion to land's income-producing capacity than other property, particularly business property.  It is also, of course, realised that total income from land is less than one-third, certainly very little more than one-fourth, of the national income, while the valuation of land is far in excess of 50 per cent., nearer 75 per cent., of the total valuation of the country.  So there is an injustice to agriculture in the present valuation system which this relief measure seeks to adjust.</P>
      <P>I said that this Bill was non-contentious, but there are certain people who have contentious minds who see something contentious in everything that comes before this House.  It is a pity that an able and well-informed man like Deputy O'Higgins should allow the stimulation and production of bile in his internal organs to distort to a great extent and warp his mental development.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins charges me with the awful crime of being actively associated with an organisation which sought to advocate and advance the cause of the unfortunate ratepayers generally.  That organisation, of course, was strictly non-political and it was supported by many members, and even prominent members, of Deputy O'Higgins's Party.  I do not think anything can be said on the ground that it was in any sense a political movement.  It was a movement that sought to bring about some reform in our present system of local government, in our system of valuation and in our system of rates.</P>
      <P>All those systems are antiquated and there is no doubt whatever that vast sums of money are wasted, not through any malice on the part of local authorities, the administrative staff or local representatives, but because of the antiquated and inefficient system which they are trying to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> Deputy O'Higgins referred to the fact that roadmaking and road maintenance constitute a very high proportion of the burden on rates.  He will I think, admit that our whole system of roadmaking is utterly and completely antiquated and that there is waste because local authorities are trying to operate on out-of-date lines, trying to operate with sporadic grants of unpredictable amounts, trying to operate in many counties, particularly smaller counties, with antiquated machinery that is not sufficient for highly-efficient road construction.  In addition, there are many difficulties in administration arising out of the fact that local authorities have to try to relieve social problems by giving employment irrespective of whether the labour can be efficiently employed or not.</P>
    <P>All those matters make for ever-increasing expense, for overlapping, for a certain amount of inefficiency and waste and a very high burden on local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are seeking to provide for the distribution of very considerable sums of money for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  This system has been in operation since 1926.  It provides for a primary grant of three-fifths of the rate, under £20, for a supplementary grant of one-fifth, over £20, and for an employment grant.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he is considering the desirability of some improvement in this system. I feel strongly that the agricultural grant should be distributed not only to relieve the agricultural producer but in such a way as to stimulate, more efficiently perhaps than it does, increased agricultural production, and particularly increased production of those essential crops for which the nation is crying out, that is, tillage crops.  If a farmer knew that he would get a relief on his present year's rates in respect of the amount of tillage which he was carrying out on his farm this year, rather than a relief in respect of the amount of employment which he gave last year, there would be a greater incentive to him to increase tillage.</P>
    <P>We know that under the present <Col N="642" /> system a farmer who employs additional men this year may look forward to a reduction in his rates next year. That is looking forward a good distance and the amount of relief given is so small now in proportion to the wages of one agricultural worker, that it does not materially influence a farmer in employing a man.  It costs very close on £200 to employ a man fully for the whole year, taking into account the full wage to which he is entitled and the premiums on his insurance.  The relief given in respect of that expenditure of £200 under this scheme is £6 10s. 0d.  That does not pay the insurance premium of that worker, under present circumstances. As that relief is given, not in respect of a man that the farmer might think of employing now but in respect of a worker whom he employed last year, it does not offer a real incentive to him to increase agricultural production, to increase employment, or to increase tillage.  If a farmer were told that for every additional acre he would put under tillage or for whatever acreage he actually has under tillage, he would get relief&mdash;if the Minister would come out boldly and say, &ldquo;I will completely de-rate every acre of land that is under tillage&rdquo;&mdash;that would be a great incentive to him to increase tillage.</P>
    <P>I know there may be people who would raise objections to that, who would say that the farmer might produce wrong figures in connection with the acreage he had under tillage. These figures can be checked.  There are other people who might say that the checking of figures might involve expense.  The answer is that under this scheme we already have inspection of a very close character, not only into the manner in which the farmer manages his business, but into his circumstances.</P>
    <P>If a farmer claims relief in respect of a worker there is a check as to whether he employed that worker or not.  That is a matter that can be checked through the national health insurance.  If a farmer claims relief in respect of a member of his family, a very intensive investigation is carried out already under this scheme as to the accuracy of that claim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> As a matter of fact, I think the investigation under the existing scheme is more intimate, if you like, and more intensive than any inspection that it might be necessary to make in respect of a claim based upon the amount of land under tillage.  For example, if a father claims an abatement in respect of one of his sons who has been employed on the farm, the local rate-collector or some other officer of the local authority will have to investigate whether that young man was employed all the year on the farm or whether he had done some other work for some portion of the year or was away from home for portion of the year.  That does constitute a close investigation into the family circumstances of the farmer.  On that score, there is nothing to be said against an abatement claim on the amount of tillage carried out.  I, therefore, compliment the Minister on his decision to consider this whole matter, at any rate. Nothing can be done as far as the present year is concerned, as the present scheme is already in operation and the abatement forms in most cases have been completed, but for the coming year the matter should be further investigated, at any rate.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted that there has been a change in the circumstances of the farming community since this scheme was first introduced. At any rate, agricultural wages were much lower in 1946 or whenever this scheme first came into operation and £6 10s. 0d. then constituted a greater proportion of the expenditure on employing a man than it constitutes to-day. On that score, there is certainly room for an improved scheme.  It is particularly essential that the scheme should be improved with a view to stimulating increased agricultural production, particularly increased production of tillage crops.  We know that it has been pointed out on a number of occasions that production in agriculture has gone down over the last two years.  We have fewer cows, fewer sows and fewer acres under the plough now than two or three years ago.  As between 1949-50 and 1950-51 there has been a reduction in the numbers of cows, the number of sows and the <Col N="644" /> number of acres under the plough. Although one of the people responsible for the direction of agricultural policy used to say that he wanted one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough, policy moved in the opposite direction.  I think all the machinery of this State should now be employed on moving agricultural policy in the other direction.  You cannot have increased production when there is a shortage of basic feeding stuffs.  You cannot have more pigs and more poultry in the country when there is nothing to feed them, and the only feeding you can get for pigs and poultry is cereal crops produced on the land.  I am glad, therefore, that the Minister has indicated that it is his intention to try to make this relief of agricultural rates conform as far as possible to the needs of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say on this matter will be very brief indeed.  I do not believe in the principle of derating land or giving relief of rates indiscriminately. There are certain types of farms the owners of which should get relief, such as dairy farms, but I think owners of land have a certain duty to the community.  I would urge the Minister that relief in rates should be given principally where landowners till a certain percentage of their arable land.  I do not believe in giving relief in rates to a farm where one man and a dog is looking after 100 bullocks.  I do not believe in relief of rates for people like the ranchers around Mullingar who drive in in their cars on Saturdays to buy potatoes and vegetables at the local market.  I think the people to whom relief of rates on agricultural land should be given are the people who do not alone work their land well but carry out their duties to the community as a whole by intensive production.  I think the Minister, in these days of lowering production, would be well advised to consider the matter from that aspect so as to encourage people who are working their land and who are contributing a proper amount of food to the national pool, who, to put it shortly, are using their land in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.  These are the <Col N="645" /> people who should get, by way of inducement to further effort, a definite relief of rates.  I do not see why the taxpayers should be asked to contribute to the relief of people who are not making proper use of the land.  I do not see why the rest of the community who look to landowners to produce sufficient food, particularly in times of emergency such as those through which we are passing, should be asked to subsidise people who are not properly using their land.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter before this question is finally disposed of.</P>

      <P>There is not very much that I have to say in reply to the debate, as no points of any great importance were raised.  It is scarcely worth while to refer to the few remarks of Deputy O'Higgins.  I was almost tempted to take the Deputy seriously and to ask him at what time or in what circumstances I had recommended any of the policies which he alleged my colleagues and I had recommended in this House.  I have never found myself in company with those who believe, either in regard to local matters or national matters, that you can have improved services everywhere without paying for them.  Even as a member of a local body, when matters of that nature were being discussed and when services were being expanded, I always took the view that the public who wanted these expanded services should be sensible enough to realise that they would have to be paid for and that the obvious outcome of such expansion was an increase in rates.  I do not think you will find on record any statement by me that is in any way in conflict with that general approach, so that the remarks made by the Deputy to whom I referred were entirely out of place in my regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did refer to my intention to review the whole basis on which this relief of rates is given.  To tell the truth, I had the feeling that I should like to do it even this year, if I could have done it.  I had that feeling largely because of the reasons advanced here by Deputies, such as Deputy Moran. These Deputies have indicated clearly <Col N="646" /> what the general trend in agriculture has been.  I was looking at this huge sum of money that the State was providing for the relief of rates and I naturally said to myself that if the taxpayers are providing this sum why should the taxpayers not condition that relief so as to use that vast sum of money in encouraging production along the lines which we, as a Government and as a people, felt were going to be most beneficial to us.  Especially would I be prone to take that view having regard to the many statements we have listened to in the course of the last three or four years as to the undesirability of asking the owners of land to till a certain percentage of their land even in any circumstances. I have been reading and listening to appeals made to farmers to till their land, and so forth.  I am of the opinion that there are many landowners who, however much stress is laid on the necessity to increase production in times like these, will be prone to take the selfish line.  Looking at the sum of over £4,000,000 which we provide in rates, I asked myself: &ldquo;Why should we throw this money loosely to the occupiers and owners of land in this country without exploring what we might do with that sum of money in order to induce those farmers to till land and give employment and follow,&rdquo; as I stated briefly in my opening remarks, &ldquo;the policy that is to the benefit of all sections of the people?&rdquo; Suggestions have been made in the course of this short debate as to the way in which that relief might be given.  I must say that though some of these suggestions may appear to be all right they do not appear to be so to me.  I think that, on closer examination, they would be found to be impracticable. It is all right to make suggestions, because they can be examined.  If they should be found to be feasible, well, that is a good thing&mdash; but I doubt if in this case they are feasible.</P>
    <P>My purpose in making these observations was to indicate to the owners of land what the approach will be in the distribution of this sum in the coming year.  If it had been a practical proposition I should have been <Col N="647" /> inclined to have a similar approach made in connection with the distribution of the sum which is now provided for under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in view of the marked increase in unemployment, particularly among insured workers, the Dáil calls upon the Government to take immediate steps to deal with this serious situation by measures calculated to increase the overall volume of industrial and commercial employment and by the expansion of the public works programme and, further, that as the present rates of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance benefit are totally inadequate to provide even minimum support for unemployed workers and their families in view of the present high prices, the Dáil is of the opinion that the Government should increase the existing rates of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance benefit pending the passing of legislation to provide for improved social security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to deal with this motion in any partisan political way nor do I desire to see the cut and thrust of Party politics displayed on this motion. I think the issues involved are far too serious, and that the rise in unemployment conjures up an economic picture which has serious portents for the future.  For these reasons I should like to see this motion discussed in a calm <Col N="649" /> manner, each Deputy having a sober realisation of the seriousness of the issues involved, and I hope that all Parties in the House will endeavour to make a contribution to the debate in an effort to ease the lot of the unfortunate men and women and their helpless children, who are the victims of the situation which now confronts us. It is to this House, and to this House only, that these unfortunate families who have been afflicted with the social curse of unemployment must look for succour from their daily privations, and this House would be unworthy to be a Parliament of the people if it did not candidly recognise that it has social obligations to these people of which it cannot divest itself&mdash;social obligations which it must bear no matter what the difficulties may be, and social obligations which must be discharged in the circumstances that confront us to-day.</P>
    <P>I have the unemployment figures which are available&mdash;I quote official figures here&mdash;and they are such as to shake anybody who may feel complacent about the position out of any mood of complacency in which he may desire to take shelter.  Official figures show that on the first Saturday in February, 1950, there were 22,000 persons claiming unemployment insurance benefit.  On the first Saturday in February, 1951, which is the nearest comparable date, there were 22,000 people claiming unemployment insurance benefit.  But, on the first Saturday of February, 1952, the figure had jumped to 31,000 which clearly demonstrates that as compared with February of last year and February of the previous year the number of persons drawing unemployment insurance benefit alone had jumped by no less than 9,000.  When you search to see if you can find any evidence as to when our own employment insurance recipients reached the figure of 31,000 you have to go back to the chaotic, disorganised days of 1923.  Therefore, we are now presented with a situation in which we have more people claiming unemployment insurance benefit than at any time since 1923, and one can understand the economic situation in the country during that year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Not only are the figures of to-day serious but their tendency is still more serious.  If you look at the figures for 1950 and 1951 you will find that after Christmas in each year there was a tendency for these figures to fall; that is, the unemployment insurance figures of applicants seeking benefit tended to fall.  Now we have an entirely different situation.  Instead of the figures tending to fall they tend to rise.  For example, in the three weeks prior to the first week in February, 1951, the figures fell by 1,600, but the figures this year in the same three weeks show an increase of 1,000, again indicating that, bad as the situation is to-day, and high as the number receiving unemployment benefit is to-day, the tendency is not towards a rectification of the position but towards a further deterioration in the whole employment position.</P>
    <P>If you stand back from the situation revealed by those who are receiving unemployment insurance benefit and look at the over-all picture of unemployment, the position is equally bleak and equally disconcerting.  Again, I am quoting from an official document issued by the Central Statistics Office when I say that in February, 1950, the over-all number of persons registered as unemployed, that is, drawing unemployment insurance benefit, unemployment assistance benefit, and with special Army claims then current, was 71,000.  In February, 1951, the figure had fallen to 64,000.  But, in February, 1952, the figure had risen by 10,000 to 74,000, a figure which had not been reached in 1950 or 1951.  Here again an examination of the official figures shows that the tendency is for the number to rise, which is against the normal tendency revealed in the previous years.</P>
    <P>While these figures disclose a serious situation, the real inner facts which are not disclosed by the figures make manifest a still more disconcerting situation because, as those of us who have been dealing with this problem in public life know, a considerable number of persons who are unemployed, who have no stamps to their credit, or no qualification certificates immediately available, or who are only entitled to a low rate of unemployment <Col N="651" /> assistance, do not go to the trouble of signing at the employment exchanges.  Firstly, they take the view that, with other people unemployed and in receipt of benefit, those who have no benefits to get are not likely to get employment before those who have benefits to get, because governmental practice has been to give preference of employment to those drawing the highest rate of unemployment assistance benefit, with the result that those who have no stamps to their credit or who are only entitled to a small amount of unemployment assistance do not trouble to go the distance to the employment exchanges to register because they do not feel that there is any corresponding benefit by doing so.  Therefore, if these were included in the number of persons who can be reckoned as unemployed, the figure would be much higher than the 74,000 I have quoted as the current unemployment figure for the first Saturday in February.</P>
    <P>When we take stock of this unemployment situation as revealed by these figures, let us bear in mind as well that we have reached this high peak notwithstanding the fact that emigration in the last four months of 1951 and the first month of 1952 showed an increase of 65 per cent. over the figures for the same months of the previous year.  Again, these are official statistics supplied by the Taoiseach in answer to a parliamentary question yesterday.  We have, therefore, this serious situation.  We have a jump of 10,000 in the number of persons registered as unemployed compared with the same period last year and this notwithstanding the fact that there is a considerable number of people who do not register because it is not worth their while to do so.  We have this huge total of unemployed notwithstanding the fact that our emigration figures show that 65 per cent. more people sought permits to go abroad to work in the five months from September, 1951, to the end of January, 1952.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that, no matter what political Party we may be associated with, that is a serious situation.  It is not one from which <Col N="652" /> we can escape simply by ignoring it. It is not one which can be ignored, because underlying that substantial increase in unemployment is a mass of human suffering, a mass of unemployed men and women with family responsibilities trying to pay rent, trying to feed themselves, trying to clothe themselves, trying to buy all the other necessaries of life in a civilised community.  Therefore, it must be the task of this Parliament to devise ways and means to try to put these people into employment, which is the preferable course, or, if we fail to do that, at least to mitigate the severest privations which unemployment necessarily inflicts on the ordinary working-class family.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would attempt to deny that our emigration position is serious and is tending to become still more serious.  Newspapers which have no political axe to grind and clergymen have given utterance during the past months, and previously, let me say, to the fact that they are startled with the way in which the country is being stripped of its manhood and womanhood.  Again, no matter what our political associations may be, that is a situation which is a challenge to our capacity to legislate intelligently for our people.  I think, however, that, bad as the present situation is, what appears to lie ahead will be even worse.  Deputy Davin said at Question Time to-day, and the newspapers have carried a similar report, that, in a week's time, approximately 300 county council workers in Laois will be paid off.  They may have to go to seek employment elsewhere. It is not available to them locally. The choice for them is to go to the employment exchange, if they have stamps to their credit to entitle them to benefit there, or, alternatively, to go to the emigrant ship, which apparently offers the only hope of their getting regular employment.</P>
    <P>In Meath, Deputy Dunne recently took a deputation to the Meath County Council on behalf of road workers employed in the county where the same story was told: a couple of hundred men out of employment clamouring at the offices of the county <Col N="653" /> council for opportunities to work and petitioning the county council to approach the Minister for Local Government with a view to securing grants to enable these people to continue in employment until the new rate made the prospect of a longer period of employment possible for them.  Recently, we read in the newspapers of similar demonstrations by unemployed persons in County Tipperary where large numbers were standing off.  The fear of another payoff was so imminent that they felt it necessary to go to the county council and ask it to take steps not only to find employment for those paid off, but to try and avert the still greater pool of unemployment which was likely to arise once the existing grants had run out.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the traders, as distinct from those employed in the public service, the position revealed is a very serious one.  In the textile trade, the great majority of textile workers are not doing a full week's work.  A very large number of textile workers are whole-time unemployed, while the great majority of the remainder are not employed for a full week.  If one looks at the import figures one can find no real explanation of that because the import figures do not show that there have been any imports on a scale to justify the unemployment position which now exists in the textile and clothing trades.  If you look at the boot and shoe industry a very, very large number of workers in it are paid off and practically the entire trade is on part-time employment. This may, of course, be due to the fact, and I think is due to the fact, that there is a buyers' resistance in these two fields of productivity, a buyers' resistance probably due to the fact that there is not money available to replenish textiles and garments and to replenish boots and shoes.  The consequent result is that unemployment is caused in both these industries by reason of what appears to be a fact, a buyers' resistance.  If you have a buyers' resistance in these two industries there is probably nothing you can do about it, but it seems highly doubtful wisdom to allow a situation to continue in which, for example, <Col N="654" /> you may have this position continued for a long time.  It might be a more intelligent approach to the whole problem, even for the State, to aid in breaking price levels there in the hope that you can get stability at new price levels and get regular employment at new price levels so far as these industries are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the building trade you now have a situation which has not been with us for some years.  For the first time for some years building craftsmen are idle, and for the first time for some years building trade workers are emigrating. That is a situation, surely, which we cannot contemplate with equanimity.  It has been many a day since these building trade workers were idle.  The fact that they are idle to-day, and are finding it difficult to get alternative employment in the industry and are beginning to emigrate again shows the need for steps to be taken here to correct whatever currents are responsible for creating a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think that, with respect to the building industry, a general feeling of insecurity is probably one of the factors which have brought about a curtailment in building trade operations; but I think the main factor has been that the banks are not financing the smaller builder and are cutting the credit of the smaller builder with the result that he is laying off his workers.  The private builder, especially in the large cities, is doing a considerable amount of building work to-day, and if his credit is tightened, if the banks get him in their grip and squeeze him, his resources being so limited, he must immediately shed workers who will go to the employment exchange and when they find that there is no work there, will proceed to make inquiries as to where they can get employment in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that anybody concerned with employment here cannot feel reassured by a situation which is developing on these most unsatisfactory lines.  A rise in unemployment is bad at any time, but one feature of a rise in unemployment which is likely to continue is that it means it is going to be harder for the unemployed man <Col N="655" /> to get work.  It is elementary to say that the more people that are out of work the harder it is for the unemployed man to get work.  That means that persons will be idle for a longer period.  It means, as well, that they will have to live for a prolonged period on rates of benefit which are not capable of sustaining them during the period they are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody in this House&mdash;again, irrespective of Party&mdash; would attempt to contend that the rates of unemployment benefit which we pay to-day are capable of sustaining those who have to depend on them. The rate of unemployment insurance benefit for a man to-day is 22/6 per week.  If he has a wife, he will get an additional 7/6, and if he has two children, an additional 2/6 for each, so that the position of the unemployed man, whether he is a boot and shoe operative, a textile worker or a craftsman on a building scheme, is that, if he has a wife and two children, he has to live to-day on 35/- per week.  That is bad for one week.  What must it be if he has to try to live on that for a number of weeks, and who knows how many weeks he will have to live on it, if we get into a situation of rapidly deteriorating employment?</P>
    <P>Will anybody attempt to say to-day that there is any place in this country where a man used to regular employment could live with his wife and two children, could pay rent, buy foodstuffs such as meat and milk, buy firing, clothes, and boots and shoes for the kiddies on an income of 35/- per week?  That is what we expect him to live on if he is unemployed, and that is the best rate, because if he is receiving unemployment assistance, he gets substantially less than that.  With a wife and five or six children, he might get as low as 23/- per week in some areas, where he had no unemployment insurance contributions to his credit.  I do not imagine that any Deputy will attempt to defend these rates of benefit.  I think they are indefensible in the circumstances in which we live to-day, and that situation is made all the more acute for those who <Col N="656" /> are suffering from unemployment by reason of price increases.</P>
    <P>Nobody has attempted to deny that price increases have taken place over the past 12 or 18 months, price increases which, in many cases, are due to external causes and, in some cases, to internal causes.  Let it be perfectly clear that everyone in the House has acknowledged the fact that price increases have taken place.  It does not matter who is in office, so far as the unemployed man is concerned, when prices are going up and his rate of benefit is the same.  For him, it is hardship one way or the other, unless he gets deliverance from his hardship. It will not be denied, either, that in recent months prices have risen even more steeply than previously, and these rises which took place recently were on top of previous increases, and it all makes a pyramid of higher living costs, so far as the unemployed man is concerned.  I know of no condition present in this country to-day which excuses the payment of these inordinately low rates of benefits to our unemployed people, but I do say that the figures I have quoted, the price levels which we know to be running to-day and the low rates of benefit paid to our unemployed people, justify support for this motion on every human consideration.</P>
    <P>It may be asked&mdash;it probably will be asked&mdash;where is the money to come from in order to meet the claim set out in this motion for an increase in the rates of benefit?  I think the money is there and I do not think that, so far as the Government is concerned, the grant of increases in this case need impose any heavy burden, if indeed any burden whatever, upon the State, at least for some time to come. According to official figures, there stood in the Unemployment Fund Account in 1949 a sum of £874,000.  The figure had been rising by between £200,000 and £300,000 in each of the years preceding 1949, and it is reasonable therefore to assume that the figure has increased substantially since 1949.  That sum of money is there at the moment.  It represents the surplus which is available after benefits have been paid out of the contributions <Col N="657" /> which are legitimately payable to the fund, and that sum of money could be made available, because it is intended to be the pool from which workers draw benefit, for the purpose of augmenting the existing rates of unemployment insurance.  I know of no reason why it cannot be used for this purpose, but that is not all the money there is available.</P>
    <P>If the Minister takes the trouble to inquire, he will find that, in 1945, the Government passed a Bill for the purpose of keeping those who joined the Army in unemployment insurance benefit, while in the Army, and it contracted under that Act to put into the Unemployment Insurance Fund a certain contribution each week in respect of every person who joined the Army.  The Government promised those who joined the Army that, when they came out, they would be entitled to draw unemployment insurance benefit, but the strange part of this whole deal was that the Government sent those who were discharged from the Army to the employment exchanges throughout the country, told them to claim benefit there if they were unemployed and paid them out of the fund which had been accumulated by the insured worker, but, so far, the Government has not put into the fund the money it contracted to pay under the 1945 Act in respect of those who joined the Army.</P>
    <P>The situation we have to-day is that the State owes the Unemployment Insurance Fund, I think, not less than £1,250,000.  That sum of £1,250,000 is a debt morally and legally due to the fund by the State.  The State contracted to pay it under the 1945 Unemployment Insurance Act, but, in fact, the State has raided the fund by putting on to it persons for whom the State paid no contributions.  In other words, the State gave these people a lien to the fund, as they were entitled to do, but they were entitled to give it only when they paid the contributions for them.  The State has paid out the money to these people who claimed benefit on discharge from the Army, but the State itself has defaulted to the extent of £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>That is not a very creditable situation and it is a situation <Col N="658" /> which ought to be remedied, because, if that sum which the State owes to the Unemployment Insurance Fund were available, with the sum of more than £1,000,000 now there, there should be no difficulty whatever in acceding to the claim made in this motion that the rates of unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance should be increased, in view of (1) the rise in prices and (2) developing unemployment.  All that money&mdash;it must be nearly £2,250,000 or £2,500,000&mdash;should be available in that kitty for the purpose of financing rates of benefit to insured workers.</P>
    <P>If the State paid what it owes and utilised money which is already there in consultation with those who represent the workers, then I am quite sure the lot of the unemployed workers could be considerably eased thereby in the crisis through which we are now passing.</P>
    <P>The utilisation of that money need not in any way cause subsequent embarrassment. It was contemplated under the comprehensive social security scheme that whatever money was standing in these funds&mdash;such as the National Health Insurance Fund, the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund&mdash;would be allowed to remain in the funds and that the income in the form of investments would go into the new fund that would be created or the new annual allocation which may be decided upon and in that way help to meet the annual charges that had to be met.  If the State now uses all or a portion of the moneys in or due to the Unemployment Insurance Fund for the purpose of increasing existing unemployment insurance and assistance benefits, then no serious harm is done.  The only difficulty and the only difference is&mdash;and both are relatively slight&mdash;that the State only under a new and comprehensive scheme, will not have these annual dividends coming in, at least so far as the Unemployment Insurance Fund is concerned and to that extent will, therefore, have to make good by contributions or allocations from Exchequer sources whatever would be lost by utilising the fund to increase the rate of benefit at this stage.  But for the State that presents <Col N="659" /> no difficulty.  The State can make good whatever may be lost by using these funds for that purpose, by paying a greater sum annually to finance a comprehensive scheme and that can be done in the knowledge that the money so used from the Unemployment Insurance Fund was very largely workers' contributions, and was money well spent in tiding unemployed workers over their present difficulty.</P>
    <P>I think I have shown by facts based on official figures that unemployment has increased substantially as compared with this time 12 months ago, that it has really increased rapidly in recent months, and that the tendency is for the figures of unemployed persons to rise still further.  I think I have shown&mdash;and, in any case, I do not think it will be contested&mdash;that prices have risen and are continuing to rise, and I think I have shown, by the exercise of ordinary common sense and by a sense of fair play, that the present rates of unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance benefit are inadequate to sustain those whom they are intended to help, especially in present circumstances.  I think I have shown, too, that money is available to meet the reasonable claims set out in the motion.  Having established, therefore, that the present rates are inadequate, that unemployment is rising, that prices have risen and are rising, and that money is available, the Government ought, in these circumstances, approach this whole matter in a non-Party spirit, and I hope they will find it possible to accept the claim set out in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is important when considering the terms of the motion that we should try to approach it, as Deputy Norton has suggested, on a non-partisan basis in respect of the position of unemployed men and women and the responsibility that members of all Parties bear to them.  It appears to me that we should also approach it on a non-partisan basis because of what is implied in respect of our whole economy by a growth in unemployment and the very dangerous consequences that could arise if we failed to take note <Col N="660" /> not merely of the absolute increase, but of the trends revealed by a breakdown of the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a situation develops in this country in which we have growing unemployment, unemployment having its basis primarily in manufacturing industries, then we have got an economic sore which it is going to be almost impossible to isolate and which will have growing repercussions on an ever-widening circle of wage and salary earners.  Therefore the motion is important, not merely from the aspect of drawing attention to the needs of those who are idle but also to try and secure attention for the situation that is surrounding us at the moment. Deputy Norton, moving the motion, referred to the official figures in so far as the register of unemployed is concerned. When, in September, these figures started to attract attention, many of us felt that it was a passing phase and that with the entry of the new year we would find the usual restoration of economic improvement and growing employment again.  It is not merely remarkable that at the moment we have 10,000 more on the live register to-day than we had 12 months ago; it is not only remarkable that last year witnessed an increase in that register of some 16 per cent. or that, more important still, there was an increase in the number of those registered as having claims current&mdash; and are constituted in the main of workers who are generally employed in insurable employment and have at least for some years enjoyed constant and comparatively well-paid employment&mdash;but that whereas during 1951, during each month of that year as compared with 1950, up to the month of September, we had either stability in our unemployment figures or a reduction, starting with September, month by month, there has been an increase in the absolute figure as compared with the same month in the previous year and the increase has grown progressively greater with each month. Even the normal factor that has been witnessed generally towards the end of January or the commencement of February in each year, that of a drop in unemployment figures, is absent this <Col N="661" /> year, and we are faced with the possibility, so far as the latest official figures are concerned, if not of a continuance of that increase at least of a maintenance of the increased figure for total unemployment.</P>
    <P>At present our unemployment rate is very much greater than that in England&mdash;and naturally no one desires to make any comparison.  It is also greater than in Northern Ireland, and the increase has been greater and yet, so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, many persons, both those associated with the Government and those associated with the Opposition, are openly speaking of it as of a grave character.  So where there is a question that we do take a grave view of this situation, it is not done in any sense of trying to stigmatise the Government nor are we seeking at the moment to try to attach political causes to this development.  The fact is that we have a situation which must concern us all, and it is our responsibility to know the situation and to see what remedy can be applied, both to arrest and retrieve it, and to give some succour to those directly affected.  I mentioned already that one of the worst aspects of this growth of unemployment is its direct effect upon some of our most important manufacturing industries, particularly clothing, textiles, boots and shoes.  While the position in the boot and shoe trade is not as bad as that of the clothing trade, it must be regarded as almost catastrophic. According to the figures I have been given by the National Union of Boot and Shoe Workers, who have records of their idle members, the actual position at the moment is that of the 12,000 employees in that industry as a whole 2,600 are working short-time and only 1,600 are fully employed. When one realises that in a town like Dundalk the boot and shoe industry is almost basic to the whole economy there, one understands the fearful economic significance of the falling off in employment to a town like that which, for quite a number of years, has enjoyed such a wave of prosperity. It is correct to say that in the clothing trade almost no workers are employed full-time, and the textile <Col N="662" /> trade&mdash;cotton, woollen and worsted&mdash;is also, though probably not to the same extent, very seriously affected, as are also new industries towards the establishment and maintenance of which the Irish people as a whole have made very great sacrifices.</P>
    <P>We can readily visualise them drifting into a period, not merely of economic decline but of economic depression unless we look for a solution. The building trade has been mentioned and in Dublin alone, for probably the first time in many years, the Amalgamated Union of Wood Workers announce that 500 carpenters are unemployed, also plasterers, which is a phenomenon we have not seen in Dublin since before the war, and goodness knows how many builders' labourers are unemployed at the moment.  The whole situation is perilous and one which should be of the greatest concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>On top of the situation I have depicted we have a similar rural situation. Again we are not concerned with political arguments or with controversy except to note that in county after county considerable numbers of men are idle.  It may be because the money already voted for schemes has been expended with probably greater speed than wisdom, that there has been a reduced amount of money made available or that the schemes are delayed waiting for sanction either locally or centrally.  At any rate, the result is idle men.  These are factors with which we should concern ourselves very particularly.</P>
    <P>In addition to our unemployment figures, we have also got the problem of emigration.  This is a loss which is felt, not merely in the matter of individual citizens, but more so because employment is radically affected. Many of our new industries are losing highly-trained technical workers who have been trained at very considerable cost and who have in some cases been sent to other countries for their training. Now, however, they are seeking work elsewhere.  Even if we were fortunate enough to have a rapid recovery, there is the possibility that when that recovery comes about we will have shortages of trained workers. <Col N="663" /> That, in itself, is a very serious problem so that when the motion draws attention to the serious situation, it is one which is established by official figures, and one on which we should not be swayed by political differences.  The other portions of the motion are equally self-evident.  It is true that it is the duty of a Government, regardless of what Government it is, to take measures to restore the former level of commercial and industrial activity.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure this Government would not repudiate that responsibility no more than any other Government, even though it may point out that the farmers of the motion have not made any practical contribution as regards suggested measures to meet the situation.  But they cannot criticise us for asking for that attention. At the same time, we have got to try to make our contribution.  In so far as industrial and commercial employment is concerned, I think, frankly, that we cannot place a finger on any single factor which is causing the present situation.  It is now clearly established, regardless of the confusion some months ago, that, so far as our main manufacturing industries are concerned&mdash;clothing, textiles, boots and shoes&mdash;increased imports during 1951 have practically played no part in creating the present problem.  The increase in the volume is almost, in the main, due to higher prices. Consequently, if we check the volume very carefully, we will not find an answer in the case of reduced imports. The question of consumers' resistance to high prices is probably one of the definite factors.  Even though the Government feel that they must draw the most serious attention of all concerned to what they regard as the present economic position of the country, it seems to me that they should realise that pessimism and continuous emphasis on the economic difficulties facing us can have repercussions, and I personally feel that a little optimism is called for now if we are not going to continue to do grave harm to our industries and to our commercial activity.  Quite clearly, <Col N="664" /> if consumers are already in resistance against high prices, and are already deferring their buying, they will be even more inclined to do so if there is evidence that there are still greater economic difficulties facing them and that there may be greater financial burdens placed upon them.  The Government should make its contribution by expressing optimism and its belief in the immediate future of Ireland's economy.</P>
    <P>It has been denied that the banks have been restricting credit and figures have been given by the banks to show the increased accommodation provided. That does not answer the question. If large concerns in this country &mdash;we know they have done so&mdash;seek bank accommodation to purchase increased supplies of raw materials, the whole of that increased accommodation could be absorbed by some half-dozen units, while at the same time there could be increased pressure on small firms and on individuals and growing reluctance on the part of the banks to make accommodation.  I have no personal contact with bank managers, but since we had our previous discussion in this House I have been told on two occasions by bank managers that they are operating in that direction.  I do not think there is any doubt about it.  The Government can suggest to the banks that, in the interests of the banks themselves, as well as in the whole economy, there should be a less rigorous attitude towards this question of accommodation, particularly with reference to the small employer and more especially in relation to the building trade.</P>
    <P>On the question of consumption, I notice that the Tánaiste expressed the view that we have the problem of consumers' resistance, that we have a certain amount of surplus goods on hands and that we must wait for these to work themselves off.  I feel that a really serious and determined effort should be made to bring about even the smallest reduction in prices.  The psychological effect of that would be tremendous.  I personally feel that this should be done and that, even though it might prove a burden upon manufacturers and traders for a certain <Col N="665" /> period, it would be ultimately for their own good.  If they proceed on the road on which they are travelling now, they may find themselves in a much greater crisis than is facing them at present.  It has been a good trading maxim to cut one's losses in order to strengthen one's economy and to move forward.  Traders and manufacturers should face realities and make a contribution towards the restoration of consumers' confidence and towards a reduction in the great scepticism felt by consumers on the justification for the present price level.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to say&mdash;and many members of local authorities will probably speak on this with greater force than I can&mdash;that there has been difficulty in respect of departmental delays in regard to housing and various other local government activities.  We are agreed that there has to be a careful check, but if those delays are creating stoppages and placing men out of work at the present time they are unpardonable, and no Government should permit them.  There should be a careful examination of that.</P>
    <P>So far, in Dublin, we have been lucky in the sense that corporation schemes have been moving ahead, but it is, I understand, likely that towards the end of this year they may run into difficulties in regard to finance, sites and the question of main drainage.  But in so far as private building is concerned, there is widespead complaints of the delay.  When a small builder, employing 50, 100 or 150 men, is unable to obtain the money rightfully due to him, there is no use in expecting him to be able to pass these men on to another scheme and keep them all employed.  He must lay them off.  Only yesterday I came up against that problem, and it seems this week 30 labourers are going to be laid off a scheme, whereas, if the money had been paid over, that would not be necessary.  I am not blaming anybody, I am merely mentioning the fact that those 30 men would have immediately moved on to another scheme instead of having to be dismissed. When we multiply that by ten, 20 or 100, we start to get our present unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> We should again look at this question of public works.  It is a recognised economic measure to prime the pump.  There is no better way of doing it, at least in this country, than in respect of our public works&mdash;roads and other local authority activities.  If there is inadequate money to allow the local authorities to continue until the end of the financial year, some provision should be made for it, and the proposition should be carefully examined in respect of the coming year.  Quite clearly, whatever money we spend in providing employment for our own people in the rural areas, none of that will be saved; it is not going to go into the banks to blocked accounts; it will not be withheld from the economy.  It will pass right through the whole economic body and will ease the problem not only in many homes but also will ease the problem facing our manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>Finally, the main purpose of the motion is to draw attention to the personal economic position of the idle men and women while existing on benefit or assistance rates.  I can see no possible grounds upon which there can be any difference there.  Everyone in this House, with certain individual exceptions, every Party in this House, has committed itself publicly to a scheme of social security.  One of the main features of it was to provide increased benefits in regard to unemployment insurance.  It is idle at the moment to argue why this is not in force to-day, but surely we can agree that if for any reason these increased benefits are not now available to the idle men and women in their increased numbers, as a temporary expedient pending the passing through this House of the necessary legislation, we could provide these increased benefits to meet this present situation.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a question of providing increased money for individual living purposes to men and women.  It is again an economic factor.  By providing this increased amount of money we are increasing spending power.  We are making available to a very large mass of consumers money they can spend on Irish manufactured goods, and by this means make a contribution <Col N="667" /> to their re-employment and the re-employment of their fellow-workers.</P>
    <P>I noticed that some two weeks ago reference was made to this motion by Deputy Dr. Browne.  I would suggest, and I do it with all deference, that whatever may be our political feelings either in regard to the past, present, or future, each and every one of us has, not merely a political responsibility but a personal responsibility to those idle men and women.  I think that this motion, in so far as its main purpose is to seek a greater volume of relief for those 74,000 men and women, is one that calls for the support of every member of the House.  The men and women outside this House whose problem we are discussing to-night have a claim on each one of us irrespective of political or Party affiliations or what our political standpoint is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be possible for the Government to accept this motion in the spirit in which it has been spoken to by the proposer and the seconder of it.  The motion here posits that there is at the present moment unemployment, that there is a tendency to greater unemployment and that there is necessity for making those people who are unemployed feel hope for the future and feel that while they are unemployed and in their present circumstances a better provision is made for their maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin asks us to bring into the situation an atmosphere of optimism.  I feel that it is vitally important that the Government, in its reception of this motion, would do something to bring that about, because I feel that, to be discussing to-day the motion that is here, should make us feel that we are in a very dangerous situation.  Alongside us in Great Britain we have a people who are just getting the wheels moving for the expenditure in a couple of years of £4,000,000,000 on arms.  If our workers here, whether in agriculture or manufacturing industries, see unemployment, even though they are not themselves at present unemployed, there is inevitably a drag on them to go over <Col N="668" /> to Britain into a situation in which there is plenty of well-paid employment apparently waiting for them and employment that is going to be secure for a fairly definite period of time.  I think that is an element in the situation that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I asked in a supplementary question to the Minister for Finance, yesterday, was there a possibility that the Government would introduce the Budget at an early period, earlier than usual, in order to determine the financial approach to their present situation and the present position they have been complaining of.  I did not ask that lightly, because I felt it to be vitally important that we should know where we stand in regard to the general Government and parliamentary approach to the whole economic situation and in regard to what our general formula is to be in dealing with the matter at the earliest possible moment.  In view of all that has been said and done in recent months, in view of the condition in which we are, and if there is no prospect of our having a review of almost a budgetary kind on our general approach to the immediate economic programmes and our financing of them, then, I think, that the Government's approach to this motion should be such as would show that they wanted to invite people to be confident and to be optimistic in regard to the future, and that they were going to approach the discussion of unemployment and economic matters in the spirit in which both the mover and the seconder of this motion have asked.</P>
    <P>I, too, would desire to discuss anything that has to be discussed on this motion in a way that would not imply that there was any reason for discussing it in a purely Party spirit or for scoring off the Government or any other person in the place.  I certainly would ask the Minister and those on the Government Benches to believe that if anything I say with regard to the facts of the situation will rub them the wrong way, I am urging, nevertheless, at the same time that it is imperative in our discussion to look at <Col N="669" /> things factually with a responsibility, not only to the people who are unemployed to-day, but the people who are employed to-day and who may be unemployed to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The actual facts of the situation have been covered to some extent by the figures given by Deputy Norton, but the position has been brought about by a certain sequence of events.  First, we have had the political criticism and comments and, from our point of view, misrepresentations of the economic policy pursued by the last Government. Coming on top of that we had the position as regards the banks. There was a certain amount of stockpiling definitely invited by the last Government as a policy.  These stocks of various kinds were definitely laid in, and it is a remarkable thing to me that the Government so impressed people with the possibility of war being round the corner, that they took up an attitude, as I believe they definitely have done, in their dealings and discussions with the banks which resulted in getting the banks to withdraw moneys that have been made available for stockpiling.</P>
    <P>At any rate, anybody connected with the commercial life of the country knows, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, that instructions had been given to the banks to pull back credit.  The fact that the bank deposits at the present moment show no sign of decrease is no criterion of the present situation.  The general position is that the people who have got money for stockpiling have been advised by the banks that they must make very substantial reductions in their overdrafts by May.  Because they have been warned, they have been pressed to reduce their overdrafts. They have been told that any moneys that have been given them must be wiped out by May, and because of that they have stopped buying.  They have been to some extent disposing of their stocks, and the very people who think there are difficulties are the people who have forced the disgorging of stocks that were piled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy say who gave those instructions to the banks?</P>

    <Col N="670" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Were I asked for a personal opinion I would say that the Government did.  However, the Deputy was not here when this debate was initiated.  I do not want to make assertions of any particular kind that will obscure the things we are talking about.  We are talking about the fact that credit, given for stockpiling, has been pulled back and that there is an order still standing and instructions to the banks which are to be kept very confidential as far as the directing spirit of the banks are concerned and must not be sent down amongst the rank and file of officials.  There has to be a very strong tightening down on credit.  That has brought about the fact that stocks which were brought into being for an emergency are being dissipated and the people who have these stocks have stopped buying. They do not know when that impulse to buy again will be restored.  It will not be restored until the general position with regard to the Government's approach to the economic situation is generally made clear.</P>
      <P>Not only is there unemployment but a very serious situation has also been created, that of short time.  There is a certain amount of unemployment in the building industry and it is very definitely felt that there will be very substantial unemployment in the building industry in the City of Dublin in six or seven months time.  Figures have been quoted for last September but by the time figures are quoted for next September the feeling in the building industry in the city is that these figures will be very substantially greater.  There is that feeling in the building industry at the moment and there is a drag on our building operatives who have to go and take work elsewhere.  All this is going to be felt for the next couple of years. That feeling is very definitely there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I think that while the Dublin Corporation are only beginning now to talk about what their financial requirements are, it is a matter of urgent importance to the Dublin Corporation that it should know from the Government what they are going to do with regard to getting the £5,000,000 which the Dublin Corporation require.  If there is a feeling <Col N="671" /> that the building industry in the City of Dublin is going to be substantially reduced in its activities by September next, but that the Dublin Corporation schemes are going to go ahead and that the Government is going to assist the corporation in regard to these schemes, that would be, I believe, one of the real, practical things which would restore a certain feeling of optimism.</P>

We have had, before the Deputy came to grace the House, discussions with the Government on this question of the Dublin Corporation finances, and if the Deputy is able to assure us that the Government have radically changed their approach in regard to their responsibility to the Dublin Corporation and its moneys, and the amount it will have to pay for them, it would be helpful to the future situation.</P>

      <P>I would sit down in order to clear up this point at the earliest possible moment if the Minister would say whether Dublin Corporation will get this money and get it at terms that are in keeping with the ideas expressed when the Government discussed the matter with the banks on behalf of Dublin Corporation. It would be a great help, but perhaps it would be more orderly to allow the Minister to deal with that matter when he intervenes in the debate in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another element in the building situation that would require attention.  Normally, a very considerable amount of repair work is a valuable part of the employment given in the building trade throughout the country.  I understand that the operations of the Valuation Office at the present moment are holding up repair work in many directions, particularly in the City of Dublin.  That is working very unfavourably on building employment. It is a matter that could very well be generally attended to.  With regard to one aspect of the financial position and the Government's approach generally, it has been intimated to us that what we want is a kind of austerity policy.  An austerity policy pursued in this country on a basis similar to that of the policy <Col N="673" /> pursued in Great Britain and in a way that flows from that policy will have on this country results entirely different from the point of view of employment to the results of that policy in Great Britain.  The policy of austerity in Great Britain changes the nature of the people's employment.  It results in people being transferred from one class of employment to another.  Although they are prevented from using the motor cars they make, they are, nevertheless, employed in making motor cars which are being used for export.  To adopt their approach both to the handling of the credit situation and to an austerity programme would be disastrous to this country, although that policy might be necessary and healthy in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of the general atmosphere in which we discuss these things here.  The Government's statement of the financial situation was an attempt to confuse the people.  The situation demands that that attempt at confusion be withdrawn and that attempts to blind the people by passion and by differences arising out of the past be wiped out of existence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is going over to Great Britain now to deal with very urgent and important matters.  Nevertheless we have the <i>Irish Press</i> of January 26th, speaking of previous occasions when Irish leaders went to Great Britain to discuss matters of vital importance to the people here. We are given a picture of the Irish leaders of the time who went over to make a treaty, and they are described as &ldquo;foolish and reckless leaders.&rdquo;  If we are to discuss vital economic and social matters which are of such urgency to-day, we need a situation where members and leaders of this House would not outside the House write in terms of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have a problem of unemployment and a likelihood of more unemployment arising.  That we know, and we can see a definite trend.  We have the problem of maintaining those who are unemployed, while just outside our doors there is a very definite drag on our people out of the country.  The <Col N="674" /> whole thing goes even wider than that, and the next couple of months will show the question in greater detail to us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin spoke of the repercussions on the salaried and other sections if there were a considerable amount of unemployment.  One of the things that is creating, tending to create and perhaps increase unemployment among the workers of this country is the fact that vital classes are being broken and uprooted.  The workers in the agricultural industry are being reduced in number as a result of the Government's approach to the development of agriculture.  The Minister for Finance the other day declared that certain circumstances pointed to the collapse of the inter-Party Government's approach to agriculture. They are misrepresenting that position.  The number of workers in agriculture is diminishing, and the middle income class is being broken by economic circumstances which are squeezing them between taxation and the rising cost of living.  That reduction in agricultural employment and the position of the middle classes are vital factors which affect the strength of our economy.  But for these circumstances we would be able to keep in work the persons at present employed in the building industry and increase that number.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government realise the spirit in which this motion is put before them.  We want them to realise that there is unemployment and a trend towards greater unemployment. There is outside that the fact that we are going to be stripped of our workers, their value to us and the technical skill they have for us, unless there is a constructive approach.  A constructive approach to the motion involves a constructive approach to our general finances and our general economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by expressing appreciation of the restraint shown by Deputies Norton and Larkin in their speeches supporting this motion and of the fact that Deputy Mulcahy followed their example.  When the motion was tabled I confess that I did not know <Col N="675" /> whether it was intended to be an occasion for serious debate on a serious topic or a manoeuvre in Party warfare. I am glad that any unworthy suspicions I had of the subjects have been allayed.</P>
      <P>We have, in the matter to which this motion refers, difficult problems to resolve.  Deputy Larkin urged that we should strike a note of optimism and expressed the view that, if we did, we would have economic benefits.  I do not think it is a matter for either optimism or pessimism; I think it is realism that we require now because, if we have difficulties, as has been stressed by the Deputies who have spoken, difficulties actually existing now or anticipated during the course of the year, we cannot hope to find a way around them unless we understand fully their character and their origin.</P>
      <P>At any rate, I would have a personal problem in following Deputy Larkin's advice because I have been arguing here for a considerable time past, both as a member of the Government and before that as a member of the Opposition, that unless there was a change in this country&mdash;and I was thinking of a change in the public outlook upon the economic problems of the country as much as of a change in Government policy &mdash; the economic indicators pointed inevitably to the arrival sooner or later of a time at which we would experience a lowering of our standard of living manifested through rising prices and rising unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the situation which has begun to develop during last year. Nobody could have expected that it would come suddenly upon us.  It was clearly to be anticipated that it would develop gradually and I think we must take it that the first signs of its coming are with us now and, if we are to take effective action to check that trend, it is now we have to do it.  We may not agree as to the action that will be most effective but we can at least now regard it as common ground that action is required.  That is a gain.  We have all been talking, sometimes acrimoniously, sometimes controversially, sometimes constructively, <Col N="676" /> about these matters but I think it is true that the great majority of the people of the country regard these economic and financial problems as so much politicians' talk unlikely to affect them ever in their own daily lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to blame them for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, however, it will become clear, I think, that there are forces at work which will affect people in their daily lives, either through the impact of prices upon the cost of living or through the diminution of trade leading to unemployment.  That, in my view, is precisely the situation towards which all Government activity must be directed during the course of this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin will excuse me if this does not sound as optimistic as he would wish&mdash;I do not think it will be easy to check the trend that is now developing.  We have to try but if we are to succeed we will need, not merely co-operation in the Dáil, but a great deal more understanding of our problems outside the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We have here this problem of increased unemployment in industry. I do not want to be dogmatic about it. I have discussed it with trade associations, with trade union organisations and, perhaps more profitably, privately with individual industrial managers and workers and I have tried to build up out of all the information made available to me a picture of what is happening and to get out of it an explanation of its cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view&mdash;and I put this forward with all due reserve&mdash;in the industries that have been mentioned here, the clothing, textile, boot and shoe trades, the essential problem is that the costs of production have pushed prices to the point at which the public is not prepared to keep on buying in the same volume as previously.  In relation to these trades there is no solution now to be found by increasing protection or by action of any sort designed to exclude imported products. In respect of the categories of goods of those classes which are capable of being produced in Irish factories, the measures have already been taken which ensure that the home market is <Col N="677" /> available for these factories and, in the main, it is true to say that these factories have developed to the point at which they are capable of supplying the maximum demand likely ever to develop in any foreseeable time in this country.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that any contraction in demand, any factors operating to induce people to buy less, are bound to have repercussions upon the output and the employment given in these industries.  What has happened over the past six months is that there has been&mdash;I think Deputy Norton called it a buyers' strike&mdash;at any rate, evidence that prices had passed the point at which the public were prepared to buy in the same volume as previously.</P>
    <P>That situation, it is true, has been accentuated by the existence of abnormal stocks in the hands of traders.  I am not going to strike a controversial note there.  May I confess that I think we are all inclined to exaggerate during our political controversies the influence of Government exhortations upon traders?  I do not think the volume of stocks in the hands of traders was influenced to any great extent by the exhortations of my predecessors at the beginning of last year or at the end of the previous year.  No doubt, the accumulation of stocks was facilitated by the exceptional import facilities that were given but no trader would have availed of those facilities unless he thought it would pay him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that sentiment in trade favoured the accumulation of stocks 12 months ago. I have personal knowledge of that in connection with some businesses that I was connected with.  I was in contact with people amongst whom matters of policy in that regard were discussed daily, and I know that there was a strong sentiment in favour of keeping stocks at maximum levels in the expectation <Col N="678" /> either that supply difficulties would emerge due to the international situation or that prices would keep on rising and that the man with the highest stocks would be most likely to benefit.</P>
      <P>That sentiment changed completely towards the end of last year.  That was not so merely in this country; it was so throughout the whole world. I have read reports published by American banks.  I have seen translations of reports published by French, Belgian and other European banks, and we all have more intimate knowledge, perhaps, of the situation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Whether it was the fall in wool prices, accompanied by the fall in certain other raw material prices&mdash;and the price of hides dropped by more than half and must have had some effect upon the position in the leather and boot and shoe trades&mdash;or the talk that was then prevalent of peace in Korea and the possibility of a European settlement, or a combination of all these things, in every country in the world traders took the decision to curtail stocks.  It is difficult to say that they took the wrong decision. Whether one forms that conclusion or not depends upon one's estimate of what is going to happen in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this situation is affected one way or the other by the question of bank credit.  We could have gone to the banks and have said: &ldquo;We want you to keep on giving extended credit facilities to enable traders to retain these abnormal stocks that they are holding.&rdquo;  I do not think traders would have retained those stocks.  I think the sentiment in favour of reducing risks on stocks was so strong that even the offer of liberal bank accommodation would not have prevented their liquidation.  In any event, even if it had happened, it would only postpone to a later date the situation we are now dealing with. Sooner or later, the conditions of trade would have forced liquidation of those stocks on traders and at that stage there would be a temporary curtailment of orders to Irish factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say as definitely as I can that the Government gave no instruction or <Col N="679" /> advice to the banks to curtail credit facilities?  May I say also that, while I do not pretend to be familiar with the private instructions which bank directors may have given to their branch managers, in so far as I have been made aware of them, while there was definite warning against increasing credit facilities, I did not see in them any suggestion that there should be curtailment as a matter of general policy?</P>
    <P>I want to say this also, and it is true whether Deputies believe it or not. Whenever people spoke to me about economic difficulties arising out of the restriction of bank credit, I asked for particulars of specific cases, and I have not got them yet.  I do not say that I got no case.  I got some cases which I examined and in which it seemed to me that the only issue that arose was the creditworthiness of the borrower, and the matter was dealt with on ordinary banking principles.  I am not attempting to make any defence whatever of the policy the banks are pursuing. I do not profess to know intimately what that policy is, but I do want to say that there has not been given to them any decision by the Government to curtail credit, nor any advice to that effect.  I have said here already that they appear to have given credit liberally for the purpose of stockpiling early last year.  I think it would be a matter on which I would feel obliged to make comment if they failed to give equal assistance to a policy of developing our production if and whenever that is possible and to the extent that the banks can help it on.</P>
    <P>The main problem is, however, one of price.  I am convinced of that.  If there is, as undoubtedly is the case, a temporary contraction of orders to factories by reason of the desire of traders to reduce their stocks, that situation will pass sooner or later.  It may pass in some industries more quickly than in others as some stocks are turned over more rapidly than others.  There are signs in some industries that it is passing already. If, however, there has been a definite curtailment in total demand by reason <Col N="680" /> of public reaction to the present level of prices, that is a more difficult situation to deal with.  May I say that the solution of that difficulty is not a matter for the Government alone.  In fact, it is not obvious that the Government can do much about it.  We have, by curtailing quotas and reimposing or increasing tariffs, taken measures to ensure that whatever market is there, it will be available to Irish factories, but, if there is to be an expansion of production for a greater consumption in that market, it might be brought about by reason of the action of managements and trade unions in combination to secure more economic methods of working.  That has happened in individual cases.  In so far as there has been a contraction in the market for goods where Irish factories are capable of supplying the maximum demand that the market can generate, then some firms by better working methods or a better managerial policy have still been able to keep in full activity.  I know individual cases, even in trades which had been affected by this recession in recent months, where full activity is still proceeding.  That would appear to suggest that the managers and the workers there, realising the problem they were faced with, were able to devise methods of operation which could be usefully copied in other similar concerns.</P>
    <P>What I have said regarding certain industries applies in other directions as well.  Even in respect to certain services&mdash;and I include transport in this regard&mdash;the rise in prices has contracted the demand and is tending to create problems in regard to employment in these services also, unless we can by more economic methods of working get prices down again.  Without going into any old controversies or attempting to put the blame on any shoulders for the situation which has developed, but solely because reference was made here to pump-priming, I want to express the view that this situation which has developed, this inflation of cost in industry and in the operation of various services, has been the outcome not merely of rising prices but of the general inflationary situation which has existed, not alone in <Col N="681" /> this country but in other countries for some years past.  It is true that in most industries the cost of purchased materials is the predominant factor in determining prices.  There is no industry, I think, where material costs represent less than 50 per cent. of the ex-factory price.  In some industries, material cost is as high as 90 per cent. of the ex-factory price.  In this country a very high proportion of the materials used in industries are imported and we cannot do much about the cost of them. We have got to get them at whatever the cost.  Because of the failure of our traditional supplier to give us the quantities we need, we have been forced to go abroad into other markets and to buy at very high prices the materials that we need to keep industry going.  In so far as the solution of our industrial problems may be governed by prices, it must be by a concentration on costs that we can control, costs in our own factories.  Because of the inflationary situation and because we have had a continuous rise in prices over the last 18 months or so, there has grown up, not merely in industry but in the country generally, a mentality which believes that costs do not matter.</P>
    <P>That has been supported by assertions, made, I think, without any very great examination of their accuracy, that higher costs can be absorbed by profits without any reaction on prices. Whatever justification there may have been for these assertions in the past, in the case of some industries there can be no such belief now, because I think we are likely to be far more worried at the prospect of a number of our industrial concerns making no profits this year than we are entitled to be about the profits they made in previous years.  At any rate, it is a far more serious prospect for a high proportion of our industrial workers. I want to urge seriously on the Dáil and particularly upon members of the Labour Party and on those who have influence on the trade union movement that in the circumstances now prevailing and likely to develop during the course of the year the main preoccupation must be in maintaining and expanding employment and that other <Col N="682" /> changes&mdash;even desirable and justifiable changes&mdash;should be subordinated to that end.</P>
    <P>It is true that what I have now said applies in a large measure mainly to the fully protected industries that are developed to the point at which they are quite capable of handling all the country's requirements, but there are other industries catering for the home market which have not yet developed to the stage at which they can handle the requirements of the home market and who report that they are experiencing much keener competition from imports.  The House is aware that a number of the pre-war duties were suspended during the war and have not yet been restored and where that keener competition from abroad is being experienced in these industries there is a movement in favour of the restoration of these pre-war duties or for increased protection in one form or another.</P>
    <P>There is an issue of policy there to which I think the House should give consideration.  We have had debates during the last few months about the effect of rising prices on social conditions here and about how desirable it would be if we could check the rise or get prices down again.  Even in the course of this debate, the Deputies who advocated this motion spoke not merely of rising unemployment but of the problem created by the high price level.  When the Government comes to consider these applications which it is getting from industries not protected at the moment for the restoration of pre-war duties on the ground that competition is now coming from abroad which they cannot meet even with maximum efficiency, then we have to take a decision between giving that protection and preserving the employment afforded by these industries or letting cheaper goods into the country. That is a decision we cannot avoid.  It is true that most countries can and will export goods cheaper than they can sell them in the home market. Any industry with a fairly large home market can carry the whole of its overheads on its home sales and sell abroad without loss, and even at a profit, at a lower price than at home&mdash;<Col N="683" /> and there is reappearing just now the bogey of Japanese competition.  We all remember the exceptional problems which were created for us here pre-war by the extraordinary prices at which some Japanese products arrived.  Not very many have come yet, but the indications are that at some stage, either this year or next year, that problem will arise again.  A decision which this Government or any Government will have to take is whether it is better to concentrate on our own industries and on giving employment in our own industries&mdash;taking all precautions to assure that they are efficiently equipped and managed&mdash;or to let them go and get the temporary benefit of an inflow of cheaper goods from abroad. The Government favours putting the emphasis on production and employment here.  We do that not merely in the interest of the workers, although that is a predominant consideration with us, but also because of the urgent need, as we see it, to redress the balance of payments position.</P>

      <P>When the Government puts emphasis on maintaining and expanding production and employment here and is prepared to forgo, in order to get that, whatever temporary benefit may be secured by a fall in prices by allowing in restricted imports, I do not want it to be taken that we are prepared to give support to inefficient management or inefficient equipment or to the support of labour costs which, whether due to shorter hours or less work or higher rates, are higher than in corresponding industries in Great Britain.  Deputies will understand that I am not making a general rule on that matter but if we have to make a decision in favour <Col N="684" /> of employment for these workers in these industries, as against lower prices for the kinds of goods they produce by permitting imports, we expect those workers also to cooperate in making that policy effective by restraining their demands upon the industry and endeavouring to ensure the minimising of labour costs&mdash;I am not dealing now with wage rates&mdash;the labour costs of production by their methods of work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin referred to the impact of the rising prices on the community generally, and particularly on the classes who benefit under the social welfare schemes.  Frankly, I do not see any prospect of a general fall in prices this year.  Certainly that statement is true as far as food prices are concerned.  The House is aware that there is some agitation amongst our farmers for higher prices for some food products, and even the present level of food prices does not help to sustain a level of agricultural wages comparable with those rates that urban industrial workers have established for themselves.  I do not think we should hold out to the urban <Col N="685" /> workers prospects of lower food prices if that means a situation in which even the present level of agricultural wages cannot be maintained.  I do not know if Deputies share my view.  If they see any way by which the producer can get higher prices and can pay higher wages, with lower prices to consumers, I shall be glad to hear of it.  There may be some minor adjustment of marketing costs possible here and there, but the predominant factor is the price paid to Irish farmers&mdash;and we do not intend to reduce it.  I do not think circumstances will arise this year or next year, or four or five years ahead, in which a fall in food prices, due to a reduction in prices paid to farmers, will come into effect.  In fact, I should not regard it as reasonable for urban workers enjoying the rates of wages they have established for themselves to urge upon the Dáil or the Government any policy which would make it less easy to sustain the present level of agricultural wages&mdash; or even to urge a policy which would prevent a possible increase in these wages in the course of time.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, possible to affect to some extent the cost of living by Government subsidies on food prices. We tried that policy in 1947.  We adopted it then in the belief that there was a temporary peak in prices, that we could carry the country over that peak, get back to the previous position in regard to prices and get rid of the subsidies.  That has not happened. The subsidies are now a very heavy burden on the Exchequer.  Yet, the net benefit of all that expenditure is to reduce the cost of living by 2/- per head per week.  If we were to double these subsidies, which would be impossible having regard to the financial position of the State, the resulting benefit would be comparatively small both in actual expenditure for each family and in relation to the cost-of-living index number.  It is my personal view that we are not getting benefit in relief of social hardship for the expenditure we are undertaking upon food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see if it is possible to get some means by which we can take that money and use it otherwise <Col N="686" /> so as to give relief where it is required and not be giving it indiscriminately, as it is at present, to substantial classes in the community which are not, because of their economic circumstances, entitled to relief out of community resources.  In any event, I cannot hold out the slightest prospect of a reduction in food prices through any extension of the subsidy system.</P>
    <P>I want to get on to the second leg of the motion.  The motion has three legs, one dealing with the general position in industry and the unemployment developing there, the second with public works, and the third with social welfare arrangements.  Reference was made to public works and that is a wide term.  I think the Deputies who moved the motion used it as applying only to expenditure upon roads, drainage projects and other works of that kind financed under the Local Authorities (Works) Act or under the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote. Using the term in its wider connotation as covering all works undertaken by public authorities and including expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, on hospitals and similar desirable purposes, I agree fully with the suggestion that we must face increasing expenditure under that head.  But I hope to see in the course of time emphasis coming off the less productive of these works and on to the more productive. Reference has been made to building. The Minister for Local Government tells me that he does not anticipate any diminution in house building by public authorities during the course of the year.  At any rate, in so far as Government administration affects the volume of output of local authority housing, there will be no diminution and I am sure that the local authorities will not create any situation which may cause it.  The position with regard to house building on private account may be affected by rising costs, but as yet there has been no evidence of a serious falling off.  The Minister for Local Government tells me that applications for grants are still very high and that it is likely this year that the allocations will exceed last year.  There is, of course, no certainly that those who <Col N="687" /> apply for grants will proceed to build, but in so far as the trend of the applications indicates the position, there has been no diminution, but quite the reverse.</P>
    <P>It is true, however, that building is extremely sensitive to economic conditions. Up to the present building costs have continued to rise.  There is no sign yet of any tendency for any building material to fall in price.  I think that it is unlikely there will be a fall in price.  All metal goods will probably continue to rise.  The timber situation&mdash;and there was quite a spectacular rise in the cost of timber over the last few months&mdash;is perhaps less certain.  I note that the British Government are taking rather drastic steps to try to remedy that situation as it affects them.  I could not, however, myself hold out any expectation that building costs are likely to go down.  Nevertheless, as I have said, building on private account, which the Government cannot influence, is sensitive to economic conditions, and we have had under consideration the possibility of there being some falling off either because the price has pushed building operations out of the reach of those who might otherwise undertake them, or because of the expectation that it might be better to postpone work against a possible price fall later.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past couple of weeks I met personally the group of building trade unions.  There have been consultations not merely with that group during the present week, but also with the Builders' Federation, consultations directly related to the question whether it was desirable to maintain in operation the present control over building operations by Government Order.  I may say that both parties to the industry are of opinion that the Order should be revoked.  Whether the Government will accept that view I cannot say, but the matter will come up for consideration soon.  It is likely that the view which the industry has itself expressed will influence the Government's decision also.</P>

      <P>That was not quite the situation.  That particular Order will come before the Dáil in due course and I will give the Deputy the explanation then.  So far as public works are concerned, there has been no reduction in the amount of money made available for the construction of roads and bridges.  On the contrary, the total expenditure on this form of public works this year will be £5,300,000 as against £4,800,000 in 1950-51.  But a qualification must be expressed there. This is again a point which I would like Deputies to note and particularly the Labour Party.  During the period between August, 1950, and August, 1951, there was an average increase of 16 per cent. in the wages paid to road workers and the result, therefore, is that, although the amount of money provided for expenditure on roads and bridges was higher than the previous year, the actual amount of employment given was less.  The effect of the increased provision was offset and more than offset in fact by these higher wage rates.</P>
      <P>I am not entering into any discussion about wage rates or questioning the necessity for these increases. Everybody knows that these workers are not amongst the highest paid in the country.  It is necessary, however, to keep in mind always that any expansion of cost of that kind, however justifiable it may be, is in our circumstances likely to lead to a diminution in our total volume of employment. That is demonstrably true in the case of industry.  We have learned that lesson the hard way in the past three or four months in some industries.  It is also true in every occupation in which people are employed.  We can keep on pushing up costs to a point at which the &ldquo;pay-off&rdquo; is unemployment. The cure for inflation is high prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a controversy on this matter.  I want Deputies to understand the facts. Of the total amount made available this year for works on roads and bridges, the amount retained for expenditure in the second half of the year was also substantially higher than in the previous year.  It was, in fact, £312,000 higher.</P>
      <P>Now, Deputy Larkin said that some county councils may have spent money with more speed than wisdom.  The information available to me would suggest that that may have happened in some cases, but in 13 out of 26 counties the amount available for expenditure at this period was higher than in the previous year.  In the other 13 counties it was less.  But, having regard to the over-all position, whatever circumstances may arise in the counties which have spent their money more rapidly than the others, a significant drop in employment on road works is not to be anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure on the Local Authorities (Works) Schemes was somewhat different.  The Estimate passed this year provided for a reduction of £500,000.  Now, the reason, I understand, why that reduction was accepted was the belief that work on turf production would be more readily available, and that the operations under the Works Act could, without any hardship in the form of increased unemployment, be held over until later in the year when turf production activities had ceased.  That policy was, in fact, followed in some counties, while in others the money which was provided under the Works Act was exhausted earlier, or is nearly exhausted now.  Because of that situation, in the period existing between this and the resumption of work on turf production and on agricultural work, it may be that in some rural areas there will be unemployment which could not now be affected by any alteration of the arrangements made for the expenditure of the public <Col N="690" /> funds still available.  The number of people employed, however, in mid-January on schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was 6,069, so that it is, I think, wrong to convey the impression that there has been a complete falling off in activities because of the curtailment of the Vote in the present year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably have, but the Deputy, I think, can take it that the total employment this year was a little less.  The money provided was £500,000 less.  May I point out also that the figures I have given of the money available for expenditure on roads and bridges, or for other schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, do not represent the total funds that are available for rural employment.  Account must also be taken of the expenditure on the special employment schemes by the Department of Agriculture, the Land Commission, the Board of Works and Bord na Móna.  So far as employment under employment and emergency schemes is concerned, I note that the provision this year under every head is higher than last year&mdash;for urban employment schemes, rural employment schemes, minor employment schemes, bog development works, rural improvement schemes and development works on bogs acquired by local authorities. The number of people employed&mdash;the latest date I have is the 29th December&mdash;on these employment and emergency schemes was 3,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take up too much of the time available to the Dáil on this motion.  There is one proposal in the motion that I want to refer to, the one that relates to the provision of an increase in unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance payments.  If that had been the only provision in the motion, I would have urged Deputies not to press for time to discuss it now, because they are aware that proposals for legislation, bearing on social welfare arrangements, will be before the Dáil in the matter of a couple of weeks, and will be the main subject for <Col N="691" /> debate during the present session.  I think that Deputies, realising that, will not press the suggestion that there should be any interim arrangements made in regard to that service.  No change in the rates payable in respect of unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance could be made except by legislation.  That is the occasion on which Deputies can express their views as to the adequacy or otherwise of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>As regards our attitude to the motion, we had some trouble with it. Any multi-barrelled motion always causes some trouble because one's attitude to any one part of it may be different to other parts.  We do not feel that we could take exception to it. We agree that, in industry, there is a situation developing to which the Government must give serious attention. I discussed that situation, and I have told the House that we are giving it serious attention.  I am urging that equally serious attention must be given to it by those who are more directly able to influence the position, namely, industrial managements and trade unions.  I have indicated that, so far as public works are concerned, we accept the idea that conditions in this country require increased expenditure on public works, though I have emphasised that it will be our aim to try and put the emphasis on the more productive kind of work in the future.</P>
    <P>So far as the social welfare arrangements are concerned, we are going to bring proposals to the Dáil in the course of a few days.  If there are certain implications in the motion that we may not like, we do not mind if it is adopted by the Dáil.  I have stated the Government's position here.  I do not think that I have left any room for any misunderstanding about it.  I would not like to see the motion rejected by the Dáil because I think it would lead to a misunderstanding amongst unemployed workers as to the attitude of the nation's Parliament to their situation.  Therefore, if a choice has to be made between accepting the motion and rejecting it, we would sooner see it accepted and put on the <Col N="692" /> records of the Dáil.  That is the attitude of this Party to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the attitude of the Tánaiste in dealing with this motion.  I confess that I find it hard to realise that the Tánaiste is a Minister in the same Government as his colleague, the Minister for Finance, or as his other colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, who spoke in this House yesterday evening in regard to the question of credit.  However, be that as it may, I may have some suspicions or ideas as to what may have caused this reasonable attitude, but no matter what the cause of it is, I think it is a good thing that we should be in a position to discuss this motion and this question away from a Party atmosphere. So far as I am concerned, I propose to pursue the line taken by the Tánaiste and by the members of the Opposition in discussing the motion so far.  I hope that we will be able to maintain that level of debate in the House.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made one statement which, I think, is absolutely correct in regard to the general position.  He stated that it is inevitable that any factor inducing people to buy less is bound to cause unemployment.  I think that is a very correct analysis of the present position.  I disagree, however, very fundamentally with the Tánaiste when he says that the restriction of credit has not affected the position. Obviously, the restriction of credit is the one important factor inducing people to buy less and, in his own words, is therefore the cause of unemployment.  The Tánaiste, I think, is too much of a realist to expect that anyone will seriously believe that the banks have not been restricting credit in the course of the last six months. Everybody in the country is aware of it, and the signs of it are only too evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By &ldquo;restricting credit&rdquo; does the Deputy mean cutting down or refusing to allow it to expand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Not giving credit.  I would say that in a number of cases they are also calling in overdrafts, or <Col N="693" /> asking people to reduce their overdrafts, but they are certainly not making credit facilities available as freely as they were more than six months ago.  Indeed, one has only to read the speeches made by the chairmen of the various boards of directors of the banking companies to get proof of that.  They have all, one after the other, practically in a parrot-like fashion, adopted the pronouncement of the governor and directors of the Central Bank, declaring that credit for projects, however desirable they might be, which did not yield immediate benefits, should be postponed to a later date.  That has been the invariable declaration of the chairmen of the different banking organisations here, and it is practically identical in terms with the declarations of the Central Bank in its last annual report, and indeed with some of the declarations made by the Minister for Finance in this House and outside.</P>
      <P>Obviously, these injunctions by the governors and chairmen of the different banking organisations in the country in regard to the expansion of credit were made with a view to inducing a restriction of credit, and that, in my view, is the fundamental cause of the very steep rise in unemployment which has taken place.  As Deputy Norton pointed out, we have had a rise of over 10,000 in the number of unemployed, which only very partially reflects the position, because, as the Taoiseach pointed out in this House a couple of months ago, unemployment figures are always masked by emigration.  We have had increased emigration, an increase in the number of permits issued to persons seeking employment abroad, in the course of the past five months of between 60 and 65 per cent.  These conditions are due practically entirely to the restriction of credit, but indeed that is the policy which the Central Bank advocated.  They wanted restriction of credit.  They advocated the cutting down of public works in order to remedy what they referred to as the unusually favourable condition of employment in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government has it within its power to remedy this position very quickly by a clear-cut indication that <Col N="694" /> it does not favour this restriction of credit, that, on the contrary, it is Government policy that credit should be extended in present circumstances to enable development works to go ahead, and particularly to enable employers to maintain employment, even if it means extending credit for a prolonged period.  If that were done, I think that, in many cases, employers might be induced to maintain employment and to build up and stockpile some of their own goods, provided they felt that they had Government support in doing so.  But when employers and the banks receive clear-cut intimations from the Government or from the Central Bank, which is, in effect, the mouthpiece of the Government, that it does not desire to extend credit, that, on the contrary, it is desired to create an unemployment pool&mdash;because that is their philosophy and they have practically said so in so many words&mdash;it is very difficult to expect employers to seek credits to maintain employment. It is likewise very difficult to expect the banks to extend credit to their customers when they know that it is contrary to the Government's policy or to the policy of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In that respect, let us be frank&mdash;I am sure the Tánaiste will not mind; he has been very frank with the House and I certainly appreciate his attitude in dealing with this motion&mdash;about this whole position of credit.  We know that there has not been a written order sent by the Government to the banks asking them to restrict credit, but we do know that the Secretary of the Department of Finance is a director of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>We know that he is in touch with the directors of the commercial banks; we know that they have conferences and discussions; we know that the Governor of the Central Bank is in constant touch with the Secretary of the Department of Finance and with the banks; and we know that from day to day advices are passed to the commercial banks in the country.  It would be an easy matter for the Government to remedy the credit position, if they desire to do so.  They, in effect, control the Central Bank and they have it within their power to <Col N="695" /> control the contraction or expansion of credit.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this question, might I say that it looks very much as if, in effect, practically all the recommendations of the Central Bank are being implemented one by one?  They advocated a restriction of credit and that has taken place.  They advocated the creation of an unemployment pool and that has taken place.  They may well congratulate themselves when they next meet in the boardroom in Foster Place in that we have 10,000 more people unemployed and that 65 per cent. more people have emigrated.  That was their policy and now they have got the results.  They have also advocated the cutting down or the complete abolition of subsidies. I was interested to see several Ministers making speeches about subsidies recently and pointing out that subsidies were introduced only as an emergency measure in an emergency period and were never intended to be permanent.  The Tánaiste this evening also dealt with subsidies.  Is the Government preparing the ground for doing away with subsidies?  Is the Government preparing the ground for doing away with subsidies for the same reasons as those which the Central Bank gave in its report?  Bear in mind that the reason the Central Bank advanced for doing away with subsidies was that the people would be able to consume less.</P>
    <P>They would have less money to buy goods and they would have to consume less.  In other words, they must consume less bread, less butter, less tea and less sugar.  They advanced these reasons in so many words in their report.  The Tánaiste will realise that, in the light of the declarations which have been made recently by members of the Government in relation to subsidies, taken in conjunction with the advice of the Central Bank, one is inclined to be a little bit suspicious with regard to the Government's intentions regarding subsidies. I know quite well that a case can be made against subsidies, a good case, but there is this consideration.  I mention it now because I think the <Col N="696" /> Tánaiste will appreciate it and, I feel, would use his weight in the Government to prevent any step in that direction. Subsidies have this advantage over any other form of help to the community, that they are given in those parts of the economy where they are most needed; in other words, they benefit particularly the woman of the house who has to do the shopping and who has to get the essentials; they benefit particularly large families; they benefit particularly the lower income groups and to that extent they are probably more effective for alleviating low economic conditions than any social service as such.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I would like to urge on the Tánaiste this view, that one or two principal steps should be taken in the present situation. First of all, credit should be made available to employers in order to sustain employment, at low rates of interest for long periods, if necessary with Government assistance, in order to sustain employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Tánaiste <Col N="697" /> is sufficiently realistic to realise that the expansion in the volume of money and the increase in prices that have taken place in effect has reduced the existing amount of credit <i>pro tanto.</i> The greater the amount of national income in terms of money and the more money in circulation, the smaller the terms of credit, unless the terms of credit are correspondingly increased. The turnover is greater.  Take a rough example.  If it cost a trader £500 12 months ago to buy <i>x</i> quantity of goods, it costs him £750 to buy <i>x</i> quantity of goods to-day, and therefore he requires £250 more credit in order to buy those goods; therefore, a proportionate expansion of credit is required to balance the fall in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy work out the figure?  It is not much below it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statistics Office will work it out.  It is purely relative to the value of money at any given period, particularly in terms of import prices, as it is import prices&mdash;I agree with the Tánaiste there&mdash;that have been largely responsible for the steep increases in prices.  That makes it all the more necessary to expand credit proportionately in order to meet the increased prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second step I would urge is the extension of public works immediately, in order to absorb the rapidly increasing number of unemployed in the building and other trades.  One particular sphere in which public works could be extended&mdash;and extended fairly rapidly if it were not for a certain amount of administrative difficulty&mdash;and which would absorb a considerable proportion of the rural unemployed, particularly in areas west of the Shannon, is the rapid expansion of forestry, which is a sound investment.  I am not saying this in any Party sense, but the Tánaiste will probably agree with me as to the vital necessity for increasing afforestation in the country.  For some extraordinary reason, the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands always seems to place obstacles to the rapid expansion of forestry, yet it is one of the public works which has the <Col N="698" /> greatest amount of labour content in proportion to the expenditure on it.</P>
    <P>Many other points could be made in the course of this discussion but, having regard to the attitude of the Tánaiste, I do not propose to make any further comment on them.</P>

In case there be any doubt in the minds of any Deputies, I would like to say that, regardless of the goodwill that may be generated within this Chamber by this discussion, the Government of the day must take responsibility for whatever unemployment which exists&mdash;whatever &ldquo;day&rdquo; it may be, whether it be yesterday, to-day or to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to mention that I have been here since this debate began.  This debate has taken a very peculiar and unusual turn in this House where acrimony and political spleen have been part and parcel of this Assembly for many years.  In this debate we have got completely outside of politics and that, to my mind, is something of a mistake for it does, to some extent, give to the Government in power an escape from their responsibility in this matter of unemployment. Whatever the composition of the Government may be, whether it be the Government of to-day, yesterday or to-morrow, it must accept responsibility for the economic condition of the country.  Otherwise why should it seek power; otherwise why should it administer or pretend to administer the affairs of the State.</P>
      <P>We have here at the present time in the Republic of Ireland, a condition of unemployment the likes of which has not existed since before the war. Within a year unemployment figures have jumped by 10,000.  I know that to many Deputies, perhaps, in the Government Benches it does not seem to be of very grave significance that that should be so, particularly when they look back and recall that in other years, before the emergency began, unemployment was part and parcel of the economic set up in this country and it was regarded as the most natural thing that should be or could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> The war years brought about a change because those whom we could not keep here and force to live on starvation wages, whether it was on the farms or on the bogs, we shipped off to England where they got danger money under the German bombs and sent some of it home and managed to keep their relatives going in that way.</P>
    <P>Now that all that false prosperity of the war years has gone we find ourselves, after three years of inter-Party Government, during which period, whether you agree with it or not, there was the nearest approach to full employment that ever has been in the country, with 10,000 unemployed more than we had 12 months ago.  Make no mistake about it.  Unemployment is the most grievous thing that can happen to a family.  It brings with it more ills and hardships.  It is responsible for the breaking up of more homes than any other force in this country to-day, or in any other country.  It has been described variously as an ulcer, as a running sore, and in other terms.  Nobody could coin a word sufficient to describe the misery and degradation that unemployment brings in its train, and here we have 74,000 of our people signing at the labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there is the small town of Balbriggan, a town very much the same as many others in other constituencies in Ireland.  In Balbriggan 248 people signed this morning at the labour exchange.  Behind those 248 people there are innumerable members of families going through want and privation because they cannot get a job.  I recall about 12 or 18 months ago, when there might have been a slight fluctuation in unemployment figures, the then Opposition, which is now the Government, seized on every opportunity they could get to pin the responsibility for that situation, if there were a slight increase, upon the Government of the day, and rightly so, because unemployment in those days, such as did exist, was the responsibility of the Government, and it is the responsibility of this Government at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is going to be done about it.  I would like to <Col N="702" /> know what answer I can give to my constituents in County Dublin when they ask me what this Government intends to do to put them back to work.  What answer can you give a man who has tramped every building job in and about the City and County of Dublin trying to get sale for his skill, trying to get a job in order to keep his family in some sort of existence; when he has tramped every highway and byway trying to get a job and cannot get one, and he tells you: &ldquo;My only recourse is to go to Dublin Castle, get a travel permit and go across to England?&rdquo;  Five hundred carpenters are unemployed in the City of Dublin, 500 skilled men, and each of them is faced with that prospect of getting out because no word has been spoken here by the Tánaiste which will give them immediate relief or any prospect of relief in the months to come.</P>
    <P>This question of unemployment is not one that should or could be put on the long finger.  It is one that must be tackled immediately.  The terms of the motion, as I understand it, were to ask the Government what they were going to do now for the unemployed. I had the unfortunate and unhappy experience within the last ten days of having to attend a meeting of a county council in the Midlands, where a deputation of 80 rural workers accompanied me to that council asking that they and the people they represented, some 700 workers in the County of Meath, should be given employment as they had been for the last three years, not upon a princely wage, but upon the barest minimum of a living wage. The answer we got was that the county council could not provide funds out of the rates and that the Minister for Local Government would not receive a deputation from the county council to discuss a grant for the relief of unemployment or additional expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here that this is a matter which should not be related to politics.  Every representative, or practically every representative of the present Government, who sat on that council and who listened to the case made on behalf of the men in a nonpolitical <Col N="703" /> fashion, endeavoured to twist that case to political advantage.  As the cards are placed, so must the game be played.  As I said at the outset, I believe it to be the duty of a Government to put men to work, and not the duty of a Government to come into power and simply hold office for the sake of power, Ministries and Parliamentary Secretaryships.  That does not mean anything except to the individuals concerned, but how are the ordinary masses of the people living? 70,000 odd of them are living pretty badly to-day under the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    <P>This motion has also suggested that the rates of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance should be increased.  The Tánaiste, in the course of his remarks, said that there was on the stocks a Social Welfare Bill which would be discussed within the next few months, which would form the basis of discussion for this session of the Dáil and as a result of which a solution would be found to the problem of the present inadequate allowances paid to those drawing unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  We have 74,000 unemployed in this country at the moment and this number will probably double itself if the present policy of the Government is continued within the next six or eight months.</P>
    <P>Have these people got to sit down and wait until Dáil Éireann, in its leisurely fashion, discusses a complicated measure of social security before they can get a few more shillings to help them to live?  A single unemployed man in rural areas draws 9/- a week unemployment assistance.  Fancy a contribution of 9/- a week from this magnanimous State.  The highest amount of unemployment assistance drawn on the average by a married man with a family is 23/- a week. Does anybody consider for a moment that these sums represent anything more than an insult to the intelligence, not only of the people who are badly hit and suffering economic distress, but an insult to the intelligence of the entire nation and a crime committed in the name of the nation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> I would have preferred to hear the Tánaiste say: &ldquo;We are going to do something now.  We are going to increase unemployment benefit now and we are going to increase the rates of unemployment assistance.&rdquo;  However, nothing like that was said.  There was vague talk of public works and a vague comment on rising prices, but what hope goes out from this discussion to the people who are suffering? What hope will the unemployed worker in Balbriggan, Swords, Lucan and Clondalkin and in the City of Dublin get to-morrow when he reads the report of this discussion in the daily papers?  Will they be any better off?  I do not believe they will because, although the Tánaiste expressed his willingness to accept the motion, nothing concrete has been stated as to what is going to be done.  Immediate steps should be taken in the counties where unemployment is worst. It is not only wrong, but it is false and misleading to suggest that unemployment is not abundant throughout rural districts.  In a small village in County Limerick, where I happened to be last Sunday, of the 80 men congregated in a hall, 50 were going to England because they could not get a job here.  They had been employed up to recent months by the county council. Situations such as this are developing throughout the country and the Deputies who represent Dublin constituents can recount the position within the city boundary where there is a depression in industry together with the restriction of credit which has been touched on by various speakers.</P>
    <P>Immediate steps should be taken to initiate public works in every county where there is inordinate unemployment. In the county which Deputy Cogan represents, and particularly close to the area where Deputy Cogan lives, unemployment abounds.  Rural workers who were formerly engaged on county council works are now out of work in their hundreds.  The same situation exists in County Carlow.  As I have already stated, this is a situation which ought not to be left hanging for six or eight months while Dáil Éireann pursues its leisurely course. <Col N="705" /> Immediate steps should be taken to place funds at the disposal of local authorities with a view to relieving the unemployment situation.  The Tánaiste in his statement gave no indication that such steps were about to be taken. Simultaneously with the development of unemployment in the small towns which I have recounted, the price of milk has been increasing.  I wonder how much milk a man with six children living in a small town in rural Ireland could afford to buy on his 23/- unemployment assistance?</P>

      <P>Yes, at 5½d. a pint.  I wonder how much food such a man could buy, how well he could dress himself, and could he pay the fancy rents which many local authorities are now asking of working-class people throughout the country in an endeavour to maintain as low a rate as they can in the different counties?  That had better be left to the imagination than described, but it certainly does reflect the total and absolute bankruptcy that the policy of the present Administration has brought about, that this trend has not only been allowed to develop but allowed to continue developing. It cuts me to think that there is an idea amongst the Fianna Fáil Party which conceives it to be a normal condition of affairs that there should be thousands of unemployed people.  I believe that some individuals amongst politicians take the view that there cannot be a healthy economy unless there are large numbers of unemployed. Such a view and such an attitude is criminal and something which must be eradicated from the minds of any representatives of politicians in this country who may hold it.  We are no longer living in the years when large masses of the people can be unemployed without a clamour from them and without a voice being raised on their behalf or anything done for them. We are living now in an era when the working-class people, whether they be rural or urban dwellers, take a far deeper and more intelligent interest even in politics, and apply far more intelligent tests and standards even to politics than they did in other distant years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Those who are responsible for having them in the condition they are in, those who are responsible for having the unemployed workers of the Republic living in near destitution, thrown out of their jobs and nothing being done about them, I hope they will give those workers an early opportunity of expressing their views at the polls as to the competency or otherwise of their administration.  The issue referred to in this motion is of vital importance to the whole nation. I must at least emphasise my disappointment at the statement of the Tánaiste, my disappointment that nothing will be done to relieve these miserable thousands of people.  There is no hope for them but wait and see. All they can do is to get their passports and go to England.  That, I suppose, is only to be expected from Fianna Fáil but one would have thought they had learned something from their period in the wilderness. It appears that they did not.  I think the wilderness yawns again for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton proposed this motion to-night and Deputy Larkin followed.  Both realised that there was a serious situation to be faced.  Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste, who followed, agreed that there was a serious situation.  He agreed that the motion up to then had been debated in a sound, constructive way and announced his ideas as to how that serious situation should be faced.  If we had proceeded on those lines, we might have been more successful in our approach to these serious problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that unemployment is growing.  Any person who gets the official statistics and studies them must notice a gradual increase in unemployment over a period of months. Now the unemployment figure is over 70,000.  That is a serious situation that must be faced by this Parliament, this Government and by every responsible representative of the people.  What is <Col N="708" /> the cause of that increase in unemployment? Part is due, as has been frankly admitted here to-night, to factors difficult to control, but there are factors, I believe, within our control that should help to lessen the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy General Mulcahy and Deputy Dunne referred here to-night to the mounting emigration figures.  I have not been able to get the correct data but I think it is within the knowledge of Deputies that many people are returning from England now because of unemployment there, particularly in the Midlands.  Any person who has to have his children working in England realises that there is an unemployment problem in the Midlands of England due to a shortage of steel and other matters.  There are many people returning to this country who are now on the unemployment exchanges.  I do not say it is a considerable number. I do not, for one moment, say that it is a considerable number, but there are registering in our exchanges to-day men who have returned from Britain.</P>

This curtailment of bank credit is not of recent origin.  In the inter-Party Government time on numerous occasions when we had complaints about the curtailment of bank credit I had to ask Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, whether the Government&mdash;whether we&mdash;had given any instructions to the banks and he emphatically denied it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot speak in this House without this inter-Party leader, Deputy Davin, interrupting. There has been a serious restriction of bank credit, not due to any instructions given by the Government, but to instructions given to the banks by the people who control them, and they are not the Government or the people of this country.  Clearly, the instructions have been given to the banks by the Bank of England and the people whom the Bank of England represents.</P>

      <P>I want to make that perfectly clear.  The position is that the banks we have in this country are not national banks under the control or even under the influence of the Government of this country.  They are independent saboteurs working in the interests of a foreign State, and I think that every person who studies this matter will find that that is so.  It is all very well to talk about unemployment; it is all very well to talk about emigration, but if the banks of this country cannot be influenced by the Government of this country then nothing very much can be done about either unemployment or emigration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we had a golden opportunity at the time of the bank strike, when the banks shut down, when they would not have any discussions with their staffs and upset the whole business of the community&mdash;not to nationalise all the banks, because I have not reached that decision yet&mdash;but to establish one State bank, for if one State bank had been started at that time we would not be in the difficulty we are in to-day with regard to the restriction of bank credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to statistics, but if he were in the position we are in every day, when we have to act for clients and go to the banks to get credit for them or an advance, he would find that when you go to the bank manager he says very bluntly: &ldquo;You know the position, you know our orders; we cannot give credit.&rdquo; That is the story which is told day after day in the offices of bank managers. Anyone who in face of that says that there is no restriction of bank credit is just not in touch with the realities facing business persons.  Take a person with a small business who had an overdraft of £5,000 or £10,000; the bank comes along and says that they are reducing by so much his overdraft.  What effect has that?  It means that one, two or three employees of that firm are laid off and two or three more are unemployed. That has been happening all over the country.  Totalling all those things, you will find a very considerable number of people unemployed who had worked in very small private businesses.  That is due to the operation <Col N="712" /> of the banks with regard to credit of that particular kind and that is entirely different from the restriction of credit in so far as new industries, the extension of industries or, in fact, the maintenance of industries are concerned.</P>
    <P>On this debate I do not want to go into the question which has been referred to as the repatriation of foreign assets because I do not think the question vital to this debate or this subject, but I do agree that it is necessary to give our own Central Bank power&mdash;it has no power at the moment&mdash;to control credit in the national interest.  I have often stated that before in this House and I do not want to elaborate on it this evening, but my view is that while the Central Bank operates under the restricted powers given to it by statute it cannot help in the creation of facilities for employment or for national reconstruction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy mentioned the building industry and referred to one aspect of it, the Dublin Corporation finances, and I stated very definitely as a member of Dublin Corporation that finance was no obstacle to them.  That is the position as I understand it.  We have run into serious trouble in connection with our building programme in Dublin. Our building programme is down 400 houses this year so far.  That is alarming and it is the subject of a very special meeting that has been arranged to be held in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given for that reduction, which I should like examined and which we have not been able to examine fully as yet is that that was due to a cement strike last year.  That is one of the reasons that has been given to us by the officials for this reduction of 400 houses in our building programme in Dublin.  It is not finance.  I want to make that clear.  All the finance that we have needed to carry on up to the present in Dublin has been made available and we have no reason to believe that the additional £5,000,000 that we are now seeking will not be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Deputy make certain that there are not on the files of the corporation&mdash; not necessarily files within the Deputy's <Col N="713" /> control or that he knows about&mdash;letters recently in regard to the restriction of credit for housing.  The Deputy might inquire into that when he is dealing with the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with this whole housing situation in Dublin at a special meeting, but our position is that, while there has been a reduction in building, it is not due to finance.  That is, up to the present, it is not due to finance.  In the arrangements we are making for an additional £5,000,000 to continue the building programme we have not been advised that there is any difficulty in the matter of the provision of that £5,000,000.  I think everyone will agree that it is a desirable position.  It was only to clear up that point that I said to Deputy General Mulcahy this evening, when he was speaking, that we had no reason to believe that the money we require for our building programme would not be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>There are some persons unemployed due to the hotel strike in Dublin.  I do not mean people who are directly locked out, but indirectly because the hotels are not operating there is some unemployment.  That, again, is a matter that is within our own control. We can help to put an end to the present lock-out in certain hotels in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I agree with what was said here to-night about stockpiling.  Stock was brought in.  People were encouraged to buy stock.  It was considered the right thing to do.  At that time everyone was talking about a world war.  I did express the view in the House at the time that there was no danger of a war.  I was laughed at.</P>

That was their idea.  They believed there would be a war.  If a war did come and they had all these valuable stock of consumer goods they would certainly do well.  The war did not come.  They were burdened with these stocks.  They have endeavoured to get rid of them. They have to lose money in the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, in a broad, general way.  I do not want to get into a discussion on inflation.  I do believe that, while houses are being built, while constructive works are being done, while afforestation, that was mentioned to-night, is being developed, while all that work is going on, whatever amount of money is paid to the people who do that work, it will not lead to inflation.  I think that is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a particular problem in this country, the problem of agriculture, and, unless we can employ more people on the land, we cannot wipe out the roll of unemployed that has existed for a long period.  There is a pool of unemployed of 40,000 or so.  I think it will be agreed that in that 40,000 there is probably a very big number who are unemployable, who ought to be removed from the unemployed register so that there would be a true reflection of the number of people who are actually able to work and who are unemployed. We know that at every employment exchange there are men registering for employment who are not able to work.  They are physically <Col N="715" /> unable to work even if they get employment.</P>
    <P>The development of industry can ease the unemployment problem but, in my view, there must be more employment on the land.  There is no way in which you can have more employment on the land now except by compulsory tillage.  When I say compulsory tillage, I want to be understood fairly.  I do not mean that you are just going to have compulsory tillage all over the country in the way we had it a few years ago.  There are certain areas, say, the dairying areas, which should be exempt from compulsory tillage.  There are certain places where there are small farms that should be exempt because, in any case, they do their proportion of tillage. There are tracts of a county, and counties&mdash;Deputy Giles knows it; the County Meath&mdash;where you will not have agriculture unless it is compulsory.</P>

They have said to me that there is only one hope for them and that is compulsory tillage.</P>

      <P>I am not provoking them.  I am just stating what appears important to me.  When a motion of this kind is before the House, it is our duty to say what is important in trying to solve a particular problem with which it deals.  I have only to say in conclusion that the debate, although it has been short, has probably shown the House in its most constructive form and if all Parties in the House&mdash;the Government, the Opposition and the Independent Parties who are not part of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said the Independent Parties.  The Labour Party is not part of the Opposition.  It does not recognise the Opposition; it is at Independent Party.  I hope Deputy Davin will not contest that.  If all of us would do everything we could to solve the problem then I think we would be successful.  I am glad to say that all the speakers to-night did realise there is a serious problem and that that problem although it is difficult to solve, can be tackled with determination, if we are all agreed on the measures to be adopted to ease it.  I sincerely hope that the Government, assisted by <Col N="717" /> everybody in the House, will take the practical steps that are necessary to reduce this growing volume of unemployment. If we can stop the growth of unemployment at the moment, then I think we can take effective steps to reduce the number of unemployed and that will in turn affect the other issue that has been mentioned, emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House.  In view of the Government's attitude to the motion it is not necessary to take up much of the time of the House.  I do wish to place on record, however, my belief that it is the duty of any modern democratic Government, having conserved the essential liberties of the people to see that full employment is secured for its citizens.  I believe it is the duty of a Government in every democratic country to endeavour to achieve that desirable end.  I think the present Government, inasmuch as unemployment has increased during its régime, has failed in one of its primary duties towards its citizens.  Modern economic thought has brought to light a number of methods by which unemployment can be tackled effectively.</P>
      <P>I think one basis on which this problem can be tackled is by increasing the effective demand for labour, so that the resources of the State are fully developed as a result of the increased spending power placed in the hands of the public.  That can be achieved, when private individuals fail to create that effective demand, by Government budgetary policy.  It can be done indirectly by means of tax concessions in the taxation framework and it can be done directly by means of public works schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see, and I think it is necessary to see, increased Government expenditure on capital account. One of the most serious and genuine grounds of criticism of the present Government policy is that the capital investment programme is being curtailed. <Col N="718" /> I hope it will not; I hope it will be increased.  In the field of public works the Government has a very effective method of helping to reduce the unemployment problem. The benefits which accrued from the capital investment programme were evident in the figures for unemployment. The fact that unemployment had so startlingly decreased in the few years prior to the present Government coming into office was not due to mere fortuitous circumstances.  I think it was clearly due to the financial and economic policies operated by the last Government.  In 1938 the proportion of workers unemployed in industries, excluding agriculture, was 15 per cent. and in 1950 it had been reduced to 7.5 per cent.  Between 1949 and 1950 employment went up by 7 per cent.  That, as I say, was the result of the Government of the day shouldering its responsibilities to the unemployed of the country.</P>
    <P>It has frequently been pointed out, and it is now a truism, that we export part of our unemployment difficulties in the form of emigrants.  If there was not this large volume of emigration, which recent figures reveal is increasing, our unemployment problem would be still more formidable than it is at present.  Until we can see emigration being reduced to manageable proportions and unemployment figures brought down to a much lower level than at present, we cannot say that the Government of the day has succeeded in fulfilling one of its primary functions.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficient for the Government merely to accept the motion.  It is not sufficient for them piously to wish for increased employment. They must take the steps necessary to bring about that increased employment.  The Minister for Finance is, presumably, in the throes of framing his Budget.  At any rate, he has an idea of the manner in which that Budget will be framed, and I think it must be placed on record that the increased taxation which is threatened, or which is implicit, at any rate, in Government speeches, will have a deflationary effect and will tend to perpetuate the conditions under which <Col N="719" /> we are suffering at the present time, namely, deflationary conditions.  If the Government are sincere in their acceptance of this motion, they will take the steps which have been advocated here time and again, namely, to produce a tax framework in which the maximum possible incentive is given to private investment on the capital side of the Budget to increase capital expenditure, and at the same time to produce the resources necessary for this increased capital expenditure by a largely increased savings drive.  I believe it is the view of the Government that the resources to be made available for capital investment in this country ought to come out of increased taxation.  I believe that is a deflationary method of financing a capital investment programme which should be availed of only in very restricted and difficult conditions.  These conditions do not exist at the present time. If the Government are sincere in their acceptance of this motion and in their desire to reduce the amount of unemployment that exists at present they will not adopt the policies which have now come to be associated with the names of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Government must be regarded as having failed because the unemployment figures have reached the proportion which they have reached to-day.  It is not enough for the Government to wish for a happier set of circumstances.  They must, by deliberate policy, bring about a happier set of circumstances.  They cannot shuffle off that responsibility by blaming the present unsatisfactory conditions on external forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a lot to reply to in this debate because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated that the Government are prepared to accept the motion.  But let it be perfectly clear what the motion asks, so that the Minister will know what he is accepting.  Portion of this motion asks &ldquo;that the Government should increase the existing rates of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance benefit pending <Col N="720" /> the passing of legislation to provide for improved social security&rdquo;.  If the Minister is accepting this motion, as he said he was, let it be quite clear that he is committing himself to the acceptance of an obligation on the part of the Government to increase these rates of benefit.  It is no answer to this motion to say that the Government intends to introduce shortly a comprehensive Social Security Bill. The Government has had a ready-made Bill at its disposal for the past eight months.  The Minister for Social Welfare said in this House in August last that he hoped that that Bill would be introduced and passed through the Dáil by Christmas.  It is now February in the new year and we have not yet seen the Bill&mdash;even though the Minister had a ready-made Bill at his disposal which passed its Second Reading in this House in March of last year.  Therefore it is no answer to the motion to say that this Bill which the Minister may at some future date produce will provide for increased rates of benefit.  This motion asks that the increased rates of benefit should be provided in advance of the Bill.  It does that for the simple reason that anybody who has any experience of the Bill and of the administrative machine that will be necessary to implement it, plus any knowledge of the time which it will take to pass that Bill through this House and the Seanad at a time of the year when financial business is pressing, must realise that it will probably be the end of the year before there is any increase in unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance rates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has spoken of what was not done for the unemployed in the past.  If Emerson was correct when he said that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, then Deputy Cowan must have the most mountainous mind in the country because consistency is not one of his characteristics. All the observations which he made this evening completely contradict the observations which he made in this House in March of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's interpretation of Deputy Cowan.  In March last Deputy Cowan was challenging the then Government to go to the country on the comprehensive social security scheme.  With his elastic political conscience he now considers himself a kind of official white-washer for the Fianna Fáil Government.  I do not covet him that position at all. Deputy Cowan has shown talents for it. He has shown them in the past few months.  However, he will not run consistently.  Any time the boat rocks, that gentleman will be looking for a life-belt.  I commend him, therefore, to the Fianna Fáil Party on the condition that they understand that characteristic of his.  The Deputy has quite a considerable acquaintance with political Parties and he holds a record for not staying very long in any of them.</P>
      <P>Under the comprehensive Social Security Bill that was introduced and that passed its Second Reading in this House in March of last year, it was proposed that the rate of unemployment insurance benefit would be raised from 35/- per week, in the case of a man with a wife and two children, to 50/- per week.  If that Bill had gone through, a family unit consisting of a man, his wife and two children would now be entitled to receive 50/- per week unemployment insurance.  While I was Minister I remember that at either the last or the second last conference with the officials of the Department of Social Welfare I told them that I wanted the administrative machine ready to pay these new rates of benefit as from the 1st January of 1952.  When they pleaded that I was rushing them and pressing them and that they did not think they could do it, they offered, by way of the best they could do, that the scheme would be put into operation at the end of March or at the beginning of April of this year.  I never accepted that as an excuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pressed them to do it, and to do it by the 1st January, and I never relented from that decision.  But whether it be the 1st January or the 1st April, if it had been possible of implementation by the 1st January, a family unit consisting of a man, his <Col N="722" /> wife and two children would be getting 50/- per week instead of the present rate of 35/- per week under the present Government, which Deputy Cowan supports.  Even if they did not come into operation on the 1st January, these benefits would have come into operation no later than the end of March or the beginning of April.  That would be a period of six weeks from now.  I challenge Deputy Cowan's political masters to deny, by reference to the official documents in the Department of Social Welfare, that I pressed to have the comprehensive scheme brought into operation to pay every one of the new rates of benefit not later than the 1st January&mdash;with the proviso that the £1 per week old age pension and the £1 per week blind pension should be paid in September of last year, which was done.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cowan had maintained, even for a further short period, the consistency for which he is not greatly renowned, we could at least have a situation in which the unemployed would to-day be getting a substantially higher rate of benefit than they are, in fact, getting.  There is no indication when they are going to get these increased rates.  It is a reasonable forecast that it will probably be nine months before there is any increase in benefit paid to the unemployed under the comprehensive Bill.  I challenge anybody to deny the accuracy of that forecast, having regard to the background knowledge of the administrative machine that must be geared up.</P>
    <P>It is not dealing with the motion to offer a benefit nine months hence. That is no answer to a motion which demands that these benefits should be paid to-day, and paid speedily.  All the Minister has got to do is to introduce a two-clause Bill increasing unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance benefits by a percentage increase, as was done previously when the rates were raised over the 1939 level.</P>
    <P>This House will pass all stages of a Bill of that kind in one day, and it can be financed out of money already in the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  In the course of my opening speech I raised the question as to the missing <Col N="723" /> £1,250,000, and I thought we would have had some answer from the Minister who was responsible then for that transaction.  I made it clear that the Government then agreed to pay a contribution for every person who joined the Army during the emergency from 1939.  The Government have welshed on that money and they now owe £1,250,000 to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  That is not the Government's money.  It is the workers' money because it is the workers' fund. If the Government will pay what they owe there will be more than sufficient money in the fund to meet any reasonable claim made under this motion. But the Government have been silent as to what they propose to do about the £1,250,000.  They went out of office the last time without paying that sum. We heard a lot of talk that the last Government did not provide for some interest charges to banks in respect of money used for the financing of a turf scheme.  I will put that down on one side and on the other side the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office owing a bill amounting to £1,250,000 and never made any provision for that.  We can then get some picture of the purity and the nobility of the motives of the folk who pretended to be so horrified that provision was not made for interest charges to banks in respect to a State financed turf scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said, this motion is rendered urgent by reason of the fact that unemployment is growing and growing rapidly, that the rates of benefit are so low that they do not provide the barest sustenance for those who are unemployed, that the price levels to-day make it utterly impossible for those who are unfortunately unemployed to keep body and soul together on the miserable rates and benefits they are receiving under existing legislation and that there is no early prospect, apparently, that that legislation will be substantially improved.  I think that our unemployment position will grow worse and worse and that makes the need for this motion all the more urgent and the need for the relief of those unemployed all the greater.  One <Col N="724" /> can hardly expect that the unemployment position will get better in view of the gloomy speeches which are being made by members of the Government. Deputy Larkin appealed for some little optimism, for some buoyancy in ministerial statements; but even that did not draw any real reciprocation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The most touching thing I saw for a long time was a photograph in a daily newspaper recently of half a dozen immaculately dressed manufacturers grouped around the Minister for Finance at a well-stocked table in the largest hotel in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very definitely it has, as I will show.  With smiles on their faces at that sumptuous meal, all the boys, led by the Minister for Finance, bemoaned that the country was heading straight for bankruptcy and the Minister for Finance had the audacity to say that a point had been reached when we were on the verge of desperation. They were all immaculately dressed at a magnificently appointed table in the Gresham Hotel.  How can the country get leadership and guidance from a Minister who can avail of a rendezvous such as that and from that eminence, under those circumstances, tell us that the country is heading straight for bankruptcy and that he is afraid the point of desperation has been reached?  As long as we get dreary speeches of that kind we will get more and more unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best thing for Ministers in that nervy and neurotic economic condition is to resign and let somebody who is cheerful, who has some faith in the country, somebody who does not believe we are heading for bankruptcy, occupy the Government Benches.  I am sure the whole Government Party are not in a state of corrosive depression. I am sure there are some cheery souls who can, at a time like this, be expected to take a hand at the helm.  Ministers who are making these speeches are a national menace; they are public pests, and the best <Col N="725" /> service they can render to the community is to get out and let others who have some regard for the danger which depressive speeches of that kind have on public confidence take their place.  This motion is being offered and is being pressed in the House on the understanding that it makes a demand for an immediate increase in unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefit prior to the enactment of a comprehensive scheme of social legislation.  If the Government accept the motion on that basis, well and good.  They will be pressed from this day onwards to introduce legislation to give effect to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In four questions yesterday I pointed out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a situation which had arisen in portion of my constituency which has caused considerable local anxiety and which I think contains within itself a matter of national importance.  I put down these questions, not for the purpose of causing any obstruction to the Minister or to Bord na Móna, but for the purpose of obtaining so far as I could information and particulars. It is proper that the House should appreciate the significance of this matter, although it may appear to be a purely local one.  Some years ago Bord na Móna announced a development for the production of sod turf on a large bog outside Ferbane known as Boora bog.  The scheme was an extremely ambitious one.  It involved an expenditure of over £1,000,000.  It involved large scale drainage work and large scale development work over a long period of years and it was allied to the commencement of a power station in Ferbane near Boora bog.</P>
      <P>The scheme, as announced, had considerable importance locally.  It seemed to provide an answer to a perennial unemployment problem: it seemed to provide continuous employment for over 1,000 workers in that area; it seemed to provide what the area sadly needed, some form of worth while industrial activity, and it also seemed to provide for the town of Ferbane a considerable increase in ordinary trade and business.  Now, that scheme, which was announced some years ago, went ahead, and Bord na Móna proceeded to develop this bog. The development meant the assembly near Boora of workers from all parts of the country; it meant the reclamation and drainage of a very large area of bog and the conversion of what was marsh into dry virgin bog.  That work went on in recent years until this year, and a sum of at least £500,000 had been spent on the development of Boora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that stage had been reached and when the country was entitled to see a return in the production of machine-won turf from the bog, a <Col N="727" /> sudden decision was announced.  The decision was this: that Bord na Móna was going to scrap the idea of producing sod turf on Boora bog and change over to milled peat production.  To people outside of the turf areas of the country, that might appear not to be of any real significance, because to the ordinary person in Dublin, or in other cities, the production of peat in any form would not seem to present any great dissimilarity, but, in point of fact, the change from sod turf to milled peat production is not merely a change of aim but is actually a complete reversal of the policy.</P>
    <P>I understood that milled peat production was a type of peat production which could, with advantage to the nation, be used in the shallower bogs in the West, but it certainly is not the type of production that one would expect to find in the real bog areas of Ferbane or Lanesboro' or other places of that kind.  When Bord na Móna announced that this huge bog, which was being developed for sod turf production, was to be turned over to milled peat production, its sudden decision had certain very real effects from the point of view of the taxpayer, of the workers engaged on the development and of the local area affected.  I only want to deal with that decision briefly from these three points of view.  First of all, from the point of view of the taxpayer.  It appears from the Minister's reply yesterday that, so far, £500,000 has been expended by Bord na Móna on Boora bog.  I assume that figure does not take into consideration whatever expenditure there has been by the Electricity Supply Board on work it has carried out in the area in connection with the power station, but in regard to that £500,000, the Minister blandly stated yesterday that £150,000 of it could be regarded as non-productive expenditure.  Now that is a phrase that might pass, but from the point of view of the taxpayer it means that at least £150,000 has been lost and has been misspent.  I am certain that that figure, which is an estimate figure, is perhaps on the small side, but at least that sum has been thrown <Col N="728" /> away by Bord na Móna arising out of this decision in connection with the development of this bog.  Some years ago the people of this country were horrified to find that the project at Santry Court, in respect of which a certain amount of development had been carried out, was being suddenly scrapped, because those who initiated it had not taken into consideration certain aspects of the site which they had chosen.</P>
    <P>The position in Boora, as I understand it, is this&mdash;I hope my information is not correct&mdash;that for the last couple of years machines have been engaged in Boora in digging and making huge drains right through the bog, drains that would permit of, and that would be suitable for, sod turf production, but by reason of this decision, to which I have referred, more machines must now come into Boora bog to close in all the drains already made there. Men were employed to open these drains and men must now be employed to close them.  Apart altogether from the non-productive expenditure in connection with the development of the scheme, we are going to have the absurd situation of more men being employed to undo the work which Bord na Móna has now decided should never have been commenced.  From the point of view of the taxpayer that, in my opinion, raises a very serious question. I would urge on the Minister the necessity for a thorough inquiry into the technical plan that permitted Bord na Móna to embark on a scheme of this kind, which they have now decided should never have been commenced.</P>
    <P>Secondly, from the point of view of the workers engaged on the scheme, I know well that there has been, in relation to Boora and to other bogs on which sod turf production has commenced, a labour problem.  The labour content of sod turf production is far higher than in the case of milled peat production.  From the workers' point of view, I understand that the peak requirements of labour at Boora was something round 1,500 men.  I do not think that was ever achieved.</P>
    <P>I understand the average was round about 500 or 1,000 men.  The change-over to milled peat production calls for <Col N="729" /> a peak employment figure of round 500, which it is hoped may be obtained locally.  Now, that raises a question in regard to those men whom I may call the pioneers, the men who were engaged there on all the rough side of turf production development, drainage work, and so on, over recent years. Last week 90 of these men were transferred from the hostel to some other bog.  They were transferred as if they were chattels, and there are some hundred of them still left at Boora. They are apparently under transfer at the moment.  I suggest to the Minister that, if this decision is to be held to, preference should be given in connection with employment under the milled peat scheme to the men already engaged on this development work at Boora.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the question arises from the local point of view of the loss of trade and the loss of the grand picture that was painted for the people of the Ferbane area as to what this scheme would mean to them.  Hostels have been built there and these apparently are to be closed or left derelict, and these is a considerable loss to the area by reason of this sudden change-over to milled peat.  Probably the Minister will say in reply to me that there is no good purpose in throwing good money after bad, and that may be so, but I suggest that, in the interests of the people generally, when a question of this kind arises, it should be followed by a very exhaustive inquiry into the entire plan and design which prompted a scheme of this kind.  In addition, I think it a pity that more information was not given locally before this decision was announced.  It is a pity that some form of conference with the representatives of the workers involved did not take place, and it is a pity that it has become necessary to raise this matter in the Dáil to obtain from the Minister the statement, which comes from Bord na Móna, which he gave the House yesterday.  The whole business is a very unhappy one and one which certainly tends to give rise to insecurity and doubt with regard to turf production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join my voice with that of Deputy <Col N="730" /> O'Higgins in saying that the constituency of Leix-Offaly has suffered very severely from many angles through the policy of the present Government, but the severest blow of all is this situation which has now arisen in Boora Bog. The villages of Kilcormac and Cloghan and the towns of Tullamore and Ferbane depend completely on the business brought in from Boora.  There were 1,500 workers employed in Boora Camp and the wages of these 1,500 men were being spent in these villages and towns.  There is no other local industry. The cruellest and most brutal blow the Minister could strike against the traders and business people, against the clergy and against all sections of the community in these areas is to deprive them of the spending of the wages of these 1,500 workers.</P>
      <P>I demand from the Minister who is responsible for the activities of Bord na Móna the reason for this sudden change.  When did Bord na Móna ask the Government's consent to change over from sod peat to milled peat? When did the Government give their consent and approval, and does it mean that the power station designed for Ferbane on the same lines as those at Portarlington and Allenwood is now to be altered?</P>
      <P>I want again to stress the importance to the area of the workers employed in this camp.  Last Sunday a public meeting was called for Cloghan, and it was decided at that public meeting that the Minister be asked to receive a deputation.  I believe that this request, coming from the Deputies for the area, deserves the calm consideration of the Minister, and I believe that he will be prepared, if he realises the seriousness of this situation for the people of Cloghan, to receive a deputation and to answer these points for the people of Cloghan who are primarily concerned.  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, this is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money.  I am told that it cost £6,000 to put down an electric line there lately, and this line is now to be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told, furthermore, that the camp which was the pride and boast of Fianna Fáil and built at the expense of the taxpayers of Offaly is now to <Col N="731" /> become a rookery for crows and a hotel for the hares, rabbits, mice and rats of Boora Bog.  I understand that a key is to be given over to a caretaker to enable him to walk in once a week and look at close on £1,000,000 worth of development work and the large amount spent on the construction of the camp.  What is to become of that camp if no one is to go into it? What plans have Bord na Móna or the Government with regard to it?  I want to make the strongest possible protest against this situation and to say that the people of Offaly will overtake the Government for the decision to deprive them of this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said last Sunday evening at the meeting which I attended with other Deputies and all sections of the local people, that I do not want to play politics in respect of a big local and national issue of this kind.  I urge the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether he will take any notice of what I say or not&mdash;to pay a visit to the place itself. He will then see that, after all the costly development scheme carried out there, there is no case for scrapping everything which exists in Boora Bog to-day.  I visited Boora Bog in a casual way a little over a year ago at a week-end and I was then told that they were proceeding to extend the hostel accommodation in the hope of providing ultimately for the accommodation of 650 people.  I was there last week-end and I found 126 people there, but I also found what I had found on the occasion of my previous visit &mdash; a considerable amount of valuable scrap, scrap metal and other scrap material, which appears to be useless because it has been lying in the same place for over a year.  I ask the Minister to have an inventory taken of the machinery, useful and useless, lying at Boora and to find out how long it has been lying there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge him, pending further consideration of the whole matter, not to close the hostel.  If it is intended to provide work for 500 people in Boora Bog, in spite of the change over, I do not see how they are to be got in the <Col N="732" /> immediate vicinity, so that hostel accommodation will be required, if it is the Minister's intention to provide employment and if employment is necessary for the economic working of that scheme.  Let him not scrap the hostel therefore.  I am interested, as is Deputy Flanagan, in finding out when this rather sensational proposition&mdash;it must have been under consideration for some time by the Department or by Bord na Móna and its engineers&mdash;was put to the Minister as the Minister responsible for the administration Bord na Móna.  I am assured that, even though the matter may have been under consideration by the Department or by Bord na Móna, it was not put as a proposal, so far as I know, to his predecessor at any time.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not want to play politics with this matter and I urge the Minister to go down and see things on the spot for himself, before taking a final decision.  The meeting which I attended last Sunday was convened by a non-political body, Muintir na Tíre, and there is no desire locally to play politics.  I want to see the place preserved and made use of for the purpose of giving the maximum amount of employment locally, if it cannot be retained as part of a national development scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time it was decided to develop the Boora Bog for the production of sod turf, the idea of the utilisation of milled peat as a fuel for power stations had not developed. Deputy Davin has spoken as if the idea of developing Boora Bog for power purposes has been abandoned.  That is not so.  It is the reverse, in fact.  Because of the decision that it is practicable to construct a station there to use milled peat, not merely will the work of development be expedited and a substation saving in cost be achieved, but the Ferbane power station, it is now contemplated, will eventually be one of the largest in the Electricity Supply Board system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies naturally will consider the effect of any such change upon the <Col N="733" /> local interests that make representations to them, but I ask them to consider the decisions that had to be taken by the Electricity Supply Board, by Bord na Móna and myself.  It has now been decided, after very careful investigation by the experts of both these bodies, assisted by other experts brought from abroad, that it is practicable to produce milled peat and burn it as a fuel for power stations with a very considerable saving in the cost of fuel, and, therefore, a considerable economy in the production cost of electricity.  Should we decide not to take advantage of that discovery&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash;merely because it means an alternation in plans already made for development in Ferbane?  It is true that if the practicability of using milled peat as a fuel for the power station in Ferbane had been known four or five years ago, the development of the bog for that purpose would have proceeded at once and some money would have been saved; but merely because £150,000 of the expenditure incurred to date must be regarded as unproductive, are we to forgo the saving of £2,500,000 which the change involves?  That is the estimate which the board has given &mdash;that the total cost of the development of that bog will be reduced by £2,500,000 as a result of the change. Clearly, that is an economy which we could not forgo merely because it is going to cause some temporary upset. No Minister would have any sense of responsibility who, merely to avoid some local trouble, would deliberately involve the country in an expenditure of £2,500,000 more than was necessary, and do so for the purposes of maintaining development which, in the long run, will be less satisfactory than the development on which we are now embarking.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said he was discussing this matter from three points&mdash; that of the taxpayers, that of the workers and that of the traders of Ferbane. In regard to the first point, there is no doubt about the wisdom of the decision, as there is a saving in total cost.  In regard to the question of the workers, the position is different. There were 120 workers in the hostel <Col N="734" /> in Ferbane.  One can talk about the 1,000 that might have been there or the 1,500 that eventually could have been accommodated if the hostel had been extended.  None of those workers are disemployed.  Those are workers brought from outside and so far as their allocation to that hostel rather than some other hostel was a decision of the board they are now gone to other hostels where their work is required and the board has decided that the work that is to be undertaken at the Boora bog can be done with local labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to put a qualification there.  There may not be enough labour there to meet the requirements of the board, but to the extent that local labour is available the board is going to utilise it.  That cannot be a subject for objection in the locality.  I am quite certain that the people there, even the traders, would prefer to see local men employed on that work than see people brought there from other areas.  I should have thought that a decision of the kind which permitted of the maximum employment of local labour would have been welcome there.  It is true that the decision temporarily affects traders in Ferbane and I think that is the origin of the agitation which has developed.  I personally regret any loss or inconvenience that might occur to the traders of Ferbane.  I understand that there is one trader who built a store in the vicinity of the camp and while commending his enterprise I can only express regret that it is not going to pay off immediately. It is intended to keep the camp there. It is expected that, with the development of the bog, a seasonal addition to the labour force will be required and the camp will be utilised for that purpose.  It may be that there will not be enough local labour for the all-the-year-round development work, in which case the camp also will be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that milled peat development necessitates the employment of fewer men than sod turf development. <Col N="735" /> That, from the point of view of the board, is an advantage because they had contemplated, in view of the development they are undertaking, a difficulty about getting enough men. There is another advantage conferred, that is, that in so far as the milled peat process is entirely mechanised it means that a high proportion of trained labour, paid upon that basis, is employed.  In this process there are few manual workers employed for labour of the kind that is still associated with sod turf production. Many of the people employed on the bogs will be mechanics or machine drivers.  Personally, I regard it as a real achievement that the technique of turf winning has, by this process at least, been brought to the stage of complete mechanisation.</P>
    <P>I do not think the constituency of Laoghis-Offaly has suffered by the policy of the present Government. May I say that it is the policy of the present Government which put this idea of turf development into the forefront of the national programme and Laoighis-Offaly particularly has benefited by that fact.  There is at the present time a number of bogs employing thousands of workers in production in Laoighis-Offaly.  There is a power station in Portarlington, a new large station capable of producing 360,000,000 units per year to be built in Ferbane and another station of equal size in the Daingean-Edenderry area. Certainly, Laoighis-Offaly is a constituency which has benefited immensely by this policy.</P>

      <P>No.  For a considerable time the technical problems associated with the utilisation of milled peat in powerhouse boilers have been under investigation&mdash;there was also the technical assistance project&mdash;and when I became Minister for Industry and Commerce again I examined the possibility of utilising that process at Ferbane as at other stations contemplated.  Over a period of six months the consequences of making the change were fully examined and the decision was made only after it was clear that there would be a substantial saving of money and no loss in time and real advantages to both the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>May I say one final word in conclusion, that even though there has been a certain amount of unproductive expenditure by Bord na Móna there is none by the Electricity Supply Board.  They have told me they will have no difficulty whatever in making the changes in the boilers ordered for Ferbane to equip them to utilise milled peat.</P>
