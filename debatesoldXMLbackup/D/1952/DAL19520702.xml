      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the improvement in the balance of trade referred to by him in reply to a parliamentary question on 26th June is primarily due to a decrease in imports or to an increase in exports and re-exports for each of the first five months of 1952; and what is the percentage change in each for each of these months.</P>

      <P>The import surplus in the first five months of 1952 was £13.6 million less than in the corresponding period of 1951.  This was the resultant of a fall in the value of imports and an increase in the value of exports.  In the first three months of 1952 the import surplus fell by £2.7 million, as compared with the same period of 1951; increased exports, including re-exports, of £6.7 million being partially offset by a rise in the value of imports of £4,000,000.  The import surplus in the months of April and May, 1952, declined by £10.9 million as compared with April and May, 1951.  This improvement was brought <Col N="2" /> about by both a reduction in imports and an increase in exports, imports falling by £7.4 million and exports, including re-exports, rising by £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>The percentage changes in the value of imports and exports, including re-exports, in each of the first five months of 1952, as compared with the corresponding months of 1951, were as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night on Forestry I pointed out the <Col N="8" /> necessity for developing the nurseries so that we would have as far as possible all the plants we required for the plantations in each successive year. Also land should if possible be acquired for a certain number of years ahead because, as the officials of the Department realise, when they acquire land for forestry there are great delays in connection with titles.  In the case of almost every portion of land acquired in South Kerry, my own constituency, there has been a difficulty about title.  This is especially true of one very important area which the Department wish to take over as a forestry centre, Lickeen, Glencar, County Kerry.  That difficulty has been going on for the past three or four years and I do not know if final arrangements have yet been made. When land is offered the Department should survey it and, if they consider it good land for planting, acquire it as soon as possible having regard to the delays which may occur before the matter is finally settled.</P>
      <P>Last night I referred to the necessity for a sufficient supply of timber for ourselves and, if possible, for export, especially because we know the difference it makes during an emergency to have our own supply of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forestry prevents soil erosion on mountain sides.  When they are unprotected the soil is continually washed down but when they are planted all that soil will be saved.  Again, we understand the importance of afforestation to our climate, especially along the western seaboard.  I believe that at one time many years ago a forestry expert was sent here from Scandinavia by the British Government.  I wonder if his report would still be anywhere in the archives of the Department of Forestry.  I believe&mdash;at least it was reported at the time&mdash;that it was an adverse report and that he said that the lands along the western seaboard were not suitable for afforestation because they were so open to the sea and to the winds from the Atlantic Ocean.  There cannot be any great change in the climate of this country for centuries back.  In fact, it is known and has been tested that that is so. <Col N="9" /> We have evidence in the cut-away bogs along the western seaboard that in ancient times these areas were certainly entirely under forest because you find the roots of oaks, pines and other trees.  If that land was capable of being planted then it is equally so now.</P>
    <P>The salvation of the western seaboard and the Gaeltacht areas depends on the extent to which forestry can be developed in those districts.  Emigration principally occurs from these poorer remote areas.  Let us take it that afforestation were carried on on as large a scale as possible.  First, having acquired the land you will have drainage, fencing, planting and the care of the trees.  When the forest matures you will have the felling of the trees and you must cart them to the sawmills.  Then, again, you will have another round of planting and the same thing all over again, so that it would mean eventually permanent employment for something like 250,000 men.  That is a very important aspect of forestry.  It would, of course, take some time to achieve but eventually it would come to that.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Forestry Department is adverse to the plantation of small areas but, if in a certain district you have perhaps a circle of 50 or 60 acres, or even a smaller area, in close proximity to what would be regarded as a key centre, I think areas such as that should be accepted for plantation.  While it has been suggested here that a separate Department of Forestry should be set up I think we have a sufficient number of Departments already.  After all the setting up of a special Department in that way would involve increased expenses and the provision of an increased staff.  I would suggest, however, in order to bring to the notice of the people of the country the fact that there is a section of the Department of Lands dealing with forestry that the name of the Department should be changed to &ldquo;The Department of Lands and Forestry&rdquo; and that the Minister should be known as &ldquo;The Minister for Lands and Forestry&rdquo;.  That would bring it into the prominence it deserves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> County committees of agriculture have, I believe, statutory powers to give grants of £10 per acre to farmers who plant shelter belts or groves of trees.  At the present time that sum is entirely inadequate for that purpose. I was just thinking&mdash;I do not wish to be offensive in any way or to introduce anything that would create any kind of opposition in this matter &mdash;that the amount of the dance tax remitted, £140,000, would pay for the provision of 14,000 such plots at £10 per acre and, if the allowance were doubled, it would help to provide 7,000 such plots.</P>
    <P>The only grievance I have in connection with this Estimate is the fact that the amount allocated for forest development and maintenance has been reduced, whereas we had hoped that it would continue to be increased from year to year.  The Minister has given some reasons for the reduction but I am not sure that they are quite acceptable. I think that the Minister should devote all his energy to the advancement of afforestation.  Some Deputies have stated that arable land should not be planted and I think everybody realises that potential arable land should not be planted.  You will also have difficulties in certain mountain areas where you have people engaged in sheep-rearing.  You have to make a choice between the two forms of activity, but I am sure that by co-operation between the officials of the Department of Forestry and the owners of the land concerned an amicable arrangement could be arrived at.  Good mountain land suitable for sheep-rearing should not be planted but, apart from that, you have in the mountainous areas of the West acres upon acres suitable for afforestation. I would say to the Minister before concluding that if he takes every step possible to promote afforestation, and if the officials of his Department will co-operate loyally to advance afforestation in every way, he will certainly have the loyal support of all right-minded people.  The trees that he and his predecessors will have been responsible for planting and that future Ministers will plant, will be there in years to come as a sort of living monument <Col N="11" /> to the good work which they carried out while Ministers in charge of this Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Year after year many members of this House have discussed this important question of afforestation. Whatever way we wish to approach the subject, I believe it is gratifying to have to admit that the Minister's immediate predecessor certainly did a good day's work within the range available to him in regard to forestry.  That assertion is justified by the statement which the Minister made in introducing this Vote yesterday when he said that a figure of 15,000 acres per annum had been reached for planting.  That certainly represented an increase on the amount planted in previous years.  Unfortunately, although this is a work in which we should all be able to co-operate with the Minister, I am sorry to say the Minister's statement seemed to indicate that we are now inclined to drift back from the 15,000 acres mark to 12,000 acres which according to the Minister seem to be the maximum at which we can aim in future.  It may be that even that figure will not be reached.  Having regard to the fact that afforestation is a branch of the activities of the Central Government, I consider that it has been grossly neglected.  Deputy Cogan, speaking last night, mentioned that there were many difficulties connected with afforestation.  He went so far as to say that it is a matter which is bristling with difficulties.  Many of these difficulties, in my opinion, are manmade difficulties.  I believe, remembering all the chances we had to advance much further in our afforestation programme in years past, that we have missed the tide most severely in this respect.  When we realise all that is tied up with the question of afforestation&mdash;the possibility of an improvement in climatic conditions, the feasibility of an improvement in health standards which are so badly affected at present by humidity due to the lack of timber and the question of unemployment in rural areas&mdash;I feel that it will be generally recognised that we have been sadly negligent in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> The net decrease shown in the total amount asked for in the Estimate is £217,350 but the Minister did point out that there were different ways of arriving at that figure.  I think it would be advisable at this stage to consider another side of the Estimate.  In the Appropriation Accounts for 1950-51, I see on page 138 an explanation of the causes of variation between expenditure and grant.  One explanation given in that page states that the saving in regard to a particular sub-head was &ldquo;due mainly to delay in filling vacancies especially in forester grades&rdquo;.  Why should there be such a delay in the filling of vacancies?  If we want to get a solution of this problem surely it is vital to see that there would be no undue delay in the filling of vacancies?  According to this statement, the total surplus surrendered in the year 1950-51 amounted to £43,352 13s. 2d.  On the Vote that was passed by this House, that was a nice tidy little nest egg to have surrendered to the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>In view of that, can it be said that we are serious in our approach to afforestation?  I believe that the last Minister for Lands, who was also Minister for Forestry, did a good day's work, but even that was not sufficient. Deputy Palmer holds a certain view and, naturally, believes that his opinion is correct.  Still, I am of the opinion that the very fact that the Department of Forestry is tied up with the Department of Lands makes it an orphan in the family.  The Department of Lands is a very big Department and the Minister in charge of it has plenty of problems to deal with.  We all know of the numerous questions which are addressed to him by Deputies about the acquisition and division of land and, generally, in connection with the activities of the Land Commission.  My opinion is that if afforestation is to be tackled in a sincere manner it is beyond the capacity of the Minister for Lands to deal with forestry problems in the manner in which we would all wish to see them dealt with.</P>
    <P>So long as this important section of Government activity is only a section of another Department, it will be ignored.  We have proof of that fact <Col N="13" /> every year when the Estimates are presented to us.  The important Estimate is that for the Department of Lands.  Even last year we witnessed the sad spectacle of seeing less than one hour devoted to forestry.  I agree, of course, that was in accordance with the time table which had been set for the Estimates.  We hear wonderful things said about forestry and of its importance to the country, and yet that was all the time that we were able to devote to the Forestry Vote last year.  I submit it is essential that forestry should be dealt with as an independent subject with a Minister responsible for answering in this House in connection with matters brought to his notice by Deputies.  We are told, of course, that if forestry were a separate branch it would mean additional expenditure for the State. Up to a point that may be correct, if Deputies want to consider the subject according to present day expenditure. But Deputies cannot be correct in that view if they refuse to accept a long-term view of forestry, realising its advantages, and are sincere in their desire that an up-to-date afforestation programme should be given to the State.  As Deputy MacBride mentioned, so long as forestry is tied up with the Department of Lands we are not going to get a programme which will produce for us results anything like what we would all desire.</P>
    <P>There are some points which arise on the Estimate that I should now like to deal with.  I see that a sum of £1,702 is provided for forestry education. That represents an increase of £412 over last year.  But coupled with that increase we have this extraordinary statement&mdash;it is somewhat similar to the one I mentioned earlier as appearing in the Appropriation Accounts for 1950-51:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a saving of money again because of the abandonment of the proposed course of instruction for foresters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it should be admitted that our people have not been properly educated as regards the importance of afforestation.</P>
    <P>That education should, in my opinion, start in the national schools, where <Col N="14" /> young boys would get a taste for the study of this important subject.  They should be interested in it early in life and encouraged to make forestry a special calling for themselves.  In view of the fact that we are all the time clamouring for more education, for more scholarships for the universities and to the various professions in our cities, we certainly should do something to enable boys to be educated for a calling which, when they reach the years of manhood, would provide them with a lifetime job in rural conditions. When I say that I do not mean a type of education that would result in packing the Department with indoor officials in Dublin, but that we should offer facilities to young boys and men to take up forestry as a possible profession which would provide them with an excellent means of livelihood later in life.  What I have in mind is the type of education that would fit them for such a calling.  The Minister may say that such an education should, perhaps, be forthcoming from the Department of Education.  That might be so, so far as the national schools are concerned, but if we are interested in this problem it is no use for us to say that the Minister and officials of another Department should do certain things for us if we are not prepared to do them ourselves.  Therefore I say that if the Minister is not able to do it this year he should make provision for a substantial increase in the amount for instruction in forestry. There should be decent provision made for forestry education.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to deal with is the provision for publicity&mdash;through advertising, for instance.  What success can we hope for when we find that the provision for advertising is only £500?  I think that the Deputies who have spoken have been justified in saying that the people in the various parts of the country are not being made to realise all that afforestation can mean to them.  I agree with those Deputies who have said that there is not enough being done either by individuals themselves or through local initiative. But if that is so I believe it is due to the fact that the central Government itself is not prepared to spend anything <Col N="15" /> more than £500 on publicity, through advertising, on the important subject of afforestation.  That is a very small amount.  When we see repeatedly in the main Dublin and provincial papers, daily and weekly, various huge Government notices on different subjects all through the year, and when we see the large amount that the Electricity Supply Board can spend telling us about the dry weather and the danger of electricity shortage, we must wonder why the Forestry Section cannot do more advertising.  I am not blaming the officials but blaming the policy&mdash;no matter what Minister or what Government is in power.  I blame Ministers for not insisting on a policy of getting before the people the importance of reafforestation.</P>
    <P>There is £100 provided in the Estimate for exhibits at shows and £50 for consultative committees.  Exhibits at shows in rural Ireland are an ideal way of boosting afforestation but what can any officials do with £100 for that purpose?  The Minister may say it is a token figure but my personal experience is that token figures are never even expended and that there is always a balance coming back to Finance or otherwise.  These two figures, £100 and £50, are not sufficient. I do not know what we ever get from the consultative committees.  If a little more money were given to the various county committees of agriculture it may bring better results than by getting people who may be experts in theory but of very little assistance to us when it comes to planting trees.  The assistance of the county committees in their commonsense direct approach to the subject may be much more advantageous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned that the acquisition of land may prove a problem in increasing afforestation.  I mentioned a point here a couple of years ago and still believe it is worth consideration.  In various parts of the country there are large amounts of derelict or waste land which is rated at present for valuation purposes at 1/6 or 2/- in the £.  The improvement of that land by putting it under timber <Col N="16" /> would of itself give the local councils an increased valuation.  No one can say that land could be used for agricultural purposes.  The Minister may say it would not suit for afforestation.  We have come to the stage where soil testing and all the wonderful paraphernalia that goes with it decides whether a tree will grow or not.  I can say that within 40 or 50 yards of my own home in Crosshaven there is a huge eucalyptus tree growing almost in bogland.  If we asked any of the experts whether such timber could be grown they would say it was impossible to grow such trees in this country.</P>
    <P>What is wrong is that we are negative in our approach.  I put down a question some years ago about reafforestation in South Cork.  There were large tracts of land which comprise turf land at present but where admittedly timber was grown a long period of years ago.  We are told now it cannot grow timber since the soil analysis does not give desired results. What exactly do we want?  Are we basing it on a 1952 system of minimum financial return for anything we spend in this State?  Are we tied to the belief that we are not entitled to look into the future and be satisfied with a return then instead of now?  Are we tied to the belief that the future must look after itself and that we are responsible only for the present time? We all know that none of us here will live to see the time when the young saplings or seedlings of the present day come to maturity, especially if they are hardwood.  We will be at least 6ft. down&mdash;whatever is left behind us.  Yet we could say that we are handing over to the people who will be alive then a positive possession worth having, maybe a lot more important than bank balances of money the value of which we cannot imagine in 15 or 20 years' time.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Minister is unfortunately one of going backwards from the afforestation target set by the previous Minister in the inter-Party Government for three or four years. It is well to remember that members of the Opposition during the period 1948-51 made contributions here which were well worth hearing.  They advanced a theory that we should get <Col N="17" /> going with things.  They pointed out that during the war years there were many difficulties, especially in regard to wire netting, but that in 1948-51 those difficulties were being surmounted. If those difficulties have been surmounted, as has been proved by the figures submitted to us, then it is poor satisfaction for us now to realise that we are putting more difficulties in the way.  Instead of advancing over the 15,000 mark, we are drifting back again to the 12,500 mark as a maximum plantation for the coming year.</P>
    <P>We will get closer co-operation from the county committees of agriculture if we ask for it and provided we as a central authority co-operate also.  In Cork and Donegal the county councils have nursery plantations themselves and they are offering great advantages to farmers in their county areas, including young plants and saplings at a cheap price.  Unfortunately, that policy is being weakened by the fact that there is no Government publicity drive in regard to the importance of planting.  If those two county councils received the encouragement which they deserved, and if the other county councils were told what Cork and Donegal have been doing, and if we are prepared to give them co-operation and plenty of publicity, we will be starting on a road which will ultimately make 15,000 acres in the year a very small amount.</P>
    <P>The outstanding problem for the few years that I have been here is the amount of land that should be made available locally before it can be acquired.  We are told that, unless the Forestry Section can get a parcel of at least 300 acres, it would not be worth taking over.  In how many parts of the country will we get, within a few parishes, a lot more than 300 acres, but which is divided in such a way that the Forestry Section consider the distances too great?  Such land is left there and is allowed to deteriorate every year.  Throughout South Cork and various other parts of this country we see hillsides and land which are ideal for afforestation purposes covered with gorse.  The fact that we are not planting trees on these hillsides and <Col N="18" /> lands which are covered with gorse means that we are neglecting those areas, that we are willing to leave the people in those areas unemployed and that we are not prepared to try and improve the climate in those areas, because we all know that the climate in a countryside in which timber is grown tends to differ somewhat from the climate in the bare open countryside.</P>
    <P>I understand that experts from another country recently examined the question of afforestation in Ireland and that the 300-acre minimum would not satisfy them.  They felt that the minimum acreage should be much higher.  We should approach this problem from a different angle from that which experts from other countries may appear to approach it. This is a small country, and we have not that much land in every county that we can say that we will put 300 acres of land in different localities under timber.  If we have parcels of land of 30, 40 or 50 acres then, with the co-operation of the local county committee of agriculture, the local people and the advice of the parish priest, I believe that the results will be such that we shall not have to send for experts from another country to tell us our business.  These days, we are wont to claim that we know a great deal more than our grandfathers knew &mdash;but our grandfathers knew the value of timber, and in their time planted trees and played their part in regard to afforestation.  We must admit that, so far as afforestation is concerned, we are not as progressive as the people who lived in the olden times.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with some of the sub-heads of the Vote itself.  Under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, in respect of the Director and Secretariat&mdash;there is an increase this year of £8,030.  I do not object to that increase&mdash;far from it.  We all know that every section of the community are entitled to the increases which they received.  There is also an increase of £702 in respect of the accounts branch.  Again, I am not questioning that increase.  I merely bring it to the attention of the House. There is an increase of £9,423 in respect of foresters and an increase of <Col N="19" /> £7,318 in respect of the inspectorate and mapping staff.  These are substantial and justifiable increases in salaries, wages and allowances, but I would ask if there has been a commensurate increase in the acreage under forestry.  I think that, bearing in mind the increases under sub-head A, to which I have just referred, we are taking a retrograde step when we reduce the acreage to be put under forestry.  It is our bounden duty, when such increases in remuneration are granted, to see to it that the acreage to be put under forestry is increased.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2) refers to forest development, maintenance, etc.  There is an increase of £5,400 under that sub-head. I believe that that increase is totally inadequate for forest development, maintenance and so forth.  With present-day costs, what can we get for £5,400?  The Minister might as well have made no increase under that sub-head as to make that small increase.  It is all very well to say that we mean well and that we are anxious to show some little increase but, in a year or two, when the appropriation accounts in respect of this year are published, we may read a note to the effect that a certain amount of money was saved on our present programme and even a little may be saved out of that £5,400. The increase in respect of forest development, maintenance and so forth, should be far in excess of £5,400.</P>
    <P>The second point under sub-head C (2) is outstanding.  It relates to capital expenditure and, in relation to labour (Initial Preparation and Drainage of Ground, Road Construction and Buildings) there is a decrease of £250,400. The Minister may say that there are certain reasons for that decrease&mdash; that so much land was put under seedlings and saplings in the last couple of years that we must now concentrate on thinning, and so forth.  If that is so, then our policy in relation to afforestation for 1952-53 is a completely inactive policy and one which will not yield any satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>Comparisons have been made between afforestation in other countries and afforestation in this country.  A few years ago I gave the <Col N="20" /> afforestation figures in relation to Britain, Norway, Sweden and other countries and I pointed out the miserable percentage of land under timber in this country.  I know the answer which was given by the Minister.  It was an answer given by his officials in his Department.  I realise that that answer may not have satisfied the Minister himself.  We must be prepared to face the fact that this problem must not be approached solely from the point of view of immediate financial returns.  No matter what Minister may be in office and dealing with this problem and no matter what Minister for Finance may be ready to grouse at him when he looks for money for the Forestry Division, there is an obligation on the Minister for Lands, when asking for money for afforestation in this country, to make sure that the amount asked for will be sufficient to yield an adequate return.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that, this year, we are prepared to drop our forestry acreage from 15,000 to 12,500.  The Minister's statement makes it clear that that in itself must be considered the very maximum.  That shows us very clearly that we are not prepared to tackle this important matter in the way we should.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of unemployment. Deputy Cogan covered many of these points admirably in his own way and I have nothing to say against him.  If I differ on many small points the difference is so small that it is hardly worth talking about. Deputy Cogan said this was a problem which bristled with difficulties and he was anxious to see a solution in the way of lovely little villages surrounded by forest land.  As a picture that, of course, would be grand but having regard to the fact that this programme takes no account of afforestation we will have to be satisfied with half the job since we know we will never have the whole job done.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of men in the rural areas who have been looking for employment over the years.  In these areas the only choice they have is either to work with the farmers or with the local authorities.  If no work were <Col N="21" /> available to them from either of those sources it would mean that there would be a certain number of men on the employment exchanges all the year round.  It would also mean that there would be a very high percentage who, because they might never have unemployment cards, would never be able to sign on at the labour exchange.  These men are put on home assistance.  Just imagine in a country professing Christian ideals that these men should be told they could live on home assistance while at the same time the countryside is denuded of timber.</P>
    <P>We have land in this country fit for nothing else but the growing of timber. It is the type of land that would yield first class timber and even if it were not suitable for the growing of first-class timber it would at least be ideal for the growing of timber suitable for pit props or firewood.  We could give employment to people in their own localities and thus relieve the plight of married men with families living on home assistance.</P>
    <P>For years past we have been depending upon foreign experts to tell us our business, but there was a time when there were no experts to tell the people of Ireland their business.  Yet they were able to carry out a programme of afforestation.  In this section of his Department the Minister has men as capable as any experts in any other part of the world.  While that is so, policy must be laid down by the Minister and not by the officials of his Department or anybody else.  The Minister should tell his colleagues in the Government that a large number of unemployed people in rural Ireland could be employed on afforestation. We could improve the land by giving employment.  Land would be improved by growing timber on it.  If we went ahead with such a constructive programme we would be on the high road to success, but I cannot see this being done as a result of this Estimate.  On that account I am forced to speak as I do.</P>
    <P>I would have been perfectly satisfied if the Minister had kept to the figure of 15,000 acres given by the last Minister.  Had that been done, we could not say that we were making a <Col N="22" /> retrograde step.  It might be that we ought to pause and hold on to the 15,000 and, after a while, strike out for a higher figure; but, in fact, we have drifted back from that.</P>
    <P>The amount under the heading Appropriations-in-Aid shows an increase of £56,510.  That will help the income figures in the Book of Estimates this year, but while the amount shows a total increase of £56,510, it is estimated this year that forests receipts will be £60,000.  We are hoping for an increase of £60,000 from the sale of timber from the forests, but at the same time we are admitting defeat by reducing the acreage under planting.</P>
    <P>Somebody will suffer by this in the long run.  That may not happen either in the Minister's time or in my time but in the future.  Yet we are hoping to increase our sales.  We are hoping to sell more timber, but at the same time we are adopting a negative policy of reducing planting, a further weakness in this important Vote.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned that there is a decrease of £5,000 in the sale of sawn timber.  I do not know how that may be but the Minister can easily account for that.  I do not know whether or not there is a demand for prepared timber, but that is a matter that can be got over.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I referred to the question of education.  It is a significant fact that the increase in wages given to foresters amounted to £9,423.  I believe we could not concentrate enough on this matter.  It is my opinion that we have not got enough foresters.  We are not offering an inducement to would-be foresters to stay in their own country. Very often the people consider those who write articles on the subject of afforestation in papers and periodicals cranks because they may happen to be Irishmen.  Yet, if we could get experts from Scandinavia or America we would bow to them and consider them almost supernatural beings when they tell us what we should do in regard to afforestation.  The sooner we realise we have men with brains in this country, and the sooner we give them employment as foresters and forestry experts the better-off we will be. Instead of sending our young men abroad and thereby depriving this <Col N="23" /> country of the benefit of their expert advice we ought to keep them at home.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw attention again. During the emergency a huge amount of timber was felled in this country. We are all aware of the amount of money that was given by means of grants for replanting purposes.  If ever there was a waste of money or squandermania in this country, it was those grants.  I am not blaming the present Minister or his predecessor for the grants.  It is quite true that a Minister cannot be aware of every little plantation which is being replanted throughout the country.  I am aware of certain cases in which these grants were received under false pretences. The individuals so guilty planted thousands of young saplings close to the roots of old trees and allowed them to grow there for five years without attention, resulting in their becoming choked by weeds.  I have seen some of the recipients of these grants for reafforestation purposes sticking plants into the ground and allowing them die for the want of attention.  Such is the useless purpose for which the Government allocated money.  Perhaps, there were not sufficient inspectors, or maybe the inspectors were not told to fulfil to the utmost their duties of making sure that saplings were properly treated when planted.</P>
    <P>Every member of the House knows that there are ideal forests in the Black Forest area of Germany, but, perhaps, members may not be aware that, during the 1914-18 war, Irishmen who were taken as prisoners of war by the Germans were sent to work side by side with the Germans in these forests.  When trees were felled, the timber was cut up and sold to the local people.  The vacant plots were then dug up and treated as well as we would treat a cabbage plot in this country, and then the young saplings were planted.  What a contrast to what happens here!  The individuals who received grants under false pretences in this country employed a young fellow, got him to stick the saplings in the ground and then failed to give them the requisite attention.  There <Col N="24" /> has been no greater waste of State money within the past five or ten years than the giving of these grants.  If it is not too late, I would request the Minister to have the areas planted, checked and reported on by the local Gardaí if there are not enough inspectors available.  Surely those carrying out the inspections would have enough common sense to know whether or not the saplings are growing. They would realise that if the areas planted are not devoid of weeds and briars young trees and saplings will have no hope of developing properly.  If reports, as a result of these inspections, were presented to the Minister's Department showing the negligence of people who got grants, some effort should be made to prosecute them.</P>
    <P>I will not prolong my contribution because I realise that the previous Minister for Lands is anxious to speak on this matter.  There were some other points that I wished to consider, but, realising that other members are anxious to speak, I will conclude by saying this to the Minister.  It is unfortunate that we are taking a backward step as regards this problem of reafforestation.  We should be prepared to say that 15,000 acres of planting per year is not sufficient and that an additional amount of money should be allocated for seedlings.  The problem of not being able to acquire the necessary land is one which can be surmounted if we wish to surmount it.  I trust that the Minister and the Government are anxious to solve that problem.  Every member of this House is anxious to see it solved.  If we adopt a progressive attitude and if we continue the policy pursued by the Minister's predecessor and try even to improve on that policy, we will be approaching the time when we will have a worth-while afforestation programme in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Palmer, I decided that he would be a very suitable character for the <i>Merchant of Venice.</i>  He spoke of reafforestation at great length, and he told us where we could plant trees or saplings.  He said that afforestation would prove of great benefit to this <Col N="25" /> country and that it would employ 250,000 people.  He made quite sure to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You are to keep away from any land that sheep can graze on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was not the Minister's plan to plant any land that would provide grazing for goats or sheep.  There is certain land throughout the country that will feed nothing else.  I do not know where the Minister is going to get land for afforestation even allowing for the fact that he is a most efficient Minister.  Deputy Palmer spoke at great length on this point, but he made doubly sure that everything he said would sound right to his constituents.</P>
      <P>I must say that Deputy Desmond gave a fine speech as to what, in his opinion, afforestation should consist of in this country.  He raised a very vital point that any Minister should bear in mind.  If this House gives the Minister for Lands a carte-blanche enabling him to take over certain mountainy districts by a stroke of the pen by merely saying: &ldquo;We wish to take over this land, and we are not going to consider the rights of a number of families who have made their livelihoods in this area for hundreds of years,&rdquo; a huge problem will be created.  In my own area in County Dublin, I have known of cases where people complained because their means of livelihood was taken from them.  If the Minister takes over a parcel of land in Kerry on which goats and sheep have been grazing and then comes along to some other area and interferes with the natural rights of the people who have been rearing sheep, goats and cattle there, there will be loud protests in this House, and the Minister will be called a dictator. Therefore, this is a matter which presents many difficulties.  Every member of this House would like to see plenty of trees growing throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made as to how the previous Minister advanced while in office.  I know that the previous Minister, like other Ministers, did his <Col N="26" /> best in this connection.  Definitely the present Minister and his Department are doing their best.  They cannot do any more.  If this House is prepared to give the present Minister full authority to tell inspectors to go out to a tract of land on a mountainside where sheep have been grazing and on which people are depending for a livelihood and acquire it for forestry purposes greater advances could be made.  That is the only way that it could be tackled on a large scale but as long as we are a democratic Party and a democratic Parliament and as long as we act under the Constitution we will have to consider the livelihood of all citizens within this state.  We must consult them within reasonable bounds if it happens that we are interfering with their livelihood in any way.  In that regard we can only move slowly and judiciously, doing things as well as possible in the circumstances which prevail and we must definitely face up to that position.</P>
    <P>I must say this of the previous Minister.  A policy was adopted by the previous Administration&mdash;and I do not blame the previous Minister too much for it at all because I know that he had been driven very hard by people who were inexperienced in the inter-Party Government&mdash;that, as long as you got a tree down, if the tree was only a week old it was as good as a tree years old.  The policy was to get that plant down at any cost, and it was a bad policy.  I had some experience of the planting of trees and the replanting of them after some years.  I took great pleasure from watching the growth of those saplings of all kinds. I must say I observed certain plantings that had been carried out as a result of the previous Minister's policy where some little plants were put down on the bleak mountainside and had no chance of surviving.  Surely if the present Minister and the Department, in their wisdom, consider that it is better, as a result of advice from experts in other countries as well as this country, not to plant saplings out on a bleak mountainside or on a moorland until they come to a certain maturity, surely it is better to adopt that policy than to put out thousands <Col N="27" /> of small plants that are not mature for replanting and would possibly die of exposure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond said that a number of plants were choked by weeds and grass where they had been given to certain people who gave their timber during the emergency.  On that particular point might I remind Deputy Desmond that we, in this country, were delighted to have trees cut down during that emergency, and I would not like the Minister to take any advantage of or be any way harsh on the people who gave their timber, and possibly gave it to their neighbours to cut down to keep their fires going during the emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a lot to do with this question of cutting down trees during the emergency and going to farmers and others to get the trees from them.  I must say that on many occasions we had to use a lot of diplomacy to persuade those people to give the trees for the benefit of the people of the parish.  While they may have been paid for it most of the people I had to deal with were fonder of the trees than they were of the money.  In cases of that kind in my area my experience is that the people are very anxious to see that these young trees will grow.  Looking on them harshly and saying that they were paid for it is not a fair judgment of the situation.  I suppose there may have been a few people who took advantage of the emergency, who bought tracts of woodland, cut it down and commercialised it, but then you have the other type of people who gave it from purely national motives and tried to help during that period. In judging the people in this connection you can put them into two or three categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this question but I am definitely fond <Col N="28" /> of trees and interested in reafforestation. Again I know the Minister's strong national views on this point and how anxious he is to help this national effort.  On the other hand, I am not so satisfied that the Minister and his Department, through the county committees of agriculture, are getting it over properly to our people in regard to the shelter beds about which we have so often spoken.  The shelter beds on the farms throughout Ireland are, firstly, very nice, secondly very useful and, in an emergency, of invaluable assistance to the farmer.  I do suggest that the Forestry Division should make a new drive in this connection.  A number of farmers have quite a lot of bad land on their farms and if the proper approach were made to people in, say, a parish or village they would be encouraged to grow trees, so that in the course of 50 or 60 years' time a saw mill might be erected in that village.  You would therefore be helping the national effort in a supplementary way as well. That could be done by more propaganda, more encouragement and would promote a love for trees among our people.</P>
    <P>When travelling throughout the country, if you see a shelter bed near a dwelling-house and a drive going up to the house you will surely admire it when passing by.  From the scenic point of view it looks well and, apart from that, what a great national asset it is to the country.  Everything cannot be left to the Forestry Department. Great progress could be made if our farmers would contribute by planting saplings and trees.  In that way we would eventually reach a most satisfactory stage in our forestry programme.</P>
    <P>One Deputy said here we are not planting enough trees and, as we dare not go into land that cattle, sheep or goats can graze on, he suggested that we should go to some parts of the hills or mountains which are almost a complete desert, possibly devoid of vegetation of any kind.  In other words, according to certain Deputies in the Opposition, the Minister and his Department will have to try to plant trees in No Man's Land.  That is a very poor outlook.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to appeal to the <Col N="29" /> Minister and his Department to encourage our farmers a good deal more to go ahead on the lines I have suggested. By doing so they will be enabling the farmers to make a supplementary effort to that being made by the Department of Forestry.  If this matter could be considered on a national scale it would definitely instil into our people a greater love for trees and a greater love for planting them. If this development should materialise it would be a great advantage to our country.</P>

      <P>Much play has been made about this target of 25,000 acres. As far as we in Kerry are concerned, we did not see any reflection of that programme or any practical effort made to bring that about so far as our districts in South Kerry were concerned. I myself made representations to the previous Minister from 1948 onwards particularly in regard to Lickeen and Glencar, County Kerry. For one reason or another nothing was done until two or three months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The lackadaisical approach and the slowing down, as I call it, prevented us from having title completed and the scheme put through.  It was not until recently as a result of questions and representations by me to the Minister and his Department that the Minister and his Department made special representations to the solicitors concerned on behalf of the landlord and title has now been put right and the scheme will go ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very fine to talk about a target but what is the good in having a target of 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 60,000 acres if we do not try to reach the target?  So far as I can see it is only so much propaganda. If the ex-Minister can point out to me any important scheme in Kerry that was put through from 1948 onwards I will agree with him that his <Col N="30" /> statement about hitting a target of 25,000 acres per year had reality, but I do not think the ex-Minister will be able to do that.  Deputy Blowick at one time mentioned that their Department would plant what he called maritime pine around the coast which could be developed and sold subsequently as commercial timber.  That scheme never materialised.</P>
      <P>I am giving the facts now as I found them in my experience.  My chief complaint about the policy of the last Government and the present Government is the Department's approach in relation to the acquisition of land.  We have been told that no scheme of under 300 acres will be considered.  It is said that an area of less than 300 acres will not be economic.  While that policy continues in operation we are wasting time talking about the development of afforestation.  I submitted a scheme to the Department subsequent to 1948 in connection with Milltown, County Kerry.  We had approximately 200 acres there but the Department did not consider it an economic proposition. If that policy continues the Forestry Department will wait for a good many years before they will succeed in getting the acreage they require.  Is the Department content to leave it over for half a century and to leave these districts without any afforestation schemes?</P>
      <P>The plea that has been made for the non-development of these smaller plots is that they could not be supervised and would prove too costly.  Why not group the smaller plots together in order to make them economic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months I have been approached by organisations such as Muintir na Tíre.  These organisations are anxious to have schemes sanctioned if they can get sufficient land to carry out schemes.  These schemes would be sponsored by the local parish committees under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre and the committee is anxious to have the assistance of the technical adviser from the Department.  In that way we would have what might be described as a communal scheme sponsored by Muintir na Tíre and developed by the Minister and his Department.  I <Col N="31" /> think that approach is worthy of consideration because it would give local people an interest.  I was told in fact that they could get people to invest in such a scheme.  Such a development would be an asset to the State and to the people in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>There is another point for consideration in relation to the county committees of agriculture.  I think the Department could have closer contact with those committees.  I know that these committees work on a different basis. They get a subsidy for the planting of trees.  I think we could go further than that and regard these committees as propaganda units for the purpose of advertising the advantages and assets of reafforestation.  These committees could assist the Department's inspectors in securing land and in collecting the necessary data.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his efforts which enabled us to complete this important scheme in Glencar. Before the year is out I hope further schemes will be developed in South and West Kerry, because these areas have been left for many years without any attention or any investigation.  At all times I have received the greatest courtesy and assistance from the Minister's officials in connection with any representations I had to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy J. Flynn ended his speech by complimenting the forestry officials on their courtesy.  He was not quite so complimentary in his opening statements.  Possibly, having tried to wound, he was anxious to pour some oil over the wound or apply some kind of plaster to soothe the hurt feelings of the officials.  As regards the Lickeen forest and any other plantations or proposed plantations in Kerry or any other constituency, the local Deputy, if he approaches the problem correctly, can do a great deal to assist the Forestry Department officials and the Minister if he wants to do that.  I have a shrewd suspicion that if Deputy Flynn, who was very fond during the inter-Party Government régime and afterwards of making lovely statements about his concern for the establishment of a forest in Lickeen, asked the people to get the title of their <Col N="32" /> lands straight in order to facilitate the Forestry Department, he would be doing much more good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn was supporting the Party now in office for 16 years before the inter-Party Government came in, and in all my reading of Dáil debates I did not notice that Deputy Flynn had the slightest interest in establishing a forest in Lickeen or any other part of South Kerry.  It is only when we gave it the fillip during our period in office that Deputy Flynn began to wake up to the possibilities of forests, possibly as a vote-catching stunt rather than for the good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disheartened when I found that the Minister had decided to cut down the planting programme to 12,500 acres.  Is he wise in that?  If his argument is that the supply of plantable land would not be sufficient to meet a greater annual target, could he not overcome that by doing two things&mdash;first, by increasing the acquisition staff in the Department and, secondly, by offering a more attractive price than is being offered at the present time?  I would like to know from the Minister when he is replying if he has altered the ceiling price in the last 12 months.  If he has not done so, I think he is not wise in continuing that ceiling, because it must be admitted that even from the poorest land the income has increased slightly, and when the income has increased slightly the cash value of the land has increased.  If the Minister is determined to proceed with forestry on a big scale he should increase the price.  At present the price is holding up matters.  Many people consider the price that they have been offered is too shabby, even in cases where the income of the land was not very considerable. It must be admitted that for the last three, four or five years, since the price of agricultural produce stepped up a little, the price of land increased accordingly.  If it is intended to proceed with afforestation in the manner that we would all wish, many <Col N="33" /> difficulties will be eliminated if the two suggestions that I have made are carried out, namely, to increase the price payable for land if that has not already been done, and to put more acquisition staff at the disposal of the director.  I do not know whether or not the acquisition staff has been increased during the last 12 months, but such an increase would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that approximately 15,000 acres were planted last year.  The target set by the inter-Party Government was 25,000 acres.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the inter-Party Government were in office that target would be reached in a very short time.  Deputy Flynn adopts the foolish attitude that miracles can be worked overnight, that an afforestation programme can be jumped up from 3,000, 4,000 to 6,000 acres per year to three or four times that acreage. That is childish and he does not believe it himself.  He tries to pretend that he believes it.  He knows that it cannot be done.  It could be reached in a few years if the proper approach were made.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the Minister's Party was soliciting support in this House to enable them to form a Government and to displace the inter-Party Government, amongst the famous 17 points, almost every single one of which has been ditched, was the afforestation programme that was filched from us.  Candidates went out and said that they would carry out a better programme than we were carrying out, that they would do it better. The Taoiseach mentioned in one of his speeches that it was his policy to acquire a great deal of land that hitherto was unplantable, to make it available for afforestation and to put it under timber.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have absolutely no faith in the present Government's policy, not only in afforestation but in almost everything else.  They made promises to lure people to support them and flagrantly broke them.  That is what has happened in what I consider to be one of the most important aspects of government so far as rural Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> If we are to put into practice that part of the Constitution which prescribes that the maximum number of people will be maintained on the land, afforestation is one of the means by which that can be done.  We are very fond of talking of and bewailing the flight from the land.  That flight is taking place day after day.  The cutting down of the afforestation programme will increase it.</P>
    <P>Forestry work is one of the most useful kinds of employment that can be given in rural areas.  Investment in afforestation is not like any other investment.  I do not mind what advice the Minister has received from officials of the Department of Finance, the directors of the Central Bank or any other body.  I maintain that the safest possible investment at present in this country is to plant something that will increase in value day after day.  That is something that cannot be said of practically any other form of Government investment.  It is argued, and it is true, that afforestation is a long-term investment.  That is agreed. This generation would feel proud and very grateful if some Government 25, 30 or 45 years ago had planted a fairly substantial acreage of forests which could have been handed over to the Irish Government on its establishment. We would say of such a Government that they were not afraid of the future, that they were not afraid to sink money in one of the soundest investments in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that he is certainly taking a retrograde step when he decides to cut down on afforestation.  It may be argued that the supply of plantable land is slow in coming in.  It is slow while we are prepared to pay only a shabby, mean price for land.  We are asking those who are making a living on the land to sell it to the State for a shabby price.  These people are not fools. When they sell land to the State they are parting with their means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Flynn and other Deputies, I take it, would have us acquire land compulsorily, I would not favour such a course.  There is only one thing to do to secure plantable land, <Col N="35" /> and that is to give a good price.  If the price has not been altered in the last 12 months, it is a shabby price and it is definitely keeping many farmers from closing with the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Grant-in-Aid for land acquisition is up by £15,000.  That is a very poor gesture indeed.  The acquisition of land is the foundation stone of forestry work and expansion and there is no use in impeding progress by not having sufficient staff to deal with acquisition and by paying a price which will deter people who would otherwise sell land to the Department from closing the deal.  An Act was passed within the last five or six months for the improvement of what is known as the undeveloped areas. Building factories in towns is an ideal thing, and I should like to see it go ahead.  At the same time, I do not want to see the rural part of Ireland neglected.  While the Undeveloped Areas Act will do a certain amount of good by providing factories in towns, it is also necessary to prevent the flight from the land.  That Act will not prevent the flight from the land.  It might in some cases only hasten or accelerate it.  If we want to keep the people in the countryside, if we want to do what Goldsmith wrote about, to maintain our peasantry, we must bring the work to their doors; we must induce them to stay on the land.  Will anyone show me a better means of doing that than by afforestation?  At the same time, afforestation will leave a crop behind it which will be improving in value year by year.</P>
    <P>I have been eight or nine years in this House and I have not ever heard any proposal to check the flight from the land which is better than afforestation. We must admit that afforestation is a crying need in this country.  In 1950-51, the last year the inter-Party Government were in office, something like £8,000,000 was paid for timber and wood products imported from foreign countries.  I am sure, if the Minister had any means of finding it out, that the figure was even more than £8,000,000 last year.  That will continue because our reserves of matured commercial timber must be going down. <Col N="36" /> If in our generation we do not do anything to replace these reserves we will lay ourselves open to condemnation by posterity.</P>
    <P>In those areas where new forest centres were established, particularly along the west coast from Donegal to Kerry, they met with the complete approval of the people, particularly the younger generation from 18 to 40 years of age.  They saw at once the advantages to be derived from the development of afforestation.  The sum provided in this Estimate for afforestation is something less than £1,000,000, and £1,000,000 out of £101,000,000 which we are to spend this year is a very small sum for such an important Department.  No matter what pressure was brought to bear on the Minister, he should not have yielded to pressure to cut down the Forestry Vote.  Whatever other Vote was cut down, he had no right to yield to the slashing of this Vote by almost £250,000.  It is a serious injustice to the country.  The Minister has failed very seriously in regard to one of the most important aspects of his Ministry by allowing the Vote to be cut down. I do not know how he feels about it, but if he yielded easily to that cutting down, he certainly has been guilty of a gross misdemeanour as a Minister. He should not have yielded.  If money had to be saved, it could have been easily saved in other directions.  The axe should not have been allowed to fall on such an important matter as afforestation.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made about the grant of £10 per acre.  Some Deputies seem to have a completely erroneous idea of what that £10 is for.  I should like to see that grant increased.  It was my intention, if I were in office when fencing material was available and when the privately-owned nurseries would be in a position to supply plants to those who wanted them, to increase that grant as an added inducement to private owners of land to put down even one statute acre of timber on their land.  In that connection, we must remember that the bog plots attached to holdings provided by the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission in days gone by are being rapidly cut away.  I am puzzled <Col N="37" /> to know what method of heating and cooking is to take the place of turf when these are all cut away.  I am reliably informed that the materials necessary for protective fencing of plantations is now plentiful again. I therefore urge the Minister to increase the grant and also to bring to the notice of landholders the wisdom of and, perhaps, the necessity for putting down at least one acre of timber on some waste corner of their land.  Even on the best corner, it would be an acre of land very well employed and would pay handsome dividends in time.</P>
    <P>While we have an abundance of bog land in some areas, the smaller bogs in other areas are being rapidly cut away.  No smallholder of land, in my opinion, will be able to stand up to the cost of buying fuel, whether it be turf, coal or timber, because it would run from £35 to £50 per year for the average small holding of from £7 to £20 valuation.  That is a sum which the average smallholder would not be able to bear and the result, in my opinion, will be a further flight from the land and a further depopulation of the small holdings.  Now is the time to advise these people and put this problem before them as I did while I was in the Department.  I would sweeten the pill somewhat by increasing the grant by £2 or £3 or even £5 per acre so as to induce them to put down their own plantations.</P>
    <P>Might I say to Deputies who have been advocating that the provision of shelter belts should be a function of the Forestry Department that I would not like to see that happening?  If we burden the Department with the problem of providing shelter belts for every holding in the country the main job of afforestation will go by the board.  The Forestry Department was never intended for that.  The county committees of agriculture are very suitably staffed for that particular kind of work and it is a very useful kind of work.  These shelter belts break the monotony of what would otherwise be a barren countryside and they provide a useful shelter for houses.  The county committees of agriculture are the people to facilitate <Col N="38" /> farmers who want to provide themselves with shelter belts.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that point I want to draw the Minister's attention to paragraph V of the summary and recommendations in the Cameron Report which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A new acquisition programme should be developed, and approved by the Board of Review.  This programme should resolve the conflicting demands for land use and, in so far as the commercial forestry programme is concerned, it should include the primary requirement for establishment of forest area aggregations of not less than 3,000 acres. To facilitate the acquisition of commonage areas, expropriation proceedings should be taken in cases where 75 per cent. of the holders of commonage rights are agreeable to sale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to have the Minister's private opinion on that.  I have my own opinion, but I do not propose to give it now.  The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ceiling purchase price for plantable land should be raised to £12 per acre with a proviso for higher purchase prices on approval by the cabinet Board of Review.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fully agree with him that the price for plantable land should be increased and I want to impress on the Minister the absolute necessity of such an increase.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is aiming at a very high figure for Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; £172,000 as against £160,000.  I should like to know if he is aiming at that figure because of the increased price for timber sales in the saw mills or is he basing it on an increased sale of timber.  We have a good deal of mature timber all over the country, mostly on lands purchased from time to time by the Department, and, while I do not claim to be an expert, my view is that some of that timber may very easily go past maturity and have little value except as firewood.  I suggest that a visit to the saw mill in Dundrum erected some time ago would give the Minister a completely new slant on what I would describe as the profitable side of the <Col N="39" /> Forestry Department.  Every one of us in the House and outside is too fond of looking at the Forestry Department as a Department which is costing a lot of money and doing little good beyond putting down plantations and giving a certain amount of employment.</P>
    <P>There is a vast amount of mature timber on State forest lands and I want to impress on the Minister that that timber should not be allowed to go past maturity into the firewood stage for want of up-to-date saw mills to convert it and to give it to the people who are anxious to get it and to pay a reasonable price, and a good price, at present.  Shortly before the change of Government, Shelton Abbey was purchased and there were something like 700 acres of timber attached to it, most of which was matured.  I hope that for the sake of saving a few pounds on whatever the erection of a well equipped modern saw mill to saw that timber up and give it to the people who want it, people who are willing to pay a good price for it, would cost, that timber will not be allowed to fall into the firewood stage, as might very easily happen.  I should like to know from the Minister how much of the £172,750 will be realised by an increased price for timber, the Order for which he gave some time last September or October, as he informed me in a reply to a question before Christmas.</P>
    <P>As regards Avondale, could the Minister let us know what is happening about the proposed transfer of the forestry centre from Avondale to Shelton Abbey?  Avondale is hopelessly small for the accommodation of forestry trainees at present.  It has certain advantages that Shelton Abbey will not have, in the matter of the provision of suitable ground, plantations and so on, but that can be easily met and it should not be regarded as a reason why the whole school should not be transferred to Shelton Abbey, since Avondale has served its purpose and, the family being now grown up, so to speak, is not now capable of housing them. Shelton Abbey was purchased largely because of the splendid accommodation <Col N="40" /> the house offered.  That was one of the reasons which weighed heavily in the acquisition of Shelton Abbey from the Earl of Wicklow a couple of years ago.  I hope these trainees will be transferred as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope, also, that the Minister will establish what I proposed to establish, a research institute attached to the Forestry Department.  As our forestry acreage grows, problems will crop up, because the new forest acreage is bound to bring its own diseases and pests, the same as any other crop.  The country is free of them at present, and we have a perfectly virgin soil to work on.  I think I am correct in saying that our forests at present are completely free from pests and diseases of any kind.  We should have a research institute which would be ready to pounce on any stranger that might come in, and, seeing that transport and travel are so quick at present, it would not surprise me to find some disease that was not known any nearer than Canada or Labrador had broken out here, which would do immense damage to our forests in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>There is no controlling of these pests, because there are 1,000 and one ways in which they can travel.  The very elements favour them at times, and people travelling and the conveyance of merchandise facilitates them.  We are free so far.  That is my information up to last year, and, as we are free, the way to maintain that freedom is by the establishment of a research institute ready to pounce on any intruder who comes in here and to wipe him out before he has time to get a foothold rather than spending millions in trying to eradicate some pest or disease after it has got a foothold.  There are many other things such a research institute could do which are absolutely necessary if we are to tackle the problem in a proper way, but the one thing that scares me stiff is the thought that we might not be prepared to meet any kind of danger that might threaten our forests in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I have raised by parliamentary question on two occasions.  In some areas, a difference of wages exists, due to the fact that forestry workers' wages are <Col N="41" /> coupled with the local county council rate.  Where a forest centre lies across the border of two counties, serious discontent is caused.  There is one area I have in mind, portion of which is in my constituency, the Cong Forest. Workers all over County Mayo are getting £4 per week, while workers in County Galway are getting only £3 12s. 6d.  These are the two county council rates.</P>
    <P>The workers in the Cong forest who work in the County Mayo portion receive £3 12s. 6d., and they feel that they should get what their neighbours in Lough Carra, Doolough forest and other centres are getting, £4.  For the sake of the few hundred pounds which it would cost, the Minister should remove this discontent by giving the higher rate in the whole forest area. It is not an unreasonable demand and it is not a demand that will involve the Minister or the Department of Finance in huge sums.  The cost of the removal of this discontent would more than pay for itself in the contentment created and the better output brought about. It would also show a little generosity and would show that the Department and the Minister are not out to chisel down the wages of these men, or to catch them by means of what they might think is a cheap trick.  It is something which, in the tying up of forestry workers' wages with county council wages, did not occur to us until it cropped up later.  At that time an increase in wages was absolutely necessary and it was done.  It does not exist except in two or three forest centres over the country.  To spend the few hundred pounds which would wipe out that disconent would be a generous gesture on the Minister's part and nobody could grumble at it.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to deplore the cutting down of the forestry programme. If we want to stop the flight from the land we will have to bring industries of some kind into the rural areas.  It is a fine thing to bring industries into rural towns, but we must bring them to the country places which are miles from any town.  If you do not establish them, in 40 or 50 years you will have a completely depopulated land and all the population of the country <Col N="42" /> living in towns.  Then it will be too late.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be well aware that the flight from the land is heaviest where the quality of the land is poorest.  That is very plain to be seen.  I am sure that in the recent by-election compaign in North Mayo the Minister saw houses tumbled in, houses that a few short years ago sheltered happy, contented families.  This has been happening, so much so during the last 20 years that I would say that some villages have been wiped out by 50 per cent.  If the cause for this were a war or something over which the Government had no control, we would all be completely unanimous in saying that it was nothing short of a national disaster.  Yet it is happening under our noses.  It is happening to houses here, there and all over the place. Slowly the people are moving off the land.  The reason is that the income from a small-holding is not fit to maintain a family at the present time. Taxes, rates and every other expense have gone up, and that is something over which the people have no control. The only thing they can do when they find themselves on the wrong side of the ledger is to clear out.</P>
    <P>We can do away with that state of affairs to some extent.  I do not say that we can provide a complete cure-all for this malady, the flight from the land, which is so serious, but forestry properly carried out and driven hard into these areas would do a lot to stop it, and maintain what any country's boast should be: a happy, contented peasantry.  Any cut in the Forestry Vote will have an adverse effect.</P>
    <P>I do not make any secret of the fact that I was proud of the strides forestry made during the three years I was with the Department.  My earnest hope was to be there long enough to put forestry on a firm, solid footing. One thing which causes me grievous disappointment and dismay is to find the Vote cut down and chiselled away. The Minister is guilty of a very serious misdemeanour when he allows that to happen.  He should not have allowed it to happen.  He should have increased that Vote and kept on increasing it until the forestry programme reached <Col N="43" /> 25,000 acres, or even 20,000 acres.  The Minister knows quite well that there were plans in his office for planting 19,800 acres in one year alone.  The Minister may say that that is grand for one year, but that there will be no plantable land if it continues.</P>
    <P>I would not take that for an answer.  The Minister has two means of getting land; to give a price for it, and secondly to give the Department sufficient acquisition officers to deal with the acquisition of land.  I will not ask him to do it all of a sudden because he cannot do it.  I would not be so unreasonable as to ask him to do so, but inside three or four years he could hit the 20,000 acre programme quite easily if he just faced up to the job of work.  I do not say that for the purpose of blaming.  I say it for one purpose: to bring home to the Minister as forcibly as I can the usefulness of this side of the work of his Department.</P>
    <P>It will be very serious if he intends to be slack about that.  The Forestry Department can get all the land they want.  They have plenty of nurseries and a staff in the Department which is second to none in the State.  I never met one person there who was not boiling over with enthusiasm to get on with his work.  I am safe in saying that many of them did overtime for which they never got a penny pay but which they did out of sheer downright enthusiasm. In what branch of the Civil Service covering the whole 13 Departments do we find that except in the Forestry Department?</P>
    <P>The Minister should definitely increase the Estimate instead of reducing it.  He can find plantable land, and I have told him the way to do it.  That is the method I used.  When I took up that office the ceiling was just half what I think it is at the present time. There was one acquisition officer to deal with the intake of land by the Forestry Department in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, to deal with title and with all the slow tanglesome matters which have to be dealt with before land can be transferred from an owner or owners to a Department.</P>
    <P>It is not good that in the short space <Col N="44" /> of a 12-month the Minister can go back on all the promises which were made if not by himself at least with his authority by his Party when they were seeking power last year.  An afforestation programme was one of the principal points in the famous 17-point programme. They have gone back on that. The people of the country were led at that time to believe and we, the members of the Opposition, understood from the programme that they meant to carry out this 25,000 acre development. You walk in here, however, and within a year you calmly tell us that you have cut the programme by half and cut the Estimate by £250,000.  If that is going to create a healthy atmosphere in the country, I know very little about politics and I must go to school again.  If people who seek and get the responsibility of forming a Government and running the country treat their promises in that way, I am afraid that I for one do not know anything at all about trying to live up to my promises.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick, I suppose, is not trying to provoke me; but whether he is or not, I find that his remarks make it necessary for me to go into matters in somewhat more detail than might otherwise have been necessary.  I think he stated last year on the Estimate that the Department should not try to do more planting than their capacity would permit.  In the previous year, I remember, he stated that he did not take it on himself to give directions in technical matters: &ldquo;I am not a forestry expert, and I leave all these things to the Department.&rdquo;  The suggestion is that I, in some way, have been badgered or bullied by the Minister for Finance or by the Department of Finance into cutting down the Estimate under certain sub-heads.  There is no foundation whatever for that allegation.  The Estimates are prepared on the basis of consultation between the staff of the Forestry Division of the Department and myself.  With the best information available to me, there is no reason whatever why I should submit, if I were asked to do so, to any cut in the Forestry Vote.  I would not do it, and I dislike the attempts that have <Col N="45" /> been made in this debate to suggest that I should be singled out or that I would subject the work of the Forestry Department to some arbitrary cut.  There has been no cut whatever by the Government in respect to capital projects generally.  They have taken the position as they found it and they are carrying on these projects to the uttermost extent that our resources permit.  We propose to continue and expand these projects where necessary. That being the position, it is quite inconsistent and obviously false to suggest that the forestry programme has been selected and has been picked out for special attention by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain to the Deputy if he has a little patience. Before I come to that point, I want to say something with regard to the acquisition staff.  The number is now 12.  There has been an addition of four inspectors, grade 1, since I took office and, if further inspectors are necessary, they will be appointed.  I am of the opinion that so far they are covering the country fairly well and that the results are as good as can be expected.  We have not increased the price of land during the past 12 months.  We have not attempted to go out into the market and pay the price that is ordinarily expected, the market price that has been increased owing to the high prices for agricultural produce, etc.  That is a matter that is under constant consideration. It is of great importance but in my opinion it is not possible for the Forestry Division to pay the price that is ordinarily fetched by land that is of a semi-agricultural or semi-arable type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, if the land is suitable for agricultural purposes, there is the big question of national policy as to whether the forestry division would be justified in trying to acquire it.  Secondly, as the Deputy understands, if the land is acquired for Land Commission purposes, then the Land Commission requirements must take priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about land of that kind.  We are talking about ordinary offers by tenants to the Forestry Department.  I do not see why the market value should not be paid for it.  I do not see why tenants who part with their land to the Department should not get as much for it as they would get in the open market.  That is clearly side-stepping it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated by Deputy Esmonde that the present rate of grants to farmers for planting purposes had been unaltered for a period of 25 to 30 years.  That of course is not correct.  It was altered in 1934, and 1945 when the amount of the grant was increased to £10 per acre&mdash;£5 after six months and the remaining £5 after five years.  This big increase in the amount of the grant was designed to meet the increased cost of plants, fencing material, etc., brought about by emergency conditions.  At the present moment we are re-examining the whole grant scheme.  It may be possible to recast it further but I am not in a position to make a definite announcement at the moment.  With reference to the suggestion made by Deputy Desmond that the Department is not safeguarding the rights of the public in not taking steps to see that moneys expended through these planting grants to private individuals is not wrongfully expended, I should like to say that planting grants are not paid until the Department satisfies itself by an inspection of the planting areas concerned and that the second instalment is paid only after five years on a second inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question asked by many Deputies was why the Department does not take smaller areas of land than the 300 acres basis for a forestry <Col N="47" /> centre?  The reason is that the opening of a new forestry centre is going to impose a certain financial and administrative liability on the State.  We have to see that the work in that centre will, as far as possible, be a continuous project.  The cost of the necessary stakes and rabbit fences is extremely high in the case of small areas. Assuming perfect squares, the cost of fencing one acre is four times as much as the cost per acre of fencing 16 acres. Furthermore, the cost per acre of supervision is inversely proportional to the size of the centre.  As it is, the average emoluments of a forester come at the 300-acre basis to at least £1 per acre.  The area which one forester can supervise adequately is about 3,000 acres, and the ideal situation would be, even if there is a distance of a few miles between one plantation and another within the particular forest area for which he is responsible, that he should be responsible for at least 3,000 acres.  The average size of all the present State forests is about 1,500 acres.  Up to recently, 300 acres were considered to be the minimum economic initial block, but within the past few years, since the plantable land survey has indicated where additional acquisitions may be expected to accrue, it has become not unusual to start with smaller blocks provided (1) that the block is one in which there is a reasonable proportion of plantable land, and (2) that preliminary inquiries show that there are good prospects of being able to acquire such additional lands as will bring the total for the centre up to 300 acres or more.</P>
    <P>What is really in question in setting up a new forest centre is the potential gross output of the block.  If the prospects are favourable, it may be possible to start with a comparatively smaller area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the acquisition and the building up of a plantable reserve, which is necessary, all experts agree, I should like to inform the House that in 1935 there were 18,000 acres acquired representing 42 purchases, or an average of 400 acres each; in 1952 we acquired 19,000 acres, representing 168 purchases of 162 acres each.  The total <Col N="48" /> plantable area that we acquired last year was 15,000 acres, including the large purchases at Kinnitty and Shelton Abbey.  Excluding these, the average works out at 125 acres per purchase.  At the present time purchases which are in the hand of the Chief State Solicitor work out at an average of only 67 acres.</P>
    <P>A Deputy expressed surprise when I said that even to accomplish the target of 12,500 acres it would be necessary to bring into this year's planting programme about 3,000 acres which the branch has not yet taken possession of.  The reason for this is that the plantable reserve has always been so bad that for many years the Department has had to include in the planting programme lands which came in barely in time to have them prepared, fenced and planted during the season.</P>
    <P>For example, in 1950-51 there were at least three cases in which the land was acquired as late as August and up to the end of September, and in 1951-52, lands which were acquired in August and in October of last year and even in February of this year, had to be included in the planting programme.</P>
    <P>The first public pronouncement regarding this 25,000 acre programme which Deputy Blowick speaks of, and for which I cannot find any authority at all from the technical officers responsible to me: the first reference to it appeared in a document which did not issue from the Forestry Branch. The document was issued by the Minister for External Affairs as a White Paper to E.R.P. on the 20th December, 1948.</P>
    <P>That was the first public statement, so far as I know, regarding the 25,000-acre programme.  The Department of Lands know nothing officially about it. No official authorisation had been given by that Department to that programme, and it was only during the following year that the then Minister, now sitting on the other side of the House, stated to the Forestry Division that &ldquo;the Government had adopted a planting programme of not less than 25,000 acres.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the debates on the Estimate in April, 1949, the then Minister stated that the necessary transplants must be available before the necessary stocks could be raised to enable this programme to be carried out. He stated that the purchase of land must in the meantime be stepped up by at least 30,000 acres per annum, and that it would be preferable to increase the rate for the next three years to 50,000 acres or thereabouts.  The total plantable reserve at the present time, as last year, is only in the neighbourhood of 30,000 acres.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for the year 1951-52 were originally drafted in relation to a programme of 25,000 acres.  Why then were they reduced to 20,000 acres which, as events show, in spite of the most extreme pressure being put upon the Forestry Branch to enable them to go beyond what they, as reasonable men, thought possible and practicable, and in spite of the greatest possible efforts carried on at a later period of the season with the aid, of course, of mechanical preparation?  Nevertheless, not more than 15,000 acres was possible of achievement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the reasons why it was not possible for the Forestry Branch to carry out a programme greater than 12,500 acres.  I explained, <Col N="51" /> in my opening statement, that thinning operations which should have been carried out systematically on a fairly large scale for many years past has been neglected, had been put aside, and that there were very heavy arrears of work to be carried out.  Those who are acquainted with forestry know that these sylvicultural operations and the maintenance of forests in proper condition, so as to get the maximum output in valuable timber at the end of the rotation, take precedence of replanting and must be attended to unless serious loss is the result.</P>
      <P>The fact is that, at the present time, very large blocks of land, 300 and 400 acres, are in urgent need of treatment for thinning.  These blocks must be dealt with and, at the same time, the whole stand of timber must be treated concurrently.  You just cannot take up work to-day and leave it again tomorrow. If your aim to get the best return in commercial timber at the end of the rotation is to be achieved, you have to see that the thinning operations are carried out regularly. These large blocks of timber, which require thinning, are coming in yearly or in alternate years in a good many of our forest centres, and they have to be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I made was that the reserve of plantable land was insufficient. I need not worry Deputies by calling their attention to the fact that Mr. Cameron, the expert, again adumbrated the principle in his report that you must have a three years' reserve in hand if you are going to make progress and if you are to have continuity.  If you are going to accept the position that, for political or other reasons, you are going to swell your programme arbitrarily by putting into it an effort that might be more wisely expended in other directions and not get the result you would get by approaching the problem from the point of view of having continuous progress over a period of years: if you are going to adopt that kind of thing to bolster up a programme, one year for political or other reasons, then face a decline next year, and then bolster it up again, it means that you <Col N="52" /> are not going to give the country the return that should be given through forestry operations.</P>
    <P>I propose to show convincing evidence to the ordinary Deputy that it is not possible to do what Deputy Blowick pretends to believe was possible, that was to get 20,000 acres planted last year.  I have a list here of a number of centres which were pressed to plant more last year than they would have planted normally in two, three, four or even five years.  In one case, 430 acres were planted, leaving a plantable reserve to date of only 540 acres.  In another case, 356 acres were planted, leaving a reserve of 631; in another case 331 were planted, leaving 301; in another case 337 were planted, leaving 310; in another case 498 were planted, leaving 812.  In another case, in an area which Deputy Desmond probably knows, 835 acres were planted last year, leaving a reserve of 67 acres in hand for future operations.  In another area, not very far away from that, 596 acres were planted, leaving 553 in hand.  In another area 397 were planted, leaving 241 in hand, and in another area 467 were planted, leaving 401 in hand.  The total for all those areas showed 4,247 acres planted, and the total reserve left in the nine centres was only 3,856 acres.</P>

      <P>It tells us that we cannot continue to give employment in those areas, when we have planted them up, during the period which must elapse until thinning operations take place.  What is the use of talking about giving employment, about stopping the flight from the land, if we are going to plant up, as the Deputy would have us do and apparently thinks is the right national policy, the reserves which we have within two, three or four years, when we will have nothing to continue the work after that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another summary here.  We have 150 centres and in about 22 there is scarcely any work on hands or any prospect at the present time.  That is largely due to the fact that last year, in most if not all of those centres, the plantable reserve that existed about then was absorbed almost completely, leaving nothing for future development.</P>
      <P>There is another number of centres, about 60 or more, where prospects are good, because we have reached the position where thinning operations are going on or even if planting stops and additional land for planting is not available, nevertheless other operations will mean that the amount of employment which was given in the area can be continued.  In a good many of these areas, it is to the thinning operations and the ordinary forest operations rather than to planting that we shall have to look, I fear, to keep up the level of employment.  There is an intermediate number of centres, perhaps about 50 or more, where, as in the case of the 22 centres where very little is being done at present and very little in prospect, while we cannot say they are quite as bad as these, nevertheless the prospects are not at all favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the House that if we are to have a planting programme it must take cognisance of the fact that we have a labour corps attached to each of these forest centres and if we mean to have progressive afforestation we must have a programme that will aim at keeping these in employment regularly and continuously, and if possible, increasing the amount of employment.  There is no use in a forest policy that aims at going into an area and, by mechanical ploughing or otherwise, planting up some hundreds of acres, then have the same thing the following year and the same thing the year after that, until that reserve is exhausted and there is no employment in sight until such time, twelve or fifteen years later, when operations may start again.  I do not think any forester would agree for a <Col N="54" /> moment that that policy is reasonable or wise in any respect.  If Deputy Blowick or Deputy MacBride or anyone else wish to put that before the people as their policy, we are quite prepared to answer that and to show that it is a false and misleading policy, that it has not the true interests of the country at heart and that it would simply mean that after a year or two forestry operations would break down altogether.</P>

      <P>Deputies are criticising the reductions in the amounts provided under certain sub-heads in the Vote. They forget what I specifically called attention to in my opening statement, that the capital and constructional expenditures last year were based on the assumption that a planting programme of 20,000 acres would be undertaken. Such a programme was entirely beyond the realms of possibility.  It was not possible to achieve it, and therefore the provisions for labour in the 1951-52 Estimate were out of perspective.  I am being candid and frank and, I hope, honest, with the House and the people in saying that 12,500 acres is the target, that the Forestry Division tell me that is the utmost they have a reasonable prospect of achieving this year; nevertheless, the total provision for labour is at least £9,000 more than it was last year, when my predecessor told us he had a programme for planting 20,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not down from £181,000 to £135,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of wages has increased during the year, and if the rate of wages should increase further and it should be necessary to make adjustments, or if it is found that the provision for labour under any of the appropriate headings is not sufficient, <Col N="55" /> I am quite prepared to introduce a Supplementary Estimate, as was done last year when the original provision was found to be insufficient.</P>
      <P>I pointed out yesterday, in reply to Deputy Sweetman, that, in sub-head C 2 (3) there is provision for materials, £50,000, for wire netting.  The Estimate this year provides for almost a normal supply of materials.  Last year the expenditure on materials for stockpiling was charged as capital expenditure. This year, it is being described as normal constructional expenditure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick thinks the increase of £15,000 is not sufficient for acquisition. If it is not sufficient, and if sizable areas of land, for which we have not made provision, should come in during the year, we shall look for the additional provision.  I should like to remind the House that last year we purchased two large properties&mdash; Shelton Abbey and Kinnity Castle, with the surrounding lands.  They cost us very substantial sums of money. Whether they will justify entirely what they cost us is not for me to say. I am afraid I am rather soft-hearted in these matters and I should prefer at the moment not to express an opinion.  The provisions for acquisition, nurseries, maintenance and the conversion of timber have all been increased.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the fact that the Department's forestry staff are, in the main, unestablished.  That question is one in regard to which the Department have always been very sympathetic but there are a number of difficulties in the way.  Most of those difficulties have been overcome and I am glad to be able to say that a solution is in sight.  A decision has been taken, in principle, that the forester grades are to become established and I hope it will be possible to take the necessary steps to give effect to that decision in the Autumn. Deputies may rest assured that there will be no avoidable delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of Deputies, I should like to say that the costings of the manual preparation and planting of land work out at about £16 to £20 per acre whereas the mechanical preparation <Col N="56" /> and manual planting of land costs about £10 per acre.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick admitted when he was responsible for this Estimate in former years that due to the attractive prices for land and the prosperity of agriculture the Department were being forced back more and more on very inferior and very bad land.</P>
    <P>The inspector's report on some of the land that we are being offered at the present time is that it is &ldquo;deep, soggy, fibrous peat with large areas of quagmire and innumerable pools&rdquo;.  I shall give the House now, as an example of the type of land he has been asked to inspect for afforestation purposes, the opinion of an inspector which will meet with the general approval of those who are interested in the progress of forestry as a serious proposition from the national point of view.  He said that we would not be justified in going ahead with acquisition until the inferior type of land offered has been scientifically evaluated on the experimental forests which have been established on similar ground. We have a number of these forests in the West.  The advice of the technical experts to me is that we ought to go cautiously in regard to the plantation of those areas, that we ought not to plant them up in a short period but over a period of time, watching the results and hoping that they will be favourable.  As soon as it becomes clear that the inspectors are satisfied that the results are favourable, we can proceed to plant very much larger areas of that type of very inferior land which, up to the present, was considered unplantable.</P>
    <P>Afforestation is not the only purpose for which these lands might be utilised. There are other purposes for which they might be utilised with, perhaps, greater advantage to the people in the area, greater advantage to the country and even, possibly, greater employment. For example, valuable experiments are being carried out at present in Kerry and in Galway by the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company for the production of grass from reclaimed bogland.  Apart from the land rehabilitation project, for many years the Department of Agriculture and the Land Commission have been encouraging <Col N="57" /> the reclamation of land in the congested areas and have met with a considerable amount of success.  With regard to the potentialities of high bog for turf development and for the development of electric power&mdash;leaving out agricultural or semi-agricultural purposes&mdash;we are, as the House is aware, entering on a very big phase of development.  The opinion has been expressed that in an area where very extensive development of bog is going ahead for an electric power station to be built in the area in some years' time, the cutaway bog area may be used there afterwards for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>An important point is that some of those districts, where large areas of bogland hitherto considered unplantable have been acquired for afforestation purposes, are very remote from centres of population.  It would be very difficult, especially if there is not a continuous programme of development, to hold out the hope to those who seek employment that they are going to find continuous work over a period of years. It would be very difficult indeed in some of those areas to find sufficient local labour.  If we go into those areas, being satisfied from the point of view of experiment that the possibilities are good and that wholesale expansion on a very large scale can be carried out, inevitably the question of providing accommodation for workers will arise. The workers will have to be drawn from the neighbouring areas or perhaps brought in from outside areas.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that I was rather exaggerating when I said that there was a shortage of labour in certain areas side by side with the fact that in certain districts, due to the shortage of a plantable reserve of land, we are in danger that we may have to lay off men during the coming or succeeding seasons unless the situation alters. In some of our best-known centres, due to the isolated areas in which the forests are located, it is difficult to get labour.  I have before me a reference to one forest.  &ldquo;Practically all the available labour has been absorbed into forestry employment, but, at that, we can find only 45 men out of an authorised staff of 60.  Large-scale <Col N="58" /> thinning and associated road-making absorb most of the labour force and although there is a pool of some 700 acres available for planting, the planting programme must necessarily be restricted in relation to the supply of labour available.  Serious damage to plantations can result from continued deferment of thinning once it becomes necessary and it would be contrary to the principles of good sylviculture to allow a programme of fresh planting to take precedence over such work.&rdquo; That is not the only area; in an important area west of the Shannon, where I was very hopeful there would be considerable expansion and where the prospects were very, very favourable, I find that only an average staff of 20 can be supplied where the desirable quota would be 32.  &ldquo;It is doubtful if the thinning programme for this year can be completed owing to shortage of staff, and overlong deferment of this work is highly undesirable.&rdquo;  That is the position in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>In a southern area the authorised labour staff is 30 men and 24 men are casually employed.  &ldquo;Shortage of labour has not been a significant difficulty up to the present, but next year's planting programme is situated at an isolated area, thinly populated.  Men cannot be expected to travel from the main centre to the new area, and it is feared that difficulty may be experienced in completing the programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the Cameron Report.  The Canadian expert recommended the establishment of 500,000 acres of commercial forest at planting rate of 11,750 acres per annum.  It is true that he also recommended there should be a social forest programme, but definitely as far as the commercial requirements of the country and the provision of our own needs from our own resources were concerned, he recommended a planting rate of 11,750 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is having regard to the needs of the country at the present time.  We hope to have a bigger population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The expert&mdash;I do not <Col N="59" /> know where he got the figures&mdash;estimates that our population might increase by 50 per cent.  With regard to the suggestion that expropriation proceedings should be taken where 75 per cent. of the owners of a commonage are prepared to sell, the forestry division has never looked with favour on a policy of compulsory acquisition of land.  We prefer, if possible, to acquire land with the goodwill of the people, and I think Deputies will generally agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I think it would be difficult to have a rule of thumb policy whereby we would take compulsory proceedings arbitrarily where a certain percentage of owners were willing to sell.  Actually, we get a great amount of assistance from the Land Commission and their inspectors in dealing with commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I would like to point out with regard to the argument that there should be a separate Department for forestry and a separate Minister&mdash;I am not going to offer my own opinion one way or the other&mdash; that there are certain advantages at present in having forestry closely associated with the Department which has the machinery, the organisation and experience that the Land Commission has for the acquisition of land.  It means that if large areas of land, which are not required for allotment among uneconomic holders are available, they can be transferred straightaway with the greatest goodwill and the least possible friction from the Land Commission to the Forestry Branch.  As Deputies will realise, very substantial areas of land have come in that way, but if we approach the problem on a different basis we would not have that advantage.  In any case, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, it is not really a question of appointing a Minister.  It is the question of the machinery, the organisation and the method of working that is in operation, in my opinion, rather than whether the head of the Department should be responsible specifically for it to the Dáil or, as some Deputies would think, the <Col N="60" /> forestry work should be administered under the control of a board such as Bord na Móna or the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn raised a number of points regarding lands in Kerry.  I think I can assure him that so far as the Lickeen case is concerned, although it is not quite completed, everything possible will be done to bring it to a conclusion.  With regard to another case in Milltown, where some years ago it was decided not to proceed because the area was rather limited in extent, only 98 acres, fresh inquiries are being made and possibly it may be taken over.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked me about research work.  The position is that this matter has been engaging the attention of the Department for some time.  In our opinion the most important field for research and experiment in the near future would be the assessment of our plantations and the analysis of annual income to determine the most suitable thinning cycles and in the cultivation of particular species on certain types of land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick asked me what was the position regarding Shelton Abbey and Avondale.  Final decisions have not been come to owing to difficulties which have arisen with regard to the premises at Shelton Abbey.  There has been no departure so far from the intention to provide alternative accommodation for the trainees.  We have two large buildings, Shelton Abbey and Kinnitty Castle, and both of these are in question. In the case of Shelton Abbey, there is the question of substantial reconstruction work at very heavy cost upon the building.  I have not come to a final decision yet as to whether we should proceed with the proposal to make Shelton Abbey a training school or whether we may not have to adopt an alternative.  All the aspects of the case will be carefully considered before any final decision is come to, and it will not be a question of submitting to the dictates of the Department of Finance.  It will be a question of what is best in the general interests of the forestry service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the forestry workers' wages in adjoining counties, where <Col N="61" /> workers on one side of a county boundary are being paid differently to workers on the other side, we are considering that question.  I am not in a position to make a promise.  My inclination is in favour of paying the same rate but I am not yet quite satisfied that we will not have anomalies in other directions.  When forestry workers' wages were linked with county council wages, some councils were paying higher rates than others and the forestry workers could claim they were doing the same type of work.</P>
    <P>The question may be raised later on of having a general rate, but my sympathy would be rather more for having all workers paid the same rate for the same type of work rather than having a differentiated one.  However, that matter is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick is very interested in the flight from the land.  I do not agree with him that forestry development alone will keep people at home who have been going for generations to England and Scotland as migatory labourers.  I have been acquainted with these people during my whole life time, and my firm belief is that nothing less than permanent industrial employment of a good and remunerative type will prevent them from emigrating. Perhaps, even the provision of such employment would not keep them at home.  As was pointed out recently, the attractions in Great Britain are not merely financial ones.  There are large numbers of our people congregated together in London, in Birmingham and such places at the present time so that those who emigrate will be certain of having a large circle of acquaintances.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by an independent authority, that is probably as big a factor as any other in inducing young people to leave this country.  The conditions under which they live at home appear very difficult to them, and when they realise that urban life provides cheap transport and other such amenities they are not inclined to remain in their native places where, probably, such amenities are not held out to them.  Since I went into the Department of Lands, I have seen files dealing with the acquisition of land for <Col N="62" /> afforestation purposes, and I notice that the young people are not staying in remote mountainy areas, though the older people may remain on in these areas for some time.  Perhaps I am wrong in saying that industrial employment alone will keep our young men and women in this country.  Maybe the making available of permanent employment as a result of afforestation, the reclamation of bogs or other reclamation work would do the trick.  In my opinion, the employment will have to be continuous, and the remuneration fairly good if we are to succeed in keeping them at home.</P>

    <P>Siad na seirbhísí is mó ar a dtráchtfaidh mé sa ráiteas seo ná na Tionscail Tuatha agus na Tionscail Mara atá dá seoladh faoi chúram na Fo-Roinne agus cúrsaí tithíochta faoi Achta na dTithe (Gaeltacht).</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Tionscail Tuatha taispeánann na mírchinn D. 1 go D. 11 go bhfuil laghdú de thuairim is chéad agus dachad-a-seacht míle, chúig chéad punt (£147,500) ar an soláthar i mbliana.  Má déantar, ámh, ar soláthraíodh anuraidh i leith stór-thiomsuithe a chur ar leataobh, chífear go bhfuil á sholáthar i mbliana, idir a bhfuil ag teastáil do na gnáth-riachtanais reatha agus d'athshlánú stór na n-abhar, tuairim is seachtó-cúig míle punt (£75,000) níos mó ná gnáth-sholáthar na bliana roimhe.  Is amhlaidh a tháinig ísliú ar na praghsanna d'olainn agus d'abhrais olainne ó anuraidh agus tuigfear, dá bharr sin, gur mó is fiú an soláthar breise ná a dhealramh.</P>
    <P>Déantar soláthar faoi mhírcheann D. 4. do cheannach maisínre do na tionscail bréidín agus cniotála.  Ar an soláthar atá ann tá tuairim is seacht míle punt (£7,000) do mhaisínre don mhuilinn sníomhacháin i gCill Chártha, Contae Dhún na nGall, míle punt (£1,000) do sheolta fíodóireachta <Col N="66" /> agus cheithre mhíle punt (£4,000) do mhaisíní agus striúdaí don tionscal cniotála.  Faoi mhírcheann D.7.  (4) tá soláthar eile do mhaisínre agus tá ann tuairim is míle, trí chéad punt (£1,300) don mhonarchain sa Spidéal, Contae na Gaillimhe, mar a ndéantar cloigne agus cabhail-pháirteanna cruaidh do na babóga a déantar sna monarchana eile bréagán a sheolann an Fho-Roinn.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar faoi mhírcheann D.5 do abhair déantóireachta do na tionscai cniotála agus bróidnéireachta agus do roinnt bheag abhras a bhíos ag teastáil do fhíodóireacht bréidín agus súsaí agus nach bhfuil ar chumas an mhuilinn i gCill Chártha a tháirgeadh.  Taispeánann an mírcheann laghdú mór ach baineann cuid mhaith dá ndúradh cheana i dtaobh stór-thiomsuithe leis an laghdú sin.  Is sa tír seo is mó a bhímid ag brath ar mhargadh a fháil, go háirithe don chniotáil, agus bhí an margadh sin go dona ar fad anuraidh. Coimeádadh na hoibrithe ar lán-obair a fhaid ab fhéidir ach sa deireadh bhí orainn cúngú éigin a dhéanamh ar an dtáirgeacht.  Ag féachaint dá bhfuil déanta chun allmhairí a theorannú, táthar ag súil le feabhas a theacht ar an margadh diaidh ar ndiaidh.</P>
    <P>Faoi mhírcheann D. 7 (1) déantar soláthar do na habhair déantóireachta a bhéas ag teastáil do na monarchana bréagán.  Tá laghdú de thuairim is aondéag míle punt (£11,000) ar an soláthar ach sé faoi ndear sin ná cúrsaí stór-thiomsuithe na bliana roimhe agus abhair de shórtanna atá nios saoire a bheith ag teastáil ón margadh.  D'ainneoin an mheatha a tháinig ar an margadh d'earraí eile le timpeall bliana anuas chuaidh an tionscal bréagán ar aghaidh go réasúnach maith agus bhí na fáltais uaidh anuraidh níos fearr ná a bhí an bhliain roimhe sin.  Mar sin féin, tá cúrsaí an mhargaidh ag éirí deacair go maith, go háirithe thar lear, agus beidh sé riachtanach níos mó aire ná riamh a thabhairt don mhargaíocht i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Soláthraítear don mhuilinn sníomhacháin faoi mhírcheann D. 8 agus do na plandaí físiúcháin agus críochnúcháin faoi mhírcheann D. 10.  Taobh amuigh den stór-thiomsú olainne dar soláthraíodh anuraidh, is féidir a rá go bhfuil <Col N="67" /> an soláthar d'olainn i mbliana i leith cúrsaí reatha níos mó ná an soláthar céanna a rinneadh anuraidh toise an olann gan bheith chomh dacr anois. Tá dul chun cinn maith sa tionscal bréidín agus tá ag éirí leis an bhFo-Roinn margaí nua tar lear a fhorbairt, go háirithe sna Stáit Aontaithe.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag soláthar faoi mhírcheann F.2 do Fhógránacht agus Poiblíocht i leith na dtionscal tuatha agus tá os cionn dhá mhíle punt (£2,000) breise dá chur ar fáil dóibh.  Tá an Fho-Roinn ag déanamh gach ar féidir chun táirgí na dtionscal a chur ar an margadh thar lear agus chun aon mhargadh dá bhfuil ann a choimeád agus a fhorbairt agus, ag féachaint do chúrsaí coimhlinte sa tír seo féin, tá gá mór le poiblíocht chun greim a choimeád ar an margadh.</P>
    <P>Tá laghdú de thuairim is míle, naoi gcéad punt (£1,900) ar mhírcheann F. 3. ach sé faoi ndear sin ná an méid a soláthraíodh anuraidh do stór-thiomsú abhar pacála.</P>
    <P>Is amach as Leithreasa-i-gCabhair a híoctar an chuid is mó den pháigh oibre a tuilltear ag an lucht oibre sna tionscail tuatha, taobh amuigh de na méideanna dá gcuntasaítear faoi na mírchinn D. 8. agus D. 10.  In ionad an nócha-ceathair míle, trí chéad agus dachad punt (£94,340) ar fad dar soláthraíodh mar sin anuraidh tá ochtó-hocht míle, chúig chéad punt (£88,500) ann i mbliana agus é bunaithe ar ar caitheadh go fíor anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Tionscail Mara is beag difríocht atá ar mhéid an tsoláthair i mbliana taobh amuigh den cheithre mhíle, sé chéad punt (£4,600), atá ann faoi mhírcheann E. 4 i leith cairrgín. Is amhlaidh atáthar tar éis imscrúdú a dhéanamh le tamall anuas i dtaobh a mbaineann le cúrsaí ullmhú agus margú an chairrgín agus ceaptar nár mhiste tabhairt faoi thurgnaimh a dhéanamh is féidir a raghadh chun tairbhe an tionscail.  Táthar ag leanúint de bheith ag cur slata mara ar fáil don Chuideachtain Tionscail Ailigionáide (Éire), Teoranta, ar leis an Stát an chuid is mó dá scaireanna agus ar di a leagadh ar bord na Dála i dtosach na bliana féilire seo na cuntais don bhliain dar chríoch an 30 Meán Fómhair seo tharainn.  Do hardaíodh bun-phraghas <Col N="68" /> na slata mara ó cheithre phunt deich scilling go cheithre phunt chúig scilling déag an tonna don séasúr seo thart.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithíocht déantar soláthar faoi mhírcheann H. 3 do na deontais a tugtar faoi Achta na dTithe (Gaeltacht) agus tá an méid céanna, seasca-haon míle, chúig chéad punt (£61,500) sa Mheastachán chuige sin i mbliana agus a bhí ann anuraidh.  Siad na háititheoirí tí féin a dhéanann cuid mhaith de na hoibreacha ar ina leith a ligtear na deontais agus tuigfear mar sin go mbrathann go mór ar na daoine féin an fhaid aimsire a caitear leis an obair chun íoc na ndeontas a thuilleamh. Beidh reachtaíocht ag teastáil sar i bhfad chun tuilleadh airgid a údarú faoi na hAchta agus táthar tar éis a bheith dá bhreithniú le tamall anuas ar chóir aon athruithe a dhéanamh anseo agus ansiúd iontu.  Beidh faill eile againn chun na cúrsaí sin a phlé. Tá obair na tithíochta ag dul ar aghaidh sásúil go maith agus, i láthair na huaire, tá tuairim is chúig chéad (500) tithe nua dá dtógáil agus dhá chéad go leith (250) dá bhfeabhsú.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú de tuairim is deich míle, chúig chéad punt (£10,500) sa tsoláthar atá dá dhéanamh faoi na mírchinn A, D. 1, D. 2, E. 1, F. 1 agus H. 1 do thuarastail na bhfoireann éagsúla atá ag obair faoin Fho-Roinn.  Níl ach beirt ar fad de bhreis ar an uimhir daoine dá bhfuiltear ag soláthar agus sé is mó faoi ndear an t-airgead breise ná na breisithe tuarastail a deonadh an bhliain seo tharainn.  Chífear go n-iann figiúirí compráideacha na bliana sin méid nach mór chomh mór leis an méld a haistríodh ón Vóta do Bhreisithe ar Luach Saothair.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar dá chur ar fáil don chéad uair faoi mhírcheann I do obair fheabhsúcháin agus cothabhála Ionad Tionscail na Fo-Roinne.  Táthar ag súil gur fearr a féachfar i ndiaidh na hoibre sin an cúram a bheith faoin Fho-Roinn féin ná a bheith faoin Oifig Oibreacha Poiblí mar a bhíodh.</P>
    <P>Déileáltar faoi mhírcheann J. leis na fáltais i gCabhair an Vóta lena bhfuiltear ag súil.  San iomlán níl ach laghdú de thuairim is seacht míle, chúig chéad punt (£7,500) ar fhigiúirí na bliana roimhe.  Tá tuairim is cheithre mhíle, chúig chéad punt curtha isteach i mbliana do fháltais as cairrgín <Col N="69" /> a dhíol nach raibh i gceist an bhliain roimhe ach tá laghdú de thuairim is trí-déag míle punt (£13,000) ar an nglan-mhéid atá dá áireamh mar fháltais as na Tionscail Tuatha tar éis a n-íocfar astu i leith páighe na n-oibrithe agus coimisiúin dhíolacháin a thabhairt san áireamh maille le laghdú a déantar orthu chun cabhruithe le cúrsaí airgeadais na Fo-Roinne ó lá go lá.  Tríd is tríd, ba bhliain chorrach trádála a bhí againn sa tír seo an bhliain seo tharainn ach táthar ag súil leis go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an scéal sar i bhfad.</P>
    <P>I have already circulated a translation of the statement I have just made so I do not think it is necessary for me to refer to it in English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that we have reason to be disappointed with this Estimate.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed it was thought that there would be considerable development in these various services.  Some short time after the Parliamentary Secretary took office he circulated a statement intimating what he would do.  When one re-reads that statement now and compares it with the Estimate for this year the result is disappointing.  According to that statement, the Parliamentary Secretary was about to do this, that and the other.  There was hardly anything one could imagine that had not been conceived but, in spite of all the conceptions, the Parliamentary Secretary has brought forth very little.</P>
      <P>I shall read some of this statement to remind him now of all the things he had intended to do and to relate it to the Estimate he has now introduced:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In almost every area I visited the volume of emigration had increased very much in recent years and everywhere the necessity of making industrial employment available was impressed on me.  I believe that the introduction of the Undeveloped Areas Bill will be of considerable importance in this respect. The House will shortly have the opportunity of debating this in full.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This statement was issued prior to the introduction of the Bill dealing with the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" />&ldquo;The fuller and better utilisation of our natural resources was repeatedly stressed.  In this connection I believe that expansion and development of fisheries is of primary importance and I am actively in close co-operation with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, who is in charge of the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture.  I am paying particular attention to increasing the productivity of land in these areas&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, in the Gaeltacht area&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and with this end in view, the inter-departmental committee has under consideration the co-ordination of schemes under the ægis of different Departments and branches of Administration.  For example, the land division and rearrangement problem, particularly in Connemara and Mayo, has a detrimental effect on the proper utilisation of land and the deriving of benefits under land reclamation and other improvement schemes by tenants of rundale holdings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder was that paragraph written in all seriousness?  The late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, was twitted here by the Fianna Fáil Party when he tried to do something for that area.  What has the Parliamentary Secretary done for the area during the past 12 months?  Obviously he has done nothing.  I think we should at least have had from him to-day a statement as to what he intends to do in the near future.  What does he propose to do with the land in Connemara?  He referred to-day to subdivision.  Does he intend to further subdivide the land there?  What does he mean when he talks of subdivision of the land in Connemara?  What one should really aim at in that particular area is the enlargement of the present holdings. If that is done, what will happen to the people who are displaced?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A special sub-committee of the inter-departmental committee has been set up to undertake co-ordination of effort and pressing forward of land division and other improvement schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Land division down in Connemara!  I think it was a Galway Deputy who waxed eloquent in relation to Deputy Dillon's land project and referred to Deputy Dillon rolling the rocks in Connemara down into the sea. Apparently Deputy Dillon made an attempt to put the rocks somewhere. The Parliamentary Secretary does not say what he will do with the land in Connemara.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is hoped that many necessary, outstanding and desirable works, including marine works which have been under consideration in the special employment schemes office will be undertaken at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am interested in a little marine work and have been interested in it for a number of years past.  I had a parliamentary question down about it to-day. I had hoped that this work would have been undertaken years ago.  It might be interesting if I now read the reply I got to-day.  I asked the Minister for Finance to-day if agreement has been reached between his Department and the Donegal County Council as to the character of the marine works to be constructed at Portaleen for the accommodation of fishermen.  The answer I got was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The answer is in the negative, but it has been agreed that a hydrographic survey should be undertaken as a necessary preliminary to the formulation of any proposal for works in Portaleen.  It is hoped to carry out the survey within the next two months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a matter upon which I had hoped the Department of Finance and the Donegal County Council would have reached agreement long ago, and I was hoping that any day now work would commence.  Nothing has been done.  The Parliamentary Secretary was to be the great co-ordinator between all these Departments.  His would be the duty of turning on the tap to supply the steam needed to heat things up properly and get them going.</P>
    <P>The statement from which I was quoting goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I found an increasing demand for the extension of the rural electrification scheme to the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> Of course, rural electrification does not come within the Parliamentary Secretary's purview at all.  If he confines himself to the things that are really relevant and pertinent to his particular office he would of course be a real asset.  He should not interfere in matters that do not concern him. Rural electrification is being energetically pursued by those who have been appointed to deal with it, namely, the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The pamphlet goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As announced recently by the Tánaiste, the Government has decided to place in my charge the administration of Gaeltacht services and has appointed me Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in order to invest me with the necessary authority.  I believe there is room for improvement and expansion of these services.  The excellent standard of Gaeltarra Eireann products has made them outstanding in a highly competitive market, and it is my hope that increased output will make available to Gaeltacht residents opportunities of greater employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That paragraph is quite true.  For the last ten or 15 years the Department has revolutionised the production of the goods until now they are of the highest possible competitive quality. The spinners, dyers and weavers producing these goods are to be congratulated on the progress that has been achieved.  As a result of the disastrous 1914-18 war and the general economic slump, resulting in a total lack of demand for textile goods, we got into the habit of producing inferior stuff and destroyed the market until, ultimately, nobody would buy it at all.  I am glad that this marked improvement has taken place in these goods.  They are of the very highest and very finest quality.  There is one thing that the Parliamentary Secretary could do. There is nothing of more importance than to see that the goods produced are of the very highest quality and of the highest standards in design and quality.  If he does that, he will be doing a really good job for the Gaeltacht.  He should not be talking <Col N="73" /> a lot of nonsense that he is talking in this pamphlet.</P>
    <P>The pamphlet goes on to emphasise that the preservation and expansion of the language and of the Gaeltacht itself is of primary importance in the work of the office.  Let us be quite serious about this.  I have some contact with the Gaeltacht.  I know it for a long time.  It is one of the tragedies of my life to witness the continuing and continuous decline of the Gaeltacht, both the Fior-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  I do not see anything in this Estimate, that will stop that decline.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he has visited all these areas.  I hope he keeps his eyes open and sees what is going on there from day to day.  I hope that even this year he is taking note of the continuous and rapid drain of the young boys and girls from these districts.  As many as 600 of them have left these areas in one day and have crossed to England.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary going to preserve the Gaeltacht in Birmingham and Coventry?  Is that what he has in mind?  Or, is he going to tackle this enormous job that is involved here and that must be undertaken?  This Estimate will not do it.  It does not even make a beginning.  This Estimate in fact is retrogressive and shows no evidence of progress with regard to the promises the Parliamentary Secretary makes in that circular.</P>
    <P>There are the promises.  We come now to the achievements.  We have the Parliamentary Secretary telling us of the marked and very substantial decrease in the provisions for the Department this year.  He attempts to justify that by telling us that last year there were provisions for stockpiling. I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any practical knowledge of running a substantial business. While I have not been trained in Fords, I have some experience.  It strikes me that the amount of stock provided for here this year, or even last year, is not excessive even in normal times when one relates the cost of the raw materials for textiles to current world prices.</P>
    <P>While the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="74" /> ascribes the difference in the amount provided this year and the amount provided last year to stockpiling, he does not in fact indicate the difference in the price paid for wool in the year 1950 and the beginning of 1951 as against the price of raw wool for the current year.  According to Australian market reports, the price of Australian wool in 1951-52 as against 1950-51 shows a decline of approximately 50 per cent. Related to the number of bales sold in Australia and New Zealand for the two years, the price they got in Australian pounds is down by roughly 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary attempts to justify the sum provided this year as being equal to the sum provided for the year before, in order to confirm that statement and to give us evidence of the veracity of that statement, he should have given us the relative prices paid in the two years.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that has been troubling me for years.  These factories are soundly established now and surely we have reached the stage when we should introduce costings, to put them on a commercial basis.  Then the House and the country would know exactly how they were being run and how their costings related to comparable industries. This is a special division, not doing it on a commercial basis but making provision for congested areas and providing work for people there, but that is no reason why the industries should not be put on the very soundest commercial basis.  It would show private people engaged in the same business that we were not over-subsidising them out of their money and producing goods to compete with them in the market and also a desire on the part of the Department to be efficient.  It would show that they were not using the money of their competitors to subsidise them unnecessarily. We have reached the stage when it would be a good idea to have detailed costings with regard to these factories. When one looks at these figures with regard to wages and salaries, etc., apart from the salaries and wages of the employees from the manager down to the ordinary workmen, and relates these two things, it strikes one that it is exceedingly top-heavy, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I should like to go through these accounts in detail.  Materials are down by £100,000.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary could give us the quantity of either wool or yarn represented by that £100,000 in relation to the £200,936 provided for in 1951-52. In sub-head D (8), there is £96,274 provided for materials for spinning.  Is that raw material taken out of the item of £100,000 in D (5) or is that a duplication? I should also like to know what is the meaning of sub-head D (9). While these are only token sums, I do not see why they should be there.  They only inflate the Estimate and serve no purpose.  As to sub-head D (10) (1)&mdash; Materials for Dyeing and Finishing&mdash; does that relate simply to dyeing materials belonging to the dyeing department or has it anything to do with any of the other materials referred to in the other sub-heads?</P>
    <P>I now come to kelp and seaweed. For some years I had the hope that this could be developed as a substantial commercial item.  I had always hoped that it could be used in an unrefined way for feeding stuffs.  There is no doubt as to its feeding qualities for stock of all ages, from calves to cows, and for horses.  We have been told that we are to be limited with regard to the imports of feeding stuffs and, with the present price of maize and linseed oil, particularly linseed oil, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should put it to the technicians in the Department whether bulk supplies of this material could not be collected and sold in a raw condition to those mills which hitherto produced a compound feeding stuff for farmers.  They should be asked whether they could not make use of this material to raise the standard of the very poor quality of feeding stuff which they are now turning out. It would be a simple process to have a proportion of this material mashed up in a mill and a quantity of it added to these feeding mixtures which they are now producing.  It would enormously increase the feeding value of these feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>As it now stands, this whole branch is a purely nominal thing.  When you take the sum of £19,000 for the <Col N="76" /> purchase of kelp and seaweed and find a sum of £11,835 for costs for the handling of £19,000 worth, it seems out of all proportion.  I find it difficult to justify a transaction of that sort.  The transport and storage of it cost £8,000. One cannot help being coerced to the conclusion that the cost of salaries, wages, etc., is completely out of proportion to the amount of money produced by way of Appropriations-in-Aid. I seriously suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, as he is now, as it were, confined to this special branch, that the whole thing should be reorganised from top to bottom and an attempt made to put it on a sound commercial basis.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary, because this was a thing which was being built up.  But, now that it is established, we owe it to the taxpayers, especially now, when everybody finds it so very hard to live, that we should not unnecessarily waste any of their money. I am afraid that if you could get an ordinary taxpayer to analyse this Estimate, he would be very wrathful with this House for producing an Estimate of this kind, having regard to the amount of money spent on salaries, wages and allowances in relation to the Appropriations-in-Aid, that is to say the material produced.  The service rendered to the community, rather than the salaries paid, is the test of an organisation of this kind.  People think that all this money goes into the Gaeltacht and gives employment there, but that is not so.  Only a fraction of it goes there, and we should aim at sluicing the major portion of it into the Gaeltacht areas for the purposes for which it is voted.  A lot remains to be done in that respect.</P>
    <P>We have a central depot for marketing these goods, and perhaps it is an organisation which is indispensable, but, from the business point of view, it would be worth trying what other large manufacturers do with regard to the sale of their products, that is, to give persons who are experts in the marketing of textile goods the agency for these goods.  These are articles of the highest quality.  They are competitive in quality and, so far as I know, in price, and it should not be a difficult <Col N="77" /> matter to market them.  I wonder if the Department has considered approaching it on those lines which would dispense with this central depot for marketing them.  I cannot see what advantage this depot can have over a competent agent trained in the handling and marketing of textile goods.  These people have been trained in the textile business from the very bottom, and know all about it, and they would probably be keener than officers of this depot because there is a limit to the extent to which these officers can go.  They are, in the main, civil servants, and always have to keep in mind the fact that they are civil servants.  I suggest that it would be worth considering whether or not the marketing of these goods should be handed over to agents.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are agencies, but to what extent and in what capacity they act, I do not know.  The central marketing depot is here in the city, but I should like to know if the goods are in fact sold through agents, because there is a substantial item for commission set out here, and I take it that that is in respect of the sale of these goods.  I am curious to know where they come into the picture.  Are they the instruments of the central marketing depot?  Do they sell the entire goods in that central depot or do they sell some other products of the Department, such as those made in depots scattered throughout the country where a department teacher teaches girls to knit, to make gloves, socks and so on?  Is it such goods these agents dispose of or do they dispose of the entire products of the Department?  Are they a type of subagents who receive the commission set out here?  I make that suggestion for what it is worth because it would be quite futile for me to get up here and criticise unless I had some constructive suggestions to make.  There could be a substantial saving in the cost of the central depot and the marketing of these goods, and the Parliamentary Secretary could sluice back some of the money to the districts which were intended to benefit from the provision of these moneys.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that the Estimate shows a decrease.  When we <Col N="78" /> deduct the amount of money provided for the purchase of machinery this year for one purpose and another from the total, we find that the decrease is very substantial.  With regard to the wool in stock, most of it would not have been bought recently.  I take it that some of it would have been purchased last fall or early this year, and at the time the Estimate was prepared, wool had not fallen in price to the extent to which it has fallen now.  I should like to have an accurate figure from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the amount of wool represented by the £200,000 last year and the £100,000 this year and the price paid for it, so that we could get a clear view of the actual reduction in the Estimate this year as against last year.</P>
    <P>Kelp does not seem to show very much development either.  Is it that the people along the coast are not going in for this kind of work, that they think it too laborious, which in fact it is not? What is the position of the external market for sea rods, together with the internal position?  At one time, there were great hopes that these sea rods would be extensively used for the production of fertilisers and I should be interested to know what amount, if any, the fertiliser manufacturers are using now.  During the past year, the cost of fertilisers, owing to increased cost of wages, freight and insurance, jumped about 50 per cent., and if the Parliamentary Secretary could push up the amount of money involved in that sub-head, he would be doing very good work.  I do not see why that should not be done.  Young men in the Gaeltacht areas would in the evening when they are substantially free be far better off doing that job&mdash;if I may say so to them, and I am not afraid to say it&mdash;than slouching around the roads. There is nothing better for anybody no matter who than a good healthy hard bit of work.  Certainly they would be far better at that than stuck in a picture-house somewhere, in a poky hall with bad ventilation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the promises made by the Parliamentary Secretary on taking over this Department and the performance, I think that this House and the country cannot be anything but disappointed. It is the old ordinary Estimate <Col N="79" /> and indicates nothing but stagnation. No hope is shown in it under any one heading or any one sub-head, and I think we must really say that it causes disappointment, one might add bitter disappointment, in view of the promises made when the Parliamentary Secretary was specially appointed to take over these areas.  We had better just be honest and quite frank about this matter.  We should not go on codding ourselves or pretending to cod ourselves and pretending also that we are codding the country.  We may go on trying to cod the people but you cannot cod them.  It cannot be done and it will not be done.  We are not living 60, 70 or 100 years ago.  The young men and women of these areas are far too intelligent now.  They have a good education.  They read the papers and have the wireless.  They are just as keen as anybody anywhere else and more so because the conditions of their life make them so.  They have a keener, higher intelligence than other people I am not saying that by way of flattery.  The Department of Education would confirm that statement about them in relation to young people in the rest of the country.  The very conditions of their life make them keener and more intelligent.  Surely it is a piece of supreme codology for this House to attempt to make them believe that we are doing something for them, not only for now but with a long view, which will enable them to live a healthy life in reasonably constant employment and in the future give them a home in the area which the Parliamentary Secretary proclaims he is going to resuscitate, reanimate and re-emancipate. That is not in this Estimate and there is no sign of it.  Certainly I am not going to cod myself into believing that it is in order to flatter them or to get applause.  It is not in it.</P>
    <P>Some people, perhaps, would tell us that we are only wasting our time, that these people are inherently lazy, that there is no use in doing anything for them, because they will not do anything for themselves.  It is only roughly 150 years since they were driven from the good lands of Ireland into the hills and bogs of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry.  They were thrown there <Col N="80" /> helpless and penniless, and have eked out an existence through those years. They reared large families and gave them whatever education was available in the local national school.  They paid their debts, and if they were not fit to pay them while the children were being reared, they ran accounts, and when the children grew up and earned money, the money came back, and every penny of those accounts was paid.  They reclaimed the bogs of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Clare. Surely it is an insult to these people to tell them they are afraid of work, lazy, not worth doing anything for.</P>
    <P>No matter what anybody says, if we mean to preserve these people, if we are honest about doing anything for them, we must do it well.  No haphazard action will do.  To be employed for one month or two will not satisfy any young man or woman.  They do not demand good wages for a period, but they want continuous wages, so that young men and women can get married, build a home and have a continuing income with which they can rear, feed and clothe children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was long overdue in this country. For years it has been apparent that the population was drifting from the western seaboard and that the cities were becoming overcrowded.  It was obvious that if we were to take serious notice of this depopulation of the Gaeltacht something tangible would have to be done with a view to finding a solution to the problem. The appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was the first serious step ever taken towards that end.</P>
      <P>To my mind it was actually better than to set up a separate Ministry to deal with the Gaeltacht and the congested areas because he may not merely tackle the problem in a particular aspect, he has authority to coordinate the various Departments in so far as their work relates to the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  That in itself is better than to have separate Ministry, desirable as such might be, for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker made a case in <Col N="81" /> defence of the good type of people who occupy these areas.  I think that nobody has ever disputed that and that it is unnecessary to point it out.  The fact, however, that so many families have left these areas and that there has been a continual decline in the population over a large number of years brings us to the conclusion that something serious must be done if that decline is to be arrested in the future. The problem is of course entirely an economic one.  The people of those areas depend for a livelihood on a number of things.  All these people have little holdings none of which is capable in itself of supporting the large families which are very often brought up on them.  They must have some supplementary income if they are to continue to live in those areas.  That is exactly what the problem means.  Not merely do they need to be taught and given an opportunity to get the most out of the small-holdings they have but the small industries which exist in these areas and the potential industries which might be set up there require attention, and that without further delay.</P>
    <P>There are a few main industries which help to supplement the income of uneconomic holders in the congested areas.  These might be listed as turf production, fishing, the production of hand-woven tweed and, to a great extent, knitting.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to concentrate on these, at the same time keeping in mind any potential industries which can be set up to give more employment in these areas.  The tweed industry has had a sufficiently haphazard life over the past half-century in Donegal but at the present time it is becoming established and is on a fairly firm footing, mainly due to the improvement in quality and the better attention paid to the production of this material for a number of years. There is much that can yet be done in that respect but the principal aim at the moment should be to find sufficient markets as an outlet for the material produced.  Since the duties of the Parliamentary Secretary are to co-ordinate the activities of various governmental and semi-governmental Departments, I should like if he would pay particular <Col N="82" /> attention to one semi-governmental Department recently established for the purpose of furthering our export trade&mdash;Córas Tráchtála.  That Department is not very long in existence but there is much more it could do to find extra markets for Donegal tweed, a considerable quantity of which is being exported to the dollar area at present. The further development of these exports would serve the dual purpose of earning dollars and at the same time provide employment in areas where it is most required.</P>
    <P>Some person made a remark the other day in relation to the number of Irish who are abroad, and I was reminded of a statement made, I think, by the Taoiseach on a former occasion when he referred to the numbers of Irish people who took part in the parades in the various cities of America on St. Patrick's Day.  Last year 100,000 Irishmen marched down Fifth Avenue, New York, and there were almost 1,000,000 people looking on, most of whom were Irish or of Irish descent.  Over 25,000 participated in a parade in Philadelphia and upwards of 500,000 in Boston.  We are reminded that if these people bought only one suit of Donegal tweed in the year, it would keep every available weaver in the country working to capacity during the entire working days of the year.  We think that bodies like Córas Tráchtála recently set up to promote our exports should pay attention to matters such as these to see if it is not possible to get Irish associations in America to take a keener interest in the sale of our products in those countries.  I would not entirely concentrate on Gaeltarra Éireann, which is a well organised body capable of looking after its own interests in the main.  There are many private firms who cannot themselves afford the advertising necessary to establish their products on markets abroad.  These people are entitled to assistance from any Government or semi-Government organisation.  There are many admirable firms which we feel should get every possible encouragement and facility, particularly firms engaged in producing articles for the American and other foreign markets.  Every help should be given them to increase their <Col N="83" /> exports and by that means to increase the employment which they afford for our people at home.</P>
    <P>In regard to turf, the production of turf is one of the main industries in the congested areas.  Those who come from turf areas would not be in the slightest disappointed if coal never entered this country.  Coal which forms one of the biggest items, if not the biggest item, on our import list should be imported for industrial purposes mainly and to areas where turf cannot be purchased economically.  I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that he could keep a close check on the amount of coal allowed into turf areas in order to ensure that there will be no surplus turf on the market&mdash;not merely that there will be no surplus turf but that the people will be encouraged to produce turf in larger quantities and that they will be assured of a market for it in future.  It is one of the main industries in the congested Gaeltacht areas of this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishing, I am satisfied that recent legislation will provide the necessary facilities to enable inshore fishermen to take part in this precarious occupation in greater comfort, in larger numbers and at a better profit.  The market for fish at the moment seems fairly assured and satisfactory. I hope it will always remain so.  The problem now should be, how to increase our catches and that can be done only by supplying the necessary gear and the proper types of boat to fishermen.  The provisions in the recent legislation in that respect enable us to do that for the fisherman who is anxious to continue in that precarious industry.</P>
    <P>In the matter of knitting, I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that those who are engaged in this industry have had a difficult time for the past 12 or 18 months.  They found, in villages where knitting industries are established, that it was possible, in the early months of last year, to purchase English-produced knitwear more cheaply than it was being turned out in the local factory.  It was dumped in here to the extent of £2,000,000 worth in 12 months.  We trust that will never happen again, that the market will be <Col N="84" /> preserved for the home knitting industry and that the industry will be facilitated in every possible way in building up an export trade as well.  In that respect I should like to point out that the recent duty imposed on imported yarns for the purpose of facilitating home production has had, in some cases, a very adverse effect on the knitting industry where an export market for a particular type of material had already been built up.</P>
    <P>There is certain machinery available to enable those people to bring in the yarn free of duty if the goods to be produced from it area for export, but there is a good deal of red tape attached to it, and I do not think that it works very smoothly or satisfactorily for those in the export business.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should examine the machinery available for that purpose to ensure that nothing will retard the progress that is now being made in the export of knitwear, gloves and piece goods, which are being produced in many centres in Donegal, for which there are ample orders in hand at the moment, and on the production of which many people, living in cottages on the hillsides, are employed.</P>
    <P>There are various other schemes of interest to the Gaeltacht, many of which have already been referred to on other Estimates such, for example, as the Estimate for Forestry, which are of great importance.  A previous speaker said that temporary employment alone would not solve any of the difficulties which, apparently, exist in the Gaeltacht.  That is perfectly true. Some people seem to be worrying about the money that was being expended on drainage work along the roadsides under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Necessary as such employment may be, work of that nature for a few weeks on a drain by the roadside is not going to keep anybody at home in the Gaeltacht or in the congested areas.  It is only a passing phase, a temporary type of employment which lasts for only a few weeks. No man can look forward to settling down and saying to himself that on work of that nature he has permanent employment which is capable of supporting his wife and himself, and maintaining <Col N="85" /> a home.  For that reason, he cannot look on his position as being secure for the future or feel that there will be no need for him to emigrate. Temporary schemes do not create that impression in the mind of anybody in those areas.</P>
    <P>That is not the type of employment that we require.  It is fortunate to know that the weavers who are employed by Gaeltarra Éireann and the other private firms look on their employment as being of a permanent nature.  They can see a future in it for themselves and feel that the necessary protection will be accorded to them, that they will be able to set up a home and marry, if they are not already married, and live in their own native districts with a certain measure of comfort and prosperity.  That is the type of employment that we want to see in the Gaeltacht areas, even though it may take a little extra time to provide it to the extent desired.  We do not urge the Parliamentary Secretary to rush in with temporary improvised schemes for the sake of bringing down the figures of unemployment for a few months and then leaving the people on the dole for the remainder of the year.  We would prefer to see him direct his attention towards finding permanent employment of a suitable kind for the people in the establishment of industries that will hold out hope for the future&mdash;hope that there will be some sense of permanency about them as well as for the expansion and improvement of the industries which already exist.</P>
    <P>On the other side, it will be necessary to see that suitable amenities are provided for the people in those areas.  We think that any person who is destined to live in a backward area, such as a Gaeltacht area is invariably, should be given the opportunity of having every facility that is available to people living elsewhere in the country.  We believe that he should have a decent road to walk on, no matter where the village or townland in which he lives is situated.  We believe that he should have a decent house to live in.  In that respect, I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has seen fit&mdash;I am sure that he is <Col N="86" /> responsible for it&mdash;to ensure that, in the new Housing Act which is at present before the House, the omission that was in Section 7 of the 1950 Act has been remedied in so far as that the new Act will now apply to Gaeltacht housing.  The amendment made will enable a local authority to give a grant for Gaeltacht housing as well as for housing in any other part of the country.  If the local authorities give a grant equivalent to that given in the Gaeltacht Act for housing, that will greatly facilitate the building of houses in the Gaeltacht and will certainly provide better means for the Gaeltacht than they ever had before.  That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>So far as roads are concerned, they are an amenity which everybody desires at the present time.  It is not good enough to say that the roads are as good as they were 40 years ago or as they were in our grandfathers' time.  To-day, we want to see a decent type of road leading to every village and hamlet, and I suggest that it is up to those who profess to be interested in the Gaeltacht to ensure that we get the necessary facilities to enable us to equip ourselves with those amenities.</P>
    <P>There are various other matters in relation to the Gaeltacht which will arise under other Votes, but I think it well to remind the Parliamentary Secretary, since his job is the coordination of the various Departments, that the building of schools in the Gaeltacht is a matter of great urgency. I think that has already been dealt with, and I believe that we can expect a very definite improvement in that direction in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to consider an extension of the tomato scheme.  We have a tomato scheme in a particular part of Donegal. I believe that, given a fair trial and judging it on the whole, it is a very successful scheme, one on which the Minister who introduced it may well be congratulated.  I would like to see that scheme extended to other parts of Donegal where the people are anxious to share in the benefits which their friends in other parts of the county are enjoying at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in his opening statement, referred to the provision <Col N="87" /> of recreational halls and playing pitches.  I was particularly anxious, in connection with a certain Gaeltacht area, one of the most ancient and historic parishes in this country, that it should be facilitated in regard to the provision of a playing pitch which the local parish council is trying to provide at the moment.</P>
    <P>When we appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, as we hope to do in the next few days, I hope he will give us every facility to ensure that such a pitch will get the necessary assistance. It would be the first pitch of its kind in a Gaeltacht.  I hope we will get assistance from whatever Departments are responsible&mdash;the Board of Works, the Department of local Government and any other Department.  It is an area where it is difficult to provide a playing pitch, as in the Gaeltacht you have not the flat plains of the County Meath and if we get the necessary facilities it will add to the cultural amenities in the area.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the businesslike way in which he undertook his work during the year.  Unlike a previous speaker, I do not want to sneer or be cynical in connection with this important appointment.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been charged with co-ordinating the work of various Departments and one cannot expect him to work a miracle in eight short months.  Many Governments have gone their way and have not done in a number of years what he is undertaking now.  We did not expect to see miracles within a few months. I am satisfied and convinced that this is a step in the right direction and that as time goes on the effect of his work will be manifest.  I trust he will have the support and co-operation of every Party in the House to see that this most desirable work is brought to fruition successfully in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the legislation which set up An Fóras Tionscal is one of the most important pieces of legislation enacted by this House for a very long time.  It gives <Col N="88" /> hope to those people in the western counties who in many cases had to emigrate, whether it was permanent emigration or temporary migration. It has given them hope that at least their interests are being looked after now.  The idea is a very sound one, and I am personally gratified that we have in charge of this development of the western counties a man who is not only capable but who during the past year has put a great deal of spadework into this project, and will continue to do so.  From discussions I have had with him, and from accounts that I have read, and knowing of the number of visits he paid to the western areas to get first-hand information, I know we can rest assured that development will take place.  We should be very satisfied if the rate of development continues over a period of years as it has done within the past 12 months.  This office is less than a year in existence, and there are concrete results which can be seen already, resulting from the setting up of this board.  New factories have already come into being as a result of the work done by the Parliamentary Secretary and by An Fóras Tionscal.  I look on it as a long-term policy.  We should aim at doing something substantial, doing it in a permanent way and planning on a long-term basis. As the last speaker has indicated, the people of the western counties do not want to be thrown sops.  They want something that will be there permanently, and that will not alone bring money to the western counties but will also produce some wealth for the nation.  It is in setting up industries in the West, in producing goods for the home market and for export, that one will give employment to these people and improve their lot, and also benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on forestry, Deputy Blowick suggested that employment should be given to people in the rural districts.  I agree with that, but I find that in rural districts not enough employment can be given, no matter how one goes about it.  We must supplement that by having some industries in the towns and villages that will absorb the surplus that must necessarily come from the rural area.  We <Col N="89" /> want to capture that migratory element and must capture it as near to home as possible, rather than let it go overseas. The proper way to do that is the way adopted by An Fóras Tionscal, the setting up of industries, small or large, in the towns and villages of our western counties.  I would appeal for the setting up of even very small industries. Some people have an idea that unless they do something outstanding, unless there is an industry costing thousands or hundreds of thousands of pounds set up, it is not worth while bothering about it.  I believe that greater benefit can be given if we get around to catering for small industries where ten to 20 people would be employed.  If we had many of those, it would go a long way towards solving most of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>An Fóras Tionscal is solely responsible for the giving of grants and aiding proposed industries.  Before an industry reaches that stage, a good deal of preliminary work must be done.  The idea is to leave that to local enterprise and An Fóras Tionscal does not act until local enterprise has got to the stage where they have something concrete to put before the board.  The board acts from then on.  A good deal of work must be done before that, and I think that attached to the board there should be an advisory body.  I know there is the Industrial Development Authority, but I think there should be something more approachable&mdash;say an advisory office in each county.  You may have people in a town or district who have the necessary capital.</P>
    <P>It is not easy, in the first place, to get them together to pool their ideas and their capital.  Having done that, even when they get together it is not easy for them, being in some isolated place, to decide as to the best industry for that particular locality.  Even if they are aware of the most suitable industry, they are not in a position to say whether there is a home market for the products of that industry, they cannot say how much of those articles is being imported or whether a foreign market would be available.  Of course, they could refer it to their local Dáil representative but he, having many <Col N="90" /> other things to do, is not always able to devote the amount of time he should to getting the particulars required.  It would be beneficial if you had an adviser in each county who would go around, attend meetings and give the information which would be required in the initial stages of any project.</P>
    <P>One danger I see in connection with the getting of grants for industries in western counties concerns the last of the three requirements for a grant, namely, that there must be competitive disadvantages.  I think many industries or proposed industries could be ruled out on that requirement, if it were carried too far.  It is easy enough to rake up advantages.  No matter where you start an industry, one can rake up a number of disadvantages and a number of advantages.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that too many advantages should not be put against the establishment of a new industry in the Donegal and other western counties.  A number of advantages means that a grant will not be forthcoming.  It is very easy to outweigh the disadvantages by what may seem to be advantages, but any industry situated in a western county starts under a great handicap.  What the people in those counties need is constant employment.  I think the idea behind An Fóras Tionscal should, if given a proper chance, create in the West a reasonably constant amount of employment for the people there.</P>
    <P>The people in Donegal say that the people in Dublin seem to think that Donegal is one of the Six Counties. The Donegal people say that Donegal is always left out in the cold, and that they do not get the same benefits which other counties are getting.  We hope that under An Fóras Tionscal Donegal will get its share of whatever is going in the West.</P>
    <P>A geological survey was carried out in this country some time ago&mdash;I forget the exact date&mdash;and a certain sum of money was allocated for that purpose. The counties first surveyed were the counties best surveyed, and the counties which were surveyed last were skimmed over because funds were running low.  I think that large tracts of Donegal were not done at all.  We <Col N="91" /> have minerals in Donegal suitable for many purposes, but in that connection it would be necessary to carry out a new survey or to complete the old survey.  I know of a firm that is interested in a certain type of clay.  If we had a survey to guide us, it would be an easy matter to find the exact type of clay required but, as things stand at the moment, it is a matter of trial and error, mostly error.</P>
    <P>As the last speaker has stated, the development of turf in Donegal and in the western counties during the emergency helped to create a good deal of employment for the people there.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to impress on the Department of Industry and Commerce the necessity for as great an expenditure on the development of turf now as during the emergency.  While on the question of turf, I might say that tests were made in some of the Donegal bogs for montan wax.  The percentage of montan wax in the specimens taken from Donegal was the highest in Ireland.  A Dublin firm got a certain distance in that connection, but nothing further has been done since.  I think that at one of his meetings in Donegal the Parliamentary Secretary got particulars of that matter.  I am anxious to find out if it is a proposition worth following up and, if it is, I think we should be given information as to the potential markets and the cost of setting up the plant to develop that wax.</P>
    <P>Donegal is one of the counties in this State which produces the most flax. For years, the people there have been discussing the idea of setting up a flax spinning mill.  I know there are many snags in the way.  I know that the cost of such a mill is very high and that the markets are not always steady.  Sometimes there is a slump in the linen market.  Nevertheless I think we should have a flax spinning mill in the northern part of the Twenty-Six Counties for the counties in that area that go in for flax-growing.</P>
    <P>The development of fishing along the western seaboard generally is of great importance.  I am glad that a statement has been issued to the effect that <Col N="92" /> different ports along the western seaboard are due for development.  Fishing has been carried on from the port of Glengad in Donegal for generations and we have some of the best fishing grounds in Europe off Malin Head.  Evidence given in a recent case in regard to a trawler that had been shot at goes to show that this is one of the best fishing grounds around there or anywhere off the coast.  Landing facilities are so bad at the moment that insurance companies will not undertake to insure the boats.  It requires a fairly substantial sum of money to improve the landing facilities there.  I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary, in his advisory capacity, to impress upon the different Departments connected with the building of piers&mdash;not one Department alone is concerned but three or four&mdash;the importance of attending to this matter.</P>
    <P>Donegal being one of the foremost potato growing counties, exports a very large quantity of potatoes.  Some of these potatoes are exported through the port of Derry.  I think it would give very much employment if they were sent out through the Donegal ports.  There are facilities at some of the Donegal ports like Moville, Buncrana and other places for loading these potatoes.  The same applies to industrial alcohol.</P>
    <P>At the moment, industrial alcohol is being transported by lorry to Dundalk and shipped from there.  Again, we have the facilities in Donegal for the shipment of industrial alcohol from many of the ports there.  That long transportation is a thing that should not be allowed to take place.  I know it is very difficult to get away from the idea of centralisation but we have an opportunity of getting rid of this centralisation. By keeping his eye on these things, the Parliamentary Secretary could help to undo that state of affairs even in a small way.  It is those smaller things, when taken over a long period, that will go a long way towards building up to the larger items.</P>
    <P>I again want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the work done during the past year.  I congratulate him on the work he has carried out on his own part in going <Col N="93" /> around to the different centres in the West, in learning at first-hand of the conditions that exist there and in providing the remedies that should be adopted.  I congratulate him on having reached the stage, after less than a year, where we can point to some new projects on the stocks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>For a new Parliamentary Secretary starting off with a brand-new section of a Department his opening statement was very surprising. He told us, of course, that the particular branch he operates is merely one to co-ordinate the work of several Departments.  I should have liked if he had given us an idea of what was accomplished or the foundation that was laid during the period since the Department was established to get those projects under way.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that he had a lot of running around to do, particularly in the western areas, making visits and so on.  If he had told us what was likely to result from these visits, it might have been more interesting and we might have been able to help him out and make some suggestions to him that might be helpful in his work.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that they had been in close touch with the following developments in the Gaeltacht and congested areas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Bord na Móna and Electricity Supply Board electricity from milled peat scheme at Bangor Erris, (2) Comhlucht Siúicre experimental and pilot schemes in connection with medicinal and herb growing, (3) Electricity Supply Board rural electrification and disposal of surplus turf in the remote areas, (4) Department of Agriculture re-extension of tomato glass-house scheme and the growing of onions, fishery development, etc.</P>
      <P>I think that some of these schemes were started during the time of the inter-Party Government&mdash;at least they were talked about.  With regard to the &ldquo;rearrangement of rundale holdings&rdquo;, would the Parliamentary Secretary let us know what is being done in that connection and what success he has met with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> With regard to &ldquo;directing Forestry Division activity to planting of remote and comparatively barren areas&rdquo; I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary was in the House when the Minister for Lands replied on the Forestry Vote. The Minister left me under the impression that he was not at all too interested in the very thing in which the Parliamentary Secretary seems to be so interested now.  In that connection, I had made a comment, which I repeat on this Vote, that the work of Fóras Tionscal in establishing factories in towns was very good but, good as it was, it left the remote and barren areas, which are not so barren from the point of view of population, unprovided for.  If we are to keep a peasantry on the land and in the country, we must do something to arrest them clearing out of these areas.  Establishing factories in the towns may help to arrest it within a radius of three, four, or five miles of that particular industry.  I hold that we should establish some industry in the areas in the hinterland. The Parliamentary Secretary's office can go a long way towards achieving that object.  I have not yet heard a better plan to rival afforestation as a means whereby a substantial population can be retained in the rural hinterland to which I have referred.  I have listened to speakers in this House for eight or nine years.  They have suggested all kinds of schemes for developing industries in towns but not one of them pointed to any scheme which would rival afforestation as a means of checking the vanishing population in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary does nothing else except develop afforestation in these areas and assist Fóras Tionscal in establishing factories in the towns in the western areas, where the rainfall is very high and has contributed to impoverishing the land down through the centuries he will have done a good day's work.  I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary, that the setting up of industries in the towns is excellent for the towns themselves and for a radius of two, three or four miles around the towns.  However these industries do not serve the huge hinterland and, in very many cases, the <Col N="95" /> heavily populated hinterland, stretching for, perhaps, 15 or 20 miles between towns.  I do not want to see those hinterlands becoming any more depopulated than they are at present.  If they do we will not be able to hold our &ldquo;bold peasantry&rdquo; as Goldsmith called them long ago.  It will be a sad thing if, when history comes to be written, our period, from 1920 to 1970, will be described as the period of the second great clearing from the land.  I hope it will not be said that successive Irish Governments muddled along from one year to another, allowed depopulation to take place and did nothing to stop it.  It will be regrettable if this generation is condemned for its negligence in this regard, and, unless, we get down to brass tacks, that will happen.</P>
    <P>We may talk about the freedom of the country, about removing the Border and so forth, but do we realise we can do something to remedy one of the greatest catastrophies that is befalling us at the moment?  I am referring to emigration.  Dr. Lucey, the Coadjutor Bishop of Cork, referred to it as the decay of rural Ireland, and no more suitable expression could be used to describe what is happening.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has been in the western parts of County Mayo and in the northern and southern constituencies of that county, or in Galway, Kerry, Clare, Donegal, parts of Sligo and Leitrim, he must have been struck with a number of houses &mdash;obviously ones which were occupied not so long ago&mdash;where the windows and doors are boarded up and the occupants gone elsewhere.  I am referring particularly to Leitrim.  That is a sad state of affairs.  It is not good enough to say that the propositions that we are putting forward will not be a financial success.  The thing to do, in my opinion, is to bring employment of some kind right up to the doorsteps of the people in these areas.  Of course, if they want to emigrate even then, constitutionally we cannot stop them.  However, I do not believe that they will have that desire if chances of reasonable employment are held out to them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has <Col N="96" /> visited my county and County Galway, where he has met people with all shades of political thought.  These people have told him that they agreed fully with the afforestation drive that I had in hand during the period from 1948 to 1951.  However, in case politics might be used to influence him to drop that scheme, I am asking him now not to do so.  I do not think he is a man who would yield to that kind of cheapness, or that he would descend to that type of action.  But in case it is whispered into his ear to drop that scheme, I ask him not to pay any heed to such a suggestion.  I emphatically repeat again that I know of no more effective means at the present of retaining the population in the big areas between the towns than by means of afforestation. The previous speaker mentioned the geological survey which is being carried out at present of our mineral resources.  That survey has told us fairly plainly that whatever mineral resources we have are not to be found in these areas, and that, in any case, our mineral resources are scarce, of poor quality, and too deep to be worked economically.  My suggestion is that we should take the surface as we find it, and work it in such a manner that it will provide a livelihood which will encourage our young people to remain at home.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate on the Forestry Vote, the Minister for Lands astonished me with some of the things he said.  He gave the impression that the game of afforestation in the congested areas would not be worth the candle.  These were not the exact words he used, but the gist of what he said amounted to that.</P>
    <P>It will be a sad day when the whole of the West of Ireland has become depopulated.  There are many areas in the west where the land is so poor that it is fit for nothing but snipe.  If the depopulation of these areas goes on at its present rate, the day will come when the only people left will be gathered into the towns, and dependent on one factory and on the output of that factory.  I hope I will never see that time.  I trust that more than one factory will be established in the town, so as to help to provide for its <Col N="97" /> own population and for the surplus population that must always come into it from rural areas, as was mentioned by another speaker.  It will be a disgraceful state of affairs if we allow the land of Ireland to become bereft of its people during our lifetime and, indeed, it has become sadly bereft of them at the moment.  All I hope is that the depopulation of rural areas has not gone too far.</P>
    <P>During my three and a half years as Minister for Lands I never met a young man or a young woman who would not stay at home if he or she had a reasonable wage and a chance of reasonable security in employment.  I do not believe that in such circumstances even one out of every 100 persons would desire to travel and see the world, as the saying is.  The majority of people emigrate because they want to make the best use possible of their youth.  However, if any chances of reasonable employment at home are held out to them they will stay here. In fact I have never known one who, in such circumstances, would be anxious to go.</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Parliamentary Secretary ever witness a railway station scene in the West of Ireland in the spring time?  If he did, he saw crowds of young emigrants in tears, because that is no uncommon sight.  If, as has been said often in this House, they are so anxious to leave, why are they weeping?  A similar scene can be witnessed on Dún Laoghaire Pier.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that, if these youngsters were given security at home, they would not be anxious to leave the country.  They go because they want to make the best possible use of their youth and to put a fortune together, whether it be big or small.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that he should discuss with the Minister for Lands the question of establishing forestry in the congested areas.  The Forestry officials will tell him that, from experiments that have been carried out, these areas have been shown to produce good timber.  There are certain quagmires and certain barren mountainsides without <Col N="98" /> sufficient earth or protection from the winds which will not grow timber. However, apart from these, there is plenty of land which could be effectively used for such a purpose.  The Parliamentary Secretary need not be a bit afraid of spending money for afforestation purposes.  Forestry is something that will increase in value from year to year.</P>
    <P>When he is replying, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what is the cause of the unemployment in the West.  Factories under Gaeltacht services in North Mayo have been reduced, I am informed, to working two days a week.  I would like to know if that is true.  These factories, short time as it is since the inter-Party Government were in power, were all going full blast, and I have heard that the bottom has fallen out of the markets for the goods they were producing and that they are working on only one and a half or two days a week. There is also the possibility that the Elly Bay toy factory will be put on half-time as well.  I have heard these rumours and I would like to know if there is any truth in them.  I took a keen interest in all these activities and I was very proud of the employment they were able to give during my term of office.  I would like to see them going ahead.  I know that toys and other products of these factories might sometimes blow into a blast of heavy selling weather and that they might suffer because of that.</P>
    <P>As regards Fóras Tionscal I wish to make a few suggestions.  First of all, let me say that the Parliamentary Secretary has just given us a bald statement instead of setting out what the board has accomplished.  After all, we have voted money to that board and I do submit that it is hardly good enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to come along with a bald statement like that.  That is not the way to treat the House when we are voting over £2,000,000 here.  We never expected treatment of this kind and I am sure the Deputies behind the Parliamentary Secretary's back will agree with me in full when I say that it is not a fair way to treat the House.  I do believe that the board has made very good tracks, <Col N="99" /> so to speak, in some directions but then why hide the fact?  Why hide their light under a bushel?  Goodness knows we can fire enough bricks at their heads and if they have done something good why hide it?  Apart from that consideration, as long as the House votes the money for the board we will insist on having an account of what is happening and what they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are not discussing Fóras Tionscal but I do say that when the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister is moving the Vote for his office he should give an account to the House of what the board has done for the year.  Perhaps it may not be proper to discuss the various projects on which the board have been engaged or have succeeded in bringing to fruition during the year&mdash;the Chair can rule out discussion on that&mdash;but the House should have an account from the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister as to how the money is being spent and as to the success which has attended the board's efforts to establish factories, and so on.  All we want is just to know what is happening.  I, for one, feel it is not good enough to vote money and then simply have a warning notice put up: &ldquo;It is none of your business from that on&rdquo;.  It is our business and I insist on it being our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there are a few towns that I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring to the notice of Fóras Tionscal for the establishment of factories if at all possible.  Each one of them has facilities for the establishment of a factory.  There is a slate quarry in Louisburgh which should not be allowed to remain dormant.  There are also quantities of blackface wool and of bred wool of this year and last year on the farmer's hands and there is ample opportunity for the establishment of a factory in one town if not in two towns for handling that.  There are four towns&mdash;Newport, Ballinrobe, Westport, and Louisburgh&mdash;which, like the rural areas, will soon be depopulated <Col N="100" /> if something is not done to give them employment of a permanent nature.  Now that the board is established it should come to the rescue of these places.  After all, it is not for big centres which are already humming with industrial activity that the board was ever intended.  It is for the towns like those in the West that I have mentioned that it was intended.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is that the Vote for Gaeltacht Services is down by a very considerable figure, by a net £133,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary explained that by saying it is much lower this year because of stockpiling that occurred last year. Might I suggest that stockpiling did not run into that figure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  That will satisfy me.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how the handwoven tweed industry in Donegal is progressing or has it fallen on evil days? Are the markets bad or could any better drive be made to try to develop sales within our own country and in outside countries where the Irish population form a considerable portion of the total, say, in the United States, England and other countries?  Can anything be done there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that there is one sub-head which makes provision for advertising the products of Gaeltacht services and I am delighted to see that.  All I am sorry about is that it is not twice or three times as much.  I believe there is an opportunity there of developing and getting sale for the products.  I want to say this&mdash;I did not get an opportunity last year&mdash;that Gaeltacht services are turning out some remarkably fine classes of materials and finished articles.  They are as good if not better than anything on sale from any other country in the world and there is no reason why, with proper advertising, the sales at home and abroad could not be vastly increased. We should not let the opportunity slip of obtaining a market for our wares through failure to advertise them.  Let the world know what we have to sell and let them know the excellent quality <Col N="101" /> of the goods we have to sell.  I must say that during the war years, owing to many difficulties, the impossibility of getting proper materials, proper machinery and proper spares for existing machinery, the quality of some of the materials turned out might not have reached the standard we would like to have seen it attain.  However, since then the quality is quite good.  It is better than good; it is excellent to my own knowledge and from what I have heard from traders who buy some of the material.  It would be regrettable if we should fall down on the job of selling those goods and if unemployment should result from lack of sales because of our failure to advertise.  In other words, let us push our wares and let the world know what we have to sell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very placid atmosphere in the House this evening and we all seem to be agreed that something should be done for the congested areas and for the Gaeltacht. I do not intend to say anything controversial and certainly I do not intend to say anything derogatory of the Opposition Party.  I was very interested to hear Deputy Blowick referring to towns like Louisburgh, Newport, Ballinrobe and Westport.  I agree wholeheartedly with him that every effort should be made to provide worthwhile employment in those towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I believe that the schemes are there, notably under the Undeveloped Areas Act, and to some extent it must be the duty of a public representative to try to whet the appetite of important business people and other people with money in towns such as those mentioned.  Personally I intend to do everything I can to bring before the notice of those people the necessity for making as great an effort as possible at the present time.  The need for increased production is acute. The need for providing increased employment is self-evident.  In many respects the Government can only go a certain distance and they must leave it to local initiative to go the rest of the way.  Possibly an energetic public representative would be the right link to bring both the Government and <Col N="102" /> local initiative together in order to achieve something worth while.</P>
    <P>One of the chief functions of the Parliamentary Secretary is that of coordination. I must admit that I would not like the job of tackling one Department after another and I would not relish the job of tackling a body like the Land Commission in order to prevail on them to change their minds and either speed up or slow down, as the case may be.  I do not intend to attack the Land Commission.  I know that they are faced with great difficulties but I do sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to use his good offices with the Land Commission in relation to the rearrangement of rundale holdings. While the tenants are waiting for the Land Commission to make up their minds in that respect they cannot obtain either a Gaeltacht grant or an ordinary local government housing grant for the purpose of providing accommodation for themselves.  Many of these people&mdash;many of them live in my own constituency&mdash;are faced with the problem that they badly need accommodation but are unable to provide themselves with that accommodation until such time as the Land Commission make up their minds what they intend to do.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for tackling the Land Commission in relation to that matter.  He will earn the undying gratitude of many of the people in County Mayo, particularly the poorer people, if he succeeds in bringing about some action.</P>
    <P>At this stage it might be well to say&mdash;there is nothing controversial in it&mdash;that I have not heard one single word of criticism from the Opposition Benches as to the behaviour of the Parliamentary Secretary during his visit to the congested districts and the Gaeltacht areas.  Had there been any suggestion of Party politics or any favouritism shown by him towards those who support the Fianna Fáil Party that would very soon have become known to the Opposition and they would have made use of it.  The mere fact that there was not even a whisper of a suggestion in that respect is in itself a great tribute to the <Col N="103" /> Parliamentary Secretary and proves beyond doubt the attitude that he adopted when he went down the country to meet the local people.  He went down to study their problems at first hand, to find out in the very best way how to tackle those problems and how to solve them.  In meeting the people he met the representatives of all sorts of groups and societies and of all shades of political thought.  I believe that is the proper method and I hope that is the method the Parliamentary Secretary will continue to use.</P>
    <P>While travelling up and down the country, particularly in Mayo and Galway, the Parliamentary Secretary must on occasion have travelled over some of the less important roads.  If he did, he must have reflected on the necessity for providing money for their improvement.  County Mayo has an enormous road mileage.  It is not possible to provide enough money to repair the roads in that county without striking a rate which would cast an intolerable burden on the ratepaying community.  Indeed, in some cases these roads would need to be dug up and new foundations put in.  I made representations to the county engineer in relation to some of these roads.  He proved conclusively to me that the money available to him and to the county council was wholly insufficient. If I remember rightly, last year and the year before the county engineer published a notice in the local Press at the end of which he stated that the rapidly deteriorating road system showed every sign of continuing to get worse.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of human problems bound up with the condition of the roads in areas like South Mayo. There is the problem of the sick person who needs the ministrations of the priest or the doctor.  Generally these people find, when they answer the call, that they can only go a certain distance in their cars and they must travel the rest of the way on foot over pot-holes that are full of water in wet weather.  Speed in certain cases may make all the difference between life and death and it seems a pity that a few thousand pounds one way or the <Col N="104" /> other should make such a grave difference even to one single individual.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to bring that particular problem within the scope of his activities. If his activities produce a solution he will render an unparalleled service to the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the rural areas people were inclined to reject the extension of the electricity supply in the beginning.  Many people, because of an inherent conservatism, felt they were getting along all right with paraffin oil and they felt that the cost of installing electricity and paying the subsequent capital charges of one kind or another would be altogether too heavy.  They did not know what they were letting themselves in for in relation to electricity, whereas they knew to a penny what it cost them to run their houses on paraffin oil.  When the original canvass was made, therefore, many areas did not reach the required percentage and had to be by-passed by the Electricity Supply Board.  Now the people in these areas have seen the enormous advantages attaching to electricity and they are beginning to change their minds and to clamour for the extension of the supply to them.</P>
    <P>In any case in which I have applied to the Electricity Supply Board appealing for a new canvass in a particular area or the extension of the scheme to two or three houses in an area that has already been decided upon I have always met with the greatest courtesy and the board has always been prompt in its response to my request.  I feel I should say that because semi-State bodies are, as a rule, inclined to be somewhat autocratic in their views and methods. Whatever disagreement we may have with the board in relation to the actual cost of electricity consumed it cannot be said that they are not an extremely courteous body with which to deal.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has had the experience I have had.  If he is interested I am quite prepared to supply a list of areas where the Electricity Supply Board failed to obtain a sufficient number of applicants on its first canvass and <Col N="105" /> where to-day I am morally certain they would now find a sufficient number willing to have electricity installed.  I appeal to him to take the matter up with the board in order to bring about an extension of the scheme to these areas.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the glasshouse scheme.  We all know that that scheme has proved successful. Unfortunately it does not apply to County Mayo, and candidly I can see no reason why it should not be extended to that county.  It is always an advantage to have quick results and a quick return for outlay.  If the scheme were extended to Mayo I am sure it would be as successful there as it has been in the other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that there is anything very original in what I have said.  Certainly there is no originality in saying that the answer to the problems of counties like Mayo is industrialisation. The basic problem is, of course, paucity of land.  No matter what rearrangement is done, no matter what acquisition or division is carried out, there is not enough land to go around. In every household there are two, three or four surplus sons and daughters. These are the people who are forced to emigrate in present circumstances, and these are the people who will continue to emigrate until such time as employment is provided for them at home.  Where these young people live near a sizable town there is no reason why they should not be able to look forward in the very near future to finding employment in a local factory. There is no reason why even in the remoter areas they should not also be able to look forward in the near future to finding employment through an extension of afforestation and other schemes.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which the problems of those people will be solved. I hope that the day is fast approaching when we will find proof one way or the other of Deputy Blowick's statement that the vast majority of our people do not want to leave this country.  I believe that in the main he is right and that the very high percentage of the people who leave would prefer to <Col N="106" /> stay at home and find employment here.  I am looking forward to the time when we shall be able to look back and say that the people of Ireland, when given a choice, chose Ireland rather than anywhere else in which to live and, when we can say that, we can also add that they made the right choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little one can say on this Estimate because it is only a very short time since this whole matter was discussed on the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  I think that almost everything that could be said was said on that occasion.  Since the <Col N="108" /> passing of that Bill, however, very little progress has been made in the West of Ireland.  I said on that occasion that I did not feel that the Bill would meet with success because, while I recognise and appreciate the importance of private enterprise, I also appreciate the magnitude of the problem that exists in the West of Ireland. As I said then, I believe that private enterprise will not be able to solve the problem as we know it in many counties in Connaught.  I am in full agreement with Deputy Seán Flanagan in hoping for a brighter and better future for the West of Ireland.  He is a comparatively young man, however, and I venture to prophesy that if he is here for the next 20 years he will still be rising on one or other side of this House hoping for a brighter future for the West of Ireland. If we are only to deal with it in the manner provided for in that Bill and with the limited capital which we are prepared to make available, we can hardly expect that the problem as we know it will be altered very much as a result of it.  We will still have the emigration which has been taking place and the poverty which has existed there for a long number of years.  In Mayo, and I suppose parts of Galway, Sligo, Donegal and Kerry, the people are getting out pretty quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary and the large number of his colleagues on the Government side of the House who traversed the length and breadth of North Mayo during the past few weeks and paid visits to almost every hamlet in that constituency have become very conversant with the situation as it exists there. If their presence there served no other purpose than to enlighten them in regard to the problem that exists there it was well worth while having a by-election. I met quite a number of Deputies from the Midlands and elsewhere during the course of that campaign and they were amazed and bewildered and wondered how the people can exist there.  I am sure they will be able now to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be more realistic and to bring pressure upon his colleagues in the Government to be more realistic in dealing with the problem and that, <Col N="109" /> privately or publicly, they will convey to them that the sum allocated is not at all sufficient to ease the situation which exists.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any member of the Government or even the simplest of the back benchers believes that there is any hope for the future so far as removal of the conditions as we know them in the West of Ireland is concerned. There is scarcely a townland in the whole of Mayo in which you will not find four, five, and as many as ten holdings closed&mdash;windows shuttered and doors barred, and the occupants gone to England, America and elsewhere. They lived in hope that something would be done over a period of 30 years and now they have lost hope. The only persons who have not lost hope are the members of this House. On both sides we still keep hoping. We must have great confidence.  It is said that faith without hope is lost, so we must have faith and hope when we hope something will be done.</P>

      <P>It must be very strong. If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that the Act which passed through the Oireachtas some time ago and his statement on this Estimate are going to solve the problem in the West of Ireland, he is a very innocent man.  He has as much sense now as we can ever expect him to have and I am sure he realises now that he is only playing with the problem, like a baby who gets a toy to keep him quiet.  These are just little sops which we hand over to the people thinking they will ease the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the situation in the West of Ireland calls for State intervention and large expenditure of capital.  If that is not forthcoming, I can see only one solution&mdash;it is a solution which we can see without going to the trouble of carrying out a survey&mdash;the exodus of the people from Mayo and from counties where similar conditions exist.  When you talk to these people, they will tell you: &ldquo;The problem will soon solve itself because if you live another 20 years, you will not see many chimneys smoking in this <Col N="110" /> district.  We will have gone, and, if we had any sense, we would have gone long ago, but we thought that an Irish Government would rise to the occasion and do something&rdquo;.  They have now come to the conclusion&mdash;and I do not blame them&mdash;that there is no future for them and that they must seek their livelihood elsewhere rather than hope for assistance from any Government since the establishment of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I know that the advocating of State interference or State enterprise is not very welcome to certain sections but every public man has the right to express his own feelings and opinions. I would be much better pleased if private enterprise was prepared to face up to its responsibilities&mdash;it might be better&mdash;but when private enterprise is not prepared to do it, it falls on the shoulders of the State and of the Government to try to provide the remedy.  That remedy must be the provision of suitable employment.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of dolls and toys may give a certain amount of employment, but it is mainly girls or boys of 16 and 18 years of age who are employed in that industry and the wages in the industry are not very remunerative. Furthermore, it is an industry which depends mainly on the home market&mdash;I am not sure whether we have an export market for these articles&mdash;but notwithstanding the fact that it depends on the home market, if one goes into any of the big stores in Dublin&mdash;and I assume the same applies to Cork and other large centres&mdash;one finds that many of these toys are imported from abroad and are very expensive. A young nephew of mine who was up here recently went into a certain store and fell for a certain toy.  He priced it and found that it was something over £6&mdash;for a toy that you could carry under your arm.  That is ridiculous. That toy was manufactured for the very well-to-do and I do not know that anybody would be foolish enough to spend £6 on a toy.  If anybody were so foolish it is obvious that he or she must have plenty of money to throw away and I hold the view that such articles should be well taxed.</P>
    <P>Therefore the market for the toy industry is limited, and even if we did <Col N="111" /> rigidly control the importation of toys we can only look forward to a limited number of people being employed in the industry.  If we could provide employment&mdash;manual labour&mdash;for males it would be much preferable.  That is what is required in the West.  We talk here about the defence of Ireland and the building up of an army when we cannot produce even a shotgun.  In rural Ireland everything said here is scrutinised very carefully.  It may be thought that the people in rural Ireland are a simple kind of folk but there is nothing simple about them and when one goes amongst them it is surprising what one can learn and how they weigh up what is said here.</P>
    <P>That is one industry which, if we are to maintain an army, we could very well have here.  We must have equipment for our Army.  There is no use in equipping them with popguns of the type we played with as boys; we should try to produce our own arms, or a certain amount of them at any rate. That is one industry which, if ever brought into being, should be situated in the West of Ireland, and preferably in my own county, because a lot of the men who emigrated from 1939 to the present time became skilled in the production of certain instruments and equipment for war.  It would be easy to avail of these men with knowledge and training and they could train those who remained at home and who would be prepared to take up employment.</P>
    <P>We only assemble our bicycles here. I think we have reached the position that we should be able to make them. That would be a very valuable asset and would give considerable employment.</P>
    <P>There are many deposits, I am sure, in the West of Ireland which, if examined and exploited, would give employment to the menfolk.  It is all very well to provide work for women. I am not against it but I must point out that when a man marries he can hardly expect his wife to go on earning. That duty falls on him.  If he has no work to go to the alternative is that he must do the housework while she goes out to the local toy factory, knitting industry or one of the other small industries <Col N="112" /> which exist in the West of Ireland.  For that reason I would urge that whatever money is invested, whatever industries are developed, the work should be undertaken with a view to providing employment for the men.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that he had reason to visit many areas and I am sure that he has acquired more knowledge during the past five or six months than he had at the time of the introduction of the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  He knows towns like Charlestown, Kiltimagh, Ballyhaunis, Claremorris and Kilkelly. There is a very big rural population around them.  When we bring people from Mayo to Dublin to hospital, on business or for some other reason, the remark they make about the towns in the Midlands is: &ldquo;How poor they are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They say that there are cobwebs in the windows and that the things they show for sale have not been moved for years.  The reason is that there is no population around these towns like Kilbeggan, Moate and the others through which you pass.  There is very little business there.  There is a rural community around these towns in Mayo however, which have kept them going over the years but it is beginning to dwindle.  The people are beginning to go away.  They see that they have been wasting time and energy crossing to England or even to America.  They say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot exactly agree with our forefathers that when we go to America we should come back, settle down and let the children go.  If we have made some capital in England or America we should make our home there.&rdquo;  That is a new idea which has crept in over the past 20 years.  Twenty-five or 30 years ago Irish emigrants to England or America came back and settled in their home place but that is not done to-day.  They remain in America.  That is the big loss.  That causes the danger that the rural population will dwindle.  It is dwindling and it will dwindle fast unless we wake up to our responsibility and the Government recognise that they have a duty.  They should not put that responsibility on individuals, on people who have capital at their disposal but who are not anxious to invest <Col N="113" /> it.  The people will move if the State does not move and move rapidly.</P>
    <P>Many things could be done, drainage, afforestation and road construction for example.  There should be a close survey of mineral deposits in the West of Ireland.  I do not believe for a moment that Ireland was created minus mineral resources.  I believe that there are mineral resources in the West as well as in any other part.  If a survey were carried out I am sure that deposits would be discovered which would be very valuable and would help greatly to build up industries.  I do not believe that any real survey was ever carried out with that motive and sooner or later some Government must do that.</P>
    <P>We should not permit the continual drain of Irish boys to England to do many of the things which are required here, such as the construction of roads. The Parliamentary Secretary has been down in North Mayo.  Some of your colleagues have been there.  I met Deputy Bartley and Deputy Beegan in Belmullet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary found it very uncomfortable to travel on some of these roads.  They are very badly constructed and are very narrow.  In many places two cars could not pass with any degree of safety.  This is particularly true around Achill, Mulranny and Louisburgh.  These are spots which we try to advertise in our tourist bulletins. We invite people to spend their holidays there but the roads are appallingly bad.  The men who emigrate are building roads in England.  The English Government think it pays to give them a good weekly wage to do these things but we do not think it pays.  It might not pay dividends immediately but over a period of years it definitely would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one point on which I disagree with the present Government.  They maintain that unless a development programme pays dividends on the spot it should not be undertaken.  That is where we clash.  Almost every Party on this side of the House differs from <Col N="114" /> the Government in office on that. Afforestation, road construction, drainage, land rehabilitation and housing do not immediately produce dividends or reimburse the State for the capital investment but in years to come they definitely would.  In the first instance they would hold young men at home. Remember that that would mean an increase in the consumption of goods and, naturally, an increase in the production of goods accordingly.  I mean consumption of goods in every sense of the word&mdash;the things they wear, the things they eat and everything else.  Unless some such effort is made you cannot have increased production on the one hand, or capital to outlay on the other, because eventually there will be nobody from whom you can secure capital, nobody to tax.  As the population dwindles and taxes increase the number of shoulders left to bear the taxes is decreasing, and we must wake up to our responsibility.</P>
    <P>I have been surprised for a considerable time that the Parliamentary Secretary had not something more concrete to offer us, something more encouraging to present to the House. One felt on the introduction of the Undeveloped Areas Bill that in a comparatively short time one would see wonderful changes.  The changes are yet to come.  It is like the old slogan about prosperity around the corner.  I think that the time has come when the prosperity should show itself and not wait around the corner all the time.  It is because it remains around the corner that the people are going away.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would again stress the importance of the towns I have mentioned.  It is rumoured&mdash;how truly I do not know&mdash;that two or three industries are about to be opened, one in Swinford, one in Kiltimagh and one in Ballyhaunis.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is concluding I would like him to verify that rumour.  If he has any knowledge he should tell us whether these industries will materialise or not.  During the election campaign we were told that there were at least six industries, if my memory serves me right, about to come into existence in the North Mayo constituency. I met a very interesting Fianna <Col N="115" /> Fáil supporter during the election campaign, one of those broad-minded men that you do not often find in the Fianna Fáil ranks, who can crack a joke now and again.  He said to me: &ldquo;Is it not a pity that another Deputy would not die in Mayo so that we would get six more industries?&rdquo;  That was the way he looked at it.  It took the death of one Deputy for the people there to be told that there were six new industries about to spring up in the area so if another one died, according to what this man said, we would probably be told of six other industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This man said: &ldquo;If another Deputy died we would get 12 industries and that would help to keep at home thousands of young men and young women who are at present emigrating.&rdquo;  It was really a sensible argument.  I do not believe, of course, that these industries are likely to exist anywhere except in the election promises and anybody who looks at <i>Dublin Opinion</i> this week knows what they think about election promises. All I have to say is that, so far as we are concerned on this side of the House, the Parliamentary Secretary will get whatever co-operation he deserves or requires in my constituency in particular.  We shall do anything we can to encourage people with private capital to use it in the best interests of the community but, as I have said already, if all the private capital available in South or North Mayo were placed at the disposal of the Government, that in itself would be insignificant in comparison with what is required to meet the situation.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows the situation is rather serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made here to marine works, piers and harbours.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has already carried out a survey of the piers in Achill and Blacksod areas and that he realises that they have been neglected over a period of years.  The county council did not see its way to accept responsibility for the maintenance <Col N="116" /> or repair of these piers and the Department of Agriculture or Fisheries did not want to take on the responsibility either.  They are shifting the responsibility from one to the other. With that shifting of responsibility, neglect has continued and deterioration to a great extent has set in.  There is a very large population all round that area, particularly around Achill. The people are sea-minded and interested in fishing but they are given very little, if any, encouragement.  No trawlers, no fishing equipment, no piers or no assistance, good, bad or indifferent, have been forthcoming from this or any other Government over a period of years.</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the matter because I have no doubt that if the fishing industry were properly developed it would provide a large amount of employment and become a very prosperous industry.  We could even secure an export market, apart from supplying the needs of the home market.  A very prominent local business man, Mr. Sweeney, has gone a long way towards developing the industry in Achill area, and with a little encouragement and some State aid further development in that direction could take place.  People of that kind should get assistance and if the State stepped in and repaired these piers and provided local fishermen with essential equipment in order to ensure their safety, the industry would flourish.  I have said to-night, and I said it before on the occasion of the debate on the Undeveloped Areas Bill, that private enterprise, while I welcome it and while it is essential in the life of any democratic State for the development of industries such as we are considering here, is not of itself sufficient.  There is grave need for the State to step in with a view to solving this problem, which is not something which has arisen to-day or yesterday. It is a problem that has a history extending over 100 years back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated on this Estimate.  It is the first one of its kind that he has brought before the Dáil, and I hope it will be followed by others of a much fuller character. The thing that struck me most here to-night was the unanimity there was in a great deal of what was said by Deputy Blowick, Deputy Lynch, Deputy Cafferky and the last speaker. <Col N="119" /> When I was a young man I went, year after year, to the Gaeltacht, and the colleges which I attended most frequently were Ballingeary and Ballyvourney. I also attended colleges in the Western Gaeltacht.  I found those areas collectively, simply a wellspring of the Irish language.  I am sorry to have to admit that that wellspring is drying up.  Recently, I read the comments of a Bishop who gave confirmation to a mere handful of people in one of these Gaeltacht areas in which he regretted the falling-off in the population there.</P>
      <P>When we are dealing with the congested districts and with the Gaeltacht, I think it is right for us to ask ourselves: &ldquo;Who are going out of the country?  Who are coming into the country and what language is making progress in the country?&rdquo;  I am afraid that the Irish language is dying out in the country.  I believe firmly that only in the strengthening of the Gaeltacht, and in the extension of the Gaeltacht area, lies any hope for the revival of Irish as the spoken language of this country.  I was reported recently in some newspaper, quite wrongly, of course, as saying that Irish should not be taught as a living language.  Of course, it should be.  It still, thank God, is a living language.  Where it is the living language the whole education should be given through the medium of Irish.  If that is done, and if the people can be kept in these areas and if these areas can be extended in a natural manner, then there is hope for the revival of the language.</P>
      <P>The people are not flying from the Gaeltacht areas by choice.  They are leaving of necessity.  That is a process that has gone on since long before we had a native Government at all, but I think most of us had hoped when we got a native Government some 30 years ago that that process of decay would stop, and that there would be an immense revival.  I am sorry to say that hope has not been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people, as I have said, do not leave these areas by choice.  They are simply forced to go, to find a way of living where there are industries and openings for employment.  Great <Col N="120" /> numbers, of course, are flocking and have been flocking now for decades, across to Britain.  The flow to America is not so great, but the flow to Dublin has been very considerable.  I think if these people come to Dublin that, in a generation or so, even a purely Irish speaking family will lose the Irish language as the medium for the ordinary transmission of thought.</P>
    <P>I believe that the revival of the language merely through the schools is an artificial sort of revival.  We have young boys and girls leaving school with quite a good knowledge of Irish. If they had Irish surroundings they would remain Irish speakers and become more perfect in the use of the language.  But what if the reverse happens?  That is why I would make a strong plea for the establishment of industries in the Gaeltacht areas.  I know, of course, that there are difficulties there, difficulties with regard to staffing, possibly, and difficulties in regard to transport.  I know a town that is not 100 miles from here that is happy enough to have four or five factories.  The proprietors of some of those factories send cars out to collect the workers and bring them in to work. Take Ballingeary, for instance, which is quite a small village, and Ballyvourney, a few miles from it, which is also quite a small village.  About 30 years ago you had a good sprinkling of a population around there, and those people could have been brought into a central industry if one were established there.</P>
    <P>If industries are established they should be, I think, industries of a staple kind.  I know that the powers of the Parliamentary Secretary may not permit of that being done but I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary could use his influence, as I am sure he will, with the various Departments to forward this idea of establishing industries in Irish centres manned by Irish people and controlled by Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am very uneasy when I think of what may happen when Britain relaxes her munitions drive and reverts to civilian production.  I am very unhappy when I think what may occur in the United States.  We may have <Col N="121" /> tens of thousands of our people dumped back on us once these countries revert to civilian production and we have to go into competition with them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I regard some of our industries as possibly not an unmixed blessing for the country.  If they are industries that just serve the needs of nations that are up to their eyes in preparation for war and in the production of war material and which will simply fade off the map when that ceases to be the case, a great amount of misery may come to us.  These may be industries which are giving very quick and profitable returns, but they may leave a tremendous vacuum, as it were, at any time when other countries may find it convenient not to take these products from us.  For that reason I should like to see in all places such industries as would supply our own people.  I should like to see them concentrating, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas, on the establishment of permanent industries for the production of goods for our own people, industries which would survive when the world becomes normal, because it is very abnormal at the present time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan in the plea he made that the Land Commission should be stirred up because undoubtedly agriculture is the foundation of the wealth of this country.  The greater the number of people we can keep on the land the better.  The more breaking up of estates into economic holdings&mdash;I do not mean large economic holdings&mdash;the better, as more people will be kept on the land in the congested districts and throughout the country.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will use all his influence to bring these things about for the good of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Cafferky denouncing the Parliamentary Secretary and his programme and describing his statements during the recent election as propaganda. He finished by appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to do something for his district in Mayo.  It was very amusing to me to hear him denounce the whole programme and the Parliamentary Secretary's work as <Col N="122" /> propaganda and at the same time trying to get the Parliamentary Secretary to do something for his own district.  That does not show any sincerity. It is evident that these people are jealous of the Parliamentary Secretary's work so far as the Gaeltacht and the congested districts are concerned.  He forgot that this is the first time in the history of this country that any Government thought fit to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary specially in the interests of the Gaeltacht and the congested districts.</P>
      <P>I have great hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will do good work. He has already broken through the red tape, as we will call it, as between the different Departments and the Gaeltacht.  I am referring now to Gaeltacht housing.  We have had some difficulty in getting matters expedited but quite recently there has been an improvement.  We have also had difficulty in regard to turf production and the sale of turf.  There, again, the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials assisted the people whom I represent in the Kerry Gaeltacht. Nothing has been done for 30 years to help the people in the Ballin-skelligs Gaeltacht, and I now ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us a scheme similar to the tomato-growing scheme which was designed for other Gaeltacht districts.  Certainly we are entitled to consideration in that respect.</P>
      <P>Several speakers have mentioned piers.  County Kerry has a very long coastline.  Over a number of years we have had occasion to appeal time and again to the Board of Works for the repair and construction of piers and landing places there for fishermen and for small farmers who utilise those piers for the haulage of sand, seaweed and so forth.  I am confident that the Parliamentary Secretary will cut through this red tape so far as the Board of Works is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the industrial side of development and from what the Parliamentary Secretary can do about establishing industries in the Gaeltacht and congested districts, he can do great work if he can succeed&mdash;as I believe he will&mdash;in being the intermediary between the people and these <Col N="123" /> Departments.  I believe he will cut through this system of red tape which has been in operation for generations and which has made it impossible for any Government to do the right thing by the people whom we represent.  We have been appealing to the Board of Works for the past 20 years to repair the piers and harbours and landing places in County Kerry.  I made those appeals myself since I first represented the people in my constituency and others before me did likewise.  Engineers have been sent down to those places in the course of the past 20 years but nothing further has been done and probably nothing further will be done for another 20 years.  The co-ordination of the services which will be under the Parliamentary Secretary's control will bring about a great improvement.  I believe that the system will be simplified in such a way that some schemes can be sanctioned at a very early date.  That is all I have to say in appreciation of what has been done and of what I believe will be done in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no use in deluding ourselves into thinking that a Parliamentary Secretary or a Government can do wonders inside six or 12 months.  Some of the schemes to which I have referred have been under consideration by previous Governments for the past 15 or 20 years.  It would be unreasonable and ridiculous for anybody to expect that a Parliamentary Secretary or a Government can come in now and readjust the position and make satisfactory decisions and meet the requirements of the people inside a year or two.</P>
    <P>The people realise that it will be next to impossible to do that but they also realise, from the evidence they have of the work which has been done even in the past six months, that the outlook for the future is brighter than it has been and they have great hope in Deputy Lynch.  As I have said, he has visited the districts in question. He has come back and tried to simplify this system.  On behalf of the people of South Kerry whom I represent I should like him to persist in his endeavours no matter how great the <Col N="124" /> obstacles.  We are aware that there are serious obstacles in regard to some of these Departments and to their attitude to the Gaeltacht and the congested districts.  Some of the civil servants do not really know what the Gaeltacht is like.  They may go down there for a holiday for a few days or so. That is all they know of the hardships of the people in the Gaeltacht areas. It is only by close contact and persistence that we can do good work for those people and I am confident that the Parliamentary Secretary will do it.</P>

      <P>As was inevitable the debate ranged over rather a wide field of subjects.  So far as I can, I will try to answer some of the main points made by the speakers.  Listening to this debate, apart altogether from knowing the problem, it is evident that a solution of the problem of the Gaeltacht and the congested areas cannot be evolved in one simple formula.  I believe there is no one solution and that by means of various State activities and private enterprise the rehabilitation of the Gaeltacht and the congested areas generally can be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies on the other side of the House, in particular, were rather confused with regard to the main function of Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeanntair gCúng.  As I said in my opening speech, the primary function of that office is a co-ordinating function. Very often we have heard the complaint that the needs of Gaeltacht areas and of congested districts generally were being submerged in the ordinary administration of the different Departments of State.  It was, possibly, a natural development that the problems of areas where the population was not as big as in other areas might not be brought to the surface as often as they should be and that the needs of those areas, while not forgotten, might be neglected to a large extent.  It was for that reason that my office was set up.  I can safely say that I and the members of the office staff are pursuing our duties energetically and I can also say, with some justification, with good results. It is inevitable, by the very nature of the duties, that the tangible results are <Col N="125" /> not seen through the work of the office <i>per se.</i>  The office has no executive function.  In many directions the work of other Departments has been speeded up and has been enlarged in order to meet the needs of these Gaeltacht areas.  I now come to deal with some of the points made by speakers.  The first speaker who contributed to the debate was Deputy McMenamin.  He opened in a rather jeering fashion, a lead which, fortunately, was not followed by any of the other speakers.  I must at this stage say how grateful I am to the other Deputies&mdash;and to Deputy McMenamin in so far as he tried to be constructive &mdash;for the manner in which they approached this debate.  They appreciated that there were many problems &mdash;problems which were not easy of solution.  They appreciated that overnight difficulties and hardships, which were the fruit of centuries of oppression, could not be solved.  When I say &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; I refer to the fact that the office has been set up only one year.  It is less than eight months since the Supplementary Estimate was introduced in the House which set up the office officially.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin read from what he described as a &ldquo;circular&rdquo; or &ldquo;pamphlet&rdquo;.  He must have come very hastily briefed into the House when he referred to that statement as a &ldquo;circular&rdquo; or &ldquo;pamphlet&rdquo;.  It was no such thing.  If he had made proper inquiries he would have discovered that it was a translation of the opening statement that I made last autumn.  It was not intended to be a pamphlet or any formula for what I proposed to do for the solution of the problems with which I was faced.</P>
    <P>He quoted several sentences from that statement and referred to several activities which I intended to pursue. He said that, in so far as he could see, there was no evidence whatever that anything could be done in respect of any one of them.  He construed them as promises and he said in respect of these promises that there was no performance. I want to say that I at no stage made any promises with regard to what work I hoped to achieve.  I was mindful of the difficulties and the <Col N="126" /> magnitude of some of the problems and I was mindful of the fact that they might not be easily solved.  For that reason, I did not want to make any promises and I did not want to build up any false hopes in the hearts of the people who were living in these areas.  Nevertheless, taking the manner in which Deputy McMenamin presented the statement item by item, I can say here and now that considerable progress has been made in regard to each and every one of the items I referred to in my statement last autumn.  For instance, as regards the land project, it must be admitted that there is no diminution of effort by any means in the work of this project.  The Department of Agriculture is carrying out that work as energetically as it was done prior to the coming into power of the present Government.  In fact, far more work has been done in the 12 months, from the 1st of last June, than had been done in the two years in which the project had been in operation prior to that during the inter-Party Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>Let me give an instance of what has been done in that direction.  The total of cash grants made available up to the period of 1st June, 1951 amounted to £154,079.  From that to 15th April, 1952, the total cash grants paid were £403,889, representing a difference of £249,810.  Much of that work was carried out in the Gaeltacht areas.  It was carried out at the instance of Oifig na Gaeltachta and as a result of the work of the officers and of the interDepartmental Committee that meets regularly to assist me and the officers of my Department in the carrying out of that work.</P>
    <P>With regard to sea fisheries, every Deputy knows that there has been a new Sea Fisheries Act passed through this House.  As a natural consequence of that, there is now in contemplation the setting up of at least six proper fishery ports all round the western sea coast.  The project with regard to setting up proper ports and landing places was not only aided but, I think I could say with some justification, initiated in my office.</P>
    <P>Everybody must appreciate that fishing is necessary for the livelihood <Col N="127" /> of many of the residents of the western seaboard and the provision of equipment is not enough for the proper implementation of the fishery policy.  That was realised not only by me but by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and by the Government.  For the first time we are having a co-ordinated approach to the proper establishment of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>At this stage I might say with regard to the work of co-ordination that due to the setting up of the Office of Public Works, which office was charged with the carrying out of marine works generally and due to the demands made upon it by the more important harbours, there was and is at present very little staff available for the carrying out of the smaller type of work to which I referred.  It is hoped that, as a result of the interest which is now being taken in the fishery harbours and marine works, very shortly there will be a sufficient increase in the technical staff of the Office of Public Works. Possibly the fishery branch of the Department of Agriculture will have its own technical officials who will be able to plan and undertake the marine works which were hitherto in the hands of the technical staff of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural electrification, my office has been in continuous touch with the Electricity Supply Board, pushing forward extensions in the Gaeltacht and congested areas generally and keeping the demands and the needs of these areas forever before the Electricity Supply Board.  I can again say with safety that we have achieved some results in that direction too.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made some reference to the fact that Gaeltacht services were costing the taxpayer money at the present time and he suggested that it should be put on a sound commercial basis.  The Deputy must know that as well as being engaged in a commercial undertaking, Gaeltacht services are also performing a social function.  It would be very easy for Gaeltacht services, as a commercial unit, to make far more money than it is at present doing by simply gathering together <Col N="128" /> their outlying small factories and bringing them into one unit centrally situated, but then they would not be performing in that manner the function they were designed to perform.  It is necessary to keep these small factories diffused throughout the Gaeltacht generally, and for that reason there is a considerable addition to the cost of running the Gaeltacht services as a commercial undertaking.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the fact that a market for seaweed should be found for fertiliser purposes.  Unfortunately since the emergency there is no market available except the one that will always be there.  I am referring to the utilisation of seaweed for fertiliser purposes on their farms by the ordinary farming community living near the coasts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick complained that the statement which I made introducing the Estimate for Oifig na Gaeltachta was not sufficiently comprehensive. The remarks which I applied to Deputy McMenamin's statement also apply to Deputy Blowick's, namely, that, Oifig na Gaeltachta being a co-ordinating office, it is not easy to pinpoint the developments that have taken place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also asked what I was doing as the director of Oifig na Gaeltachta and what the office itself was doing with regard to rundale holdings, forestry activities in remote areas and so forth.  I agree that, until the rundale problem is completely solved, there will be very little chance of proper development in the areas where that system operates.  It is very difficult for the people in these holdings to take advantage of the ordinary schemes which are operated by the Department of Agriculture and other Departments for the betterment of their livelihoods.  The difficulties of title and the various difficulties of any co-ordinated scheme are such that, unless the people who occupy rundale holdings are properly housed and their lands properly striped, there is little likelihood of any improvement being made in their way of life.  I think it is necessary to concentrate as much as possible on the solution of that problem, but every Deputy must realise that the problem is not one <Col N="129" /> for the Land Commission, but that the rundale holders themselves must contribute largely to its solution.  If there are 19 or 20 landholders in a rundale area and if one or two of them do not co-operate in the solution of the problem or in the striping of the land, it is obvious that it is very difficult for any official to effect desired improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick was anxious to know what was the cause of the unemployment in some of the knitting centres throughout the country.  He particularly instanced Mayo.  I am sure the Deputy must know, as everybody in the House and everybody throughout the country who has come to the use of reason must know, that there has been a recession in trade, particularly in the woollen trade, not only in this country but all over the world.  It is realised by everybody that that recession must naturally affect the activities of the Gaeltacht Services factories.  It was attempted to keep the workers in these factories in full employment throughout 1951.  This was achieved even though at the time there was very little clearing of the stocks that were already in hands and of the stocks that were coming as a result of the continued operations of the workers who were retained in full employment.  It was obvious at the end of the year that these stocks were not being cleared and that to continue building them up at the rate then in progress would be commercial folly.  For that reason a decision was very reluctantly taken to put the workers in some of the Gaeltacht services factories on half-time.  It is not correct to say that they were working only for one and a half or two days a week.  The fact is that in no case were they working for less than three days per week, or half their normal working time.  I feel there is some justification for saying that already there is an easement and that we hope soon to bring the workers as near to full employment as possible.</P>
    <P>There is no diminution of employment in the Elly Bay toy factory, although there is certain difficulty being experienced in the marketing of the products of that factory.  However, it is not contemplated putting the workers on <Col N="130" /> short time.  Workers engaged in the manufacture of handwoven tweeds and in the manufacture of tweeds in the Kilear factory are being maintained in full employment.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by other speakers, we are seeking more markets abroad.  Deputies will have noticed that, as a result, there is increased provision in the current Estimate for the advertising of our commodities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick maintained that I should disclose to the House the activities of An Fóras Tionscal; that we had voted £2,000,000 for the activities of this board and that, therefore, we should know what is being done by them.  The Deputy is aware that we not only voted money under the Undeveloped Areas Act, but that we also included a section in the Act to the effect that An Fóras Tionscal was to make an annual report to the Minister.  Section 11 of the First Schedule reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall submit in such form as the Minister may direct an annual report of their activities and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious why the Minister for Industry and Commerce put that provision into the Undeveloped Areas Act. The Minister has not interfered with the activities of the board.  An Fóras Tionscal is completely independent, and I feel it is very desirable that that should be so.  Every application for a grant for the establishment or enlargement of an industry is made to the board completely on its own merits. Neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor I have ever interfered with any single proposal that has come before the board.  I feel the reason is obvious; the Minister or any member of the Government cannot then be accused of the fact that political considerations were brought to bear on any decision with regard to the granting or to the refusal of financial assistance to any group or groups that may approach the board for a grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick commented on the fact that there is a reduction in the Estimate due to stockpiling in 1950-51 which is not taking place this year. <Col N="131" /> He doubted whether the amount by which the Estimate had been reduced could be entirely attributable to stockpiling. I think he would himself remember that in 1950-51 a supplementary Vote was introduced.  It was a token Vote on that occasion of £10 but under that token Vote Gaeltacht Services Division was authorised to spend £54,000 odd for stockpiling.  In the subsequent year the provision was £225,745 but of these two provisions, totalling £280,000, £176,000 odd was spent in stockpiling.  There is a provision for replenishment of stock in the current year amounting to £85,500, so in a way the amount provided for, even though it has not been spent, will be fully utilised, and as well as current stocks being maintained there will be a certain amount of reserves in order to ensure that, as a result of any future shortages, the workers will not be forced to be put on short time.</P>
    <P>There were several other matters raised but they are of too great detail for me to deal with them at the present time.  I think, however, I should advert to the fact mentioned particularly by Deputy Butler and Deputy Duignan that the Irish language is of primary importance with regard to the administration of my office.  I believe that the language itself must be assisted by making the people who speak the language naturally happy in their own areas.  The only way of making them happy and contented is by the provision of amenities and facilities which exist in other parts of the country and by the provision of employment in so far as it can be provided.</P>
    <P>The Government, I readily agree, must come to the assistance of these people if private enterprise fails to do so.  The Undeveloped Areas Act is an inducement to private enterprise to come into these areas.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in bringing in the Bill, intimated that the greater the competitive disadvantage the greater would be the assistance.  For that reason he was trying to induce private individuals here interested in establishing factories outside the larger centres of population to go as far west <Col N="132" /> as they possibly do.  It may be that many of these factories will not be established in the Fior-Ghaeltacht areas but in so far as they will not, the Government will be mindful of the problem of the residents of these Fior-Ghaeltacht areas and will always have the betterment of their living conditions before it.  It is my particular function to ensure that not only the Government but each member of the Government in so far as the administration of his Department is concerned, will have these problems continuously before him, so that the officers of his Department will not be permitted to put any proposals designed to deal with the Gaeltacht areas on the long finger.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, my office has met with a fair measure of success.  As well as the function of co-ordinating, we have the function of initiating schemes.  Any schemes or any proposals that are initiated must naturally, by the set-up of the office, be implemented through the other Departments of State.  There are a number of schemes which are at the stage at which it would be premature for me to advert to them here but I do hope when I am introducing the Estimate in the current year that I will be able to report considerable progress in the matter of providing a better way of life, of providing worth-while projects for the people of the Gaeltacht and congested areas.</P>
