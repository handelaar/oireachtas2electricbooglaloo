      <P>The point raised by Deputy Hickey was considered, but it would be impossible to have the two systems in operation.  We must have either one or the other.  In my speech on the Second Reading I gave what I thought was good reason for resorting to the monthly system of payment, that it was really an encouragement to people to do some saving and to have some substantial sum for meeting payments that would not be regarded as ordinary weekly payments, such as buying boots or shoes for children or things of that kind.  It might be possible also to encourage the better-off people to go a little further in regard to savings. I was anxious to encourage them to put money into savings certificates by making some arrangement later on under which the money would be paid into a certain account for that purpose. The whole idea is to encourage people to save.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring last night to the question of Gaeltacht housing and this proposed arrangement, and I asked the Minister to consider the question of making these grants retrospective to August, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I did that was because representations were made to us over the past few years by people in the Gaeltacht districts who applied for a reconstruction grant asking us to arrange that the local authority would give them a grant as in the case of people who had erected houses under public utility schemes and under the direction of the Department.  I submit there is a good case to be made for the <Col N="305" /> applicants in the Gaeltacht districts who, because the legislation was not amended, were deprived of the concessions enjoyed by their neighbours in other districts.  Whilst I am sure that the people of the country, and particularly the people in the Gaeltacht districts, will appreciate the Minister's action in making it possible for the local authorities to give grants now to people in Gaeltacht districts, I appeal to him, if at all possible, to make that provision retrospective to applicants who applied as from August, 1950, and were turned down.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the grants under local authority housing schemes which were applied for before April last.  The applications are being dealt with under Sections 9, 10 and 11 of this Bill.  If it is at all possible I ask the Minister to allow the people who got the first instalment before 1st April of this year to qualify.  As I understand the section in this Bill only those people who did not get the first instalment until after April will qualify.  I submit that that can be a great hardship. The Kerry County Council had their own housing scheme and advertised for applicants under that scheme. They received hundreds of applications. Now it would appear that most of those people, particularly those who received the first instalment before April, will be ruled out under this arrangement.  The Minister could allow the word &ldquo;notified&rdquo; to stand because the notification would not usually be forwarded within the prescribed period.  I hope that that matter will be rectified before this measure becomes law.</P>
    <P>The increase in the maximum of the reconstruction grants has been referred to by other speakers in this debate.  In congested districts and especially on the mountain side you will usually find the small three-roomed house.  A sum of £80 is allowed for the reconstruction of that type of house.  I appeal to the Minister to increase that sum to £100 in the case of the three-roomed house as in the case of a four-roomed house. There is a very good case to be made for that increase.</P>
    <P>A big improvement in the Bill is the provision reducing the period of 15 <Col N="306" /> years to ten years between the provision of the first and second reconstruction grants, though it applies only to thatched houses.  I urge the Minister to broaden that provision so as to bring in people who live in the Gaeltacht and in the congested districts and whose houses have what we call locally a &ldquo;galvanised roof&rdquo;.  There are not many such houses, but there are a few, and I think that they should be given the same concession in regard to the ten-year period as is given in respect of thatched houses in those districts.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to county council schemes.  We were anxious to avail of that type of scheme because it provided for the workers and the small farmers in our county.  The scheme which the Kerry County Council adopted was a very good scheme, but if this new arrangement will cut across it now it will mean.  I think, that we shall have 1,200 applicants.  These people will have to be segregated and dealt with under Sections 9, 10 and 11, with different gradings and different valuation. But we had already more or less done the same thing.  I submit that there is a possibility that most of these people would be ruled out in that area. Again, I would ask the Minister to see if it is not possible to have the people receive the first instalment before April.  That in itself would cater for a large number of the applicants referred to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty tried last night to make the case that this Bill was detrimental to the people generally and that it was no improvement.  In reply, I claimed that it was a vast improvement and that the people throughout the country appreciate it and realise that it is a big improvement. For the first time in the history of this country local authorities are enabled to give housing grants to people in Gaeltacht districts.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the manner in which that was handled because for years and years we had been asking the last Government to get the Ministers for Lands and Local Government to agree so that local authorities could get those grants.  We were informed that it would entail legislation and some arrangements by <Col N="307" /> both Departments, but in this measure the Minister has taken steps to meet our requirements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to express my appreciation to the Minister. All parties in Kerry, anyway, irrespective of politics, paid tribute to the arrangement which is now being put forward by the Minister.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have put forward when making his final arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the grant of £50 for water supply and sewerage, I would like to ask the Minister whether it will dovetail into the grant that is already in existence in the Department of Agriculture for the supply of water to houses in rural areas?  Will a person availing of this grant be excluded from applying to the Department of Agriculture for a similar grant for a supply of water to his house?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister for making these generous provisions.  I have listened very carefully to the speeches made during this debate.  In my opinion, many of the speeches made by representatives of local public bodies here would have been much more appropriate in the local bodies which they represent.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, there were complaints from Cork Deputies above all objecting to the local public bodies, whether in Cork City or County, giving grants to institutions for the erection of houses for their employees.  Reference was made to the banks applying to the local authority for the grant of £400. I think any local public body would be well advised to meet not only the bank institutions but all other large industrial institutions as well if they undertake to provide the houses for the people.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that the Minister was quite right in insisting upon those people having their rights even though they are in bank institutions because we must remember that the employees of the banks are citizens just as we are and are equally entitled to their rights.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be of considerable advantage to local authorities. If such institutions provide homes for their own employees there should be no objection.  We, as a matter of fact, 18 months ago, offered a certain industry sites at a rent of £2 per year and were prepared to advance £400 per house and rightly so because, in the long run, there will be a considerable saving to local public bodies if those arrangements can be entered into with those people.  I congratulate the Minister upon insisting that those people have rights.  Every employee of a bank is a working man and is entitled to those rights just as a builder's labourer is entitled to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints about the difficulties experienced by agricultural labourers and rural workers being enabled to secure their own homes.  Any citizen of this State who owns a piece of property upon which a house could be built is entitled to all the grants available, and no one can deny him them.  I think that the Minister was wise in introducing this Bill and making the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I feel I must reply&mdash;a matter which brings us back to the action of the Minister for Finance in 1948, when he raised the loan charges from 2½ per cent. to 3¼ per cent., thereby putting no less than 15/-per £100 of an impost upon every blackcoat worker who endeavoured to provide his own home.  During the term of office of the Coalition Government in not one single case did a <Col N="309" /> Labour Deputy, a Cumann na nGael Deputy, a Clann na Poblachta Deputy or any other Deputy in this House protest against that impost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government makes available 2½ per cent. for the benefit of the people whom it is our duty to house there is no reason why that should not have been continued, but what do we find?  We find £9 15s. per year of an additional impost on the blackcoat worker who endeavours to provide his own home.  That is hardly the way to encourage a young man about to marry and settle down and provide his own home.  That is not for one year.  That will continue for the next 35 years.  These are some of the things which people should keep before their minds.</P>
      <P>When any young man or woman decides to marry, settle down and provide a home, it is the duty of the public body who is responsible to provide not only the money but the ground upon which they should have an opportunity to build the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very refreshing to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done that consistently since 1932 and we can claim to-day that, in proportion to our population and our rateable valuation, we have housed more people under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act than any other public body in the State, including the City of Dublin.  I think if public bodies generally would knuckle down to the job of providing houses there would be less complaints. A great deal of the delay can be attributed to the local representatives themselves.  The law is there.  All we have to do is to avail of it and make sufficient provision to give every citizen who wants it an opportunity of providing himself with his own home. I congratulate the Minister and the House on the reception that has been given to this Bill.  I hope that greater results will accrue from it than have accrued from similar Bills in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing problem is a national problem and it is desirable that we should discuss it apart altogether from politics.  I am glad that the Minister has introduced this Bill. To a large extent it is a continuation of the 1950 Act.  I am glad that he has increased the floor area in relation to reconstruction grants.  I am glad he has increased the grant.  Many of the older farmhouses in the country have a very large floor space and it is only right that they should qualify under the new ceiling provided in this measure.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has continued the system of free grants by local authorities.  I think more co-operation is desirable in this matter as between the Department and local authorities, with a view to speeding up the payment of these grants.  Where partial payment is made, the local authority should be notified of that fact.  In County Kerry people make representations to the local authorities in relation to the hold up in the payment of the grants, and the only reply we can give them is that we have received no notification from the Department. I think that immediately sanction is given for either a partial grant or the complete grant the local authority should be notified of that fact.  That would enable the local authority to give the applicants money they badly need to pay debts they have incurred either with the contractors or the merchants from whom they secured their materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problem in relation to housing is the question of finance.  I think the problem should be solved by the flotation of a national loan.  We all know that the rents people are asked to pay to-day are beyond the capacity of most of them.  In Tralee rents run as high as 28/- per week for a four-roomed house and 34/8 for a five-roomed house.  These houses were built in order to clear slum areas.  It is not unusual in these new building sites to find in one house a tenant who holds a very high position in the town while his next-door neighbour may be a carpenter or an ordinary labourer. I think that is a matter that would need to be examined.  A loan should be floated to assist local authorities to <Col N="311" /> build houses which could be let at reasonable rents.  If people have to pay these high rents to which I have referred, it means that we are, to some extent, depriving them of their daily food or some other amenities.  Money may be set aside for provisions during the week, but when the rent collector calls on Monday morning the rent must be paid or the tenant must get out.</P>
    <P>There is too great a delay between the Department and local authorities in relation to the sanctioning of sites, of schemes and the approval of tenders.  The Department is too slow. I think there should be some person in the Department who would go down and discuss the problem with local authorities.  At the moment, there is some difference of opinion in relation to the construction of roads as to whether they are to be of tarmacadam or concrete.  I think there should be an inspector who would go down and discuss matters like that and thereby obviate the delay that takes place between the Department and the local authorities.  With relation to direct labour schemes, some difficulty has arisen in County Kerry in relation to the laying of sewerage and water to a scheme that is almost completed.  The houses will be ready for occupation within the next month or two.  When the engineering staff of the local authority was asked to lay the sewerage and water they said they could not do it.  It was a matter for the contractor who did the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in the Department is altogether too long.  When the county council asked the contractors to do the job on a piece and time basis the Department would not sanction the figures.  We then decided to do it by direct labour.  It was again turned down by the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I hope there will in future be better co-operation between the Department and the local authorities in relation to the grants, and that when either the partial or the complete grant has been sanctioned the Department will notify the local authority so that that body will be in a position to pay the grants to the applicants as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I would like to raise in relation to this Housing Bill.  It is a matter only of local importance in my constituency. For some time past in a particular portion of Offaly, the Pullough area, there has been considerable concern by reason of existing regulations concerning housing grants. In this area, where over 1,000 people live in 80 houses, there is considerable need for housing.  The local people, traditionally, have built their own houses of a very small type.  The reason is that the area is a bog area and only houses of a very small type can be built in it.  Now, in the last two or three years, applicants for housing grants in the Pullough area have discovered that the kind of house they desire to build, and the only house which can be built there, is too small and does not comply with the housing regulations.  That has meant that the people in this entire area cannot avail of the financial provisions contained in the Housing Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I submitted a memorandum to the Department dealing with this problem.  While I do not want to discuss administration in relation to the Bill, I do suggest that power should be taken in it to enable <Col N="313" /> the Minister to use his discretion in relation to local problems of this kind. It would be quite possible, in this particular area in Offaly, to devise a special type of house which might not be suitable for other parts of the country, but which, nevertheless, would enable the Housing Acts to operate there.  I urge on the Minister that the matter should be considered.  It may be that other special problems arise in other parts of the country.  If the Minister took power in the Bill to provide, by regulation, for particular areas of the country, then these problems would not arise.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably at a later stage of the Bill an amendment dealing with this particular problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no major point of criticism voiced in the course of this debate on the proposals contained in the Bill.  I will, however, endeavour to deal with some few matters of interest to Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  I suppose one of the reasons for the sort of unanimity of approach that we have in this House to any proposals dealing with housing is that we have reached the stage now when it is not easy to see what better facilities can be extended both to local bodies and private persons who are interested in and affected by this housing question.  There is no doubt about it that if money, and all that it means, were as freely available as Deputy Hickey would like it to be the problem of dealing with housing would be quite a simple one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My process of reasoning is influenced by the fact that, since that is undoubtedly the case in so far as our people here and the people in the outside world are concerned, there must be something in it.  It just cannot be explained away in the simple fashion that Deputy Hickey would like us to believe.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey yesterday asked me a question dealing with the effect of the rate of interest on our activities, or the effect that it was likely to have.  He asked me to address any remarks that I might wish to make to that subject.  I said that all I knew at that moment was that the rate of interest affected my own overdraft.  There is no doubt about it, apart altogether from the effect that the cost of money has on the provision of houses and on the rent at which houses may be let to tenants, that, of course, the cost of money also has an effect on quite a number of other very vital matters.  It has an effect on the farmer who is handling his business on the basis of an overdraft and so on. I am prepared to admit that, if a situation could be reached where these impediments and difficulties could be brushed aside, this world would be a very simple and a very free and easy place in which to live.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies have spoken about the problems which confront incoming tenants in many of the houses that are being erected by local bodies, and I quite realise that, <Col N="315" /> having regard to present-day costs, anyone who moves about through the world at all can easily see the problem it must be for many of these families to pay these rents.  When you come to look at it from the other side you will see that, as far as we thought it was reasonable, we have called upon the taxpayer, as I have often stated before, to make a very generous contribution to this problem, and that the local authority itself has done its share in so far as the ratepayers are concerned.  In fact, in some cases, they have gone so far as to create a feeling amongst the ratepayers that perhaps they have gone too far.  I am not suggesting that that is right, but that is a feeling that is abroad amongst the ratepayers of these local bodies.</P>
      <P>The next person to fit into this picture is the tenant who is going to be given the occupancy of the house. Again while one can see that the tenant is the person who will feel the pinch the longest, at the same time, there is no use in creating the impression that the Government or the local body can in some mysterious way ease that burden.  It can only be met as far as I can see in the manner in which we have been attempting to meet it in the years gone by, and that is by a joint effort on the part of the people of the State, the ratepayers in the area in which the houses are being built and the tenants who come to occupy them.  Even after that co-operation has been secured&mdash;and the results are available in many cases, as I say&mdash; it does not follow that everybody will be entirely satisfied, but it is the best that we can hope to do.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputies referred to the proposals that are put forward here to take the place of Section 7 of the Act of 1950.  Since the publication of these proposals I have received a number of letters from people who had intentions of one kind or another to build houses for themselves. <Col N="316" /> The line of thought shown in these letters was influenced, naturally, by the way in which these proposals affected the individuals concerned Now I am prepared to admit freely that in the proposals that are outlined here, which are entirely permissive as far as the local authority is concerned, the valuation and wage limits are very low.  Some Deputies here have criticised them rather violently and some people outside did likewise because of that fact.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Act of 1950 was a permissive section also, and many county councils drew up schemes under that section.  To tell the truth, I thought the section itself gave too much freedom at the time to these local bodies.  I certainly felt, when I saw the section being operated, that that line of thought was entirely justified.  It gave the councils freedom to adopt their own scheme, and once the council started to frame their own scheme the difficulty arose that, if they did attempt, as they did in nearly all cases, to impose some kind of limit as to the type of people who would benefit, they were forced, even where they did make such an attempt, by pressure of one kind or another from their own members or from the public outside, to move along, step by step, until, in most cases, they reached the point when it was what was called a free-for-all scheme.  Those of them who drew up a scheme under the section have been operating on that basis since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were then other councils who, when they examined the matter closely, decided that they could not face up to the financial burden that the adoption of such a scheme would entail and they had no scheme at all. I felt satisfied that, if some such section were to be continued in our housing laws, there was no use in leaving it to the councils to adopt their own scheme.  It was, to my mind, a bit unfair to them in the sense that no member of a council would like to be placed in the position of having to draw a line against any particular individual simply because his valuation was £35 5s. or £35 10s., or because the income limit was over this <Col N="317" /> or that amount.  Because of the awkward position in which members of a council were placed, I could see from the trend of events that if Section 7 were to remain as it was, the councils&mdash;in fact, some of them had indicated their view on the matter and had made it clear&mdash;would not adopt a section so wide as was that section.</P>
    <P>Let me say this to those who complain that the valuation limit and the income limit as set out are far too low, that those valuation limits and wage limits are low because of my desire to frame a scheme in the Bill or in the Act itself that councils can freely adopt or reject and that will not impose upon them burdens that might frighten them away from adopting any scheme at all.  Where the man who finds himself earning £500 or £600 says to me: &ldquo;You should raise that a little bit higher so as to enable me to get a grant,&rdquo; my reply to that man is: &ldquo;I can easily raise both the valuation and the wage limits but in raising them I am perhaps doing something that will prevent the council in the area in which you live adopting a scheme at all, and not only will you fail to get any benefit but those much worse off than you will also be deprived of it, because of that fact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My attitude therefore to Section 7 and my reasons for substituting this scheme are that in trying out an experiment of this nature, it is always better to start on a conservative basis and if it is found in the course of a couple of years that it is possible to do better, it can be done; it is much easier to become more generous than to become more restrictive.</P>
    <P>I am anxious therefore that the councils who have adopted schemes under Section 7 and the councils who have not would adopt this scheme because I believe it will not impose too heavy a financial burden upon them. I am especially anxious in the cases where schemes under Section 7 were adopted that schemes of supplementary grants will be continued and that there will not be the situation where a couple of hundred people who have received these local authority supplementary grants will be able to say to <Col N="318" /> those who mean to build in the future: &ldquo;We just got away with it when you were out in the cold.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many people, I suppose. who might build houses or who have built houses in the last two years and who have obtained grants who will not be covered by the new scheme under Sections 9, 10 and 11.  I feel, however. that this new scheme under Sections 9, 10 and 11 will fairly meet the sort of persons that we have in mind-namely, the small farmers of up to £35 valuation.  I do not know what percentage of farmers would be represented by a £35 valuation, but I think it would be about 80 per cent. It is a good thing to give a start to those of the lower income group who wish to build houses on the basis set out in this Bill.  I am not saying that many of them will be able to build houses, but some of them will, and for those the help provided in Section 11 will, to my mind, be some advance. I hope that all county councils, including those who operated Section 7&mdash; many of those did not operate that section at all&mdash;will all adopt this scheme.  I feel it will help to blot out a great many of the small houses and the houses in a bad state of repair in rural areas owned by people who have not, in the past, been able to get any assistance at all, even the assistance which was provided by the State and which, owing to rising costs, was not sufficient to enable them to get on with the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy for us to make sure when this Bill becomes an Act that it will cover just exactly what we desire.  What I would like to see it cover is this: under Section 7 of the 1950 Act, councils prepared schemes that were to continue up to the 31st March, 1951.  The council that I have in mind made it quite clear to all those who applied that the work of construction would require to be completed by the 31st March, 1952.  I think they also made it a condition that the approval certificate in respect of the erection of a house which issues from the appointed officer would require to have been issued on a certain date.  These were the conditions that were attached to the payment of the supplementary grant.  In that case there were dozens of applications made which would fully qualify under that general sort of outline. However, it so happened that the councils never actually notified these people that the supplementary grants would be paid to them.  Of course, it would be absurd to debar people in these circumstances from obtaining the supplementary grant simply because the local body concerned had not notified the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will endeavour under this measure, that any person who applied for a housing grant under the 1950 Housing Act and who received the approval certificate to proceed with the erection of his house, but who, at the same time, applied to the local authority before the 31st March&mdash;I <Col N="320" /> would prefer that the 31st March would be the operative date&mdash;for a supplementary grant and received no notification, to provide in this measure for the payment of the money to such person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to leave county councils a certain amount of discretion in the matter of completion. I would not like to close down entirely on that.  I feel there could be no question of allowing people to qualify who might send in their application, say, in the month of March, 1952, have no work at all done and commit the council to the payment of the supplementary grant, simply on the basis that application had been made before that date, although no construction work had been done.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. Crowley and, I think Deputy Flynn raised the matter of making the payment of the grant under Sections 9, 10 and 11 retrospective to 1st August, 1950.  I do not know whether Deputy Flynn and Deputy Mrs. Crowley had in mind the grants as provided under these sections or the grants as provided in the scheme adopted by the council under Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  So far as these proposals go, the retrospective effect would relate to the scheme enshrined in the Bill, and if the Deputies had in mind that the benefits of the scheme in existence, the terms of which I cannot remember, should be restrospective rather than what is in the Bill, it raises another issue and, as I have said in another regard, we can discuss it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of matters important to the Deputies who raised them were mentioned in the course of the discussion, but I hardly think it necessary to refer to them all.  One of these was <Col N="322" /> the reason why local bodies asked an applicant for Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act money to provide sureties. Deputy Murphy and, I think, Deputy Desmond raised a point, as did also somebody on our own side.  These local bodies are free to take the security of the building and the site and give the money on that security alone, or to do otherwise.  I remember replying to a parliamentary question with regard to Donegal, where the same situation exists as apparently exists in Cork, and I do not think it would be right for a Minister, even if he had the power, to attempt to give directions to local bodies in a matter of that nature. The Cork County Council is composed of all classes of people, as all other councils are, and Deputies will find that they are a fairly sensible body of men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but you will find that if the county council were to give him a direction in a matter of that nature, the manager might very easily come to heel and do as they requested. I know that in Donegal the manager did leave this question to the council, and the council, by a majority, decided on the two sureties.  It would not be right, even if the Minister could do so, to influence or attempt to influence councils in that regard.  They have their own powers of persuasion, and if Deputy Murphy, who is a member of the council, has a good case, I imagine that there are sensible, well-intentioned people who will listen to him.  If that is so, he ought to be able to secure a reversal of a previous attitude.</P>

      <P>The question was brought before a meeting of the Cork County Council within the last 12 months when the vote was 50-50 and the matter was allowed to stand over. Will the Minister not agree with me that it is very difficult for a small farmer or businessman to ask his neighbours, no matter how good friends they are or what his standing is&mdash;he may be a man of the highest honour <Col N="323" /> and integrity&mdash;to act as sureties for him?  When people know that his circumstances are not very good, they will not be inclined to act as surety for a period of 35 years or to commit their families to that obligation.  It is very difficult for that type of person to get the sureties and I cannot see why if in one county a mortgage on the house is quite sufficient, the Department should not extend it to the whole country. I cannot see why we should have one law in one county, where a mortgage is accepted and another law in Cork, where sureties are required. There are people who should benefit from the provisions of the Act who are unable to benefit because they cannot get the sureties.  The people getting these loans are people who are quite able to build houses, if these loans were never made available, and their main reason for applying for loans is to avoid interfering with their capital or perhaps to secure some advantage in the matter of income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely different question.  The awkwardness of going to one's neighbour to ask him to sign a bill for one does not arise here. Here it is a matter of the county council as a body borrowing money which it will lend to ratepayers and others in the county for the provision of houses, and it is for the people who borrow the money in the first instance to stipulate the conditions on which they will lend it out to individual applicants.  I do not see in what way the Department can or should enter into that matter.  Surely those who act for the community at large and borrow in bulk to lend out to individual applicants should have the right to approach the matter in their own way. Some ask for sureties and some do not, and, no matter what arguments may be advanced to sustain the other case, I still maintain that, if the case is a good one, as the Deputy seems to think it is, it is his fault if he cannot convince his colleagues who would like to see people facilitated just as much as he would that an easier course should be pursued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies with regard to the people who should get these loans from local bodies.  Some Deputies suggested that certain people should not be allowed to secure a loan under the Small Dwellings Acts at all, but that again is a matter for the local body.  There is no hard and fast rule laid down.  They make their own arrangements and it would not be a bad idea if they sifted these applications and ensured that only those who require money in a genuine way would be able to get it.</P>
      <P>I intended to say a word or two on letting grants.  I am providing here that what the then Ministers and legislatures intended by the 1950 and 1948 Acts should be the law will prevail. When this letting grant provision was inserted in Section 19 of the 1948 Act, it was an invitation to those to whom it applied to build houses on the assumption that the facilities which were promised to them would be made available. Apart altogether from whether it was a desirable provision or not&mdash;I will come to that later&mdash;they were given the assurance they would get these facilities if they erected these houses.  At a later stage, when some local bodies saw a flaw in the Act and side-stepped their responsibilities, when in spite of the Minister's ruling to the contrary they still insisted on taking their own line, it became the duty of the Parliament here to make sure that the guarantees given to these people would be carried out.  I have been reading some reports of discussions of local bodies where some of these letting grant houses were erected and I notice that it was on a case or two where certain banks provided some houses for their employees that there was most concentration.  I was saying to myself that it was not popular in these days to be a banker at all.  When I looked up the number of houses that had been provided under the section altogether.  I found that the number provided by banks was very, very small.  Indeed, the number provided under the section in every shape and form was very small, but the percentage of the total number that the banks erect was scarcely noticeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> What is wrong with this provision? If Bord na Móna, the sugar company, the banks or any industrial concern here proceed to erect houses for their workers and thereby relieve the local body of the responsibility of doing this, what was wrong with that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why, simply because the Munster and Leinster Bank in Tralee or the Ulster Bank somewhere else builds two or three houses for their employees, one should say: &ldquo;These houses are not freely available for letting, inasmuch as the people going to get the tenancies are earmarked in advance; that is not fair, and the local rates should not be called upon to contribute in that case.&rdquo;  The strange part of it is that, in the case of some of the local bodies who indulge in that talk, when you go down to see their housing schemes, you find they have housed some of those bank officials themselves in their houses, at much heavier expense to the State and the local authority.  I have seen them myself and I have seen it happen in local bodies where a few months later they were proceeding to denounce everyone because the bank came along and sought to get what the law promised, £400 per house at £40 per year over ten years, £13 per year of which has to be paid by the local body.  Not only is it right that we should make doubly sure that those who are given an assurance that these grants would be available for them would get them, but I think it right that we should encourage it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not give the actual number, but only 500 or 600 houses were built under this section since it was inserted in our housing legislation.  Even though the number is small, there is a possibility that it could be a help to many industrial concerns in the future. I would like to see the attitude of some of those who have been critical of this, if an industry were introduced to their own town or constituency.  If housing were short there and if the local body were unable to come to the <Col N="326" /> rescue, would it not be a grand thing that a section like this would be there at hand to help and encourage other interests to go about the provision of those houses?</P>
    <P>Simply because the banks build 3, 4. 5, or 6 houses, out of 500 or 600, for a few of their employees&mdash;they may be blackcoated workers, but, in many cases they are not very well off people at all and in many cases they have been actually included in the list of tenants submitted for the occupancy of houses erected by local bodies&mdash;we should not, just because we think that it would ring fairly well in the ears of the public, try to show that the banks should build their own houses for their workers.  We should not rely on that sort of misrepresentation to denounce the idea or refuse to work a section that is a very desirable one?</P>

      <P>We can debate this some time.  When there is an appeal to us in any particular case, the rent is vetted. You must remember that in some of these cases the houses erected are fairly expensive ones.  I have in mind a case in Cork&mdash;I think in Youghal&mdash; where I saw houses being erected that looked fairly formidable and fairly expensive. They were being erected to serve a very useful purpose and, even with the payment of a grant over ten years of £40 a year, it should not be expected that these houses could be let to the tenants at the sort of rents that would be chargeable by a local body for a house that was not at all up to that standard.</P>

      <P>Of course, there was a time when it was to the advantage of Cork and Dublin to borrow in the open market, and I suppose now the advantage is the other way, and it is only natural that not only a Cork Deputy but a Deputy from any place would try to have it both ways as it suited him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing it. That question can be discussed locally. I am raising another point.  The Minister knows the restriction on the sites available in the city.  I am only raising the general question of the availability of finance.  The Minister knows that when we went to the stock market on the last occasion only about one-third of the issue was filled.  That is the difficulty we are up against.  I <Col N="328" /> know the Government has never let us down, and I am sure they will not do it now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy raised a matter with which we will deal I hope at a later stage, that is, the problem that arises because of the shortage of building sites in the city and the desirability of extending the S.D.A. outside that area.  That is another matter to which consideration will be given and I hope we will be able to meet the reasonable requirements of the local authority there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to state my attitude on a number of things, such as direct labour.  I have already done so in the House on a number of occasions and I will not go over it now.  I have been urged as to the desirability of increasing the grants on houses and questions have been raised about sites that are being leased to individuals by local bodies for the provision of houses.  I have been told to take steps to ensure that these sites would not be used by those persons to charge exorbitant rents.  We do in <Col N="329" /> fact take action to protect the public in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure that when I conclude, I will have missed dozens of questions that may seem small to me, but which were important to the Deputies who raised them.  We will have to let it go at that.  If the Deputies concerned are not satisfied, they can raise them on the Committee Stage, when, I hope, we will be able to clear up a number of matters that may still be in doubt.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the allocation of grants for houses where the floor area is less than 500 square feet?  I know they are very small, but there are a number of families in my area where there are only one or two members, and where they have not room to extend their premises.  They are quite satisfied.  The rents are lower in these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised that point.  I do not see how you could do that.  You must have some limit.  I do not profess to understand how the special problem arises in the area referred to by Deputy O'Higgins.  A house of 500 square feet is a very small house.  As to giving the Minister discretion, I suppose the Minister might, in some cases, like to have it, but, in a general sort of way, he would be glad not to have it, and it is better that he should not have it. I do not see how you could reduce the floor space below 500 square feet, and I do not think there is any hope at all of our being able to meet that request.  Whatever problems may arise or may exist in any part of the country because of that limit, I do not see how they could be met.</P>

      <P>The area which I mentioned is a small compact area. There are 1,000 people living in 80 houses.  That will give an idea of the overcrowding.  In the last two years there has been a considerable amount of interest locally in this problem in Pullough.  A number of organisations have made suggestions to the different Deputies as to the possibility of devising some plan for <Col N="330" /> a local house that would meet the requirements there.  Would the Minister and his Department, some time in coming weeks, perhaps, get a special report on the situation there? If the Minister thinks the 500 square feet house can be put into operation then, that would meet my objection, but I am told that that is far too big for this particular area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,335,710 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
      <P>The gross Estimate for the Defence Vote for the financial year ending 31st March, 1953, totals £6,646,955, the net figure being £6,503,570, showing a net increase on last year's figure of £1,035,610.  The gross figure is made up of the pay, allowances and maintenance of the Army and First and Second Line Reserves, costing slightly over £4,000,000.  The pay and allowances of civilians with units and at headquarters is estimated to cost £775,000, while warlike and other stores will cost approximately £1,600,000, the balance including a figure of £63,000 for Civil Defence, being by way of miscellaneous and other expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate has been framed on the basis of a peace establishment of 12,743 all ranks, including 1,270 officers. This figure was approved by the Government on the recommendation of the General Staff as the minimum Army strength which, with Reserves, would be necessary to enable expansion to be carried out with the least possible delay on an active-service footing. <Col N="332" /> The present Estimate does not provide for the full number, but has been reached on the basis of the progress of recruiting and in the experience of the general trend of discharges of time-expired soldiers.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I think it proper to say that if the present trend of recruitment continues it may be necessary at a later stage to review the financial provisions in the light of the actual Army strength.  When the Estimate was framed it was assumed that the average strength over the year would be approximately 20 per cent.  lower than the full peace establishment and a deduction has been made on this basis from the sub-heads concerned.</P>
    <P>The pay and maintenance of the First Line Reserve is estimated to cost £83,865 making provision for 4,790 all ranks.  The provision made falls short of that made in the previous year by approximately 20 per cent.  The decline in the strength of the First Line Reserve is a cause of concern but an effort made last year to recruit men directly into the Reserve proved fruitless. With the increasing strength of the permanent force, it is hoped that the First Line Reserve will in due course receive a steady influx from men who have completed their engagement with the permanent force.</P>
    <P>The provision for the Second Line Reserve (F.C.A.) covers an average strength over the year of 21,000 all ranks anticipated to cost approximately £255,000.  The attendance at training of this reserve has not been as regular as might have been anticipated and provision is made for approximately 10,000 all ranks undergoing training during the year with something over 1,000 attending for special courses.  The Second Line Reserve is composed of partially trained men but in case of an emergency would be an important factor in assisting the permanent force to reach an active-service footing.  In this arm of the force also there has been a decrease in strength from 33,000 to 21,000 all ranks.</P>
    <P>In addition to the military establishment set out above, the Estimate also provides for the pay and allowances of 2,100 civilians with units and at headquarters. Some 1,500 of these employees <Col N="333" /> are attached to units and are composed of tradesmen, helpers, semiskilled workers, storemen and analogous grades.</P>
    <P>Of the gross figure £1,600,000 provided in the Estimates for stores required during the year, a sum of £928,000 has been provided for warlike stores, including naval requirements. It will be appreciated that with the general world rearmament situation supplies of warlike stores are difficult to acquire.  The gross provision under the sub-head amounts to £1,681,000 and while every effort will be made to acquire warlike stores up to the full value of the programme, it cannot be stated in present conditions whether it may be possible to secure within the year all the items for which a gross provision has been made in the sub-head but if these stores can be obtained they will of course be gladly accepted.  Wherever such material could be found, efforts have been made to secure it.  Contracts in the neighbourhood of £850,000 have been placed for suitable warlike stores of which sum £265,000 has already been advanced in accordance with the conditions of the contract.  Deliveries against these orders have already begun and a steady flow of the remainder throughout the year is expected. Negotiations have also been opened for the purchase of other types of warlike stores and arrangements in this direction have now been completed by the signing of the contract.  Other contracts for the purchase of small arms ammunition have been made and these are expected to bear fruition within the financial year.</P>
    <P>General stores, as distinct from the warlike stores of the Army, will cost approximately £720,000.  This sum is comprised of approximately £362,000 for cloth for uniforms, £88,000 for renewal of mechanical transport, £71,000 for aircraft renewals, and the balance on the purchase of other corps equipment and materials for maintenance and minor new works.</P>
    <P>Under the head for civil defence, the gross estimated requirements are £263,000 approximately, but again it cannot be stated whether all the <Col N="334" /> material and equipment for which provision has been made will become available, and for that reason a deduction from this sub-head has been made, leaving the net figure £63,000 approximately. In the same way as warlike stores, any material for which provision has been made will be accepted, and should the cost of this material exceed the net provision in the sub-head, the matter will be reviewed later in the year in regard to the financial circumstances existing on the Vote generally</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that civil defence is making definite progress and, while the development may be slow, the whole is working towards a concerted plan.  Broadly speaking, the scheme envisages three main stages, first, the appointment and training of civil defence officers, secondly, the appointment and training of instructors and, thirdly, the recruitment of volunteers to man the varied services which will make up civil defence.  While we have completed the first stage, progress is slow on the remainder, due to the non-availability of the appropriate equipment. The School of Civil Defence opened in June, 1951.  Twenty-six civil defence officers have been appointed for specified cities and towns.  Five courses have been given at the school, and 146 persons, comprising civil defence officers, officers of local authorities, health and the Garda Síochána have attended.  Early this year work began on the building of training ranges.  It is anticipated that these will be available in July, when a course for general instructors will be held.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the Estimates include a sum of £20,000 by way of Grant-in-Aid to the Irish Red Cross Society.  The figure shown last year of £21,000 included a grant for relief of distress in Italy following the floods, so that the net grant to the society was £1,000.  In explanation of this large increase, I might say that the Irish Red Cross Society initiated a recruiting drive and a general reorganisation of the society.  The establishment of units consisting of trained members who would co-operate with the Army Medical Corps in time <Col N="335" /> of emergency and assist in civil defence was the primary objective aimed at by the society.</P>
    <P>The recruiting drive met with considerable success and following the initial training which has been completed at a number of centres, the recruitment of members for the Voluntary Aid Division is now being initiated. In addition to recruitment, the society, as part of its reorganisation programme, commenced a scheme for the building up of stocks of emergency hospital supplies, uniforms and accessories as well as for the replacement of its fleet of ambulances which require renewal.</P>
    <P>The society is not and could not be expected to be in a position to meet the exceptional expenditure incurred or contemplated on the measures and activities in question which have a direct bearing on national defence.  It is estimated that for the period ending on the 31st March, 1953, the society will have expended on these matters a sum of approximately £24,500.  In addition, a sum of £12,000 approximately will have been spent by the society in connection with activities directly calculated to increase the society's membership and thereby useful from the national defence viewpoint. One thousand eight hundred pounds approximately have been paid by way of Grants-in-Aid to the society towards this exceptional expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the society will have a deficit of over £15,000 in its accounts by the end of March, 1953, with no liquid assets available.  In the circumstances and having regard to the expenditure which I have mentioned on activities relating to national defence, I am making provision of a Grant-in-Aid of £20,000 to the society in the financial year 1952-53.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining provisions in the Estimate, one item of £37,500 for advertisements may call for comment; £37,000 of the figure has been provided to cover advertisements to aid the campaign for recruits during the year.  The House will, no doubt, be glad to learn of the success of the recruiting campaign and here I should like to pay a tribute to the help and assistance <Col N="336" /> which has been given by the Dublin Press and provincial papers.  Since the advent of the campaign upwards of 3,000 recruits have been accepted and of these a large number are boys under 18 who have responded to the innovation call of youths of this age to enter the service of the Army of their country.  This figure fills a large portion of the gap between strength and the establishment and with the continuation of the campaign throughout the year it is hoped to bring the strength up to full establishment.  I am glad to say that the standard of recruits offering themselves is most satisfactory.</P>
    <P>During the year, courses continued at the military college and the various corps schools.  Selected officers were sent abroad for courses of a military and technical nature.</P>
    <P>The general training of the Army is on a satisfactory footing and is all that might be expected of it from the resources available, while the health of the troops maintains an excellent standard. The co-ordination of the continuation of education for the younger recruits is in hands and these boys will not suffer in that regard by reason of their service in the Army.</P>
    <P>There is little need for me to remind the House that the world situation has not eased in any respect, and while the nations of the world, big and small, are strengthening their defences either on their own initiative or in combination with other States, this country, for reasons which have been so often stressed in this House, must rely on its own resources and on its own strength.  As one of the last countries in the world relying for its defences upon a voluntary army, the Government feel that this faith in its citizens is justified and are striving to build around a strong cadre of highly trained officers and men a nucleus which, with the Reserve, the F.C.A. and numerous other men, already trained or partly trained in the country, would, in a very short space of time, resolve itself into an efficient fighting machine.</P>
    <P>For their part the Government are investigating possibilities of procuring <Col N="337" /> up-to-date equipment and armaments and making arrangements by courses abroad to train key personnel in the use of modern weapons.  Within the slender resources of the State, therefore, this Estimate provides for the requirements of the peace time cadre upon which the defences of the country are built.  For the last couple of years it will, I think, be obvious to all clear-thinking people that the strength of the Army has been permitted to dwindle well below the danger level.  This Estimate aims at providing for the requirements of the peace time Army up to a total of 12,743 all ranks, and it will be my duty for so long as I am Minister to use all my resources to endeavour to bring the Army strength to that figure, at which I hope to keep it.</P>
    <P>What the future has in store for us it is difficult to say, but if Press and radio information is evaluated even conservatively it will be clear that there has been little if any slackening in the preparations for war and while in the end it is hoped that prudence, common sense and righteousness may prevail, this nation without alliances relying solely on justice, integrity and its own strength of purpose must maintain the minimum strength approved by the Government upon the recommendation of the Army authorities.</P>
    <P>In presenting this Estimate to the House I do so with confidence having within the additional cost of £1,000,000 provided for additional strength, increased pay for both officers and soldiers, greater supplies of warlike stores and at the same time providing for the maintenance of an efficient Army capable of expansion to meet an emergency in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>While many of us may not believe in the urgent necessity for the present recruitment, I take this opportunity to offer our congratulations to the Minister on the success of his effort in that respect.  I have always felt, and I have said so in this House, that in any circumstances where danger threatened us or the imminence or likelihood of war presented itself, there would always be a <Col N="338" /> ready and willing response from the people generally throughout the country.  But, as I say, we might feel, whether rightly or wrongly, that this is not the particular time for intense recruitment for the Army.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate feature has been that, in the main, young men have been drawn from that part of Ireland where they are most needed to give the impetus to the greater production now called for from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I want to say that there are certain features of this Estimate that it is our duty as an Opposition to inquire into.  I feel that the wrong method is adopted in respect of some of the large charges shown in the Estimate.  If I question the Minister rather exhaustively on certain features of this Estimate, I should like him to appreciate that I do it not in any spirit of animosity, but purely in a spirit of inquiry.  I should like to know the estimate of the cost of warlike stores which the Minister will be able to obtain in the year.  I am led to believe that it was the Minister's predecessor who initiated the mission that went to Sweden, and that ultimately got us certain types of equipment. I am sure the Minister will be generous enough to pay whatever tribute may be due to his predecessor in that respect.  I am also informed that it has taken a period for any flow of equipment to come.  Are we continuing a policy of acquiring obsolete or obsolescent types of material?  Are we purchasing the rejects or the castoff equipment of other armies who have made further progress?  Is that the type of equipment we are getting? I want to know whether there is a very gross overestimate of cost in this Estimate, and whether the Irish people are being asked to carry a burden of taxation under this Estimate that, in fact, will come back, in a large measure, in Appropriations-in-Aid in the next account?  I suggest it might be better if the Minister adjusted his Estimate to the extent of basing the <Col N="339" /> figure for warlike stores on the amount likely to be obtained and, should fortuitous circumstances make available to him more than that amount, he can come back to the House at a later stage and ask for further money.  He knows it will not be denied to him.  It has never been denied to anybody.</P>
      <P>This Estimate shows an artifical enlargement that, ultimately, is an unjustifiable impingement on the taxpayer. I want the Minister to tell us, so far as he finds it reasonable or politic so to do, our sources of supply. Are we in any way getting aid from N.A.T.O.?  Are we in any way getting arms from America?  When he is replying, the Minister might indicate the present situation.  If, as he has suggested in his opening remarks, the war clouds are still as ominous as before, can he indicate any arrangements which are being made, and if no arrangements have been made will he indicate how we are going to make available to our strengthened Army the equipment which it might need?  It is easy to criticise and I appreciate that that criticism may well be offered to myself.  One is forced to ask, however, whether an argument about an Army of 10,000 strength and an Army of 12,000 strength is a real argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to ask ourselves the question that must alarm anybody who is genuinely interested in defence problems, namely: how are we going to get over the difficulty of the Reserve?  How is it that a tremendously large pool of already trained personnel has not given the response that one might reasonably expect to the First Line Reserve?  I think the Minister and the House will be <i>ad idem</i> that our method of defence is a small kernel in the standing Army with the First Line Reserve and the F.C.A. as the main sources of expansion.  If that is so, I should like the Minister to be frank with the House as to the real difficulties with regard to the First Line Reserve and how he hopes to overcome them.  I can assure him that where <Col N="340" /> I personally am concerned, and where any of my colleagues who have served in the Army are concerned, he will get every possible support in the advancement and enlargement of the Reserve. The matter is a source of grave agitation to the minds of those people who are interested in the Army.  It seems extraordinary that we cannot get that impetus which we had before.</P>
      <P>We had it prior to the emergency. Because it was my privilege to be in the Volunteers prior to the emergency I assert there was a response then that seems to be lacking now.  If the Minister has some solution for that, I wonder if he could indicate it to us because I feel that there is where one of the real strengths of the Army must be built.  If that difficulty can be got over, the general pattern of the Army will be infinitely stronger.  I am anxious to see, not so much the men who have completed their term of service becoming the nucleus of the real strength of the Reserve, but all the spirit and enthusiasm that were present in the emergency Army and the personnel that left the Army highly trained seven or eight years ago, welded once more into the camaraderie of the Defence Forces.  That is an immense reserve that should be tapped. It is one that was trained in a very exhaustive way during the emergency. It is one that carries with it all the hallmarks, so typically Irish, of a really quasi Volunteer Army as, in the main, the emergency Army was.</P>
      <P>There are features disclosed in the Estimate generally that must give satisfaction.  The improvement and the amelioration of conditions of service and the improvements in pay must inevitably give satisfaction to us all because they are gradually leading to contentment in the ranks and in the officer ranks.  As I have often said in this House before, many of the difficulties in a small army such as ours must of necessity surround the conditions of pay and service.  They have been considerably and substantially ameliorated. In general, we owe that much to the Army.  I hope the instalment they have got will find its realisation in complete satisfaction in the near future</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> There are many difficulties of a small nature upon which I want to query the Minister as distinct from in any way harrying him.  I wonder if there will be any impetus to the drive to settle the quarter question for the Army, whether houses and married quarters will be built in the areas where they are urgently needed? Sometimes, driving through the Curragh, I have wondered whether the whole end of Pearse Park, with its officer quarters of wood and huts, will be replaced some day by adequate houses commensurate with the status and rank of the officers who dwell therein?  I know that the Minister is up against immense difficulties there and that what I am advocating will involve further expenditure of money. What I am anxious to learn from the Minister is not so much the plan for the immediate present but the envisaged plan.  I want to get from the Minister, if he thinks it politic to give it, the new type of co-ordinated plan that must be in the Department of Defence in relation to Red Cross, civil defence and military defence in the matter of their having to be integrated into one national organisation for the purpose of general defence. I would like the Minister to inform the House as to how far his efforts have gone in civil defence, what particular type of A.R.P. protection is contemplated, what particular method of evacuation is contemplated and what is the general basis of the new A.R.P. training?</P>
    <P>I think that in regard to its basic principles the public should be enlightened as early as possible so that, when the ultimate appeal will go out for recruits to turn up to the classes of trained instructors and that kind of thing, sufficient interest will have been stimulated to make sure that a wholesome interest will be taken in this development.  Does the Minister or the Government really adhere to the belief that the war clouds are as ominous to-day as they were before?  If so, we would like an earnest of the effort the Government are making to co-ordinate and consolidate general defence.</P>
    <P>We suffered, when we were in office, from a protracted barrage that seemed <Col N="342" /> to indicate that the fate of this nation depended on whether there were 9,000 odd men or 12,000 men in the Army.  I want to know if there has been any substantial improvement in the weight of armour, ammunition and equipment behind the forces as distinct from the personnel itself?  I want to know whether or not there was not a good deal of political blowing in that artificially created scare?  Does the Minister or any Deputy in this House honestly believe that the question of the obtaining of 2,000 or 3,000 recruits would relieve many of the really serious difficulties that face us in defence matters?  I one time indicated my view in this House that if there is going to be a war, and if the Government feel that war might be inevitable, there would be no neutrals in it.  I want to know if there is any proposed defence union in the event of an attack by certain powers?</P>
    <P>We are agitated in our minds as to what real progress has been made, not so much in the recruitment of personnel as in the mobilisation of opinion towards defence in general.  No matter whom we may be called upon to fight, in the ultimate analysis it is a decentralised army of small dimensions, working in co-operation with local volunteer defensive groups to which this nation must resort.  We will never be in a position to put large armies in the field.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Minister, if he is genuine in his belief that the war clouds have not been dissipated, to indicate to us what measure of improvement the Government has been able to effect in the defence-consciousness of the people.  I am not quite so pessimistic as the Government is.  I feel that the threat of war, which was imminent in the early days of the Korean conflict, has now receded.  Because the great democracy of America and the people of England have had more time in which to rearm, the threat of war grows gradually less day by day.  I do not believe any nation, no matter how powerful it may appear to be, will ever be in a position to take on the armed powers of Western Europe, backed by the great democracy of America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> I do not think we are justified in stimulating any great degree of consciousness of the threat of war in the minds of our people.  I believe that our effort should be diverted towards developing production and not towards drawing people away from the land. Production will be a vital and most integral part of our defence.  If the Government really believes that the war clouds have not been dissipated, then we are entitled now to be given a composite picture of the steps taken by the Government and the Minister for Defence towards the unification and co-ordination of the various Volunteer services, the Reserve and the Army into a worth-while and workable unit.</P>
    <P>What particular type of A.R.P. equipment does the Minister hope to obtain?  What particular type of training does he envisage?  In answer to parliamentary questions the Minister has told us that certain people have been sent away on certain courses.  He has told us that a civilian defence school has been opened.  What type of training will be given in that establishment? Will it be training in a real sense?  Will it be training with dummy equipment?  Will it be training with improvised kit?  Are we justified in large-scale expenditure on obsolete equipment?  We may be told that such equipment is better than none.  Is that the only justification that can be made for it?  What efforts have been made to improve the situation?  I know that the Minister is fully alive to it.  Has any progress been made in obtaining certain types of equipment?</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to get the impression that I am prepared to sacrifice one iota of our sovereignty or independence in order to obtain up-to-date equipment.  Have the possibilities been examined of obtaining such equipment from England, America or N.A.T.O.?</P>
    <P>The Minister's recruiting drive has been an unprecedented success.  In the main the call has been answered by the young men in the rural areas. In the circumstances is that type of recruitment wise?  At one end of the <Col N="344" /> Front Bench we have the Minister for Agriculture, aided by the Taoiseach, shouting for increased production and for a greater effort on the land.  We have people constantly complaining that rural Ireland is being denuded of its youthful population.  Is the recruitment then of young personnel from the rural areas altogether wise?  May it not ultimately prove a disaster?  No one is more anxious than I am to have the Army brought up to full strength. In the state of crisis that is alleged by the Government are we justified in asking the taxpayer to pay more and more for Army services while at the same time drawing the young people away from the production on the land?</P>
    <P>I have no intention of interfering in any way with the Minister's effort to get this Estimate through, but I am postulating questions which are worrying the general public.  I would like to tell the Minister that people are asking, in the present situation of harsh taxation, whether we are justified in seeking all this money for defence. They want to know, and are entitled to know, what they are getting in return for this expenditure.  It is not in any spirit of futile inquiry that we are asking these questions.  The Minister owes a duty to the public that is infinitely greater than mine, and we all owe a duty to the public to inquire, when expenditure on defence has reached the figure that it has this year, what is the justification for it.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know, in passing, when the Minister hopes to be able to press on with the permanent Defence Bill.  Candidly, I had hoped to see the Report Stage of that Bill coming into the House before the Minister's Estimate.  I feel that, with the amount of work that has been done on the Bill, there is a good deal of urgency about getting it completed in view of a likely early dissolution of the Dáil. I want to press that point home with the Minister.  When one considers the services and the arduous hours of time that were given to the consideration of the Bill in Committee, I am wondering whether it would not be wiser, if at all possible, to put it through now. The Army are anxious to see it in its <Col N="345" /> final form.  I think, too, that we in this House who have any Army connection are more than anxious to see it on the Statute Book.  I want to conclude on the note that I started on of paying a genuine tribute to the Department, to the Minister and to the Army for the success of its recruiting drive, reserving as I do the right to question its wisdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to open my speech on the same note of praise as that on which Deputy Collins concluded his.  I congratulate the Minister on the success of his recruiting drive.  I, for one, have no doubt whatever, though Deputy Collins seems to have a doubt, as to whether we are justified in spending money on the Army at this moment.  In my opinion, if we did not spend that money and bring the Army to such a strength that it could be of proper use in an emergency, then all the money that would have to be spent on an Army under strength and ineffective would be wasted.  It comes down again to the question as to whether or not we should have an Army at all for defence, or whether we should only have it as an auxiliary police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country, to my mind, is well worth defending when one bears in mind the number of lives and the treasures that were lost over the years in order to achieve its freedom.  I do not think there can be a doubt in any Irishman's mind that the country should be defended to the very best of our ability.  That being so, I want to say that it is our duty to make our Defence Forces such that, if an emergency should arise, we will be able to cope with it to the last ounce of our strength.  In order to do that, we must put the Army authorities in the position in which they will be able to carry out that job.  Successive Governments have gone into this question, and have decided what is the very minimum that will enable the Army to do that.  I think it is admitted, as a result of the experience gained during the last emergency, that an establishment strength of 12,500 men for the Army is the absolute minimum.  Consequently as I say, I have no doubt that, if the Army <Col N="346" /> is to be effective at all in an emergency, the money spent to achieve that strength is well spent, and indeed is an absolute necessity for the country.</P>
    <P>In connection with the recruiting campaign, I think it is well that some public criticism should be made, and publicity given to a statement made recently in court about a criminal being let off to join the Army.  I think that is very bad.  I think a statement of that kind would help to keep decent young fellows out of the Army.  Our Army is not to be a refuge for criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that some publicity should be given to that statement. I hope, too, that we will not have a repetition of it because the young men going into the Army are representative of the very best of our people.  We have all the greatest regard for them, and I think it is very wrong that a statement such as that should be made in a public court.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say, in his opening statement, that £260,000 worth of warlike stores had been obtained, and are actually in process of delivery.  That is very good news to hear.  I was also glad to hear his statement that small arms and ammunition were obtained, and that he hoped the full delivery of them would be made during the year.  It is well that these stores should be built up to as strong a reserve as we can possibly achieve.  Deputy Collins questioned as to whether they were obsolete or not.  I do not know, but while we are in the position that we are not able to provide them for ourselves I suppose we will have to do with the best that we can get.  Certain steps were taken in years gone by in connection with that matter&mdash;steps that would help to put us in the position of providing some of those things for ourselves.  Unfortunately, these steps were discontinued on the grounds of economy.  We will have to start taking those steps again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that a sum of £63,000 is being provided this year for Army vehicles.  I would like to know from <Col N="347" /> the Minister whether that means increased numbers of Army vehicles or whether it is for mere replacement. Does it mean that the vehicles in the Army have got into such a state that this sum is needed in one year to make replacements?</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's statement about the Red Cross Society.  To my mind, it is very necessary that that society should be kept in as strong a position as possible. It is of great importance to the country in peacetime and more particularly in wartime.  On the subject of civil defence I, like Deputy Collins, would like more information on the programme being carried out.  We know that certain officers have been appointed and that certain arrangements have been come to, but no information on these matters has reached the public. I would be glad if the Minister could give us more information on that point.</P>
    <P>The strength of the F.C.A. has not reached the figure desired by any of us. I feel we should extend our congratulations to the young men who are manning that force at present and giving their time to it.  To my mind, it would be a good idea if the Army authorities were to give more attention to the conditions under which the F.C.A. work. This organisation, to my view, does not hold out sufficient attraction to the ordinary young man.  Its personnel are confined to the rifle battalions and are not allowed to have anything to do with machine-guns.  I heard of a case where an enterprising officer actually got possession of a machine-gun and tried to train some of the F.C.A. personnel on its uses.  When this was discovered, the officer was hauled over the coals and the machine-gun was taken from him.  I do not think it is right that the F.C.A.'s training should be confined to just the rifle.  They should be taught how to use other guns and should be given other war training as well.  This would give them a bigger interest in the force.  Take the case of a man who has been in regular training for, say, two or three years; he knows everything that is to be known under the present programme and tends to lose interest in his work.  I should like <Col N="348" /> the Minister to give some attention to that side of the question.  I feel that if the work in the F.C.A. were made more attractive far more of our young men would take it up.</P>
    <P>I have very little else to say on this Estimate.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on the success of his recruiting campaign.  Without recruits, we can do nothing, no matter what stores we may have.  We must have men, and I feel that the Minister has made very good progress in this respect, considering the short time he has held office.  When he comes to this House next year, as he will, with his Estimate, I hope he will be able to report further improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I might forget it, I would like, at the outset of my remarks, to express wholehearted agreement with some of the things that have been said by the Deputy who has just sat down.  In his reference to the F.C.A., he said that keeping its personnel indefinitely handling no heavier types of armaments than the rifle bred monotony, and that that monotony resulted in a falling away of members. He maintained that those men should be equipped in the knowledge of arms which embraced the machine-gun at any rate.  I had not the full advantage of being in the House when the Minister was speaking, but I understood him to state that the strength of the F.C.A. at the present time is 21,000, and that the effective strength is 10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What would be the effective strength?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>21,000 men is the effective strength, and we expect 10,000 to go on annual training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We can leave out the expectations with regard to annual training.  I am quite sure the Minister shares with me the view that a far higher number should be induced to go on annual training each year.  I feel certain that more would go if the pay were better.  Various steps were <Col N="349" /> taken during my period in office to make the financial conditions more attractive for those who reported for camp training.  Very much better conditions were not secured during that time, but there were hopes that, within a year or so, further inducements would be held out and that a greater number would go on annual training.  However, I do not think that any step forward has been taken in that direction since.</P>
      <P>It is unreasonable to expect men to lose money as a result of turning up for annual training.  I hold very, very strongly that, when the F.C.A. personnel turn up for such training with the regular Army, they should receive marriage allowance, children's allowances and every other allowance in the way of pay in addition to the ordinary training bonus that is given.  I maintain that they should be equated with the conditions existing for soldiers. 21,000 of an effective F.C.A. strength in a country with our population is, in my opinion, nothing short of a disgrace. We know very well that the L.D.F. had a strength of over 100,000.  The F.C.A. even recruited under different conditions, had a strength in the neighbourhood of 80,000.  The effective strength was double the present effective strength and I saw in my early days in the Department of Defence an F.C.A. that was withering and it was withering really because it was not getting enough attention and enough encouragement from the Army.  If anybody had the choice of a defensive machine as between an army, we will say, of 50,000 and a small army with an F.C.A. strength to build it up to 50,000, any man with a military mind would say that the army of 50,000 is preferable.  It would be more highly trained, more scientific and better equipped.  If we are talking about facing the world or facing even a considerable portion of the world we should begin at least by facing facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts of the situation? You have recruited up to the highest degree and you managed to get together an army of 12,000, the recruits being mainly boys recruited on an attestation period that was never known before in this country, a two <Col N="350" /> years' attestation period.  With all the goodwill in the world and with all the vigour that could be applied you are able to get an army barely in the neighbourhood of 12,000 on a two years' attestation period, taking boys at 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>That is the position as far as human beings go.  That is one side of the Army.  The other side of the Army is the armament side.  The armament side in the world we live in to-day is the important side.  At the beginning of this century an army only meant so many men in uniform and a rifle of sorts.  Get your men together, give them a rifle and there you had your army.  It was men that mattered. To-day the men matter very little.  It is machines that matter.  It is the weight of machinery that matters and the heavy equipment.  To face facts what is the position to-day?  We are the cinderella of the world when it comes to the purchase of arms.  The Minister knows it, I know it and it is well that the Dáil and the people should know that we are living in a situation where we are outside all the military combinations that make up the world we live in.  The supply of arms produced is given within one or other of those many military combinations, the Soviet combination, the United Nations, the Atlantic Pact, the Mutual Aid bloc, and so on.  All the heavier types of armaments, whether produced in America, Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Germany or any other country you like to name, are only circulated within one or other of those combinations.  The Minister tried for years in the past when he was a Minister&mdash;and I am certain he has tried even harder in the last year&mdash;to secure warlike stores, heavy armaments, proper equipment on modern lines.  Certainly I tried as hard for three and a half years as any Minister ever did.  What I got was next to nothing and there was such a delay about what I did get that one had nearly forgotten the order when it arrived.</P>
    <P>As regards the arms arriving at the present moment from Sweden, it was in the winter of 1950 that that particular avenue was opened up and a <Col N="351" /> free hand was given to the Army to go out and inspect and, if the supplies were suitable and approved, to buy to the maximum amount they could get; but they were only comparatively light arms and I do not think that is a continuing supply.  They are coming here at the moment and with the exception of that, up to machine-gun level, there is not a country in the world that would supply us with military equipment of the heavier type.  One time we hired or bought a few Churchill tanks. They were obsolete at the time we hired them but, obsolete or otherwise, they were better than nothing.  They were the first, and presumably the last, thanks to reach this country.</P>
    <P>Those are facts and there is no good is stide-stepping them.  The Minister knows the truth of what I am saying and I know it absolutely.  You can talk about friendly countries, America, or any other country you like.  Go to them for arms; they entertain lavishly, they are very nice, very polite and courteous but &ldquo;we cannot supply outside of the combination we are committed to.&rdquo;  What is the order of priorities&mdash;the Atlantic Pact, U.N.O., the Mutual Aid pool, and the countries outside of those combinations most nearly menaced by the Soviet Bloc; after that a handful of countries like ourselves.  In other words, when the dish is not only emptied but licked clean and a hole through the bottom, if there is anything left we can get into a scramble with other countries.</P>
    <P>That is our position with regard to armaments and it does not matter whether you write down in that Book of Estimates £1,600,000, £860,000 or any other figure.  You will only get a tiny driblet of warlike stores and that driblet will entirely consist of the lighter arms, no heavy armaments.</P>
    <P>During my time over there I was denounced year after year and outside from platform after platform because I had not war-like stores in sufficient quantities, because I had not an Army equipped fully in the modern sense. The people denouncing me knew very well that such supplies could not be secured.  I am not denouncing them <Col N="352" /> because they have not succeeded or are not likely to succeed in procuring such materials.  They are just not there. The Minister cannot be blamed.  His colleagues cannot be blamed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my last acts in the Minister's office was to give sanction for a mission to go to see if the type was suitable, whenever they were ready to go.  There was some suggestion that there might be a hold up by the U.N.O. people, but as soon as that was cleared, they had authority <Col N="353" /> to go.  However, I am not trying to score a point over the Minister.  If the Minister is in a position to get all the supplies he wants&mdash;I am not talking about a few pieces of heavy equipment for training purposes&mdash;in the way of heavy armaments, I do not see why he is reducing what he says is required for heavy armaments.  He puts £1,600,000 in the Estimate and reduces that by £860,000 in respect of supplies which cannot be procured or delivered. If, at the end of this year, when the Minister or some other Minister comes along with the Estimates for next year, that £860,000 is expended, I shall be the most surprised Deputy and also the most pleased Deputy in Dáil Eireann; but the Minister knows, no matter what he may say about heavy equipment, that it is not procurable, except, as I have said, in driblets.  You will always get enough to keep you blooded, but you will not get enough to equip your Army, even your Army of 12,000, or anything like it.</P>
      <P>In that situation, if you cannot equip your Army of that size on modern lines, you cannot any longer rely on equipment. You have to go back and rely on men, and, with a proper use of the F.C.A., with proper attention from the Army, with enthusiasm from Army headquarters and with drive from the Minister, there is no reason why that force should not reach a figure of 100,000.  A force of 100,000 riflemen and machine-gunners is not a force to be scoffed at.  Concentrated over an Island of this size it is a formidable force.  I am not going to say that it would beat all comers, but it is a very formidable force and a force of that nature distributed throughout the whole country is a far more effective force than a force of 10,000, 11,000 or 12,000 men equipped with rifles and machine-guns, and a few samples of heavy material.  If you cannot have one, then the other is the thing to concentrate on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, by the way of criticism, might I say that the F.C.A. is not getting the attention from the Army it got heretofore? Heretofore, half the officers of G.H.Q. above the rank of commandant were out every week-end with the F.C.A.&mdash;surprise visits, inspections <Col N="354" /> and paying the unit the compliment of a very high G.H.Q. officer moving amongst them.  It gave the impression to the F.C.A. units around the country of headquarters taking a deep and intense interest in them, of the Army relying on them as a competent weapon in the event of an emergency arising. That was the importance of these visits, to give them the conviction that the Government and the Army were looking to them as a really important defence force, as a fighting unit.  That has practically disappeared.  I do not care how many turn up for annual training, induced by more attractive conditions, if the F.C.A. is not kept on its toes in maximum numbers, with your present numbers you have no defence force whatever.</P>
    <P>With 12,000 highly trained expert soldiers, soldiers trained to the last degree in the science of war, each one of them able to act as a trainer or instructor for larger numbers, and with half-trained men to the extent I have mentioned outside the Army and subject to mobilisation in the event of war, you have something like a defence machine that the people can look to with a certain amount of confidence.</P>
    <P>But with these 12,000 men, even well equipped, and a dwindling handful of 15,000 or 20,000 outside, not properly looked after and not made to feel that they are an important element in the nation's defence, you have nothing and any money you are spending is waste.  The manpower is there; the spirit is there; the tradition of the citizen soldier, the volunteer fighting man, is there; and the desire to defend the country, not because it is a good job, not because the pay is good, and not because barrack life is comfortable, but to defend the country for the payment of nothing a year, is there. That is the spirit that exists up and down the country and it is invaluable, if it is properly used and properly led.</P>
    <P>I know there is always a difficulty in getting the army to lean towards the F.C.A., to pay sufficient attention to the F.C.A.  What was done in my time had to be done by drive, drive, drive, by continuous prodding, by always asking what was done last month. Otherwise, the F.C.A. would be <Col N="355" /> allowed to fade away.  That drive is not there at the moment and the F.C.A. feel it.  A complimentary speech now and then does not fill that vacuum.  The Army must be mixed up closely, continuously and intimately with the F.C.A.  Not only that, but the F.C.A. cannot be treated as children. They cannot be treated like young boys just playing soldiers around the floor, given a rifle, kept forming fours, asked to slope arms and shoulder arms, and engaged in annual shooting competitions with the rifle, but nothing else.  Those men, when they join and get their first experience of military training, take an interest in military matters and know very well that the elementary weapon&mdash;in fact, nearly the obsolete weapon&mdash;is the rifle; and that if they are being taken seriously by the Army, by the Minister, by the Government, they will at least be trained and equipped with the arms that are procurable and are available, that is, with machine-guns at the very least.  Inside every F.C.A. unit there should be at least a small group trained in the very heaviest material we have. That would convince them that we are looking at them and looking to them as part of the real defence machinery of the State.</P>
    <P>I am not advancing these particular arguments or making these statements by way of criticism: I am advancing them as a person as interested in the security and the defences of this country as anybody sitting opposite.  I know it cannot be done by a small number, what any country would regard as a handful of regular soldiers of a standing army, no matter how well equipped.  The Minister has got his maximum number, he has got his recruits, he has reduced the attestation period, he has reduced the age limit.  He has allowed for a big falling away in the year in numbers.  The Book of Estimates shows that the number he expects to carry throughout the year is 10,000, that is, that big numbers are due to leave.  Those are the figures given to us in the published Estimates.  Does the Minister claim that, even with full equipment and allowing for the numbers inside an army that it takes to service the few <Col N="356" /> in the field, that is a defence force on its own?</P>
    <P>Let us take the 12,000, equipped. How many of those could take the field?  In a modern army, does it not take three behind to one in front, does it not take three service men to keep every fighting soldier in supplies?  You could take a quarter of this, 3,000, as being an effective fighting machine, the others servicing that odd 3,000. What is that?  Is not that a joke? Standing alone, is it not a joke? Standing alone, it is not an army, it is not a defence force.  However, if standing beside them and with them and mixed up with them in the event of war, you had 80,000 to 100,000 capable of using the machine-gun, highly trained in the rifle, capable of quickly absorbing and acquiring knowledge of the higher type of armaments, then you would have something worth while.</P>
    <P>There is not good in spending big money on one and starving the other; there is no point in spending £1,000,000 on one and begrudging the pennies to the other.  What money is available has to be soundly distributed with a view to turning out and giving to the country the most adequate defence machine that the country can throw up under existing circumstances.  The strength or impressiveness of a ceremonial parade should not be the deciding factor.  I would rather have a small ceremonial parade with a lot of out-of-step, half-trained, volunteer soldiers making up the numbers but knowing that those half-trained, out-of-step, volunteer soldiers were there in their tens of thousands, equipped up to machine-gun standard and ready in the event of any emergency, than to have a few thousand of those and 9,000 or 10,000 Regular Army men highly trained.</P>
    <P>I would implore the Minister to look up what attention has been given to the F.C.A. in the last 12 months and compare that with the previous 12 months and ensure that such attention will be given to the F.C.A. that they will take an interest in their work and that they will hold their strength; that, as young fellows leave school and come up to the proper age in their neighbourhood, <Col N="357" /> they will be attracted to the F.C.A.; that the old-timers will show, by graduating from the rifle to the machine-gun, and so on, that the Army is taking an interest in them, that the country is relying on them, and that they are not just left playing around month after month and year after year with the weapon that they are entirely master of and could use in their sleep.</P>
    <P>I want to give a reality to the force and I think the situation is sufficiently serious and sufficiently permanent to impress on the Minister, on the Army and on the Dáil that we are never going to have an army equipped as a modern army is and should be and that we have got to rely on numbers. We cannot get the numbers into the Regular Army without jeopardising the economy of the whole State, without lowering production to such an extent that the end would be worse than the beginning.  We are never going to get it.  During the course of the last year I happened on one occasion to witness two battalions passing through a village&mdash;two wartime battalions. They passed in front of me and when they had finished passing I had not seen one man, and they had all passed me by.  Every one of them was in mechanised heavily armoured vehicles of one kind or another, infantry being brought up, and so on. Can we ever reach that standard? Can we ever reach it when nobody can supply us, nobody will supply us; and is there any use in talking about producing the requirements here at home?</P>
    <P>We know all this very well.  The Minister knows it, as his Government was there for 16 years before.  They went there with the history of years of criticism of the previous Government for not having armament factories in the country, for not at least producing small arms.  They went into the matter.  They never produced a bullet. They never produced a factory to produce a bullet.  Why?  Because even if we started a small arms industry in this country, three days' working of that particular factory or industry would give the Army its year's requirements and the production for the rest of the year, if the industry remained <Col N="358" /> working and the wheels revolving, would just be a drug on the market.  We are not going to produce it at home.  We have not the raw material to produce the equipment for a modern army at home, even if no other factors entered into it.  We must rely on numbers.  We cannot take sufficient numbers into the Regular Army and pay them as full-time soldiers, so we must look outside the Regular Army for a sufficiency of numbers. That is there in the F.C.A. The spirit is there, the example is there, the tradition is there.  All that is wanted is the inspiration, the drive and the gesture of encouragement from the Department of Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary, having regard to the state in which we are informed our finances are this year, that there should not be overestimation in any Department. The Minister in introducing his Estimate to-day indicated the possibility of having a surplus due to the fact that he might not be able to expend the moneys for which he is budgeting. As other Deputies have stated, if those stores, become available during the year, the House would be in full agreement in giving the Minister authority to spend the additional moneys in acquiring those stores rather than give any impression to people that we were in any way regardless, in dealing with an Estimate, of the economic factors governing the financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The good results of the recruiting drive brought from both sides of the House congratulations to the Minister on his success.  I agree that it is a good thing, under ordinary circumstances, to have an influx of new blood into the standing Army, but we must equate that to conditions in rural Ireland, where to-day production is definitely being held back by the unavailability of suitable labour.  Some three or four weeks ago, on one of the finest days for sowing operations, when people were working hard to get as much tillage done as possible&mdash;I know many farmers who had to cut down their beet acreage this year because they could not get help&mdash;we witnessed some 1,700 able-bodied men <Col N="359" /> being marched into the Theatre Royal to see a film show.  That is a matter for which the people who were working from dawn to dark in those days would not give much credit to the Government.  If the additional numbers now in the Regular Army have been achieved at the cost of a loss to the Second Line Reserve, by drawing off some of its members from a condition of life, wherein they were able to engage in productive employment and volunteer their spare time for the service of the country, thereby rendering double service to the nation, that is highly undesirable.  It would not be at all advisable to take men from these walks of life and put them into barracks, where, to use an Army expression, they may become &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; after some time by the conditions there.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some consequence, a matter to be deplored, that the increased number of recruits in the Regular Army has necessitated a calling back of officers and training N.C.O.s attached to F.C.A. units throughout the country.  The greatest blow to the Reserve was the withdrawal of the N.C.O.s after the emergency, during the period when that grand force was left hanging fire for nearly a year and a quarter, and did not know whether they would be wound up or maintained as a permanent reserve, as part of our defence force. During that period the men who came out, by their example, by the manner in which they carried out their duties, brought much appreciation of our national Army to people who prior to that had no opportunity of getting to know the types of men we have in our Army, and they brought to places far distant from Army centres an appreciation of the fine life it is, the healthy life it is, to serve in the Army.  The withdrawal of those men meant that the force disintegrated, and we had up to a few years ago merely a paper strength.  It is important that the members of that force should be effective members.  It would be impossible for the administrative staff to ensure that that will obtain if the number of administrative officers at present <Col N="360" /> attached to the force was diminished further.</P>
    <P>I would join with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in asking the Minister to treat men who go in for annual training in the same way as men in the Regular Army are treated.  I know from my experience over seven or eight years, that many members of the F.C.A., particularly in the officer class, who are engaged in business, lose considerably as a result of taking time off from their businesses for the purpose of giving it to the administration of their battalions or companies in camps.  A great service is being done in training those who avail of the opportunities at both the summer camps and winter training centres, and everything should be done to see that as many as possible avail of the opportunity of training.</P>
    <P>I agree that a week or fortnight in such a camp is worth any amount of weekly training at home but I would like to see the regulation being rigidly enforced that any member of the force would not be permitted to avail of that training unless he was clocking in his weekly training hours at the centres provided at home.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that the diminution in the number of training N.C.O.s will not result in the training of the F.C.A. becoming in any way slipshod. No matter how good the F.C.A. member may become as an N.C.O. or officer, it is vital that the regular training N.C.O. and the regular officer would be kept in the battalion and company centres as a direct contact between the Regular Army and the Second Line Reserve.  I feel that you would never get from the recruits coming into the force the same degree of co-operation, the same degree of effectivenss, as you would get from instruction given by members of the Regular Army.  Consequently, I would like to be assured by the Minister that, in concentrating on training of the recruits in the Regular Army, the training being applied for some time past in the Second Line Reserve will not in any way be affected.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Colley in his references to some statement apparently made in court when an <Col N="361" /> accused person was discharged so that he might join the Army.  I think such types should be refused admission to any section of our Defence Forces, because the recruitment of even a very small number of such types would inflict untold damage on the morale of the Defence Forces.  Officers of the F.C.A. in charge of local companies take on a great responsibility when bringing boys into camps during the summertime or at any other time.  They bring them away from their homes, many of them for the first time, and they take on a responsibility which is well realised by the parents of these boys.  Parents certainly make it quite clear that they regard the officer in charge as being responsible for these boys during the period they are away from home.  I think it would be very damaging if these lads were brought into contact with any persons such as those to whom Deputy Colley referred, who would be directed into the Army instead of being interned in places provided for the detention of those who seriously transgress the law.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in urging on the Minister that it is about time that the monotony attached to courses which these lads attend should be ended and that more interesting courses of training should be provided, otherwise they will not look forward to their period of training or participate in the courses, with the same degree of enthusiasm as they would if they knew they were going to learn something new.  Time after time lads who had given good service during the emergency were brought in and treated as raw recruits, forming fours on the parade ground as if they had never before gone through these simple exercises and they left the training camps without adding in the slightest to the knowledge which they possessed when they came in.</P>
    <P>I think men attending such courses should be trained at least in the use of light automatics.  I agree that a certain amount of revision is desirable but, from the point of view of maintaining the men's interest and sharpening their intelligence, I think the humdrum <Col N="362" /> revision stuff which is dished up to them year after year in training should be reduced to a minimum.  I hope that in future much more interesting programmes will be drawn up so as to entice these young men to come to the camps in future years and so as to enable them to bring to their comrades who have remained at home the message that they can gain considerably, even though they may have to make some sacrifices, by attending these training courses in camp.</P>
    <P>I would say that a tribute is due to the Regular Army personnel assigned to the training of our Second Line Reserve in which I am particularly interested. Not having had an opportunity of being a member of the regular forces myself, I am not wholly conversant with conditions in the Regular Army, but I regret to have found, when meeting members of the regular forces, particularly in the last two or three years, a certain amount of animosity against the Second Line Reserve.  Members of the regular forces regarded it as an economy force, something which was inimical to their interests.  It was only after officers and N.C.O.s of the Regular Army had been engaged in training members of the F.C.A. that they began to appreciate that they had men under their charge who were extremely enthusiastic, who were prepared to learn all they could of military tactics and to bring themselves up to a standard which would gain them promotion in the ranks, and that, in fact, these lads had a higher incentive than men engaged by the hour or the day, watching the clock, perhaps, for the time when they could go off duty.  They found that even when these lads had finished their day's work on the parade ground, they frequently spent many hours in addition in study so that they could bring to their battalions and companies additional credit by way of winning competitions and by acquiring a higher degree of knowledge and becoming better trained in every branch of defence.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have much more to add beyond saying that I consider the Minister was remiss in his duty when a scurrilous article appeared in a certain Sunday paper&mdash;not a paper <Col N="363" /> produced in this country, but a British paper, with an extensive circulation throughout the country&mdash;reflecting on the men who were volunteers for the Second Line Reserve.  The article reflected on their officers and the motives which inspired their actions. I think that nothing short of a ministerial statement should have been made at that time, but not a single line appeared, not a word from any officer in the regular forces or any indication that it was the opinion of the authorities that everything contained in that article was incorrect and injurious to the Defence Forces of the country.  I regret to have to say that, because, on this Estimate, it is desirable that contributions from all sides of the House should be entirely contructive and free from any contentious element.  I am sorry that the Minister, before the matter contained in the article spread throughout the country, did not issue a statement completely controverting the untruthful allegations in it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would repeat what I said at the beginning, that I consider it important that we should concentrate at the present time on ensuring that we do not recruit men into the Regular Army at the expense of production in other fields.  We should ensure that any facility afforded men in the past to devote their spare time from their regular avocations in agriculture and industry to military training should be made available to them in the future&mdash;not alone services which they had in the past, but any additional services which they may require.  They well deserve these facilities in recompense for sacrificing so much of their time to voluntary training, so that, should the occasion arise, they will be in a position to take their place in the field side by side with the men in our permanent Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have to disagree with Deputy O'Sullivan when he states that there was, or is, any question of animosity by the Regular Army towards the F.C.A. From my experience, derived from mingling with many officers and men <Col N="364" /> of the Regular Army, I think I can say that that is not correct.  There may have been one or two isolated instances but I think it is only fair to the members of the Regular Army, especially the officers, that it should not go out from here that that is so. We appreciate that the men of the Regular Army, especially the officers, have the interests of the Army and the country at heart.  It is their career. These men realise that members of the F.C.A. voluntarily devote a great deal of their spare time to training and that there is no room for anybody to look down their noses at them or to show any animosity towards them.  I know some of the officers who are dealing with the F.C.A.  They are very keen on their job and very pleased with the work the F.C.A. men are doing.  You may get one or two private soldiers who may feel that they are great men because they are in the Regular Army and the others are only amateurs.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  You may get one or two men in the Regular Army who may have that feeling, but I do not think it should go out from here that there is any animosity on the part of the Regular Army towards the F.C.A. because that is not correct.  I agree with the suggestion made that something should be done with regard to training the F.C.A. men in the use of the heavier types of armament.  I know that young men joining the F.C.A. are very keen and anxious to acquire knowledge of every type of armament. Every effort should be made to give these keen young men and boys every opportunity to train themselves in the use of the heavier type of armament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins stated that at one time high-ranking officers of G.H.Q. now and again visited the F.C.A., but that that has ceased.  If that is so it is a pity.  I think visits from high-ranking officers of the G.H.Q. would have a very beneficial effect.  The Minister should see that these high-ranking officers go around again and mix with the F.C.A. men. <Col N="365" /> It would give the F.C.A. great encouragement and would show that not only the G.H.Q. but the Government and the Minister were taking a very keen interest in that force.  The Minister should try to revive that practice.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I was not here for the Minister's opening statement, but I am very keenly interested in civil defence from the Dublin Corporation point of view.  I happen to be the chairman of the Dublin Corporation Civil Defence Committee, and I regret to say that nothing has happened as far as Dublin is concerned.  It is time that the Department of Defence should get the civil defence committees of every local authority together and have a heart-to-heart talk with them.  We have requested the Department to meet our civil defence officer and our civil defence committee.  That is a step in the right direction in order to get something done in regard to civil defence.  I know that it is the duty of the local authority to make all arrangements but we cannot do it without the help of the Department.  Nothing whatever has happened to my knowledge in Dublin except the appointment of a civil defence officer, for whom we recently got a headquarters.  It is time that we should know exactly where we stand, and for that purpose get together the civil defence committees throughout the country and representatives of the Department of Defence.</P>

I put it to the Minister therefore that the provision of sufficient married quarters for our serving soldiers is a matter that must be attended to at the very earliest possible date.  If we want to have a contented Army and if young men are to make the Army their career and give 21 or 25 years' service, one of the first things we ought to provide are sufficient married quarters so as to allow soldiers to get married and settle down and, in addition to that, increase the marriage allowance so as to meet the very high cost of living at the moment.  With other Deputies, I congratulate the Minister on the success of his recruiting drive, but I stood up specially to ask the Minister what his intentions are concerning the provision of additional married quarters for the Army and the increasing of the marriage allowance.</P>

      <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the Army for the manner in which they carried out their duties during the last 30 years.  At the same time, I do not believe in having <Col N="367" /> an Irish national Army until such time as this country is united.  I believe that we should have a national militia in which every young man of military age would be trained in the use of weapons to defend his country.  While there may have been periods during the last 30 years when a national Army was needed, I am satisfied that there has been a vast waste of money and manpower, that these men could do far more useful work producing food for our people.  I believe that a review of the whole situation is needed.  I do not think we should carry on as we are doing, keeping 12,000 men in ideal conditions on big pay while there is such an amount of work to be done on the land.  Many farmers cannot get men to work for them to produce food for our people.</P>
      <P>A recruiting drive is going on to get young men to join the Army, and many young men with spirit will join the Army.  I believe, however, in every young man getting a military training. Give him proper training and make him into a man who, when the call comes, if it should ever come, will be able to play his part in the defence of this country.  I believe it would help to cut down a lot on the vast amount of ignorance and snobbishness which is displayed by certain people in this country towards our Army. There are young men in this country who should serve in the defence of this country, but who would never do it.  The aim of their parents is that when they are 17 or 18 they will join a foreign army.  They will spend the best years of their lives in the service of another country.  I want to see these young men mixing shoulder to shoulder with the other young men in this country and serving Ireland before any other country.  That is why I want to see a national militia, where every man will do his duty.  I want that snobbish attitude to end.  Those men would not serve in an Irish Army. They would sneer at the Irish Army, but they would serve in other armies. I want them to serve the interests of their own country first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My outlook on the National Army is well known.  I am entitled to my <Col N="368" /> own opinion and I am not afraid to air it.  I believe in facing realities.  I am satisfied that the economy of this country is strangled, because it has to maintain three armies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We hear talk of the desperate plight of the economy of this country.  Why?  Is it not a fact that we are carrying too big a load&mdash;an idle load&mdash;which the country cannot afford to carry?  We must face the fact that some day this thing must stop.  Even though we have a Border crux, I do not see why we should not make common cause, North and South, in the defence of this country.  If we were attacked by any outside force, the first thing that would happen would be that the Border would go and that North and South would fight together in the defence of our island. Is it not right, therefore, that there should be common cause in the defence of this island if world war should break out?  The matter of the Great Northern Railway was settled amicably by the North and the South.  So was the question of the Erne scheme and also the matter of the Foyle fisheries.  I do not see, therefore, why the North and the South should not meet and try to come to some agreement in relation to the defence of our country.  There is no way of securing the removal of the Border other than by peace and goodwill.  I believe that it betrays smallness on our part that we are not big enough to face that fact.  We are the bigger factor in this country.  We could contribute by being big enough to stop this face-saving and to see if there is any way of easing the burden of three armies in this country.  We should try to come to some agreement about having a unified force for the defence of the whole island.  I believe that a vast amount of manpower and money could be saved if we could come to some agreement in that connection.  I am satisfied that the country cannot continue to maintain that vast amount of <Col N="369" /> idle men.  They are trained men who are ready to do their duty, but they are too much of a burden on the resources of this little island.  It is too small and insignificant for that.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that our neutrality will depend on the best interests of democracy.  The Allies in the last war deserve every credit for the manner in which they respected our neutrality at a time when they were in a death struggle.  We should make it clear that we appreciate their action very much. Nothing would have suited Britain or America more than to land an army here in defence of their own way of life &mdash;a thing which was done in many countries in Europe.  I believe that they will respect our neutrality in the same way in the future.  I believe that the position has changed vastly in the past few years and that there is now a common cause of Christianity.  I should not be ashamed or afraid to line up with that cause.  I believe we should fit in somewhere.  We say that we can fit in nowhere until the Border is removed. We are doing nothing one way or the other at present to remove the Border.  Thank God we have never tried to remove it by force, because we would not succeed in any event.  I believe an effort should be made to come to some arrangement about the defence of this island.  The nations of the world are lining up in a menacing attitude and borders will count very little in the struggle that looks like taking place.</P>
      <P>We should pay a tribute to the United States of America and to those other countries who are sending their sons to fight in Korea in defence of Christianity and democracy.  While we are sitting here free and well protected those great nations are pouring out their wealth and their blood in defence of Christian ideals and the things which we hold dear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a soldier.  I served in the National Army and I am proud of every day I spent in that Army.  I am satisfied that the men in our Army are being trained in the best interests of the country and that they are doing a noble service, but at the same time I think that it is a vast waste of money in a small country that cannot afford to waste even one penny.  There is far too <Col N="370" /> much make-believe and a good deal of face-saving in connection with this whole matter.</P>
    <P>The people are being deceived. Every year that passes we are told of the menaces and dangers which lie ahead.  Every time Fianna Fáil are returned to office the first thing they want is to raise a huge Army, no matter what it costs, and they always say that there is some danger around the corner.  We are told that if we have not 12,000 men ready to go on the field to fight, and die if need be, for this country then we are lost.  I believe that if we had 1,200,000 men in this country ready to fight and die in the defence of this nation and that if a larger power wanted to wipe us out they could do it overnight and we could not stop them.  We should not be ashamed or afraid to say that. Every man should be trained in a small way as a soldier but at the same time left to do this ordinary work on his farm or in the factory.  Let us not have a standing Army in the Curragh or anywhere else.  All that is needed is the formation of an Army which can be called upon in time of danger.  Having 12,000 or 15,000 men standing idle is a complete waste.  We are told, of course, that it is a great insurance, that it is always there to meet a threat.  A far greater insurance is a contented and prosperous countryside, where the people are free and happy and where they work from morning to night in the building up of their own lives.  The people ought to be prepared to put down the spade and take up the gun if needs be, but there should be no waste of time keeping people standing idle on a barrack square.  This island is too small and too poor to bear that weight of manpower and money.  The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party in particular ought to realise the damage they have done to this country over a long number of years by always referring to this threat of danger.  I am satisfied that if there is immediate danger we will fit in some place and do our duty but there is no immediate danger.</P>
    <P>We see the line-up in the world at the present time, and we must fit into it somewhere.  That line-up is <Col N="371" /> Christianity on the one hand and the Red menace from Russia on the other. Ninety-nine per cent. of the people of this country will be prepared to take their stand if need be in the defence of Christianity.  In the interest of the economy of the country an effort should be made for the unification of an Irish defence, a national defence that could, perhaps, fit in with our neutral policy, and also give satisfaction to both America and those other countries who are lining up in the defence of Christianity.</P>
    <P>To think that we can meet and defeat all-comers is all rot and nonsense, because we could not live on our own for two months.  Our economy would hardly allow it.  We are not so independent in the matter of food and manpower that we can meet all-comers. We could meet very little. We are in the unfortunate position that we cannot produce either a .22 bullet or a shotgun cartridge in this country. We have to go begging all over the world for arms.  We got supplies&mdash; obsolete, outworn and discarded&mdash;here and there.  Yet we talk about taking on all-comers.  We have to equip our Army to fight with those weapons.  We are living in a modern fast-moving world, and it is just bunkum to tell the nation we are fully equipped and ready for battle, when God and the world knows we are not.</P>
    <P>During the last war, we had nothing in the way of equipment except the old discarded British Lee-Enfield rifles which the British would not issue to their own soldiers, but they were good enough for us.  At present we are getting nothing except discarded equipment that would not be used in a modern war.  I count buying obsolete weapons a vast waste of public money, and I think we should face up to the matter.  My outlook is far different from that of the Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe there was too much bunkum spoken here, and I am satisfied that if there was less talk and more work on the land, in the farms, and in the factories, in an effort to build up the economy of this country, it would be far better.</P>
    <P>Some months ago we were told that <Col N="372" /> we were almost bankrupt.  Now we are told that we must keep a vast standing Army.  We are told that we can only get third-rate equipment. The whole thing is utter nonsense.  We were told that 30 years ago we met and defeated the British Army.  I was in the fight, and I say that that is the greatest humbug.  I lived in the Midlands, and from 1917 to 1921 there were not half-a-dozen poor old Peelers killed in the whole war.  We were told that we beat the might of the British people.  We did no such thing.  Outside of a few flying columns here and there and a few skirmishes that took place, we did not fight at all.  The young generation should not be told this class of bunkum.  We fought and every man did his duty.  That and the luck we had won the fight for us.  It was as a result of that fight we got the little freedom that we have.</P>
    <P>Our fight was a very small and insignificant one.  I was through it all. I served in ambushes, in prison and in the civil war and I was out in the open, fighting all the time; but, from 1917 to 1921, I do not believe we killed six people in the Midlands.  I was through the whole civil war, and what we were doing from morning to night was running like hell after one another.  There was not a shot fired. We would go into a barracks for a drink and, on looking out at the countryside, we would see five or six places go up in flames.  We would try to catch the boys, but we could not, as they were gone.  Yet, we were fighting bloody battles.  I am sick of that kind of talk.  I would like the people to realise the true facts.  We should not always be trying to say we are a fighting nation and ready to take on all-comers.</P>
    <P>We could not get one man, perhaps, in 50 to join the Volunteers at that time.  All we had were 20 men, and they were the pick of the parish.  The others would not join.  We would not let scores of others join, because, if we did, one's neck was gone.  That was the mighty call to fight for independence. Those men who went out to fight did so with a full knowledge that they were going to fight and die, and were proud to fight.  We saw our <Col N="373" /> young men on the gallows.  I want the House to realise that it is only a few thousand who fought that fight.</P>
    <P>In 1924, when the Military Pensions Act came along, there were tens of thousands of men looking for pensions for battles they never fought.  The true fact is that there were not 3,000 fighting men in the country.</P>

      <P>This country cannot afford three armies&mdash;a southern army, a British army in Northern Ireland, the British Army and a northern police force, all maintained at considerable expense.  The economy of the country cannot carry the load that is on its back.  I think it is time that those in authority should face up to the position and do something about it. If there is to be a line-up let there be a common defence north and south. There is no reason why the orange and green cannot blend.  We could meet and agree in the matter of the G.N.R. and the Foyle Fisheries and I do not see why we cannot meet and agree on a common defence for this little island.  I am satisfied that there are good men in the north and south who would extend the hand of friendship to one another.  We should have a common unified front and then we can talk business and make our economy fit the situation.</P>
      <P>We should have one common defence force for the whole country and do away with all the rot.  I believe the whole thing is a racket.  The Border is being kept there for the purpose of making certain people rich overnight. We are too cowardly and mean to face up to the situation and until the Border is removed we will get nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>His castigation of the activities of the I.R.A. and his reflection on the men who composed that body are not deserved.  I admit the fighting strength during that period was only about 3,000 men but we had behind us, as we have to-day, a second line of defence.  We had the people behind us also.  To my mind it was that combination that enabled us to achieve the success we did.  When Deputy Captain Giles says that our Army should be cast aside and that we should admit that we have nothing to fight for and, even if we had, no hope of defending ourselves, he is not stating the true facts.</P>
      <P>In connection with the L.D.F. and the F.C.A. I would like the Minister to take note of some suggestions I have to make.  The greatest response in connection with the F.C.A. comes from the young men in the rural areas. There is nothing like the same support in the large towns.  Possibly there are too many counter attractions. The one difficulty under which these men labour at the moment is lack of halls and accommodation for training and lectures.  I do not think it is fair to expect men in the rural areas to travel five, six or seven miles to some hall and I would suggest to the Minister that an effort should be made to provide huts for these men.</P>
      <P>It was very easy for all of us during the emergency to join the L.D.F. There was a certain threat of danger at the time.  When the emergency passed it was only the people who were really sincere who continued on in the F.C.A. and I think we should pay tribute to them for their sincerity in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> I do not think public representatives on the whole are giving the F.C.A. the co-operation and support it deserves. The young men are not being encouraged to join to the extent to which they should be encouraged.  All of us who are interested in the defence of our country should do our utmost to encourage every young man to join this organisation.</P>
    <P>In connection with the suggestion I made with regard to the provision of huts, I would like to point out to the Minister that it is an expensive business at the moment sending lorries for F.C.A. personnel for training purposes. If the huts were provided more work could be done and probably the men would have a greater incentive to attend lectures and so forth.  In some parts of West Limerick these men have to traverse seven or eight miles of mountain in order to attend meetings. Most of them work hard during the day and it is not fair to place that burden on them.  We will have to rely on the F.C.A. for a second line of defence behind the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to say that we should not have an Army of 12,000 men.  If we adopt that attitude we will leave ourselves open immediately to anybody who cares to walk in here.  I was a member of the I.R.A.  I had experience in the Black and Tan war and in the civil war&mdash;not on the same side as Deputy Captain Giles, of course.  I believe we will always find young men to answer the call if and when the occasion arises.  Everything possible should be done to encourage the young men to join the F.C.A.  To those of us who had experience in the I.R.A. Deputy Captain Giles's remarks in relation to that body and the work done by it can be described as nothing but extravagant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with what Deputy J. Collins has said and in complete disagreement with what Deputy Captain Giles has said. The fact that we have our own Army to-day and our own police force is due to the work done by the young men who were in the I.R.A.  I was in the Volunteers in 1914 and I heard Padraig <Col N="376" /> Pearse address the company to which I belonged at the foot of Vinegar Hill. The field was lined with Volunteers.  In those days one had to buy one's own cap and haversack.  That time has passed and we are all getting older. We have a number of Old I.R.A. men here.  Some have gone to their eternal reward.  They were the men who made this Parliament possible.  It is sad to hear the extravagant statements of Deputy Captain Giles after all these years.  A certain tradition has grown up.  Next Sunday in Wexford we are honouring the memory of the men of 98.</P>
      <P>An army is, of course, essential.  It is very pleasant to see the Army parading on St. Patrick's Day and on Easter Sunday.  Every small country needs an army.  Small countries cannot depend on other nations for their defence.  We want our F.C.A. I have seen parades of these men and they are a credit to their officers and to all concerned with their training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that is causing dissatisfaction is the appointment of civil defence officers.  I know areas in which there are ex-captains and lieutenants, and yet the people who have been appointed to such very important posts as civil defence officers did not serve one day in the Army.  That is causing great dissatisfaction.  As Deputy J.J. Collins has said, we are not getting the same number of men from the cities and towns as from the country.  I think the reason is that those who served in the Army during the emergency were let down.  They did not get employment when it was there.  To-day, many of them are serving in Korea; they are in the British Army and in the British coal mines.  These were men who served during the emergency. They had to leave the country.  That is the fault of the Government which did not provide work for them and keep them at home.  Some of the finest men from my own area are to-day in Korea.  They are leaving daily and going into other armies.  We have free emigration to-day for Irish chaps. They are going to foreign countries where, I suppose, they will end up in the armies of those countries if war breaks out.  That is a sad thing.  No <Col N="377" /> matter what Government is in power, it is its duty to provide employment and keep our men at home.</P>
    <P>When jobs are going under local authorities it is not politicians who should be put into them.  That is what is happening.  The men who served in the Army, and who are fit to take up these jobs, should get them.  That is why we have our young men standing aside to-day when a recruiting campaign is going on.  The position is that it is only young lads, who have just left school, you see going off in the Army vans.  They are hardly able to carry a rifle.  The other men say: &ldquo;No, we have enough of that; what did we get for our five years during the emergency?  We got unemployment and emigration.&rdquo;  The young men to-day who have seen that will say: &ldquo;Well, what did the boys get who joined the Army, and what will we get when it is over?&rdquo;  That is why we have not a good recruiting drive.  That is the plain fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see that, if he takes a married man into the Army, his wife and family will be provided with a separation allowance.  That would encourage him to go into the Army.  There are men who would go into the Army to-morrow, young married men, but because no provision is made to keep their wives and families, they have to remain on the unemployment list.  If they have good payments and good separation allowances I have no doubt at all that the Minister would get all the men he wanted for the Army, and would not have to take little boys who have just left school.  It is sad to see mothers crying when their little boys are leaving the towns in the Army vans.</P>
    <P>On the exchanges at the moment there are over 60,000 people unemployed. The majority of these men would be in the Army if the conditions were better.  I say to the Minister that he and the Cabinet should examine this.  If there is going to be war in the near future, then this nation, like all other nations, will have to prepare, and will have to get the cream of the country into the Army. The Minister will get the men if he makes suitable provision for them and <Col N="378" /> gives good conditions.  What happened to the men who served the State dur-the emergency was that they were thrown on the scrap heap.  Now, we have young fellows being appointed civil defence officers by the county managers, who never served one hour in the Army.  That is an insult to the ex-officers, sergeants, and men like them.  I think that should be carefully considered.  I think that any person who is put into such an important position as that of civil defence officer should be a man who has served in the Army.  He should not be taken from a county council office, or any place like that.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>I must extend the benevolence of my charity to the rag end of Fianna Fáil.  This absurd little creature spoke about the Budget and then proceeded to talk about an article from their military correspondent in the London <i>Times</i> and to explain to the intelligent Fianna Fáil citizenry of Carlow that, if they would not vote for his Budget, for the love of God to vote for him in order that he would be able to defend them in the event of war.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister for Finance in his desire to address the citizens of Carlow about any subject on the face of the earth except the Budget, but I think he does his colleague, the Minister for Defence, a disservice if, in the desire to cover his own flank from the whips and scorpions of coming criticism of the Budget, he draws down the military <Col N="379" /> correspondent of the London <i>Times</i> for the purpose of persuading the people of this country that war has suddenly become imminent, and for that reason there must be no discussion of any domestic issue, since to conduct such a discussion in such a situation would be something approximating to treason.</P>
      <P>I have noted that whenever Fianna Fáil gets into a hot spot they start a war&mdash;an economic war or a civil war or a dollar war, or some kind of a war to distract attention from their domestic activities.  I want to remind the House of this important thing.  I remember 18 months ago, when they were feeling a bit in low water, that there was a terrific howl of the imminence of war from these benches, where Fianna Fáil were then.  I remember Deputy Vivion de Valera cross-questioning us closely as to how far we had stockpiled against the imminence of war.  I remember the present Tánaiste, whom we all rejoice to see sunburned and back from his adventures, warning us that if we did not accumulate substantial reserves against the imminence of war we were guilty of treason. Deputies will note that, having accumulated these reserves on a historic scale, the Tánaiste of to-day and Deputy Vivion de Valera are hurrying around the country wringing their hands and saying that we are in ruins because we have these accumulated stocks in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that we paralysed Irish industry as a result of our accumulated stocks.  I do not agree with him.  I think that, in the situation in which we find ourselves, it is a reassuring thing to know that there are excessive stocks of a great many commodities in the country at the present time. I think that the desirability of maintaining a full year's reserve is, perhaps, one of the most important strategic and morale considerations in relation to any defence policy.  As regards the imminence of war, I want to say that it is no service to our people to start war scares every 12 months, because it distracts the minds of our people from this fundamental <Col N="380" /> fact that, so long as the Cominform operates from Moscow, war may break out any Monday morning.  War will be started when the Cominform in Moscow think it is advantageous to start war, not later and not earlier. Nothing that happens outside would induce them to go to war a day sooner than it suits their over-all purpose.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>In relation to commodities that are not subject to control by ministerial or Government Orders, is there no way of ascertaining fluctuations in prices?  Does the Minister not think that it would be advisable if there was some way whereby fluctuations that occur in the price of commodities in common use were easily ascertainable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to the lack of information available concerning sailings between Galway and the Aran Islands and the general unsatisfactory nature of the service provided; and, if so, whether he is in a position to indicate what steps have been taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The service between Galway and the Aran Islands was transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann in August, 1951, and is now operated as part of the national transport system.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the service provided has been the subject of certain adverse criticism in correspondence which has recently appeared in the Press.  I am informed that as from 4th June sailings will be provided between Galway and the islands on Wednesdays and Saturdays in each week and that the service will be extensively advertised in the public Press and by means of posters and handbills.  It is also proposed to provide a number of excursions on Sundays during the summer and on public holidays on 2nd June and 4th August.</P>
      <P>The S.S. <i>Dún Aengus</i>&mdash;the vessel with which the service is operated&mdash; has been in use for many years.  I have informed the board of my anxiety to have an improved service and have asked them to examine the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has taken steps to try to have the services improved.  No doubt the Minister was made aware of the fact that some persons made inquiries from the Córas Iompair Éireann offices and also from the Irish Tourist Association offices to ascertain when services were available and were told that there was no information on the subject.  I appreciate the position has been remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to reports that British Railways have refused several thousand applications for booking and sailing tickets on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire service; and, <Col N="389" /> if so, whether he will state if he has satisfied himself that sufficient transportation on this route will be available through the summer period to ensure that tourists, and Irish people coming home on holidays, will not be deprived of transport facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers, and I am also aware that British Railways have published a statement challenging the accuracy of these reports.  Steps have been taken to obtain full information from British Railways in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>During the past six months there have been discussions about the passenger transport facilities serving the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route, and the representatives of British Railways who participated in these discussions have been urged to provide the maximum facilities practicable. The summer time-table recently issued provides for a considerable increase in the number of scheduled sailings in each direction, and I have already been informed by British Railways that sufficient sailings will be provided to cope adequately with the traffic offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If the reports published to the effect that British Railways have refused applications for sailing tickets in several thousand cases be correct, would the Minister consider informing British Railways that unless they are prepared to provide adequate services, the Government will request Irish Shipping to charter ships for the purpose of ensuring an adequate service during the summer period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think British Railways would know as well as I do that Irish Shipping could not charter vessels, but in any event the reports in the Press in regard to applications for sailing tickets relate to one week and it is obvious that a very large number of people would like to travel in the week immediately preceding the bank holiday.  It just would not be possible to accommodate in that one week all those who might like to travel at that time.  The number of sailing tickets has been increased and I understand <Col N="390" /> that special sailings will be provided to the limit practicable, but there is a limit and always will be for all traffic at any one period.  It is to be assumed that if there are people who cannot get accommodation in that week immediately preceding the bank holiday they can get accommodation at other periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising this matter in any controversial spirit, but I am sure the Minister is aware of the general impression there is that British Railways do not provide an adequate service.  Does the Minister not consider that the failure of British Railways to provide an adequate service damages the tourist traffic very considerably?  If they refuse to carry passengers who want to spend their holidays here is reduces the income which the hotel keepers and the people interested in the tourist trade could secure if those people were provided with transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that I presided last autumn over a conference of all the parties interested in transport facilities for the tourist trade.  Every aspect of this question was discussed at that conference, and the outcome was that British Railways undertook to provide additional sailings this summer provided the Government here undertook to make certain changes in the facilities at Carlisle pier.  Those changes are being made, and the British Railways time-table for this year shows a very substantial increase in the number of sailings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister has done everything he can in this matter and I appreciate his attitude. But am I right in thinking that the British Railways attitude in regard to the Holyhead and Dún Laoghaire service is that they are conferring a favour on this country by providing the service which they should provide in the summer period?  They regard it as a favour rather than as part of their obligation as a transport company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that would be a favourable description.  The service is quite a profitable one, and British Railways are, I am sure, very <Col N="391" /> conscious of that fact.  They experienced difficulty in providing additional ships of that character for a limited period, but undertook to make the maximum number of ships available, and to utilise these ships as often as possible, which necessitated certain changes in the facilities for turning the ships around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the preparation of the present development programme of the Electricity Supply Board, a preliminary survey of the Dungloe, County Donegal, chain of lakes has already been carried out. Following consideration of the results of this survey, I was informed by the board that the estimated output from a power station on this site would be comparatively low and consequently the erection of a station there was not proposed for inclusion in the board's current programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that a further survey is necessary.  The possibility of utilising the water of these lakes for power purposes has been under consideration by the board.  I, personally, became interested on the representations of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch.  It is possible to utilise that water power, but the capacity of the station would be small in comparison with the capacity of the stations on which the board is concentrating.  The Deputy will probably know that I informed the House during the discussion on the Electricity Supply Board Act that I was considering the practibility <Col N="392" /> of supplementing the board's programme with a number of smaller water power stations.  If that proves to be possible then, undoubtedly, I will ask the board to consider including those lakes in their programme.</P>

I informed the corporation on 25th April last that I would be prepared to sanction the borrowing of this amount on receipt of specific proposals.  Meanwhile, there is no question of the <Col N="399" /> housing programme being held up for want of funds.</P>

      <P>The main qualifications sought in candidates for announcer positions in Radio Éireann are: A high standard of general education and a good knowledge of current affairs.  Ability to speak both English and Irish with fluency and correctness and some knowledge of at least a third European language.  A suitable radio voice.  A temperament that will ensure coolness in work that tends at times to induce nervous tension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>All netting in fresh water was prohibited as from 1st January, 1948, under Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939. In exercise of the powers given to the fishery authority under the Act a bye-law was made permitting the use of nets for the capture of fish other than salmon, trout and eels in Lough Ree during the period 1st October in any year to 31st January next following. Provision is made in the Act and in the Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951, for the payment of compensation on the fulfilment of certain conditions to persons who can prove that they have suffered loss by the prohibition of netting.  The Lough Ree fishermen are not eligible for compensation under the conditions prescribed in the Fisheries Act, 1939.  A claim has been made on behalf of some of them under the Act of 1951, and on 12th October, 1951, evidence was requested that the claimants were in a position to comply with the conditions governing the payment of compensation as set out in the Act.  Such evidence has not yet been furnished, and unless it is received a decision cannot be made as to whether the claims made on behalf of the fishermen are admissible. The fishery authority has no power under the Act to do anything to alleviate the position of the fishermen more than has already been done by the making of the bye-law already referred to.</P>

Would the Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, consider amending the legislation to enable the small number of fishermen concerned to resume the means of livelihood they had, and rightly had, up to 1948?</P>

      <P>There are two elements in the Deputy's supplementary.  I am not prepared to deal with the second. With regard to the deprivation of these fishermen's rights, it is not true to say that the Electricity Supply Board deprived these fishermen of their rights on the coming into operation of the Fisheries Act, 1939.  They, in fact, deprived them of these rights quite apart from the Fisheries Act, 1939, and the question is not, therefore, one for my consideration but for the Electricity Supply Board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all entries opposite Reference No. 2.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment for the purpose of drawing the attention of the House to what I regard as a very extraordinary development.  The House will remember that the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced his intention of legislating against rings and trade organisations concerned to promote restrictive trade practices.  In these circumstances, when I was approached last January by two young men who had set up in the business of builders' suppliers, because they had been told by Irish Foundries, Limited, of Bailieborough, County Cavan, that they would not supply them with baths which these young men who had their own business wished to purvey to building contractors unless they joined a trade association, I said to these young men: &ldquo;That is quite incredible in the light of the undertaking given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to put an end to restrictive practices of that kind and there is no need to make a fuss about this business.  I believe that all we have to do is to bring the facts of this case to the attention of the Minister and suitable steps will be taken forthwith to put an end to the abuse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There then ensued this extraordinary correspondence which I now propose to read to the House.  In November, 1951, the firm wrote to Irish Foundries, Limited, Bailieborough, Co. Cavan, asking them if they could give delivery of 5' 1&rdquo; and 5' 6&rdquo; square-end baths and to state their prices and terms.  On 12th November, Irish Foundries, Limited, quoted for such baths.  The Dublin firm wrote to them several times urging them to deliver the baths which they had then ordered from Irish Foundries, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> On 26th November, the firm which these two young men were operating wrote to Irish Foundries, Limited, explaining that the baths were an integral part of their business and asking them to deliver an order which they sent them.  Now I ask the House to listen to this letter of 17th December from Irish Foundries, Limited:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>We are in receipt of your letter dated the 26th November, and note your remarks.</P>
    <P>We have, however, looked up the British Bath Manufacturers' Association list, and we cannot find your name on it as a bath importer.  We have also looked up the Irish &lsquo;A&rsquo; Foundry list, also the Irish Builders' Providers list and we regret that we cannot get any information from them either concerning you.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, ask you to give us some more particulars.  We would especially like to know if you are on any importers' list, if a member of &lsquo;The Irish Providers' Association&rsquo;. Also state the names of the foundries from whom you made purchases during the past 12 months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listening to that letter you would imagine that that was a questionnaire addressed to somebody who wanted a passport to travel in Sinkiang, or alternatively a questionnaire addressed to somebody who had a long criminal record.  But the only modest purpose of these people was legitimately to trade in baths, which they had been doing without let or hindrance until the Minister for Industry and Commerce put a duty of 50 per cent. ad valorem on the baths.  There was then one monopolist in baths, Irish Foundries, Limited, and that is the letter which they, in their enjoyment of their monopoly, address to a humble citizen of this State who writes to them, and sends them an order for baths.</P>
    <P>However, the citizen replied to that letter on 27th December, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>We are in receipt of your letter and note your remarks.  You are perfectly right in saying that you cannot find our name on any of the <Col N="407" /> association lists which you have perused.  We have not found any necessity for joining these associations, and consequently are not members.</P>
    <P>As indicated in ours of the 26th ult. we have imported between 700 and 800 baths in the past 12 months. These baths have been supplied by Messrs. S. Schonfeld Successors of London from German manufacturers.</P>
    <P>We were experiencing no difficulty in procuring supplies at extremely competitive prices prior to the imposition of the import duty, designed, we believe, to protect your industry.</P>
    <P>As indicated to you in ours of the 26th, we are prepared to market your baths provided we are buying on terms as favourable as our competitors, and must now request that you let us have confirmation by return that you are in fact prepared to supply so, or alternatively to give us a letter indicating your willingness to support our application to the Department for a duty free licence to import.</P>
    <P>Will you kindly treat this matter as urgent, as delays in replying to our letters have resulted in considerable dislocation of our business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Irish Foundries, Limited, replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>We are in receipt of your letter dated the 27th December, and note your remarks.</P>
    <P>We have decided to put your case before our directors at their meeting on 3rd instant, and will communicate with you immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we would be obliged if you would give us an assurance that if supplied you are prepared to display our bath in your showrooms, and in this connection would like to know where your showrooms are situated.</P>
    <P>We would also require a bankers' reference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To which the firm in Dublin replied on 2nd January:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>Further to the writer's phone conversation with Mr. Murphy, we are <Col N="408" /> pleased to confirm the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  We are prepared to display your bath in our showroom which is acceptable to the Irish Tile Slabbers' Association for purposes of displaying tiled surrounds, and in which we are already displaying plumbing goods.</P>
    <P>(2)  Our bankers are the Royal Bank of Ireland Ltd., Foster Place.</P>
    <P>We look forward to hearing from you within the next couple of days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, here is the gem of the collection &mdash;on the 4th January a letter issued from Irish Foundries, Limited:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further to our letter of 1st instant we have now had an opportunity of putting your case before our directors.  They have instructed me, therefore, to inform you that they will be pleased to give you full terms as soon as you become a member of one of the appropriate associations but would not consider you eligible for full terms otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Each of the associations referred to in that letter meets weekly or fortnightly to agree on prices, so that if a local authority or a contractor applies for a tender for 50 or 100 baths there will be an assurance that, no matter how many tenders they get, all the tenders will be on the one word and there will be no competition.  They meet weekly or fortnightly to that end, and if any member of one of these associations can be proved to have charged a lesser price for timber, plumbing, baths or fittings to any builder or any municipality, they are immediately struck off the list.  Observe what happens when they are struck off the list.  The monopolist, the only person in this country who is in a position to supply baths, writes: &ldquo;They have instructed me, therefore, to inform you that they will be pleased to give you full terms as soon as you become a member of one of the appropriate associations but would not consider you eligible for full terms otherwise.&rdquo;  The only basis on which you can become a member of one of the appropriate associations is that you will join the price ring&mdash;that you will undertake never to cut a price, and that you fully recognise that <Col N="409" /> if you should ever do so you will be cut off the list and become subject to that general ban.</P>
    <P>I have often said in this House that I adhered closely to my illusions.  I always go on patiently believing that this is a decent country to live in and that in the last analysis small people cannot be trampled under foot.  Wisely or unwisely, I said to these two chaps, &ldquo;Look here, do not worry.  It does not matter how big these fellows are. You have the public statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he will not stand for racketeering of that kind and rings and price fixing. He is very busy but I am perfectly certain that as soon as the facts are brought to his attention, effective measures will be taken.&rdquo;  I rang up the Department at once and I suppose I was ringing the Department&mdash;always receiving perfect courtesy from the variety of officers in the Department with whom I spoke&mdash;for a month at least and finally this letter issued from the Department, on the 9th February:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am desired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your recent representations on behalf of (a firm) who are unable to procure supplies of baths at best wholesale terms from Irish Foundries, Limited, Bailieborough, County Cavan, and to say that the inquiries which the Minister has caused to be made in the matter have not yet been completed. The result of the inquiries will, however, be communicated to you immediately it is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes me to add that it is not the practice to recommend the issue of duty free licences for imports of goods solely because a particular trader cannot obtain certain trade terms from a home manufacturer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I summoned the two lads.  I said: &ldquo;There you are.  I told you that as soon as this matter was brought to the attention of the Minister he would look into it and you will see that this abuse will not be allowed to continue.&rdquo; I was wrong.  On the 25th March, that is six weeks later, I got this letter from the Minister's private secretary:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" />&ldquo;I am desired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer further to your representations on behalf of (a firm) regarding the refusal of Irish Foundries, Limited, Bailieborough, to supply baths to that company.  In the course of your representations you stated that you felt that the real reason for the refusal to supply was that the firm in question refused to abide by the price-fixing conditions laid down by the Builders' Providers' Association.</P>
    <P>The Minister now desires me to inform you that he has investigated this matter and finds that the unwillingness of Irish Foundries, Limited, to supply this concern with baths is in no sense dictated by a refusal on the part of the Dublin concern to conform to the price-fixing conditions of any association, such as has been suggested.  Irish Foundries, Limited, have been and still are prepared to supply their goods to anyone, either within or without the Builders' Providers' Association provided that the customer is sound financially, that he is in a position to place a minimum order for baths, that he carries on a <i>bona fide</i> merchanting business to the extent that he carries stocks, has suitable facilities for displaying such stocks, and has a sales organisation.  The Bailieborough firm are carrying on the established usages of trade in the same way as every other reputable manufacturer, and in no case are they confining their sales to trading associations of any kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied from his investigations that Irish Foundries, Limited, have not violated any of the canons of reputable trading and, in the circumstances, he finds himself unable to recommend that facilities be granted to the firm in Dublin to enable them to import baths free of duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In retrospect, I confessed to looking very cynical but, believe it or not, I said to the two boys: &ldquo;There you are. Did I not tell you that, as soon as the Minister became fully apprised of the facts, these abuses would be at once laid?  All that it behoves me to do is to write and tell him the facts <Col N="411" /> and of the existence of the letter.&rdquo; Listen to this letter, because this is good&mdash;you would imagine in retrospect that it was written by an innocent schoolboy instead of a hardened old warrior like myself&mdash;this is from me:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Private Secretary</P>
    <P>to the Minister,</P>
    <P>Department of Industry</P>
    <P>and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I have your letter of March 25th.</P>
    <P>The Minister is clearly misinformed in regard to the circumstances of the case to which I directed his attention.</P>
    <P>In your letter you state that &lsquo;the Minister now desires me to inform you that he has investigated this matter and finds that the unwillingness of Irish Foundries, Limited, to supply this concern with baths is in no sense dictated by a refusal on the part of the Dublin concern to conform to the price-fixing conditions of any association. . . .  The Bailieborough firm are carrying on the established usages of trade in the same way as every other reputable manufacturer, and in no case are they confining their sales to trading associations of any kind&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>I have before me at the present moment a letter from Irish Foundries, Limited, Bailieborough, Co. Cavan, to (the firm in Dublin), dated January 4th, 1952, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Dear Sir, &mdash;Further to our letter of 1st instant we have now had an opportunity of putting your case before our directors.  They have instructed me, therefore, to inform you that they will be pleased to give you full terms as soon as you become a member of one of the appropriate associations but would not consider you eligible for full terms otherwise.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this letter from Irish Foundries, Limited, categorically contradicts the statement in the Minister's letter, I would be glad if you will ask him to review this matter in the light of this fact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> You would imagine that that had cleared the ground as much as it was humanly possible to do.  You would imagine that out of that there could arise no conceivable answer but that the Minister had brought this firm in Bailieborough to book but, if you imagined any such thing, you would not have reckoned with the resource of the Tánaiste.  I got no reply to that letter, which is dated 26th March, until 4th April, because he was manifestly a bit staggered by this.  Here, I must confess, my childlike faith began to wither and I am prepared to bid goodbye to one of the very few illusions that are still left to me.  I got this letter dated 4th April:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am desired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of the 26th of March, 1952, in which you quote from a letter dated the 4th of January, 1952, addressed from Irish Foundries, Limited, Bailieborough, to (the Dublin firm), in which it was stated that Irish Foundries, Limited, would facilitate the Dublin firm as soon as they had become a member of one of the appropriate associations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen to this, because this is good:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The issue of the letter referred to above has been discussed with Irish Foundries, Limited, who have assured the Minister that the letter was not in accordance with the firm's policy and was written by their managing clerk under a misapprehension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could you beat that?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have assured the Minister that they are supplying several firms who are not members of any trade organisation and will be quite willing to supply Builders' Direct Suppliers as soon as they are in a position to comply with the very reasonable conditions which they say are required to qualify as <i>bona fide</i> merchants and which are incorporated in my letter to you of the 25th March, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the meantime I had said to the Dublin firm: &ldquo;Send in your order <Col N="413" /> now&rdquo;.  This was before I got the letter of the 4th April from the Minister.  They did so, and, in reply to their letter ordering baths, they got a <i>pro forma</i> invoice from the Bailieborough firm which denied them the usual discount terms.  I wrote to the Minister of Industry and Commerce on the 30th April:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>Acting on the assurances contained in the Minister's letter of April 4th, Messrs.  Builders' Direct Suppliers forwarded their order for 50 baths to Messrs.  Irish Foundries, Limited, and have now received from them a <i>pro forma</i> invoice at £18 for 5' 6&rdquo; baths and £16 17s. 6d. for 5' 1&rdquo; baths, less 15 per cent., less 10 per cent., less 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>This, however, does not represent the terms made available by Messrs. Irish Foundries, Limited, to members of what they have described as &lsquo;the appropriate associations.&rsquo;  To members of &lsquo;appropriate associations&rsquo; Messrs. Irish Foundries, Limited, allow 15 per cent., 10 per cent. and 12½ per cent., with a settlement discount of 5 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The terms offered to the firm for whom I speak are therefore 12½ per cent. higher than those available to what they describe as Grade A firms.  I now quote my letter again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would be glad if the Minister would take such steps as may be necessary to impress on Messrs. Irish Foundries, Limited, their obligation to revise their <i>pro forma</i> invoice, No. 927, and to allow to Messrs.  Builders' Direct Suppliers the 12½ per cent. which they have not allowed on the <i>pro forma</i> invoice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 9th May I got a letter from the Minister's private secretary to say that the matter was being investigated, and on the 24th May I received the following letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With further reference to your letter of the 30th April, 1952, regarding Messrs.  Builders' Direct Suppliers, I am desired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say that he has ascertained from Irish Foundries, Limited, that they did receive an order for baths from <Col N="414" /> Builders' Direct Suppliers and that they quoted them &lsquo;B&rsquo; merchant's terms, which is all they were entitled to.  The extra discount of 12½ per cent. to which you refer is granted only to &lsquo;A&rsquo; merchants, that is, merchants who have the facilities referred to in my letter to you of the 25th March last.  If, and when, Builders' Direct Suppliers are in a position to comply with those requirements, Irish Foundries, Limited, will be quite willing to reconsider their application for terms applicable to &lsquo;A&rsquo; merchants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I want to submit that this firm, although they may not have the same equipment as the larger builders' suppliers in Dublin, have unquestionably adequate showrooms; showrooms, as they point out, which are acceptable to other suppliers of analogous merchandise. They can place and have placed an order for baths substantially in excess of the minimum stipulated. They undoubtedly carry on a <i>bona fide</i> merchant business, in evidence of which they pointed out to the Minister at an early stage that in the previous 12 months they had imported some hundreds of baths.  I have here before me an invoice for 300 baths imported during the year 1951, before the imposition of this tariff, showing that they certainly carry stocks, and that they are <i>bona fide</i> in the business. They have similar facilities to other people in the business, and they have a sales organisation.  The pair of them are night and day trying to build up the business to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>Here is the issue.  Is it to become hereafter the rule in this country that nobody can ever enter an established business but the big firms already in it?  If we are going to lay down the principle that if you want to go into the builders providers' business you must be prepared to provide forthwith from the day you open, premises which will compare with those of Brooks' Thomas, T. &amp; C. Martin, Dockrell's, Dinan, Dowdall's, or any of the old-established firms; that until you do you are not going to be regarded as what they euphemistically describe as an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade merchant and that you will have to trade against a rate of 12½ per cent. in favour of your larger <Col N="415" /> competitors, it means that we are establishing a most malignant and poisonous system of price rings in this country.  It may be that a couple of young chaps setting up on their own are not in a position to pay a team of travellers but, surely to goodness, there is nothing disgraceful in their acting as their own travellers&mdash;one man looking after the warerooms this week while his partner does the travelling, and <i>vice versa</i> the following week?  It may be that they cannot take premises with a large frontage on one of our principal thoroughfares with extensive showrooms to display their goods to potential customers, but surely because of that they should not be put in the position that they may never aspire to anything but retailers, that they may never compete for the patronage of large purchasers, such as building contractors or a municipality?  Surely it is to stop an attempt to crystallise a situation of this character that the Minister has announced his intention of bringing in legislation to control restrictive practices?</P>
    <P>I now assert, and I challenge contradiction, that there are in existence in this city and this country at the present time associations which meet regularly for the purpose of determining minimum prices below which nobody will sell builders' materials, and that the penalty of offering to sell for much keener margins of profit than is laid down by the price merchants is exclusion from the association.  I say that the House has before it clear evidence of the fact that the Bailieborough firm will not supply anybody who does not belong to such an organisation. I ask Deputies to bear this in mind.  Firms like the Bailieborough firm may hate the system just as much as I do but they are placed in the position that if they should continue to supply a man who was not a member of the ring, the ring would be around the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the morning to say that their baths had flaws in them, that their baths had cracks in them, that their baths were unsatisfactory, that the baths were too dear and that the Minister should issue a licence for the importation of baths or take such other <Col N="416" /> measures as would make things pretty hot for the Bailieborough bath manufacturers. If you have got to live out of your business and the alternative to trading peaceably and profitably with 99 per cent. of builders' suppliers is to break a quixotic lance with 99 per cent. of the builders' providers in this country in order to vindicate the right of a small firm that is struggling to get on its feet, then human nature cannot reasonably ask that you should throw your business into jeopardy in order to vindicate the right of the small man. That is what Parliament is for.</P>
    <P>Frankly, it never crossed my mind that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would for one moment countenance the picture that I have laid before the House and I confess, hardened as I am to politics, to be profoundly shocked to receive a letter from the Minister saying that he accepted the story that the Bailieborough firm's letter did not truly represent the firm's policy, that it was written by their chief clerk under a misapprehension.  I think that was a disreputable prevarication.  I do not believe the Minister believed that letter.  Surely the Minister agrees that if there is a letter here, which he can see, in which it is stated: &ldquo;We are going to bring your case before a meeting of the directors,&rdquo; and in four days' time that is followed by a letter which says: &ldquo;We brought your case before the directors.  Here is their decision,&rdquo; it is the shabbiest prevarication to say, subquently, that this letter was written by the firm's chief clerk without authority and does not represent the view of the board of directors.  The truth is that the board of directors got caught out.  They never thought that anybody would bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I would have expected the Minister for Industry and Commerce in these circumstances to say: &ldquo;That will not do.  I will not tolerate that kind of chicanery.  These people must be supplied provided they are prepared to pay for the baths.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of doing that the Minister appears to me to join in this game and to say that he believes that this statement <Col N="417" /> is true, when he knows that these people were told: &ldquo;We are going to bring your case before the directors&rdquo; and that four days later a letter was issued stating: &ldquo;We have brought your case before the directors and their decision is that we will not give you the terms unless you are a member of an approved association.&rdquo;  Then, when the Minister queries that, he is told that the chief clerk wrote that without authority and that it does not represent the directors' view.</P>
    <P>Now I am simply concerned with justice for two young fellows whom I never heard of, whom I have only seen once in my life.  I do not know who they are and whence they come.  I have never seen their premises and I know nothing about their business.  I was drawn into this solely because they came to me and told me their story the facts of which were verifiable and I wanted them to think that, whatever political differences exist, there were certain fundamental principles about which there would be agreement. I wanted to demonstrate to two young fellows that there was not such a thing in this country as the opportunity for a powerful organisation to crush or exploit little people or poor people, and that the moment you told the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this country, whatever Party he came from, facts of that kind, the whole power of the State would move into action to overthrow any vested interests, however great, in defence of a small person without inquiring as to what his background was, whence he came from or what his affiliations were, and that so long as he was an honest man and a citizen of this State he commanded a power greater than that which any vested interest could bring against him.</P>
    <P>It will be a source of humiliation to me if I have to go back to two relatively unimportant and entirely uninfluential persons and say to them: &ldquo;I was wrong.  We are living in a community where vested interests are too strong for me, too strong for Parliament, and there is not any remedy.  It is all a fraud.  When you are going to get into a business of this character go and make friends with the Mammon <Col N="418" /> of Iniquity, because righteousness and justice in this country have ceased to be the equal of Mammon.  The big boys, the rich boys are in this ring and Parliament itself is not able to compete with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I lay this soothing unction to my soul.  Maybe Parliament will not do it, but so long as I have a voice to denounce that kind of rotten, corrupt and bestial tyranny in this House I do not believe this House will for ever endorse vileness of that kind.  Although these two young fellows may be successfully smashed by the rapacious rascality of a combination of this kind, it is some poor consolation to know that some day our people will rise up in righteous indignation to tear such organisations to pieces.  It should be a humiliation to any Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce to tolerate for an hour such a thing.  I have no high opinion of the present Tánaiste but I certainly never thought, as I think this correspondence manifestly shows, that he would be an approving party to a transaction of this kind.  It is a revelation to me that it should be so.</P>
    <P>It is a degradation, it is a humiliation to us all if these young men are wiped out, as they are apparently going to be.  I hope that some other Deputies will resolve with me that if justice falls by the wayside to-day some day it will rise again and that rings and other combinations for the exploitation of our people and the aggrandisement and enrichment of avaricious individuals in our community will be destroyed for all time. So long as I am in public life they will be kept in the centre of the searchlight of publicity.  Whenever the opportunity offers itself to me to keep them there they will be denounced for what they are&mdash;parasites on the body politic of this country&mdash;and we will find some day some legislative D.D.T. which will eliminate them for all time from the society of which we constitute the Legislature.  No matter what we do hereafter, if this injustice be not rectified to-day we will all suffer and we must all share in the degradation that for a single hour a vested interest of this kind could set the fundamental <Col N="419" /> principles of justice and equity at open defiance for no better reason than to make themselves richer than they ever could hope to be by honest means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that arises in the dispute between these two firms is one of facts.  All Deputy Dillon's ranting is intended to conceal from the House that the facts do not support the case he is making.  I am quite certain that by this time Deputy Dillon realises that this firm on whose behalf he is speaking have no right to get that special advantage over other firms in the same trade which they are seeking.  The House is aware that I am proposing to bring forward legislation designed to eliminate restrictive trade practices and price-fixing rings. I have no power to interfere with these practices now, at least no power under statute.  But if I thought that any firm in the position of this Bailieborough firm, a protected industry supplying the Irish market, was in fact operating restrictive practices of the kind which Deputy Dillon referred to, I would have taken prompt measures to stop them or deprive them of their protection.  When this matter was brought to my notice I immediately investigated it to see if there was any justification for the allegation which was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another practice which I am going to discourage and that is, the practice of traders using political pressure, or a threat of political presure, to get from Irish manufacturers commercial advantages over their competitors. I want the House to be quite sure that we are not witnessing that at the moment.  This firm manufactures baths in Cavan.  According to the information available to me they are prepared to sell these baths to anyone at the prices on their price list.  If some people set up a trade as a builders' provider&mdash;that is, persons who go around among builders seeking orders for baths and transmit these orders to the firm in Cavan&mdash;they will get on the list prices a fixed discount&mdash; a discount which will provide them with a reasonable profit for their work. If, over and above seeking orders for baths amongst builders and firms <Col N="420" /> entering into building contracts, they agree to set up a showrooms and to carry in that showrooms a stock of baths, and maintain their own selling organisation, over and above the builders' providers' discount they get a further discount to offset the cost of carrying the stock maintained in the showrooms of the selling organisation.</P>
    <P>This firm which, according to my information, is a firm of builders' providers who canvass orders for builders' supplies and pass these orders on to the manufacturers and never see the goods because they are sent direct from the manufacturers to the purchasers, are seeking to force this firm to give them the full discount to which they would be entitled if they had a showroom and were prepared to carry a stock of baths, which they have not got.  The question is: Have this firm got that position in the trade that they maintain a showroom and carry a stock?  Deputy Dillon said that they must be stockists because they imported some 300 baths from Germany last year.  All the evidence is that they succeeded in getting orders for these baths, passed the orders on to the firm in London and had nothing more to do with the matter beyond distributing them for the exporters and collecting the commission on the sales.</P>
    <P>I went into this matter with some care.  I should have been far more determined, I think, to protect the interests of this firm if they were denied their just rights than Deputy Dillon professes to be.  Deputy Dillon says he has not seen their showrooms or visited their premises.  I had their premises inspected.  The firm occupies the ground floor of a two-storey converted coach-house at 59 Fitzwillian Lane.  Apparently these premises are used mainly for the purpose of manufacturing tiled fireplace surrounds. There is a small office and showroom combined which is not fronting directly on the lane but is separated from it by the usual stable yard.  It is now used as a storing place in fine weather conditions. In addition a small stores is used in an offshoot from the lane which is normally kept locked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a showroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="421" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just read out that there is.  You read from your report that there is a small showroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is a small office and showroom combined which is not fronting directly on the lane but which is separated from it by the usual stable yard, and another small store which is normally kept locked.  There was no stock of baths and no indication there that the firm were engaged in business as stockists.</P>
      <P>There are a number of firms on the list of customers of these bath manufacturers trading under a different set of conditions.  Some firms are credited as merchants who carry a stock and maintain a showrooms and sales organisation. They get the appropriate terms for that class of trading.  Then there are other firms who do not carry stock but who, nevertheless, are agents for the sale of the baths.  They get their profit through the commission allowed them.  As I understand it, the firm under discussion is in the second category, but it wants to get what, for it, would be an advantage over other firms in the same category, namely, the greater discount to which it would be entitled if it were incurring the expenses incurred by the firms in the first category and which, in fact, it is not incurring.  I would not regard that system of discounts as undesirable.  It is obvious that if this firm is allowed the greater discount without maintaining a showrooms, stocks, and so forth, that are maintained by firms in the first category, other firms will cease to do so, with the result that the staff which they employ will be disemployed, and that the firm itself will be forced back into the position of dealing in individual orders for small quantities, which would enhance its distribution expenses considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that an official of the firm wrote a letter in January last to the effect that they would supply the firm if they were members of one of the appropriate associations.  The fact that that letter was issued&mdash;issued, according to the directors, by the firm in error&mdash;is used here to get for this <Col N="422" /> firm the greater discount to which they are not entitled by their trading position.  It was that letter which, naturally, aroused my interest in this case, and which caused me to pursue the very full investigations that were undertaken before I satisfied myself that there was no occasion for my interference.  The firm have assured me, and have produced evidence, that they are supplying many merchants who are not members of any association, and that they continue to supply anybody who desires to enter this business on the stated terms, and to treat all comers equally.  I do not think it is reasonable to expect me to insist that they should do more&mdash;that they should give to this firm a greater discount than they would allow to other firms doing the same sort of trading, or the further discount which is designed to offset the costs involved in carrying a substantial stock of their goods.</P>
    <P>There is no issue here of monopolists grinding the face of the poor.  There may, perhaps, be another kind of issue which I do not want to stress. So far as my investigations show, this firm in Cavan are trading under circumstances which could not possibly bring their activities within the scope of the restrictive practices legislation which I intend to introduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is evidence on the record to show that the Minister's implication that there is a question of strong pressure being brought to bear on anybody is manifestly false.  I have been in correspondence with the Minister's Department since January last.  During all that time Dáil Éireann has been sitting.  I could have put down a parliamentary question at any stage, but those young fellows were not in the least anxious to become the subject of a <i>cause célébre.</i>  I kept saying to them that there was no need to do so, that once we got the information accurately into the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce nobody would be more active to protect their legitimate interests than he.  I said it was not a question that required to be raised in Parliament.  I said that all that was necessary was to engage the Minister's attention.  Sometimes it is not easy <Col N="423" /> to bring matters of that kind to his attention.  Day after day, I spoke to officers of his Department.  They told me they had passed the matter from this Division to that Division. Eventually, I said to some of the officers of the Minister's Department: &ldquo;I sympathise with your difficulties. It is not always easy to place precisely the responsibility in a matter of this kind.  Would you please pass it to the assistant secretary in charge of your Division?  If he feels he is not able to deal with it administratively he will bring it to the Minister's table.&rdquo;  That was done.  Here there is no evidence of a desire to raise an acrimonious political issue in respect of this matter.  It is not right to say there is. Four months have elapsed in each week of which I have been in correspondence, verbal or written, with the Minister's Department in order to press the matter forward to a satisfactory conclusion.  I do not think it helps anybody to suggest that political pressure has been brought to bear.  All the facts point in another direction.  The Minister read out to the House a report which he himself elected to read.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole argument was based on that and nothing else.  I have not seen the premises.  I know nothing about the fellows either.  The facts were reported immediately.  In giving us the report he got from his own inspectors, the Minister says there was a small showroom and office combined. To the Minister that may sound as a trifling matter.  If he knew as much about small business as I know, I wonder how he would describe my showroom in a country town?  I wonder if he went into the showroom of any Deputy of this House who does business in a country town how would it compare with the showroom of this small firm in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not bound to maintain a showroom on a main <Col N="424" /> thoroughfare in a city to fulfil the conditions of carrying a stock which you would show to your customers.  I am not making the case that these people had a big service here.  I am saying they had a showroom such that if they met a builder's contractor and bid him a price for a bath and he expressed the desire to see the bath they would say: &ldquo;Come along.  It is not a very stylish place.&rdquo;  When the Minister directed the inspection of the premises, the duty had been in force three months.  You cannot refuse a man a supply of baths and then bring it against him that he has not a supply of baths.  They have been clamouring for baths for five months and they could not get any.  When the premises were inspected there were not any baths there.  How could there be?  They would not give them any.  Here is an order in respect of which the Bailieborough firm thought fit to issue an invoice. The Bailieborough firm issued the invoice and if they did not believe they were going to take delivery of the baths why should they issue that invoice?</P>
      <P>The Minister said there are certain categories of traders.  Does Dáil Éireann want to set up a system of hierarchy of traders in which at every stage in the hierarchy there must be a margin of profit?  You have &ldquo;A&rdquo; traders, &ldquo;B&rdquo; traders, &ldquo;C&rdquo; traders and retailers.  What does that mean? What is the price of a bath in this country now?  Here is how the thing goes up.  You finally arrive at the stage when you get a six-foot bath costing £21.  If you are a merchant of the third category you get 10 per cent. discount and 5 per cent. settlement.  That means that the price of the bath is £21, less 15 per cent.  Then there is category &ldquo;B.&rdquo;  The price of a six-foot bath is £21.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be an imported bath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The price of an Irish manufactured bath as to six feet is £21. There is 15 per cent. settlement and discount if you are a retailer.  If you are graded &ldquo;B&rdquo; you are entitled to buy the bath at £21, less 15 per cent., less 10 per cent. and less 5 per cent. <Col N="425" /> Now there is a further category of merchants&mdash;Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; merchants, and if you are a grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; merchant you pay £21 for the bath, less 15 per cent., less 10 per cent., less 12½ per cent. and less 5 per cent. so that the bath which began at £21 goes down to about £13 15s. in the following manner.  You first take off 15 per cent. which we will say is £3 and that leaves £18.  You then take off 10 per cent., which is, say, 30/-.  That leaves you with £16 10s.  You then take off 12½ per cent. which is £2 1s. and that leaves you about £14 9s. You next take off 5 per cent. which is 14/- or 15/- and, by heavens, the price of the bath is now down to £13 15s.!</P>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the House. It sounds very queer, but the hardware trade is a peculiar trade and you would want to understand it before you evaluate facts such as that.  There are certain commodities in the hardware trade which have a standard price.  The price has always remained the same but moved up and down by way of percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to buy screws the price is related to a price quoted in 1936, plus 175 per cent.  That is the way the hardware trade is run.  I do not object to the system, which might appear scandalous, of saying: &ldquo;Here is a price of £21, less 12 per cent., less 10 per cent. and so forth.&rdquo;  The evil is that you have different categories of merchants entitled to rates of discount because when these commodities are brought before the price-fixing machinery of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the price-fixing machinery people say: &ldquo;Look here, if this bath cost £15 to manufacture, are you not getting a fair profit if you get £16 10s.?&rdquo;  The manufacturer says: &ldquo;Perhaps we are, but what about the wholesaler-retailer; or the retailer?&rdquo;&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo; says the Department.  They say: &ldquo;There are 40 genuine wholesalers in the country and they must get a living.&rdquo;  They are given a living.  The wholesalers distribute these baths to the wholesaler-retailers, and they must get a living. How many are there?  Four hundred. We must give them a living.  But, wait a minute, what about some 20,000 retailers?  Are they going to get a living out of it, too?  We will give <Col N="426" /> them a living out of it.  Remember, when they get a living, all the employees must get a living.  You will have to give them a margin of profit. They have got to pay trade union wages.</P>
    <P>The factory people say they can sell the bath for £16 5s., but they have been asked to provide a profit for the wholesaler.  They are given 15 per cent.  The wholesaler-retailers are given 10 per cent., and the retailer is given 12½ per cent.  The bath is now £16 10s., plus 15 per cent., plus 10 per cent., plus 12½ per cent.  Then somebody asks: &ldquo;What happens when the fellow pays cash?&rdquo;  He will have to be allowed 5 per cent. cash discount. At this stage, the bath is costing £16 10s., plus 10 per cent., plus 15 per cent., plus 12½ per cent., plus 5 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister really believe that these people have been fairly treated?  He admits himself that they have a showroom.  He told us that he went himself, by his officer, and saw the showroom.  I was not in a position to certify that.  As far as I could gather from what he said, the only thing in which these people failed <Col N="427" /> to meet the requirements was that they have no showroom and they did not carry stocks.  The Minister found the showroom.  They have not stocks because they will not be given stocks. That is the burden of their complaint.</P>
      <P>Surely, if they have a showroom, if they are prepared to pay for the goods, if they ask nothing more than the right to trade in them, and if they are prepared to receive delivery of them in the showroom which the Minister, by his inspector, knows to exist, they have complied with every requisition the Minister has laid down for a trader entitled to the best terms. The alternative is to close them down, put them out of business.  I think that is not fair.</P>
      <P>I say this is all part of a horrible system of price rings and price manipulation here under the protection of high tariffs and quotas designed to rob the public by ensuring that competition will not be whittled down.  A whole tyranny of profit margins has been raised behind the protection of tariff barriers and quotas for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many.  That is wrong.  It is dishonest. It is unfair.</P>
      <P>I believe that I could with confidence invoke the assistance of the Minister to put right what I believe to be a very real injustice in this case.  I ask him now if these people, albeit that their showroom is modest and poor, take delivery of the baths, hold themselves ready to show them to any potential customer, are solvent and prepared to pay, will he direct that they get the same terms as any other merchant in the same line of business with a showroom, rich or poor, gets from these firms provided that he pays his debt and involves the firms in no financial liability?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let me make it clear.  First of all, there is no refusal <Col N="428" /> to supply.  The only question is whether this is the type of firm that canvasses for orders and passes the orders on to the factory which supplies the customer without the canvasser having seen the goods at all, or is it the type of firm that carries the stock and supplies orders out of that stock? If it is in one class it is entitled to one rate of discount.  If it is in the second class it is entitled to another rate of discount.  All the evidence goes to show that the category is correct. If they can show they are in the second class, that they have a showroom and will carry stock, they will be able to supply on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I have no complaint if the Minister will undertake to enforce that rule equitably.  I think it is a fair ruling in all the circumstances.

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his statement, made an allegation that firms which are members of this protective association could, under certain circumstances, blackmail an Irish manufacturer by representing that his products were inferior and thereby deprive him of the protection of the protective tariff. I want an assurance from that Minister that that is not so.  I do not think that firms like Messrs. Brooks, Thomas, Messrs. Dockrell or Messrs. Martin would be guilty of such conduct. If it were true, however, that distributing firms, because an Irish manufacturer dared to supply Irish products to a firm which was not a member of their association, could and would there and then go maliciously to the Minister and make representations to the effect that the manufactured goods were inferior&mdash;I do not believe that that would happen&mdash; I want an assurance from the Minister that, if that did happen and if distributors were guilty of such conduct, the Minister would at least protect the Irish manufacturer by having such allegations carefully and thoroughly investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, from time to time disputes have arisen between manufacturers and distributors as to the quality of the product supplied. These disputes have to be resolved on the spot as and when they arise.  I would remind the Deputy that on recent occasions I have been pressing upon manufacturers the advantage of seeking a standard specification for the type of goods they are making from the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and applying that standard mark under the appropriate legislation to their goods.  I think the best protection a manufacturer, a trader or the public can have is the extension of the use of the standard mark.  The Institute of Industrial Research and Standards will prescribe a standard specification of quality for any class of goods.  A number of standard specifications have been made.  Others will be made until we will have, I hope, as many here as are in force in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a standard specification has <Col N="430" /> been prescribed the manufacturer can attach a standard mark to his product. By doing so he guarantees that his product is equivalent in quality to the standard prescribed and he lets it be known to the public that he is facing the possibility of prosecution if the quality of his product is less than the prescribed standard.  I would, therefore urge upon all manufacturers the tremendous advantage it is to them to encourage the preparation of standard specifications of the type of goods they produce and to use that standard mark.  It is by that means that any suspicions that may exist in the minds of the public or in the minds of traders as to the quality of goods produced in Irish factories can be finally removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, of course, a very large number of firms trading in these baths at the rate of discount at which this firm was offering to supply them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the function of the commission man.  Take this case. One man has large premises and carries a large variety of stock.  Another man must content himself with a somewhat less elaborate stock.  Surely, it is not going to be contended that, because he has not got as wide a variety of stock as his richer competitor, he is to be put out of the trade altogether?</P>

      <P>There are fashionable stockists who carry a wide variety of baths.  They can show them to a customer in green, pink and yellow, so that a builder can walk in and say that he will take 24 of this and ten of that. The other man has them only in white, and the few that he has may be in a basement.  His wealthy neighbour carries a full stock.  Is it to be contended that the other man who has only the one variety is not entitled to the same terms as his wealthy neighbour? If that were so it means that unless he can get together a capital of £250,000 he can never hope to be on the same footing as his wealthy neighbour. In that case there would be no new entrants to the trade at all, and most of us entered it on a shoe string.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that we could discuss the whole thing together. If the Chair desires, I can discuss this on the Schedule.  When the 30 per cent. is added, that raises the price of the pair of boots to 33/-, the same pair of boots which cost £1 at the factory gate.  You have there a profit for the manufacturer, the wholesaler and the retailer.  Would it surprise the Minister if I tell him that all three&mdash;manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer&mdash;in one case at least is the same man in different clothes.  The manufacturer of the boots appears at the factory gate with the pair of boots.  He changes his clothes and dashes across the street and becomes the wholesaler; he changes his hat, rushes out and becomes the retailer.  He puts the pair of boots in the window as the retailer. Without being too precise, there is another like that man in Tipperary. The same man is manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That same man is a manufacturer, a wholesaler and a retailer.  The pair of boots which he manufactures costs the purchaser 33/-.  I was in the boot trade in this country for the last 25 years, and I want to tell the House that in 15 years' trading, before tariffs and quotas in boots were brought in, there was no such thing as a boot wholesaler.  There were two wholesalers in the whole of Ireland and they supplied three small hucksters' shops. Deputies must be familiar with the sign hanging outside a shop saying that the shopkeeper was an agent for, say, the &ldquo;K&rdquo; boot.  The travellers from these firms came from England to Kilkenny, to Cork, to the Lee boot people, or to those who sold various other brands.  They sold them the boots direct from the manufacturer. <Col N="434" /> Three or four months before delivery was taken a consignment was sent from the retailer to the factory.  When the system of price control came in there emerged a new, vital interest in the boot trade, namely, the wholesalers. They are a purely ghostly body that have no physical existence. They were put in solely for the purpose of establishing a step in the profit grading so as to widen the difference between the production costs and the legal selling costs.  I could show the Minister in trade after trade in this country where, to my mind, an effort was made by trade organisations with the greatest possible assiduity and skill to sell that proposition to his Department. They successfully sold it.  I tell Deputies that they will find groups of traders for whom profit margins are provided who have no physical existence. They only exist for the purpose of collecting a profit margin which was never there until they were thought up by trade organisations to make the margin between costs and selling somewhat wider than it would otherwise be.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I know of one man who is manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer, and he collects a fixed margin at each stage of the operation.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the Minister that there is a manufacturer of boots and shoes who has two <Col N="435" /> or three shops within 300 yards of his factory.  Am I to understand that he is getting the wholesaler's price and the retailer's price, although he himself is the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer as well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He is running shops and he is employing people.  Is he to get nothing to cover the cost of running the shops and paying his employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems most unfair that a man should collect profits as a manufacturer, a wholesaler and a retailer, although his factory and shops are within 600 yards of one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not get a wholesaler's allowance unless he is reselling to other traders.</P>

    <Col N="436" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, unless he sells the boots; but it is open to his own wholesale firm to sell them from the wholesale to the retail premises, and he is entitled to take a profit at each stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Schedule and title agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill reported without amendment.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages now.</P>
      <P>Bill received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <P>This is a Money Bill within the meaning of Article 22 of the Constitution.</P>
