      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the unemployment figures for the Republic of Ireland have increased by approximately 14,000 over the past 12 months; and, if so, if he will state what proposals the Government have to alleviate the plight of the 70,000 persons who cannot find work in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, on the 26th April, 1952, the last date for which the figures are available, the registered unemployed numbered 67,766, which was an increase of 12,853 over the figure for the corresponding date last year.  Britain and many European countries are at present also experiencing a phase of increased unemployment notwithstanding the expansion of the production of war materials.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, I do not think that I can usefully add anything to what the Tánaiste has already said in the Dáil in reply to the motion moved by Deputies Norton and Larkin on the 14th February, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is poor consolation to the unemployed of this country to say that Britain and other countries find themselves in the same plight?  I cannot say that I remember any specific proposals by the Tánaiste in the debate on the motion to which the Minister referred.  Surely, at this stage, there could be some indication from the Government as to what proposals they have in mind for <Col N="1130" /> the present year to alleviate the plight of the unemployed during the present year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will read the reply of the Tánaiste in the debate to which I referred, he will find that the Tánaiste dealt comprehensively with the matter.  The Government, of course, are taking all possible steps to increase production both in agriculture and in industry so that increased employment may be given and extra production brought about to support the volume of consumption of our people.</P>

      <P>Whilst I appreciate the difficulty in which Ministers find themselves at present, I also realise that the type of employment to which the Tánaiste referred was based on a long-term policy.  Surely, whilst nobody likes the smack of relief schemes, the Government could in the meantime do something to relieve unemployment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the high prices being charged for wallpaper; and, if so, whether he will request the Prices Advisory Body to examine the profits made by retailers in the sale of this commodity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Wallpaper is available at a wide range of wholesale and retail prices.  Having regard to the price of raw materials and production costs I am satisfied that the profits of the manufacturers are reasonable.  The profit margins taken by distributors here are on the same basis as those prevailing in the case of wallpapers <Col N="1131" /> manufactured and sold in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>The profits of the manufacturers and distributors are subject to scrutiny by the prices branch and if on examination it was considered that excessive profits were being made in any case the matter would be referred to the Prices Advisory Body, or the Prices Advisory Body may on their own initiative, or at the request of any section of the public, inquire into the prices charged for any commodity or service.</P>

      <P>I have given the Deputy the information available to my Department, that the profit margins taken by distributors here are on the same basis as those prevailing in the case of wallpapers manufactured and sold in Great Britain.  The prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce have looked into the matter.  They think that the present prices are reasonable having regard to the costs.

      <P>I have not yet received a recommendation from the Prices Advisory Body on the investigation into motor insurance premiums.  I have been informed by the body, however, that, following a public inquiry held on 1st and 2nd April, 1952, it had prepared a report in the matter. Before the report could be presented to me, the Accident Offices Association, whose members constitute the great majority of insurance companies operating in this country, furnished to the body new information as to the motor insurance experience of its members in this country in the year 1951.  This new information necessitates further consideration of the position by the body and the submission of a report was, accordingly, postponed.</P>

      <P>The total quantity of unsubsidised flour (including wheatenmeal) sold during the last financial year amounted to 343,097 sacks.  This quantity included flours of various rates of extraction produced from different grists.  Consequently, the economic price was not uniform.  The bulk of the flour was flour of 75 per cent. extraction, for which the economic price was, on the average, 117/11 per sack and the selling price was 130/- per sack.</P>
      <P>The total profit to the Exchequer on sales of these flours amounted to £207,445 during the year.</P>
      <P>If the persons who purchased these flours had been supplied instead with subsidised flour of 85 per cent. extraction, the Exchequer would have had to bear a loss of £1,059,312 instead of receiving a contribution of £207,445 towards the subsidy.</P>

      <P>The recent duty on imported razor blades was imposed to protect the Irish factories engaged in the manufacture of razor blades and thereby to increase employment. Receipts from the duty on razor blades in the year 1951-52 amounted to £80,623.  Since the duty is a protective one, it is expected that the increase in the rate of duty will be offset by a substantial reduction in imports.</P>

    <P>Cliff station on the River Erne only came into operation during the year 1950-51 and as a partial development and consequently normal capital charges have had to be approximated.

      <P>&ldquo;What were you put out of the Guards for?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan repeated that statement, and, at the request of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, he withdrew his statement.  I then said:</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session to establish a co-ordinated system of social insurance and to provide for the benefits thereunder, to repeal, amend or extend the existing enactments relating to national health insurance, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and intermittent unemployment insurance, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion declaring it to be &ldquo;expedient to authorise <Col N="1148" /> such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session to establish a co-ordinated system of social insurance&rdquo;, etc. Of course, when the Minister made his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill we were not privileged to see the Budget.  But, since then, we have seen the Budget, and in the light of the terms of the Budget this Resolution seems to be misleading.  We were told on the Second Reading of the Bill that the scheme of social welfare introduced by the Minister was one in which the workers were going to get certain insurances at a lesser charge than they would have to pay under the previous Social Welfare Bill.  It is true, of course, that under this Bill they are not getting retirement pensions which were included in the previous Bill, for the retirement pensions for men at 65 and women at 60 are killed in this Bill. Those who will be covered by the Bill for other purposes will not be entitled to the death benefits provided under the previous Bill.  That provision is being killed as well.</P>
      <P>In addition, the previous Bill, which I had the honour of introducing, provided for an increase in maternity benefits from £2 to £5.  Those persons are not going to get £5 now.  They are going to be tied down to the £2 which runs to-day and which has been running for many years.  The maternity attendance allowance provided under the previous Bill is similarly killed with the three other provisions I have mentioned in the Bill which has been introduced by the Minister.  But, notwithstanding that fact, the workers' contributions are going to be increased in this Bill, in spite of the assurance we got from the Minister in March in 1951, that there would be no increase in the contributions under this Bill. We were then told that the Exchequer would pay the additional cost involved, and that workers would not be expected to make any additional contribution whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement has been falsified by the provisions of this Bill which is increasing the contributions of workers although depriving them of four vital benefits, four valuable benefits which <Col N="1149" /> were in the previous Bill, and four benefits which were not in any respect mere risks.  To a great many members of the community they would be, not risks, but almost certainties.  They are killed in this Bill.  We were told on Second Reading that the additional cost of this Bill was to be paid for out of moneys provided by the Exchequer. The Minister has had to admit that the workers' contributions are being increased under this Bill.  The Exchequer, we are told, will pay the rest.</P>
    <P>That is a fraud; that is a sham; and that is deliberately deluding the workers because, under this Bill, not only is the contribution of the worker increased but he will have the delightful privilege of paying his employer's share and the Government's share.  He will pay all that out of the money which he will now yield up to the Exchequer in the form of higher prices for bread, tea, sugar, flour and butter, higher prices which he will pay for cigarettes and, if he takes a drink, higher prices which he will pay for beverages.</P>
    <P>Instead of this being a Resolution purporting to say that the money will be provided out of the Exchequer to finance this Bill, this Resolution could more appropriately be described as a Resolution to search the pockets of the workers, to take more money out of those pockets by making them pay higher prices for foodstuffs, beer and tobacco.  Out of these higher prices they will get back a fragment in compensation and the rest will be utilised by the Government to pay the employer's portion and the Government's portion of the social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>Is it not as clear as daylight to anyone, any single man who takes a drink and smokes a pipe or cigarettes, who eats bread and butter and likes tea and takes sugar in it, that by the time he is finished paying the extra charges for these commodities the amount he will pay will be vastly in excess of what he would have paid under the previous Social Welfare Bill and that under that previous Bill he would have got much more valuable benefits than he is getting under this Bill?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> In short, Sir, as we see this Social Welfare Bill now, we can understand the haste which was displayed in trying to push the Second Reading through the House as speedily as possible. Not only will this Social Welfare Bill be financed entirely, so far as the State contribution is concerned, but there will be a surplus over, out of the additional moneys which will be taken out of the pockets of the workers by compelling them to pay increased prices for foodstuffs and increased taxes on cigarettes and liquor.  All the humbug and all the pretence that this Bill would be introduced, that the workers would get a social welfare scheme as good as the previous one and without any increased cost, has now been unmasked.  The Bill before us is a shadow and a miserable shadow of the previous Bill and the workers will have the privilege under this Bill, taken in conjunction with the Budget, of paying not only their own share but the Government's share and the employer's share as well.  That is offered to them as a Bill which is supposed to be better than the previous one.</P>

That is the way in which this scheme will be financed and it is offered to the workers as something better than the previous Bill when, of course, anyone with intelligence knows that this Bill is a fraud on the workers, that the promises which were made in 1951 by the Government have not been redeemed and that this Bill does not in any way measure up in benefits to those provided for in the previous Bill.

That cuts both ways.  It is not so long since Fianna Fáil Deputies were on these benches, and, in respect of practically every piece of legislation <Col N="1153" /> brought in at that time, we had from Fianna Fáil speakers, then on this side of the House: &ldquo;We were going to bring that in.&rdquo; When the 1950 Housing (Amendment) Bill was brought in, the former Minister for Local Government said: &ldquo;That is our Bill,&rdquo; but they had 16 years in which to bring that Bill in and they did not it in.</P>

      <P>I suggest we are perfectly entitled to refute the suggestions of speakers from the Government side that there was a deliberate delay of three and a half years in the passing of the Social Welfare Bill introduced last year.  Deputy McGrath says that Deputy Norton's Bill sought to extract forcibly from the pockets of the workers a contribution of 3/6 per week.  A contribution of 3/6 per week was expected, but it was not hidden from the public.  Every worker knew he would have to pay 3/6.  Fianna Fáil spokesmen at the time tried to make capital out of it and we did not blame them for seeking to make whatever capital they could out of it; but the fact is that the contribution was to be increased from 1/11 to 3/6 per week and the workers knew exactly what they were getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit now that the difference between the 5d. extra contribution and the difference between 1/11 and 3/6 as provided in the other Bill would be very satisfactorily compensated when one remembers the four major provisions which Deputy Norton mentioned were in the Bill he introduced&mdash; the death gratuity, the maternity attendance allowance, the increased maternity grant and the retirement pension at 65 for men and 60 for women.  It is significant, and even the Fianna Fáil back benchers know that it is significant, that there was a strong endeavour by the Government, to the point of nearly forcing the Dáil to give them the Second Reading before the Budget, to have the Second Stage passed before even the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1154" /> back benchers knew what the provisions of the Budget were going to be.</P>
    <P>I forecast during the last election in my own constituency that, if the promise of Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he was then, was to be implemented, the promise that there would be a social security scheme under which the workers would not have to contribute another penny by way of increased contribution, the worker would pay very severely for any such scheme.  Everybody knows that that is the position at present.</P>
    <P>I instanced the case of a man with a wife and three children.  They, by reason of the fact that the food subsidies have been slashed, will be forced to pay per person an extra 2/1½ per week if they are to continue buying even the now rationed amounts of foodstuffs: tea, bread, butter and sugar. That means that the man, his wife and three children will have to pay an extra 10/7½ per week for these four items. The reliefs&mdash;2/6 for the second child and 1/6 for the third&mdash;will amount to 4/-per week, leaving a gap of 6/7½ that the workman will have to pay.  Putting 5d. on to that, it means that the worker is going to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for this Fianna Fáil scheme of social security a contribution of 7/0½ per week, so that our forecast during the last election that the workers would pay through the nose for a Fianna Fáil scheme of social security has proved correct.  Even the Taoiseach, who is generally regarded as an honest man, spoke very strongly in favour of the retention of the death gratuity and retirement pension when he spoke in Cavan about 14 months ago.  I quoted the item from the <i>Irish Press</i> when I spoke previously here.  I have not got the quotation now but Deputy de Valera, as he then was, spoke strongly in favour of a social security scheme which would include a death grant and retirement pension when he spoke in Cavan in February, 1951&mdash;the first statement we had on social security <i>vis-á-vis</i> the discussion on Deputy Norton's social welfare scheme.  The <Col N="1155" /> fact is that for a reduced scheme of social security, due to the provisions of the Budget, the workers will not alone not get a scheme with no increase in contribution, but, having regard to the slashing of the subsidies, they will have to pay 7/- a week for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton is very concerned now about the effect of the reduction of subsidies on the contributions which will be made to the social welfare scheme, but, speaking on 15th October, 1947, at column 435 of the Official Debates, Deputy Norton said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The highlight of the document put before us is, I take it, the subsidies to reduce the prices of tea, bread and sugar.  I think these are sham reductions.  I do not think they make any perceptible contribution to relieving the plight of the ordinary working people to-day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that was his attitude then, how can their removal make such a perceptible difference now?  Deputy Larkin, speaking in the same debate, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...money to provide the subsidies... is to be obtained, in the main, from wage and salary earners by extra charges on what have come to be recognised as necessaries... If it was a question of a tax on drink, from a moral or ethical point of view, I would be the first to tax it out of existence altogether.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How can the taxes make such a difference to-day if that was Deputy Larkin's attitude on that occasion? These speeches speak for themselves and the attitude of these Deputies to-day merely shows that people, as the years go by, can alter, according to the circumstances they think would be in their favour, the principles they were supposed to hold at the time they made these statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As a worker, I want to say that the majority of Deputies do not understand the position of workers under the Budget.  Fianna Fáil for 16 years never thought of a social welfare <Col N="1156" /> scheme.  The present Minister said in my constituency during the general election that when he left office, he left a better Social Welfare Bill behind him which Deputy Norton could have put into operation.  We all knew that was untrue because he had no such thing as a social welfare scheme at the back of his mind at all.  After the general election, having preached so much on social welfare, he had to try to draft some class of Social Welfare Bill and he copied the Bill Deputy Norton had, but took the good points out of it, as I said here before.  The death benefit in Deputy Norton's Bill would have been a great benefit to the poor people, who are not able to pay for funeral expenses through an insurance society.  It would give £6 for a child and £20 for an adult.  That was one of the best things I saw in the Bill, but that was taken out of it.  The poor to-day, as in the past, must depend on their good neighbours, when some of these people die without a policy and would have to be buried by the local authorities.  The present Minister would not relieve his own people in County Wexford by leaving that privilege there.</P>
      <P>The Budget has made a lot of difference. Statements have been made that the times are not as bad for the working-class people.  Does not everyone know that after July the bread and butter will be taken off the poor man's table?  We have heard all the praise about giving the old age pensioners 1/6 and giving increased children's allowances. What about the people who have no family, what is being given to them?  What is being given to those on home assistance, what is in the Social Welfare Bill for them?  Nothing.  They may depend on the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Wexford we are giving 6/-to the blind pensioners as a subsidy from the local ratepayers, along with the £1 per week blind pension.  Here we have the Government boasting about what it is going to do.  I think it is a shame and I rise here as a worker who has been in industry for 25 long years in the one firm, in the dust mills where lots of my comrades died from congestion of the lungs, from <Col N="1157" /> dust and industrial disease, and nothing for them.  The same thing happened the miners in Castlecomer, in Arigna and in other places.  The Government says: &ldquo;No, we will not touch these people.&rdquo;  They are left as they are, where they were left for 16 long years.  Down the country the people are disgusted with the present Minister for talking so much about what he is doing in his Social Welfare Bill, talking so much and doing so little.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Budget increases altogether, there is the price of milk, which Deputy Dr. Browne, when he was Minister, said was so necessary for the young children; but he walked into the Lobby last Thursday night to increase the price of butter by 10d. per lb., along with Deputy Cogan from Wicklow and Deputy Peader Cowan from Dublin, supporting a Government that put these penal taxes on the poor. Is it any wonder that the people outside are asking: &ldquo;When are you going to throw out the Government?&rdquo;  I wish to goodness we could do it to-night.</P>
    <P>I remember that the Taoiseach, when he was beaten here on a Bill by one vote, went off in the middle of the night and dissolved the Dáil.  That was on the Transport Bill, the bogey now that the ratepayers and taxpayers are subsidising to the extent of millions of pounds&mdash;Córas Iompair Éireann. He will not run to the Park now.  No, because it is not popular for him&mdash;and well he knows it, because the people are outraged.  I am living in a community where there are 600 poor people who are not able to get the necessaries of life, who are out of employment and are trying to exist on the dole, which is 23/ in the case of a man.  The old people get the pension after 70 long years, but the present Minister, who knows County Wexford the same as I do, said here a fortnight ago that 1/6 would give the old age pensioner sufficient money to buy the necessaries of life with the increased cost.  He allowed 5d. for half pound of butter, so much for tea, so much for sugar.</P>
    <P>Is it not terrible to hear a Minister who voted himself £500 per year for <Col N="1158" /> being a Minister in this House offer 1/6 to the fathers and mothers of the men of 1916 and the people coming after them?  He ought to take courage in his hands and bring this Bill back to the Custom House, so that the officials could examine again the Bill that Deputy Norton produced to this House and to the country but on which we had not the co-operation of some of the fine Fianna Fáil people.  Deputy McGrath and others refused to vote for that Bill; they voted against it and the records of the House show that. I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Your Bill is not nearly as good as Deputy Norton's Bill as far as the worker is concerned, since the cost of living has gone up so much and will go up so much more in the near future.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the debate on this Resolution should be conducted in the spirit in which it has been conducted up to the present.  We had the main discussion on the Second Reading of the Bill, a discussion which lasted for many parliamentary days and in which most Deputies took part.  At the end, we found that the Bill was accepted without a division.  That is as I think it ought to be.  As I said when speaking on Deputy Norton's Bill, what I was really concerned about was to get the Social Welfare Bill on the Statute Book.  That ought to be the concern of every Deputy who is interested in this problem.</P>
      <P>Now, whether it was Deputy Norton's Bill or Deputy Dr. Ryan's Bill, one can find quite a number of matters on which there could be increases and improvements, but the vital thing as I understand it is to get it on the Statute Book and the amendments will look after themselves in time.  It is regrettable in a House constructed such as this that the two Parties who have contributed so much towards social welfare, the Government Party and the Labour Party, should be fighting with one another while another large Party sits and looks on.  That is what I think is regrettable in the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make an appeal to my old comrades in the Labour Party to let <Col N="1159" /> this Resolution go through, to improve the Bill in so far as it can be improved in Committee, to get it into operation as soon as possible; and, please God, opportunities will arise for amendment, as they always arise when a Bill of this nature is actually in operation. I think that it serves no good purpose to have a debate about it conducted in a spirit of bitterness.  I know that when Deputy Norton was preparing his Bill&mdash;and he spent a considerable time in its preparation&mdash; that it was his desire that the Bill should be passed into law, but I have a suspicion that the great difficulties he had were due entirely to the set-up in which he happened to be at the time.  I think that if Deputy Norton were to explain the difficulties he had in that period of three years one would find that they were serious difficulties.</P>

I would ask the members of the Labour Party to try to get this on the Statute Book because it is important in the interests of the people they represent and there will be opportunities in the future for amending it.</P>
      <P>I read recently in one section of the Press that for one reason or another has lowered itself to the use of yellow Press tactics, the Independent Newspapers, that on the Bill before the House there were about 100 amendments tabled by the Labour Party and that they were going to fight it tooth and nail, line by line and comma by comma.  I was surprised because as a Deputy of the House I generally get amendments as they are sent in and I had seen no record of 100 amendments. When I got the printed list of amendments I found that the only amendments to the Bill other than the Minister's were some minor if important amendments put down by Deputy Hickey.</P>

      <P>I would ask Deputies, particularly my old friends in the Labour Party, to let this Money Resolution go through. They have allowed the Second Reading to go through having expressed their views on it and I would ask them, as far as they can within the limitations imposed on us by the Constitution and by parliamentary practice and rules, to make this the best Bill possible.  When two Parties have shown a desire to improve the conditions of the people it is wrong in general that they should be at one another's throats in the interests of a third Party which does not give two hoots about social welfare.</P>

      <P>This Money Resolution is couched in the customary parlance of Money Resolutions in legislation passing through this House.  It purports to have money provided by the Oireachtas for the specific purpose of this legislation.  In this Resolution those words give a false impression because although the impression is that money is to be derived from the Oireachtas, the money for this legislation is in fact derived from direct and indirect taxation, taxation which is not even remotely concealed but is exposed to the public gaze.  The promises of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in opposition and when they were in power that they would give better <Col N="1161" /> social services to the people of the country with less taxation have not been implemented.  The Money Resolution is necessary for the implementation of the Bill, but I suggest that having regard to what is being done by the Government in respect of this legislation the wording should be altered.  It should be correctly related to the measure which is to be given to the people.</P>
      <P>Deputies Norton and Corish have explained this and I do not intend to go over the ground again but I think that we are perfectly entitled to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this Money Resolution is wrongly worded.  It is fraudulent because we are not getting the benefits which are supposed to be given to the people but must pay for them through the nose. Deputy Corish gave a case in point: the extra amount which is supposed to be given by the Oireachtas is being given from the Budget which was introduced at a suitable time.  It has been said that it was rushed through before the Second Reading of this Bill but it is now perfectly clear that it was used to extract money for this social welfare legislation.  Therefore, the wording of the Money Resolution is not suitable or fitting for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I disagree entirely with those Deputies who held that this Bill had discarded some of the best points of Deputy Norton's Bill.  The best points in Deputy Norton's Bill or in any Social Welfare Bill are the provisions for sickness, unemployment and the dependents of workers who die. Those parts of Deputy Norton's Bill are preserved unchanged in this Bill. The great hazards of life for people of limited means are the danger of sickness, of untimely death leaving dependents unprovided for and of unemployment and those hazards are provided for under the Bill just as well as in Deputy Norton's Bill.  It is as well to make that clear because it is fundamental to any Social Welfare Bill that those three hazards of life should be covered.</P>

      <P>It has been the custom on a Money Resolution of this kind to regard the House as being in Committee. When the House is in Committee Deputies are not limited to one speech nor has the Minister been given the privilege of replying.  We are in Committee; the indicator indicates that we are; yet we are treated as if this were a Second Reading or a Final Reading.  It is no such thing.  That ruling limits the rights exercised by Deputies up to now in this and in previous Parliaments.</P>

      <P>The Chair is under no misapprehension as to whether the House is in Committee or the Dáil is in session.  Even when the House is in Committee the Chair must make such arrangements as to bring the debate to a conclusion.  The Chair cannot sit still and allow the House to sit without anybody offering to speak. Nobody has offered to speak after Deputy Cogan and I must therefore call on the mover of the motion to conclude.</P>

      <P>May I submit, Sir, that it has always been the practice when the House is in Committee that the debate comes to a normal termination by nobody desiring to speak further, in which case the issue is put?  The Minister has not yet spoken on the matters which have been discussed and I submit to you that it has been the customary practice to permit the House to comment in Committee on what the Minister has to say.  Some Deputies on these benches have not spoken because they have been waiting to hear what the Minister has to say.  Up to the present they have never been denied that opportunity.  Apparently now it is proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am allowing every Deputy to speak who wishes to speak but, when nobody offers himself, the Chair must take some precaution and some opportunity to have the debate taken in an orderly fashion.  If nobody offers himself, the Chair must call on the Deputy who moved the motion to conclude the debate.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I am not challenging your right to rule in any particular way you decide to rule on this matter, but I do not think I can let the occasion pass without suggesting that when we are in Committee, if nobody rises to take part in the debate, the Committee naturally ends then and the question can be put.  I submit there is no way in which a debate in Committee can be stopped except by somebody moving that &ldquo;the question be now put.&rdquo;  In <Col N="1164" /> Committee, the Minister is entitled to intervene at any time he wants, but the Minister is not entitled in Committee to prevent a discussion on a motion in the light of what he has to say on it by refusing to rise until everybody else has declined to rise. You may rule on this matter in a particular way, but I think that if you rule in that way the Standing Orders will have to be looked at so that it will be made clear that by failure to rise during the Committee the Minister cannot automatically apply the closure in an underhand way&mdash;that if he wants to apply the closure he can move &ldquo;that the question be now put.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is not a point of order.  The Deputy is entitled to make that suggestion.  I am not saying whether such is so or not.  The Chair cannot sit still and allow the House to remain idle without doing anything.  The House must bring the debate to a conclusion.  If nobody offers himself, I will put the motion.</P>

      <P>I can understand that.  If nobody offers himself, then it is your right and duty to put the motion.  But what I question is that, if nobody offers himself, it is your right to call on the Minister to conclude the debate.  I submit that in these circumstances the Minister is definitely putting the closure on the Committee discussion.  In reply to what the Deputy says, I suggest that the Minister was asked in Committee on Finance by members of the Labour Party, to give certain information&mdash; information that is necessary for the proper conduct of the discussion in Committee.  He did not give any information when he was moving the motion that would throw any light on the questions now asked.  The Committee cannot properly carry out its business if the Minister declines to give any information in Committee on Finance and if he sits still for the purpose of closuring the discussion without giving the information.  If the Chair feels that it is its duty to call on the Minister to conclude, then I <Col N="1165" /> say that that is a procedure which puts into the Minister's power the right to closure this debate without taking on himself the responsibility for doing it.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of the Chair to bring the debate to a conclusion.  It is to be assumed that Deputies who made their points wish to hear the Minister on them.

My submission is that under the Standing Orders of the House the manner in which Committee business concludes is by the putting of a motion. I submit to you, Sir, that if this discussion were to conclude it should be by the Chair putting the motion and not calling on any Minister to conclude. I am in the position that I am anxious for the Minister's intervention before I intervene myself because I want certain points which have been raised by Deputies cleared up in the light of which I may be able to make a contribution to this discussion. I submit that it is a breach of precedent to call on the Minister in these circumstances to conclude the discussion.</P>

The last Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare prepared by my predecessor, Deputy Norton, was for £12.9 million.

      <P>I want to ask the Minister to amend the definition to cover &ldquo;widow&rdquo; for the purpose of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts. A case has been put to me, and I have examined it and found it to be correct. I am referring to the case of a woman who is married and whose husband disappeared roughly 25 or 27 years ago. <Col N="1170" /> That lady is not a widow within any definition that I can find.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Leary says, she is known as a grass widow. However, that is not a technical definition of a widow within the meaning of the Acts.  I do not know whether or not there would be many cases like the one I have outlined. The trouble involved in getting a presumption of death in such cases is pretty considerable.  I was wondering if the Minister would consider between this and the Report Stage a case in which a husband has not been or cannot be traced for a period in excess of 25 years so that his wife can be declared to be a widow for the purposes of the Acts on a statutory declaration by her.  I am aware that there are a lot of difficulties in such cases, and I would like the Minister to think the matter over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware we have been following the ordinary law in this matter.  The only remedy a woman has got is to get a court order presuming her husband's death.  We could not deal with the matter in any other way.  However, I will have what the Deputy suggests considered, but I feel it will not be possible to do anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Cowan says in this regard. I do not think the Department acts strictly in accordance with the law. It seems to me that the Department takes evidence as to the probability of death having occurred and that it does not insist in every case on a court order being made to presume death. In my view, the Department has been disposed to take the view that, if there is a probability of death having occurred, having regard to the length of time that has elapsed since the wife <Col N="1171" /> last heard from the husband and having regard to his age, a pension should be granted in these circumstances. I dealt with the case of a man who was working in London and then went to Spain during the Spanish Civil War.  Nothing was heard about him afterwards.  Nobody knows where he is, whether he is still there or whether he was killed there.  Having regard to the fact that he went to Spain, which was a troublesome country at the time he went there, and bearing in mind the man's age even if he did survive in Spain, the Department granted a pension to the wife. It was a liberal approach to the problem. It is a pity to put a woman to the expense of getting a court order. In any case, she is reluctant to have the case dragged into public.  If there were any improvement in the situation, everybody would welcome it.</P>

      <P>As the matter stands it is not necessary to have a court order but the procedure is much the same. We must presume the husband dead before we can do anything.  I cannot, therefore, deal with a grass widow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the presumption of death by the Department is inexpensive compared with the court procedure. If the Department approaches the thing in a liberal manner there is a lot to be said from the point of view of not putting the widow to the expense of going to court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of this section refers to share fishermen and paragraph (7) to outworkers, which two classes are <Col N="1173" /> being brought into Part I of the First Schedule by later amendment.  Certain classes of outworkers only are insurable under the National Health Insurance and Widows' and Orphans' Pension Acts and only those share fishermen who are employed under contract of service.  Outworkers are not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts as they are not employed under contract of service, and share fishermen are specifically excepted from insurance under those Acts.  As the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, stands at present the only persons of those two classes who would become insured on the appointed day are those share fishermen who are employed under contract of service.  It would be possible to bring both classes into the regulations but it is considered unwise to leave the Minister's powers in relation to those two classes in the rigid state which this procedure would entail.  It has, therefore, been decided that share fishermen and outworkers be added to Part I of the First Schedule and that they be also added to the classes named in Section 12 where powers are taken to modify the provisions of the Bill in the case of such classes.  It will come up again under the Schedule and it will be dealt with as well under this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might tell us what he intends to do in relation to (a), (b), (c) and (d). The regulations may modify the provisions of this Act in their application in the case of persons employed in any of the employments specified in Part I of the Schedule or to persons employed as teachers in national schools or as teachers in secondary schools or to persons employed as members of the Army Nursing Service. Would the Minister indicate what he proposes to do in respect of the application of this Bill to those classes?  The position, of course, has radically changed under this Bill as compared with the previous Bill.  A case could be made for bringing in certain classes here on the understanding <Col N="1174" /> that in return for their contributions they are going to get certain benefits or stand in the position in which there was every probability that certain benefits would inure to them and they would get those benefits under the Bill.</P>
      <P>If you take the case of a Guard, civil servant or a national teacher, if this Bill is applied to him as it stands now it is going to cover him for sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  So far as sickness is concerned, the terms of his employment are with his employer and entitle him to sick pay while he is ill so that so far as employment is concerned it is not a real risk with him because he has got a permanent pensionable post. So far as coverage for widowhood is concerned, if he has a salary at present under £500 he can already cover himself for that as a voluntary contributor under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.</P>
      <P>There are no other benefits of any value that he can qualify for.  Yet the provisions of this Bill apply to him unless the Minister sees fit to modify the application of the Bill to these particular classes.  If you had provision by which you could get retirement pension, death benefit, increased maternity benefit or maternity allowance&mdash;these are risks which materialise in respect of most classes of citizens&mdash;you could always say: &ldquo;We are taking contributions from you and not merely covering you for long-odds hazards but for some certainties as well.&rdquo;  This Bill propose to collect contributions from him and yet only covers him against long-odds risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there is provision in the section to enable the Minister to modify the application of the Bill to civil servants.  I think the present Government, when in opposition, were not too enthusiastic about the application of wider provisions than are in this Bill to people who are in what might be described as stable employment of that kind.  I should like to know in what way the mind of the Minister is travelling as regards the application of this Bill to persons such as ordinary soldiers, officers, civil servants, <Col N="1175" /> Guards and teachers, primary and secondary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, this is a section in respect of which the agreement of the Minister for Finance is necessary.  I have not yet had an opportunity of consulting the Minister for Finance about this particular class. I do not know if my Department has had even preliminary discussions with the Department of Finance.  Subject to that, however, my opinion is that soldiers are in a different class because members of the Defence Forces will, after a period of years, come out into the world and seek employment.  For that reason I think they should be covered against unemployment, sickness, widowhood and so forth. On the other hand consider the position of civil servants, teachers, Guards and so forth.  They have their own superannuation scheme. Even if we had superannuation in this measure I do not think that it would be necessary for them.  They have their own sickness scheme.  There is no such thing as unemployment so far as they are concerned.  The only thing that would be of service to them is the widow's pension.  Whether it is worth while to apply the scheme to them for the sake of that one benefit, I do not know.  There was a power for people to opt into that particular part of national health in the old days but I do not know if it will be possible in the future.  Those who are at the moment voluntary contributors in the Civil Service and so forth for a widow's pension will be enabled to remain as voluntary contributors if they so wish. I would be inclined to say that I do not think these people should be brought in.  Civil servants, teachers, Guards, local government officials, and so forth, have their own pension scheme.</P>

      <P>At present, under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, a person who has not more than £500 per annum is covered by the scope of the Act.  That Act is running for the moment.  I take it that if these people are to be exempt from the scope of this Bill&mdash;and I think they ought to be <Col N="1176" /> exempt, having regard to the different character of the Bill&mdash;they will be allowed to continue under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act since they are statutorily liable to contribute under that Act to-day.</P>

      <P>That is clear, to some extent.

At present, persons are covered under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act where their remuneration does not exceed £500 per year.  If they are exempt under this Bill&mdash;as I understand from the Minister they will be&mdash; then I take it they will continue under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  Is that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood&mdash;it was certainly my view but the responsibility now devolves upon the Minister&mdash;that so far as treatment benefit is concerned, the desire was to make it available free where it was obvious that the person definitely needed treatment such as hospital treatment. Apparently there has been a change from that practice.  A few years ago, the charge paid by the then National Health Insurance Society to hospitals who treated members under the National Health Insurance Acts was £2 12s. 6d. per week.  The Department of Health, anxious to save money on making good the deficits in the hospitals, encouraged the hospitals to charge four guineas a week to local authorities and to the National Health Insurance Society for such patients. The problem then arose what was going to happen the national health insurance contributor.  The society was paying £2 12s. 6d. for him, the hospital wanted four guineas from him, and his benefit was only 22/6 a week. In that situation I decided at the time that we would have to find the difference between the £2 12s. 6d. and the four guineas a week, so as to enable the person to continue to go to hospital and have treatment free. The responsibility for paying benefits rested on the National Health Insurance Society or the Department as it subsequently became.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I understand, the hospitals have indicated that they propose to charge five guineas a week in respect of the treatment of patients from local authorities and patients under the National Health Insurance Acts.  The Department of Social Welfare has decided that the Department will pay four guineas a week for these people while in hospital and as the hospitals want five guineas, the persons concerned will be expected to pay the other guinea out of the 22/6 per week benefit they are at present receiving. I understood that to be the effect of the new scheme which is operating or which will operate at some date in the immediate future.  If the Minister says that is not so perhaps he would take <Col N="1179" /> this opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the hospitals are now charging five guineas a week.  They introduced that charge some time in January and up to 31st March the Department of Social Welfare paid the five guineas a week. We did not think we could exceed a total of £500,000 this year in payment for treatment benefit and the only way we can keep within £500,000 is by subscribing only four guineas a week for this financial year.  In the case of a patient who would ordinarily be sent in by a local authority to the hospital, the local authority will pay the other guinea.  That is, the local authority is saved four guineas a week there.  The National Health Insurance Society pays four and the local authority pays only one.  Where the person is not one who would ordinarily be sent in by the local authority, that person will have to pay the extra guinea himself, if the hospital insists on it.  There is the objection that the person could get treatment for the four guineas formerly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows that even before this at all, the national health insurance beneficiary had the option of going to a hospital, even a private hospital that was charging more than four guineas and paying the difference himself.  The National Health Insurance Society will not deduct from the benefit the amount due by the patient to pay it over to the hospital.  People will draw benefit as usual.  Some confusion arose over this because some of the benefits were held back.  The Deputy will know why that was done.  In the case of persons who have no dependents and go into hospital, usually nothing is payable until they come out again.  That practice was continued and it appeared to be feared that the reason that the money was held back was to pay the extra guinea to the hospital.  That is not true.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is an oversimplification of the situation, and what the Minister has stated confirms my fears in connection with this situation. When the hospitals were paid two and a half guineas, they were encouraged by the Department of Health to push up the fee to four guineas and even efforts were made by the Department of Social Welfare to put a stay on the operation of the new charges.  We were anxious to have a stay put on it because moneys were being taken for hospital treatment.  We were working within a limited figure but that was not an insurmountable difficulty.  The hospital charges then went up to four guineas and I decided that the Department should pay the whole four guineas.  What has happened now?  The charge has gone up to five guineas with this difference, that whereas previously when it went up to four guineas, we put more money into the kitty to relieve the additional charge, the present position is that the hospitals are charging five guineas and the insured person is liable to pay the <Col N="1181" /> hospital one guinea per week.  Is that not clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is unfair. Let Deputy Captain Cowan look at that.  If the insured person has means the hospitals will put their hands in his pockets and take it from him.  I met this charge by putting one and a half guineas extra into the kitty for the insured person.  Why should not the Minister meet the extra guinea now?  I would not put it on the insured contributor.  The State had to put the money into the kitty to pay for the insured contributor and the State paid the four guineas.  If I were faced with a similar situation of having hospitals demanding five guineas, this State would have to put up the money because the insured person cannot pay. He should not be expected to pay it out of national health benefit of 22/6 a week for himself or 22/6 a week if he has got a wife and any number of children.  That is the maximum rate of benefit he is getting to-day under the National Health Insurance Society. Even if the new Bill becomes operative the same man will get only 24/- a week. He will have to pay one guinea out of that to the hospital.  I think that is grossly unfair.  In 1949, the National Health Insurance Society had £4,500,000 to its credit.  That was something lower than the previous year, but if you look back over the figures from 1937 you will see that the society, which had £718,000 to its credit in 1937, had £4,500,000 to its credit in 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although its assets have been going up at that very rapid rate, it is acting with the insured person as if he was just Lazarus because the insured person is going to be asked now for the first time since the National Health Insurance Act was passed in 1911 to pay a guinea per week to the hospital out of 22/6 a week while the State has £4,500,000 in the kitty from which it could take a guinea in respect of every week an insured person spent in hospital without the slightest difficulty.  I took with the same ease one and a half guineas&mdash;not one guinea&mdash;from the State funds in order to meet increased <Col N="1182" /> hospital charges when that problem arose earlier.  I think the Minister is treating this whole matter too lightly by saying that the local authority may pay it.  I do not know whether the Minister has any experience of local authorities and the way they deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a carpenter in Dublin or Wexford.  When he falls sick he goes to hospital.  The local authority would not send him to hospital under any circumstances once he is a national health insurance contributor.  He goes to hospital because he is a contributor. The first thing the almoner asks him is whether he is a national health insurance contributor.  If so, that fact is recorded and the Department is charged for the cost of his maintenance there.  To imagine that a local authority would send a carpenter, a docker, a painter or a plasterer to a hospital at its expense is just drawing on one's imagination.  That does not happen. It has not happened and it will not happen.  That carpenter may be earning £7 10s. 0d. or £8 0s. 0d. to-day. If he has to go to hospital he will be liable to pay one guinea to the hospital out of 22/6 which sum he will get not while he is in hospital but when he comes out.  He has got to keep himself in the meantime.  The Minister should undertake to look into this matter again.</P>
    <P>The State has £4,500,000 in the kitty. I believe it is much more than £4,500,000 now.  There must be something in the vicinity of £5,500,000 to £6,000,000 in the kitty, some of it even invested in British securities.  We are asking the Irish insured contributors whose money this is to leave the money alone and to recognise that he has an obligation of paying a guinea a week to the hospital.  Did anybody ever hear a worse situation than that in which the insured persons, having built up a kitty of from £4,500,000 to £6,000,000 which should be available for their benefit and aid, when admitted to hospital have to pay one guinea per week while the Department will not touch their money or allow them to touch the money?  I would appeal to the Minister to review the whole matter and put it right because <Col N="1183" /> it is grossly unfair to the insured person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister also to reconsider the position. From what I know of local authorities and local authority hospitals it would be much harder to get any reduction from the local authority hospitals than from the voluntary hospitals.  If a patient goes to a voluntary hospital he will have some opportunity of getting a reduction in his bill.  The picture is not altogether as Deputy Norton painted it.  As soon as this Bill is passed the insured contributor who has a wife and a couple of children will get £2 10s. per week instead of £1 2s. 6d.  At the same time I think there should be no charge of one guinea a week on those people if it can be avoided at all.  The voluntary hospitals are the only ones inclined to make any concession.  When a person goes into a local authority hospital in Cork he is first questioned by the home assistance officer before any reduction is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from what the Minister has said that there is an expenditure of approximately £500,000. Undoubtedly, that is a very big sum of money.  There is no doubt at all that if those people are to be maintained in hospitals the hospital authorities will look for five guineas in respect of every person and will endeavour to get it.  It is undesirable in a general way that one person should have to go and be maintained at four guineas, <Col N="1184" /> which would be paid by the Minister, and that the other person, under machinery of the local authority or through their own means, would be compelled and obliged to pay the other guinea.  That is undesirable in a general way.  What should be done is that the Minister, who is contributing these large sums on behalf of members of the society to the hospitals, should strike the hardest possible bargain with the hospitals.  After all, these hospitals are receiving moneys from a number of sources.  They are receiving moneys from other sources.</P>
      <P>Public moneys go to these hospitals in different ways and if the Minister is not in a position to reduce the charge below five guineas he ought, as Deputy Norton said, to consider the whole matter again with a view to the payment of the five guineas.  The main thing as far as the national health insurance members are concerned is that they should get proper treatment and proper maintenance in hospital but they should not be subjected to this inquiry either from the local authority or from the hospital authorities through their almoners and the machinery of the hospitals.</P>

      <P>From July the sick man and his dependents will have 50/-per week.  The single man has only 24/- per week and I think it is hardly fair to ask him therefore to pay towards his hospital treatment.  There are many little comforts he will require.  I think we can very easily agree that the Minister should come to the rescue of a man in hospital even if he has 50/- per week for himself, his wife and two children.  I do not think it would be fair to trespass on that 50/-per week because his wife and two children will have to be supported and I do not think the poor patient should be annoyed when he is in hospital with questions as to whether he can pay anything for his treatment other than the national health which is being paid for him in that institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke on this matter before and adverted to the fact that when the cost in hospitals went up from two and a half guineas to four guineas he met the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> That may be true.  Nevertheless, the medical benefits never exceeded £500,000 in any one year up to this and something like this was necessary in order to put some limit to the extension of medical benefits.  That is why the change has been made for this financial year but it is done on the clear understanding that any person who has not the means to pay that extra money will have the contribution made by the local authority.  I cannot see how anybody can imagine at the present time that if a man has only 22/6 a week the local authority will not come to his rescue.  As a matter of fact local authorities are paying for people with much bigger incomes than 22/6 a week and I see no reason why they should not do that in these particular cases.  Why should we assume they will not do it?</P>

      <P>Yes, I misunderstood. This is not a new principle.  Deputies must be familiar with the medical benefits under the national health insurance scheme.  They must know that at all times a man had to pay half the cost of a denture.  There was no such thing as the local authority paying part. Admittedly the man was working at the time but nevertheless he had to pay half.  If you like, we are extending that principle in a way that is not very welcome to the insured person but we are extending it because the annual amount for medical benefits was growing very rapidly and exceeding £500,000 a year.  If we find we have overshot the mark and if we can go back to the five guineas and still remain in or around £500,000, I shall certainly consider that matter.  I do not want to make a saving on the £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question with regard to those hospitals that come within the category of approved hospitals for the purpose of treatment under the national health insurance scheme.  I had some cases recently where contributors could not gain admittance to the approved hospitals and because of the urgency of their particular complaints they had to go to a private home or some other institution which was not an approved hospital.  They were under the impression that the national health fund or the Minister would come to their assistance in paying for their treatment in <Col N="1187" /> these particular establishments.  When they came out they were presented with big bills together with medical fees and fees for certain tests that were carried out.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated some time ago that he had under consideration the question of extending the number of approved hospitals.  Has anything been done in that respect?  At certain periods of the year these approved hospitals are very full and urgent cases have to seek admittance elsewhere. Can the Minister say if anything has been done in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember telling the Deputy we had the question of revision under consideration.  We have not completed it yet.  I was hoping we might make a regulation under this new Bill.</P>

When that is full urgent cases, such as ulcers and so on, must go to some private nursing home.  That is an expensive proposition and no help is given.  Does the Minister contemplate including private nursing homes as approved hospitals?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister <Col N="1188" /> has met the situation in the way that circumstances demand and I think that is because he does not know how this matter is dealt with by the local authority.  When an insured contributor goes to hospital he is tabbed as such and the usual practice is to get the Department or the society to pay the full cost of maintenance, which was at first £2 12s. 6d., subsequently four guineas and now five guineas.  That contributor will now be expected to pay five guineas.  He may plead that he cannot pay five guineas.  He may plead he cannot pay anything at all. He will be told that the Department will pay four guineas but the hospital will look for another guinea and that contributor will be badgered in an effort to get that guinea out of him.</P>
      <P>Almoners have certain duties to perform and they are pretty alert in performing their duties.  The position up to this was that a contributor could walk out of the hospital knowing the bill would be discharged by the Department.  In future that contributor will go out wondering if he can manage to get out without paying the extra guinea.  The effort to get that guinea will involve that person parading his poverty before the almoner or some of the hospital authorities.  The hospital will want one guinea out of that man's 22/6. If the insured person is a woman she will not even have 22/6.  Heretofore, that man could walk out of the hospital with his head up, feeling that his hospital treatment was paid for. He will now have to parade his poverty and plead that he cannot pay this one guinea and will have to try and get away as quickly and as quietly as possible from the almoner or other official whose job it will be to get this guinea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These hospital fees were not increased from four to five guineas merely for the sake of dealing in fives instead of fours.  The hospitals mean to get the five guineas if they can. Their financial position is such that they will say they are acting within reason in looking for the five guineas, but I suggest that their trouble is that they are trying to get this guinea from the wrong people, from an insured person who has no wages while in hospital. <Col N="1189" /> That person cannot afford to pay the guinea.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to look into this matter again and get some more money from the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; so as to enable an insured person in the future to be able to walk out of hospital with his head as erect as he could hold it up to now.  But it is not only in regard to hospital treatment that the Department is breaking from the tradition in the past.  Up to now, anybody who wanted an X-ray could get it under the National Health Insurance Society's scheme free of charge.  I think there are good reasons for encouraging people to get an X-ray instead of having them going around imagining that this, that and the other thing is wrong with them.  In the past, if they were recommended by a doctor for an X-ray, they could get it free of charge through the society or the Department, but an Order recently made by the Minister makes the insured person pay half a guinea for the X-ray in the future.  A person who was able to get an X-ray free of charge in the past is going to be required to pay a half guinea in the future.  In the case of a person who is out sick, that half guinea is going to come out of the allowance which he gets in sickness benefit.  Under this Bill, or under existing legislation, that means that the half guinea will come out of 22/6, so that he will be left with 12/- to fend for himself for the rest of the week.</P>
    <P>I think that is unfair, and it is particularly unfair when, in fact, the Minister and the Department of Finance have at their disposal nearly £6,000,000 of the moneys of insured persons.  Why would the Minister not allow insured persons to utilise the money in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; which they have built up for the purpose of getting from it sufficient to enable them to get free of charge in the future what they were able to get free of charge under the national health insurance scheme in the past?</P>
    <P>Now, what the Minister has said is true, that in the past people were required to make a contribution towards the cost of spectacles and teeth.  I do not put these in the same category as treatment in hospital or an X-ray examination.  People can develop fashions in teeth and spectacles, <Col N="1190" /> but there is no question of developing fashions about going into hospital for treatment except where it is necessary.  I think that the Department should, from the contributors' fund at their disposal, meet the additional cost as it was met in the past.  I would strongly urge on the Minister not to allow Department of Finance considerations to operate in this case. There is plenty of money there, and I can hardly imagine the Minister himself being reluctant to use it.  It is the insured person's money, and I suggest that it ought to be utilised for the purpose of exempting a person from paying these heavy imposts under, what is after all, a relatively low rate of sickness benefit.</P>

I have pointed out, over and over again, that the people the Deputy has in mind are entitled to free treatment if they never had national health insurance.  It is ridiculous to talk about such persons being asked for a guinea.  If they had £3 per week, they would not be asked for it.  There is no use in making the case that people are being asked to pay a guinea out of 22/6.  That will not happen if the local authority is doing its job.  If the Deputy was in my place, and was paying out grants to local authorities, he would know, as I know, what local authorities are spending in regard to these benefits.</P>

      <P>There is no use in making the case which the Deputy did.  These treatment benefits were there before amalgamation took place.  Some societies had them and some had not. Generally speaking, they did not come in until 1942.  Since 1942, they have been growing gradually.  In the last four years they have doubled.  In the first year in which Deputy Norton took over, they were about half what they are at the moment.  They were <Col N="1191" /> growing at such a rate that we had to make some limit.  We had to say, as regards those who could afford to pay, let them pay the guinea extra, and that as regards those who could not afford to pay the local authority would pay for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that £4 4s. per week was not a bad contribution to make for hospital treatment for a sick person under the national health insurance scheme.  I think that when it was agreed to make it £5 5s. that it was really an incentive to the hospital authorities to get after the patient to try and get the guinea from him.  My idea is that the hospital authorities should be told that the only contribution we can make for an insured person is £4 4s. per week.  I should like to know how it came about that the charge should be £5 5s.  My opinion is that, when you agreed that it should be £5 5s., the hospital authorities were bound to look for the extra guinea from the insured person.  I think it should be pointed out that the National Health Insurance Society is prepared to contribute £4 4s. a week for an insured person while in hospital. I do not know how the £5 5s. a week was arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any danger of that.  The Department of Health sanctioned £5 5s. a week for the voluntary hospitals and the Department of Social Welfare said they could not afford to pay the £5 5s. There is a conflict between the two Departments which I cannot settle.</P>

      <P>If the Minister had been a little more definite with regard to the practice of local authorities in their treatment of the type of patient that we have been discussing, I would have been inclined <Col N="1192" /> not to pursue this discussion on Section 14.  Would the Minister not make some inquiry from local authorities to see in what way they treat those people who have no income but this 22/6 a week, because I think that, as soon as a local authority gets to know that it is a national health patient, it will waive all claim as regards responsibility for that patient and leave the case to the National Health Insurance Society.  It may be the duty, legally, of a local authority to provide free treatment for such people, but in practice I do not think they do it.  Perhaps the Minister would consider making a spot check on certain local authorities to find out exactly what is their practice.</P>

Do you expect that the local authority will say: &ldquo;We are prepared to meet the bill for so-and-so because we know that he has no means and can pay nothing.&rdquo;  How was this five guineas arrived at?  You say the hospitals are charging that for the patients.  It would be much better if the Department of Social Welfare were to say: &ldquo;We cannot pay the £5 5s. a week.  We are prepared to pay £4 4s. a week.&rdquo;  Then they would not be after a man or woman looking for the £1 balance.</P>

As <Col N="1193" /> Minister for Social Welfare he says: &ldquo;So far as I am liable for insured persons, I cannot pay more than four guineas.&rdquo;  Therefore, he says to the insured person: &ldquo;You are liable for the other guinea.&rdquo;  That is the position up to to-day.  The Minister says to-day that so far as the insured person is concerned he cannot be expected to pay a guinea out of 22/6 and he cannot be expected to pay it out of 24/- and in fact he could not pay a guinea out of 50/- per week.

That is the only protection to give these people and that is what the Press should do to-morrow and consequently make sure that these people are not made liable to pay one guinea per week out of these small sums of money.  If the Press will render that service to-morrow, it is as good as an amendment by the Minister to this Bill, because the insured persons will not be salted to pay the guinea.</P>

      <P>I think there is a lot to be said for that.  Let the hospitals get the money, if they can, from the local authorities, if they can establish a right to get it from the local authorities but, if the insured contributors know that there is no obligation on them to pay this guinea out of the 22/6 or the £2 10s., there is no problem about the section at all.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2)  reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A female person whose employment is mainly in agriculture or domestic service shall not be entitled to unemployment benefit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to delete that sub-section.  The method proposed under sub-section (2)  of the section as it stands is likely to produce difficulties administratively.  It will make necessary the imposition of a long term test to determine whether or not a worker should be regarded as employed mainly in agriculture or domestic service and this would be a difficulty in such cases.  It is better to solve the problem, it is thought, by amending the contribution conditions for disability or unemployment benefit contained in paragraph 1 of the Fourth Schedule and these conditions are amended by providing that, where a claim to unemployment benefit is concerned, contributions at the special rate of 2/- applicable to female agricultural and domestic workers do not count.  This puts employment of that nature outside the scope of the scheme as far as unemployment insurance is concerned.  So that the amendment of the Fourth Schedule is considered a better way of dealing with this, taking this sub-section out.</P>

It is considered better to take it out at this stage and to amend the Fourth Schedule by making the benefit depend on the contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind casual workers who come badly out of this section both in respect of sickness benefit and unemployment benefit.  It it wrong that when a man falls ill his benefit should not date from the date at which he falls ill.  Up to now he was not entitled to benefit for the first six days but under this Bill that is reduced to three days.  I do not know what the justification is for the three days.  If a man falls ill, he loses his wages and is reduced to 22/- or, if he has a family, 50/- a week.  It is wrong that the benefit should not start from the date on which he becomes ill. That is from the illness point of view.</P>
      <P>Take then the case of the unemployed man and I am particularly concerned about casual workers, particularly dockers and builders' labourers. If a casual man gets three and a half days' work in the week, he will not get any benefit from the unemployment fund and that is particularly so in the case of a docker.  He is employed morning after morning and some weeks he gets three and a half days and other weeks four days' work, but there are quite a big number of dockers who never get more than four days' work in the week.  He is more likely to get three days the whole year round, but, assuming he gets four days in the week, he gets nothing at the labour exchange, although he signs on there, because he does not know how long he will be unemployed.  Totting that up for the whole year, it means that in the case of such men, there are 104 days, or 17 weeks and two days, in the year in respect of which they get no unemployment benefit whatever. That is a grave injustice against these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had hoped that that position would be set right in this Bill and it was the reason for my putting down the amendments which have been ruled out of order.  I appeal to the Minister to rectify that situation.  The question of social justice comes into it.  Why should we penalise a worker because he is a worker and deprive him of sickness benefit until he has been ill for three days?  If he can return after being ill for three days, he gets nothing at all.  The same applies to the casual <Col N="1197" /> worker.  There are a number of men engaged in the building industry whose only security in that trade is that they get an hour's notice of unemployment &mdash;they can be dismissed after one hour's employment.  The only guarantee the docker has is a day's wages when he starts in the morning.  If a man is employed on a weekly wage, he may be off for a week or two and in many cases the employer pays him full wages while he is out ill.</P>
    <P>Every man in the State service who falls ill gets his full week's wages while ill, but when it comes to the ordinary worker and particularly the worker who is subject to casual employment, he must register for four days before he gets anything at all and he will get only one day's illness benefit after being out for four days.  From the humane point of view, it is unfair that any class of worker should be unemployed for 17 weeks and two days in the year and that he should receive no benefit whatever from the State in respect of that period of unemployment. I appeal to the Minister to rectify that position.  There is nothing unreasonable in asking that that be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot see his way to abolish this restriction altogether, perhaps he would agree to reduce it to two days.  That would be a great benefit to certain dockers in Cork who work only about three days in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that suggestion.  I feel that when a man goes sick and gets nothing for the first three days of his illness, it is an incentive to him to stay sick.  Many a person may be sick for two or three days and may then be fit to return to work but, in order to draw benefit, they have to remain sick for a week. I cannot see any sense in that and never could.  I think that that restriction should be removed and once a man becomes sick&mdash;it is not his fault that he becomes sick&mdash;he should be entitled to draw his benefit as from the day he is forced to leave his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present law in relation to unemployment insurance is that a person must be six days unemployed <Col N="1198" /> before drawing benefit.  The period in respect of national health insurance is three days.  This clause makes the period three days for both and it is, therefore, a considerable advance on the present position.  To cut it out completely would make administration very difficult, because many men are sick with a cold for a day or two days and then go back.  In the same way, they might be laid off for a day or two and it would be administratively very difficult to cover all these cases for individual days.  It would also be very costly and would probably have the effect of making the contribution higher.  Everybody will agree, I think, that a man who is in fairly regular employment should be able to provide for a contingency of that kind&mdash;sickness for one or two days occasionally.</P>
      <P>The cases mentioned by Deputy Hickey and Deputy McGrath are different.  That is a particular form of employment and these men are nearly always idle for a couple of days in the week.  I do not think that should be dealt with by means of unemployment benefit; it should be dealt with in some other way and is being dealt with to a great extent in another way.  In fact, I am told&mdash;I do not know exactly what the position is&mdash;that dockers get a very much bigger wage, comparatively speaking, than other workers because of the casual nature of their employment.  If such a man gets four days' work he gets what may be equivalent to a full wage in another employment, and I think that is the proper way to deal with it.</P>

      <P>There are two problems here.  Where a person is ill for a day or two days, undoubtedly there can be considerable administrative difficulty, but suppose a person is ill for a period of ten days?  Is it the position that the first three days are knocked off and do not count?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is ill for a continuous period, the first three days should be included, and he should receive benefit for every day he is ill. I can see that there is a difference where a man is out ill for one, two or three days and stops at that, but if he is ill for ten days, he should not lose his benefit for the first three days, as I gather from the Minister is the position.</P>

      <P>The purpose of social security measures is to provide for the worker at times when he cannot receive a wage.  If every one of us here were to speak his mind, he would admit that any one of his constituents who ever approached him with regard to national health insurance complained bitterly about these three days for which they are not paid. Every person in the House has had that experience.  Deputy Cowan's solution would be a sort of compromise to which none of us would be inclined to agree.  The Minister talks about administrative difficulties and cites the example of the man who has a cold for a day or two.  He says it would not be right to make a payment to a man in respect of the one day, or the two or three days.  I do not think there could be any case there for malingering, because the medical officer appointed by the Minister is charged with the responsibility of certifying that the man is incapable of <Col N="1200" /> working.  If we are to accept social security in respect of sickness and unemployment, we should accept it in relation to every single day a man finds that he is not able to work, either because he cannot get it or because he is unable to work, and the Minister should agree to include these three days as payable days.</P>

      <P>I have been asked to raise a certain point, and I have raised it on a number of occasions.  It is in regard to teachers who are known as junior assistant mistresses, post-1921.  I am informed there are two types of junior assistant mistresses, &mdash;pre-1921 and post-1921&mdash;and that there is £100 difference in remuneration between them.  The pre-1921 class gets £100 more than the post-1921 class, although the latter does the same work, carries the same responsibility, and looks after the same size of classes. I do not know how many are involved &mdash;I do not think it is a very great number&mdash;but it seems unjust and unfair that there should be a difference in remuneration of as much as £100 a year.  I do not think there should be any difference.  As I have been asked to make the point on the Estimate, I do make it, and I make a very strong recommendation and request to the Minister that the post-1921 junior assistant mistress is remunerated in the same way as the pre-1921 teacher of the same class.</P>

Sílim go bhfuil eolas agam, agus go dtuigim ceard atá mé a rá, maidir le Gaelige ar chuma ar bith.</P>
      <P>Is é an fáth go ndúirt mé sin mar, nuair a bhí an tAire réidh lena chuid cainte, sheas Teachta anseo, sheas sé suas, agus dúirt sé gur Gaeilgeoir ó dhúchas é, go raibh Gaeilgeoir eile in aice leis, agus nár thuig siad ach an ceathrú cuid den mhéid adúirt an tAire.

      <P>Ina dhiaidh sin, labhair Teachta eile as Contae Mhuigheo, an Teachta Ó Cafferky, agus tá brón orm agus uafás orm faoin rud adúirt sé.  Dúirt sé gur tháinig sé as ceantar áirithe i gContae Mhuigheo agus nach raibh muintir an cheanntair sin ag iarraidh Gaeilge ar bith sna scoíleanna atá ansin.  Bhí mise ag múineadh Gaeilge sa cheantar ceanann céanna sin.

Tá sé ag teastáil uaimse ar chuma ar bith&mdash;agus tá chuile dhuine anseo, nó tá chuile phairtí anseo, ag rá go bhfuil siad ar thaobh na Gaeilge.  Cé labhair Gaeilge anseo ó thainig sé isteach sa Tig seo? Cé hiad na Teachtaí anseo a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus faitíos orthu Gaeilge a labhairt anseo nó go bhfuil náire orthu í a labhairt?

Sin an meas atá acu ar Ghaeleachas agus ar an nGaeilge.  Ansin deireann siad arís agus arís eile: &ldquo;Tá mé ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus oideachas Gaeleach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Cuíd againn tá muíd ag dul thart ag iarraidh gach duine sa tír seo a ghríosú chun Gaelachais le fada an lá agus molaimse do na Teachtaí atá anseo dul ar ais go dtí a gcuid ceantar féin, dul ar ardán agus a rá le muintir a gceanntair féin go bhfuil siad freagarthach as an nGaeilge, a rá le tuismitheoirí meas a bheith acu ar an nGaeilge, ar oideachas trí Ghaeilge.  Má dhéanann siad é sin, geallaim díbhse a cháirde anseo, má thaispeánann sibhse an dea-shampla go leanfaidh na daoine sin agus gur furasta dóibh é sín a dhéanamh.  Ach tá faitíos orm nach oideachas Gaelach atá uainn.

Breathnaímis ar an scéal.  An múinteoir scoile agus an mháistreás scoile is daoine nádúrtha iad, daoine a rugadh agus a tógadh <Col N="1203" /> díreach mar muid féin.

Is breágh an saol atá aige.&rdquo;  Tá faitíos orm go n-abrann daoine seachas an gnáth-dhuine é sin. Más rud é go n-abrann&mdash;agus tá fhios agam go n-abrann&mdash;is mór an scannal é.  Sín daoine nach dtuigeann obaír an mhúinteora; sin daoine nach dtuigeann tada; sin daoine nach dtuigeann nach bhfuil obair an mhúinteora réidh nuair a fhágas sé nó sí an scoil, go bhfuil obair le déanamh ag na daoine sin, b'fhéidir go dtí a deich a chlog, ag iarradh réitiú in aghaidh an lae amáraigh nó na seachtaine seo chugainn.  Ní cheapann daoine é sin agus tá faitíos orm gur beag imní atá sé á chur orthu.  Téann an múinteoir sin isteach chuig an scoil fhuar, fholamh, shalach ar maidin, agus chonnaic mé go mion minic iad.  Nuair atáim ag caint ba mhaith liom é seo a rá: níor cheart do mhúinteoir ar bith a bheith freagarthach faoi ghlanadh na scoile, teinte a chur sa scoil ná rud ar bith dá shórt.  An obair atá ar mhúinteoir ar bith dul isteach sa scoil agus a chuid oibre a dhéanamh ag múinteoireacht agus gan tada eile a dhéanamh ach é sin.  Níl fhios agam cén deontas a thugas an Roinn Oideachais le haghaidh glanadh na scoile in aghaidh na bliana, ach chuala mé go bhfuil sé chomh suarach sin nach mbeadh sé ín ndon cró muice a ghlanadh.  Is mór an scannal, is mór an náire, a leithéid seo a bheith ag tarlú sa mbliain 1952. Tá súíl le Dia agam go mbeidh muid í ndon duine éigin a fháil a chónaíos in aice na scoile, an duine sin a íoc íonas go mbeidh sé i ndon an scoil a ghlanadh agus a scuabadh tráthnóna, aer breá, folláín a ligínt isteach ann ar maidin agus tine a fhadú ionas go mbeidh deis ag an máistir, nó ag an mháistreás bualadh isteach ansin agus a chuid oibre a dhéanamh gan tada eile ag cur imní air.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine eile ann agus ceapann siad <Col N="1204" /> go bhfuil an máistir nó an mháistreás ag fáil an iomarca tuarastail ar fad. Duine ar bith a thuígeas an scéal níl sé ar aon intínn leo.  Chuala mé uair amháin: &ldquo;Cé'n fáith a ardódh sibh tuarastal an duine sin?  Nach bhfuil gluaisteán aige?&rdquo;  Tá gluaisteán anois ag madraí an bhóthair.  Ní cruthúnas saibhris gluaísteán a bheith agat.</P>
    <P>Anoís níor mhaith liom chur ísteach oraíbh go mór agus tiocfaidh mé go dtí an t-oideachas gairme beatha.  Tá rud amháin a chuireas imní orm, mar bhí mé féin ag plé leis: go mbíonn múinteoirí gaírme beatha ag plé le múinteoireacht oiche Dé Sathairn amuigh faoín d uaidh.  Ba mhaith liom go n-eisteodh an tAire go haireach liom anois.  Nuair a bhí mé ag plé leis tháinig na scoláirí isteach chugam ach má bhreathnaítear ar rollaí oíche Dé Sathairn geallaim don Aire go mbíonn an tinreamh glan an oíche sin.  Bíonn go leor le déanamh ag daoine oíche Shathairn go mór mhór amuígh faoin dtuaidh.  Tá réiteach le déanamh acu in aghaidh maidin an Domhnaigh agus ba cheart go gcuirfí deire le obair ar bith oiche Shathairn.</P>
    <P>Anoís maidir le hoideachas, tá locht amháin agamsa, agus is é locht é nach bhfanann na scoláirí sáthach fada ar scoil.  Tá gach páiste scoile i láthair na huaire ag faire ar an lá go mbeidh sé ceithre blíana déug d'aois, agus ansin an doras amach leo agus cuírtear an milleán ar an máistír agus ar an máistreás.  Fadó ní raibh a leithéid de scéal ann.  Is cuimhin liom nuair bhí mise ar scoil go bhfanadh na páistí ar scoil go dtí go mbeadh seacht mbliana déag d'aois sroiste acu.  Anois tá na páistí ag feitheamh leis an lá go mbeidh ceithre bliana deag d'aois sroiste acu agus ansin buaileann siad bóther agus bíonn deire le hoideachas dóibh.  Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh le gach cineál múinteora sa tir seo mar tá ár n-oideachas níos fearr, agus i bhfad Éireann níos fearr, ná an t-oideachas í Sasana agus in Albain; tá níos mó eolais ag na páistí.  Tá ár mbuíochas tuillte ag múinteorí na tíre seo, agus níl aon dul uaidh sin.  Tá faitíos ormsa go bfágann páístí an scoil ró-luath.  Dár líomsa, ba cheart go mbeadh dlí ann chun iachall a chur ar chuile pháiste, buachaillí agus cailiní, freastal ar scoil go dtí <Col N="1205" /> go mbeidh siad sé bliana déag d'aois ar a laghad.  Ansín ni bheadh an chaint seo ar síúl nach bhfuíl oídeachas ar bith sa tír anois.  Duíne ar bith adéarfas go raibh sin amhlaidh, tá faitíos orm go mba cheart dó dul chun an dochtúra agus a cheann a thomhas.  Nuair a fhágas na páistí an scoil, sin é an t-am is contúirtí maidir le hoideachas agus maidir le ceist na Gaeilge.  Níl aon áit le dul acu, go mór mhór amach faoin tuaith.  Níl rud ar bith le déanamh acu ach siúl thart ó theach go teach. Deirtear: &ldquo;Ní cloistear focal Gaeílge.&rdquo; Ní mheasaim gur fíor é sín.  Mholfainn don Aire agus don Roínn Oideachais&mdash;ní chosnódh sé morán&mdash;halla amháin a thógaint i ngach paróiste ina bhféadfadh na daoine óga, le cois múinteoir Gaeilge, teacht le chéile.  Sé an t-aon ríal amháin a bheadh ag teastáil ná nach labharfaí focal ar bith Béarla an fhaid a bheadh siad ann.  D'fhéadfai drámaí a léiriú, leabharlann a chur ar fáil, cártaí agus táiplis agus rudaí mar sin a imirt.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an rud go léir faoi stiúrú duine údarásach a bheadh ag siúl timpeall ag féachaint chuige nach mbeadh teanga ar bith dá labhairt ach ár dteanga féin.  Ansin, ní bheadh sé le rá ag Teachta ar bith, tar éís bliana nó mar sin, nach bhfuil le cloisteáil ach Béarla agus Béarla amháin ós na páistí nuair a fhágann siad an scoil.  Sé an rud atá in easnamh ar na páistí ná caitheamh aimsire.  Níl ag teastáil uathu ach duine chun iad a stiúrú.  Chítear dom go mbeadh cailiní agus féin a dhéanamh ach stiúrú ceart a bheith ar fáil acu.</P>
    <P>Molaimse do gach Teachta anseo comhartha na Croise a ghearradh air féin agus an cheist seo a chur ar féin; &ldquo;An bhfuil mise ar thaobh na Gaeilge, nó an é an caoi nach bhfuilim?&rdquo;  Is féidir leis magadh a déanamh fúmsa, ach an duíne a dhéanfas magadh faoi féin, tá an diabhal déanta aige air féin. Iarraim ar gach Teachta atá anseo dul abhaile, gabháil amach chuig na daoíne a chuir anseo sibh, agus comhairle a chur orthu.  Má dhéanann sibh é sin. beídh ar bhur gcumas a rá le fírinne: &ldquo;Rinneas mo chion féin.  Níor chlis sibh riamh ormsa maidir le Gaeilge, agus má dhéanann sibh bhur ndícheall as seo amach ní chlisfidh sibh ormsa maidir le hoideachas.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points with which I would like to deal. The first is the peculiar position of the teachers who retired prior to the 1st January, 1950.  They found themselves at a total disadvantage compared with the people who retired at a later date and in comparison with their poor brethren in Northern Ireland.  I feel that they should be entitled to the benefits in this connection enjoyed by other teachers.  I realise, of course, that for that purpose money would be required.  However, one donation or gift of money would deal with the whole thing, as it would not be recurrent. I would be pleased if the Minister would give that matter his consideration. These teachers experience the same difficulties as everybody else these days in trying to make ends meet. A lot of them are, perhaps, passing through the most expensive period of their career&mdash;trying to educate their families and do well for them.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the subject of the vacation in our primary schools.  I do not know a great deal about national schools generally, but it seems to me that in the country districts holidays take place at any time.  It also appears to me that in comparison with other grades of education, the primary schools get very short periods of vacation.  I feel that the period should be extended and especially in the summer months.  It is pointless to be keeping children at school throughout the warm summer months when they could be out enjoying themselves, and enjoying the sunshine which would benefit their health. Surely, some standardised time, say July and August, could be fixed for summer vacation for national schools. That would seem to meet the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cleaning and heating seems to me to be one of the outrages of the system operating with regard to national schools.  One sees small children struggling along the roads with a bundle of sticks or bringing on their backs a load of turf for the purpose of heating the school.  There seems to be no definite system operating here with regard to the question of heating the national schools.  I believe that some <Col N="1207" /> small sum should be allocated to the manager for heating purposes.  Surely we could have some system whereby the expenses of that could be borne by the local authority, and possibly the Department itself might consider assisting in the matter of the cleaning of schools.</P>
    <P>In regard to our schools, I would nearly go so far as to say that some of them are scarcely fit for human habitation.  I have been in one or two schools where there is water pouring down from the roof; there is a bad floor in them; one of those open fireplaces where all the heat races up the chimney and very little goes out to the schoolroom itself.  It is heated with a few sods of turf which the unfortunate children probably gather on their way in.  I think the Minister should consider that, as I stated before, a local authority should be asked to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I believe in leaving the control of schools and the control of all these matters under the present managerial system.  I believe it is a good system and it suits this country well, and the Minister might possibly consider setting up a consultative board to consider this heating and cleaning question, consisting of representatives of managers, representatives of the Department of Education and of the National Teachers' Organisation themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on subsidised transport.  I do not think we have enough subsidised transport in this country.  In my youth, we used to see children pattering along the road in their bare feet to school, having left home, in a great many cases, early in the morning.  It still occurs.  I understand that the regulations insist on a certain number of school hours being put in every day. The hours in the winter months, therefore, cannot be altered and a lot of those children who have to travel two or three miles to school have to leave early in the morning, have to spend a whole day in school and, for the reasons I have stated before, with regard to heating, and so forth, often <Col N="1208" /> are shivering in school; and it is late before they get home in the evening. In some cases we have subsidised transport but we have not got enough. You would find it would be money well spent.  If children are brought to school by transport they are brought to school dry and brought home from school dry; they will grow into healthy, virile men and women and there will be less of a charge on the State in the long run for diseases such as tuberculosis and so forth.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to say a few words about vocational education.  I do not think that the vocational teachers are paid a proper salary.  I confess that I do not know a tremendous amount about it but I believe there is some form of arbitration on at the moment.  The proof that they are not paid a salary commensurate with their services is that you cannot get vocational teachers in my constituency. Where a new vocational school has recently been built in the county I was approached so that they could have some classes for the summer.  It was in connection with homecrafts, and I communicated with the chief executive officer locally.  He replied that he was very sorry he could not give the class because they had not got a teacher to teach.  The case applies very much, I think, all over the country.  There is not enough money in the bill for vocational education. There is not enough money paid to the vocational teachers and, therefore, vocational education is not going ahead as it should in this country.  It is one of our most important needs. The speaker who has just sat down&mdash; I am not a very fluent Irish scholar myself; I could not follow him very closely&mdash;stressed the fact that when children leave school at 14 they are very often at a loose end up to the age of 16.  It is when they leave school at 14 that the vocational school is very useful to them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be generous in any allocation he makes to these vocational schools, to encourage them in every way he can, because it gives children not only an opportunity of learning about mechanical appliances, carpentry or crafts, but it also gives them an opportunity of <Col N="1209" /> learning things that are very useful to them, things relative to the soil.  There is no need for me to stress the point that in the working of the soil to-day mechanisation is the thing that is going to go ahead into the forefront and has done so.  It is in these technical classes they can learn those things.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to do what he can for the vocational schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be natural for me as a teacher and as an Irish speaker to speak on this Estimate in Irish, but I am not going to do so for the reason that on that subject of Irish I do want to bring home to every Deputy in the House and to the Minister the fact that notwithstanding all the effort, the energy and the expense that have been put into the building up of the Irish language over the last 30 years, we have not yet succeeded in establishing that the Irish language will become the spoken language of this country in the foreseeable future. We are not at all making the advances that should be made.  At the moment Irish appears to be a kind of Sunday suit that has to be worn on special occasions.  It is only on occasions like this when a debate on education comes before the House that Irish is inclined to be used.  Outside it is only by people connected with education that Irish is used.  A vast number of our people have a good knowledge of Irish, but only a fraction of those who have a knowledge of Irish use it on occasions when it could be used.  We seem to have entered into a period which is lacking in enthusiasm and, in some cases, I would go so far as to say that many people who speak Irish are ashamed to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that an inquiry should be held into the methods adopted for the resurrection of the Irish language over the last 30 years.  That is necessary because I know that a good deal of lipservice is being paid to Irish.  If the Minister were aware of the things which are happening in regard to the figures given to his Department for grants for Irish speakers&mdash;people who are supposed to speak Irish in the home and in the schools&mdash;and the figures which are given for the subjects <Col N="1210" /> taught through the medium of Irish, I think that an inquiry would be warranted.  We are fooling ourselves by producing figures for these things. One can prove nearly anything by statistics, and something more than statistics is required.</P>
    <P>There must be a different method of approach.  Certainly something must be done over and above what has been done during the last 20 years.  I admit that much work has been put into the revival of the Irish language but nothing like what should have resulted has resulted from that effort. Even in the Six Counties much faster progress is being made.  In the City of Belfast and in the City of Derry, where Irish classes are carried on, I find that you will meet persons who will be able to converse in Irish.  They attend their Irish classes and their céilí dances.  It is often said that if Irish were banned greater progress would be made.  There is no use in sitting back and hoping that the energy and money being expended at the moment will have good results unless there is a change of approach.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Estimate, I shall confine myself to the part which deals with primary education.  I find that only a few pages of the Minister's statement were devoted to primary education.  That is unfortunate, because primary education is of vast importance in this country.  The majority of our people up to now have been unable to get any other kind of education.  I must say that the teachers and all those connected with primary education have behind them a record to be proud of.  I was surprised that a Deputy should come in here and cast aspersions on the work which has been done and is being done by the primary teachers.  Although the teaching of Irish accounts for a good deal of our time in the schools, I think that the fostering of the Irish language, as well as serving the purpose for which it is done, also tends to sharpen the intellect even of the child who does not understand Irish when coming to school.  I find that the standard of education has not suffered because we teach Irish in schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> During the war years pupils from the City of Derry came to my school and I found that their standard of education, although all the work was done in English in the schools in the Six Counties, was not higher and, in some cases, was lower than our own.  Our primary schools are turning out students who can compare favourably with and compete with those of any other country.  But at the present time more time and thought are directed towards vocational, secondary and university education.  That is a good thing, but only a small number of our population can avail themselves of these types of education.  Therefore, no matter what strides we make in improving vocational, secondary and university education, we should not neglect the fundamental which is primary education.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Council of Education are going into the matter of the function of primary education.  I think that the present national school programme could be changed with advantage.  It has been suggested that instruction in agriculture should be part of the curriculum in rural schools. I think that that would be wise, that the theory of agriculture should be made available to the pupils, especially boys, at a fairly early age, so that they would at that age have an interest in the land and have a love for agriculture. It is the most important industry of the State and therefore our young people should learn about it and love it.</P>
    <P>The public generally have received the Minister's pronouncement regarding new schools very favourably.  Many new schools are needed.  The medical officer of health annually visits each school in his area and issues a report. A study of these reports will bring to light the facts that in each county a large number of schools are condemned and that others are not suitable because they may not have a proper water supply or proper lighting.  It will be seen from these reports also that a number of schools, in areas where new schools are not needed, require pretty extensive repairs.  Therefore, the Minister's policy to speed up the building of schools is appreciated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The Minister will find that the building of schools can be a very slow process.  In the first instance the managers are charged with the responsibility of finding a site, and the finding of a site is not one of the easiest things in the world.  Very many complications set in at that very early stage, even where a manager is willing and anxious to find a site.  Then that site has to be vested.  The local schools inspector has to give a report&mdash;(1)  the necessity for a school, (2)  where that school should be situated and, when a site is found, if the site is suitable, and so forth.  The matter passes from the Department of Education to the Board of Works, and more delays are experienced. Eventually a decision is arrived at and then a quibble begins as to the amount of grant to be given by the Government and the amount of the local contribution.  There may not be a short way of cutting through all these turns and twists and taking the straight road but so long as all these formalities have to be gone through&mdash; and some of them are quite necessary I admit&mdash;the Minister will find that the process of doubling the school building output will be very slow.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed throughout the country that, with the recent increases in salary, the teachers are quite satisfied with their present salaries and conditions.  Such is not the case.  There are certain sections of the teaching profession, especially junior assistant mistresses and unmarried male teachers, where the salaries are quite inadequate at present.  Generally all salaries, when compared with those operating in the Six Counties and in England, are much below those recommended under the Black and Burnham scales.  Teachers should be paid in accordance with the type of work they do.  It is of vast importance that men and women who are charged with the responsibility of educating the youth of the country should be free from financial worry and should work in a good school building and have the facilities which are necessary for the carrying out of their work.  In primary schools all the facilities that are required are not available.  In some cases these schools <Col N="1213" /> are badly stocked with maps and all the other equipment that tends to make the teacher's work easy and to make the work of learning easy also. I want people to get rid of the impression that teachers are well paid and that they have got all their demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech omitted two matters that are of very great interest to the teaching community.  The first relates to extra holidays about which the Minister made an announcement some time ago.  I agree with other speakers that these holidays should be made available in the summer months. We are very near the summer months now and yet there was no reference in the Minister's speech as to the extra holiday.  The second matter is the retiring gratuity which is payable to all teachers who retired after the 1st January 1950.  Many of these older teachers are existing on very small pensions.  In some cases the pensions are as low as, if not lower than, 35/-per week.  Certainly an ex-teacher in his or her old age cannot live on such a small pension.  It is said that it would cost £1,700,000 to pay a retiring gratuity to these people.  I would point out however, that the pensioned teachers have paid into a pension fund which would now amount to well over £500,000.  This fund was taken over by the Government and if the demand of these retired teachers for a retiring gratuity were met it would not mean anything like a sum of £1,700,000 to the State.  I would remind the Minister also that in the early years of the revival of the Irish language, when no money was paid for the teaching of the language and when, in some cases, it was frowned upon, these retired teachers did the pioneer work in fostering the language.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest handicaps besetting teachers is this question of bad attendance at school.  Bad attendance applies more to rural schools, I think, than to town or city schools, but one finds it everywhere&mdash; an 80 or 75 per cent. average attendance.  No teacher can do good work if only 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the children are in regular attendance. It means that work that is done one <Col N="1214" /> day has to be redone if those who are absent turn up the following day. There is of course, a School Attendance Act, but I say that that Act is not being enforced as it should.  It is a rather cumbersome measure but, even so, if it were better enforced we would not be complaining of a 75 per cent. attendance.  First of all, a Civic Guard has to warn by notice the parents of the children who are continually absent or absent over a period.  If the defaulting child returns to school for a number of days thereafter, a new warning notice must be issued in respect of subsequent absences.  Eventually, in the case of very bad offenders, court action is taken, and there is a fine, sometimes of 5/- and sometimes 10/-.  The offending parent goes home and says: &ldquo;It was well worth it,&rdquo; because in one day the child had earned something like 10/- picking potatoes, gathering fruit or some other work, for which children are purposely kept absent from school.</P>
    <P>I think it was something new in a speech like that which the Minister made last night to mention children who are mentally deficient.  It is necessary that something should be done to provide for the education of these children.  One meets them in every school in the country.  Sometimes there are as many as three and four in one school.  Their state is a pitiable one.  They are incapable of keeping up with the progress made by the other children.  They are glossed over shoved from class to class and they learn nothing as they go along.  They feel out of place and the teacher feels that, as there are only a few of them. it is not worth bothering about them. They present a problem which is difficult to remedy, but I think in each county or in each constitueney there should be some scheme under which facilities would be afforded, such as exist in England and the Six Counties. for the teaching of such children. Teachers who have special qualifications are sent out to different districts to look after such children.  That procedure has been adopted since the recent war and, so far as I know, it is working pretty well.  I wonder if something along the same lines could not be adopted here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> Much criticism has been voiced against the primary certificate.  It is felt that a child at the age of 13 or 14 is not able to put on paper all the knowledge that he or she has acquired on a certain subject and that is what the primary certificate asks the child to do.  Teachers are of opinion that at that age pupils are not capable of doing a written examination, that such an examination does not afford a fair test of the amount of knowledge a child possesses and that it might be better if an oral test were held with a record kept by the teacher.  The teacher is best able to judge what a child is capable of doing, what its qualifications are, and if it were left to the teachers to issue these certificates, it is felt that the result might be more satisfactory.  Another matter that has to be considered is that the present system leads to cramming.</P>
    <P>Teachers naturally are anxious that a fair number of the pupils entered for the examination should pass, and for that reason cramming takes place before the examination.  Set questions are given and a mass of information is gone through with a view to passing the examination.  I think myself the purpose of primary education should be, not to amass a wealth of facts and figures, but that the child should be taught how to learn, that he should be given, as it were, the blue prints and the weapons whereby in after years he could amass knowledge.  The child mind is such that if crammed with these bits and scraps of information, it will cease to judge for itself.  Therefore, our aim should be to train the mind so that when a child leaves school it will be capable of progressing in the quest for further knowledge.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by again drawing the Minister's attention to the position of the Irish language and to warn him that it is necessary to do a bit of stocktaking in order to see where improvements can be made because I feel that once the child shakes the dust of the national school from his heels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I agree with the gloomy outlook of the last speaker in thinking that the reestablishment of the Irish language as the spoken language is doomed to failure.  I agree with him that the approach to the revival of the Irish language is wrong.  We are impatient to have Irish the spoken language all in a few years, but we should remember that penal enactments introduced against the use of the Irish language some 300 years ago did not finish the Irish language in this country nor fully establish the English language.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the revival of the Irish language is only as old as this House as far as the official side of it goes, although many broadminded people always sought to keep the remnants of the language alive in the period before we got our freedom. There is only a 30-year-old effort, if you like, to re-establish the language in this country.  I cannot agree that there is no hope of re-establishing it nor do I subscribe to that opinion.</P>
      <P>It will take a long time to have it the spoken language of this country. We should not forget that the vast number of our people never had an opportunity in their day of learning Irish.  Their occupations and way of life prevented them from devoting the necessary time and attention to learning it.  I agree with those who say that the approach to the system is wrong. It must be because it should have produced better results than were produced after a period of approximately 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this question of the revival of the Irish language, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the present method of teaching Irish or trying to instil Irish into the minds of the pupils of the national schools up and down the country is doing a certain amount of damage to their knowledge and to the amount of actual knowledge they have when they leave school.  I am afraid that what some speakers said in the House last night is true&mdash;that they <Col N="1217" /> have not the same education as those in the English-speaking districts; they do not emerge from school with the same amount of knowledge as they did when English was the spoken language. While I do not claim to be an expert on educational matters, I think the Minister and his Department should keep a very close watch on the matter.</P>
    <P>If damage has been done&mdash;I have no proof of that beyond the statements made in this House from time to time &mdash;in that regard to the last generation or two of pupils who have left the national school, I think that is a very serious matter.  It would be well worth the trouble of looking into to see that in the process of re-establishing the language during this transition period, pupils, who have not an opportunity of going to a secondary school, are not turned out under a very severe handicap compared with the generations which went before them.  I hope I have made myself clear to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a huge number of children whose parents have not the opportunity, the wealth or the freedom to send their children to secondary schools.  These children have to do all their lives with whatever education they get in the national schools.  I have heard one teacher describe the teaching of Irish as stomach pumping Irish into the youngsters and that their general education suffers.  That is a very serious matter if it is true.  It is a very serious matter if the pupils fail to grasp the knowledge that has been given to them by their teachers because it is given to them through the medium of Irish and that they leave school knowing things off by heart and not understanding them.  They can tell you that two and two make four but they do not understand it in the same way as the pupil in an English-speaking district understands that ten apples and ten apples make 20 or that ten eggs and ten eggs make 20.  That is a matter the Minister should look into to see if there are any grounds for these statements.  If there are grounds a very serious injustice is being done under our eyes.</P>
    <P>Further to the speaking of the Irish language, I regret to say that the <Col N="1218" /> Gaeltacht areas are shrinking and shrinking rapidly.  Efforts have been made in this House by different Governments to try to preserve the language there.  I think the great cause of the trouble in these areas is the flight from these areas or the failure of the various Governments to stem the depopulation of what we describe as the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>In this House recently a Bill&mdash;the Undeveloped Areas Bill&mdash;went with lightning speed through the Dáil, principally because those who knew the Gaeltacht areas and those who did not were anxious to preserve the remnants of the pure Irish speakers who lived in these areas.  The working out of that Act has come as a shock to most people because they find that the very things they hoped would emerge from the working out of that Act are not taking place at all.</P>

      <P>I quite agree.  I am aware of that.  The Minister for Education is responsible for and has a great interest in the maintenance of the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas and while the Undeveloped Areas Act does not come within his ambit or within the scope of his Department, nevertheless, I had high hopes that the operation or the implementation of that Act would go a long way towards keeping the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I still hold&mdash;I will have more to say on this subject when the Vote for the Department of Lands comes up for discussion&mdash;to what I have said in this House before I was a Minister, while I was a Minister and since I was a Minister, that afforestation holds out the greatest hope of keeping at home our young people within the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister was Minister for Lands for some four or five years, and was in charge of forestry during that period, and he must be well aware of the facts I am putting before him. Anything else is merely windowdressing, and it will not help to keep the remnants of the Irish-speaking population in the Gaeltacht.  I think <Col N="1219" /> one of the pleasantest experiences one can have is to see the effect that a native Irish-speaking teacher has in the Gaeltacht area in which she or he is located.  There is perfect harmony between the teacher and the children, and the results are really excellent.  It is sad to realise that these children, who are complete masters of the language, will almost certainly emigrate. That is one of the severest blows from which the language revival is suffering. Native speakers are associated in the minds of some people with poverty and backwardness.  English-speaking neighbours look down on them.  The sooner we kill that the better it will be.  Anything that is done to abolish that idea will be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I raised the question of the closing of schools because of falling averages in the Gaeltacht areas. Unfortunately, the average is falling alarmingly.  Averages have fallen from something like 80, 20 and 25 years ago, down as low as 15, 18 and 20.  In all probability they will fall still further. While from the financial point of view it may be an economy to close these schools the effect otherwise is absolutely disastrous.  People associate their school with a natural village centre in the same way as they associate their church and their shops. All these things go to make up a natural centre round which their lives revolve.  Close a school in such a centre and there is immediately a stampede out of it.  It is an open invitation to parents with school-going children to leave that area altogether. That is something for which we cannot excuse ourselves in these areas.  We can take steps to stop the flight, and we are all equally culpable if we do not take those steps.</P>
    <P>I know there is an unwillingness on the part of one Government Department to develop that part of our country.  The result is the Irish language is dying.  Those areas could carry as big a population if they were properly developed as any other part of our country and could provide gainful employment for the breadwinners. In 20 or 30 years' time, if steps are not taken immediately to stop the rot, we <Col N="1220" /> will raise a great howl and strike our breasts in penitence for having allowed such a disaster to overtake the country. We must remedy the present trend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise it is because depopulation will follow as a natural consequence on the closing of schools in the Gaeltacht areas. Indeed, I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on reopening one school, Glensaul, a short distance from Tourmakeady.  Whatever the Minister may do about closing schools in the less poverty-stricken areas he should not close any school in the Irish-speaking areas.  Some means should be found of keeping the people there.  The Minister will ask me how it is proposed to pay the teacher where there are only five or six pupils in a school.  Even if the number fell so low, I would still keep the school open and pay the teacher. I would hold on to the very last in the hope that afforestation or some other employment would ensue for the people.</P>
      <P>In relation to one particular school, there are 15 children left in the locality, and it is now proposed to send some of them to Tourmakeady and some to Trean.  I appeal to the Minister to reopen the local school and not disperse the children.  That can be done, because the Minister is not bound by statute, and it is a simple matter to alter regulations.</P>
      <P>Some retired teachers are existing on a pension as low as £30 a year. Under legislation at present before the House old age pensioners will get approximately £55 18s. a year.  I do not think it is fair that teachers who have given a lifetime of service to the State, to the children and, through the children, to the parents, should now find themselves in the position of having to subsist on £30 a year.  These are the people who kept the torch of nationalism alive when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so.  There must be very few of them left now and I think we should strain a point to come to their assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that a sum of £23,092 is <Col N="1221" /> provided for cosmic physics.  Unfortunately my education did not go as far as a full, or even a partial, understanding of cosmic physics.  I hope the Minister will tell us what value the taxpayers are getting as a result of this expenditure.  There may be a perfectly good reason for it.  Some of us are in the dark as to what cosmic physics are doing for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned on this section, the Minister, when speaking, said that dockers were privileged with a higher rate of pay per hour than other workers because of the casual nature of their employment.  He said he was informed of that.  It was rather strange to hear that statement from anybody.  They get that higher rate because of the heavy work they have to do.  I think a case can be made for them because of the casual nature of their employment and, therefore, the amendment which I had down was all the more necessary.  There is a principle involved in this section.  The principle is, are such workers entitled to get benefit from the date on which they fall ill, and are they entitled to get unemployment benefit from the date on which they are thrown out of employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that these are classes of workers who have no resources at all.  The Minister made the point that they can earn so much in four days that they can easily suffer the loss of getting nothing at all for <Col N="1222" /> the other two days of the week.  The fact is that throughout the whole year they have 17 weeks and two days during which they will get no benefit from the State.  Yet they will have their family obligations to meet during that period.  Many of these men are the fathers of very large families.  They have rent to pay the same as everybody else.  Some of them may be in houses where the differential rent system operates.  If they earn so much in the four days, the rent of their houses will go up accordingly.  I think that is an argument against the point raised by the Minister.  If, for instance, they have to pay rent of 10/-a week during a week in which they got two days' employment, then under this differential rent system their rents may go up to £1 a week in the following week because in that week they had four or five days' employment. Therefore, the privileges which these men enjoy, according to what the Minister was told, of a special rate because of the casual nature of their employment, are completely, nullified.  The same applies to builders' labourers.</P>
    <P>I think there is a very grave principle involved in this section, and that a case can be made for this class of workers.  I submit that they should get paid sickness benefit from the date on which they fall ill, and unemployment benefit from the day on which they are thrown out of employment. As I said before, they are no less worthy of consideration than men in regular employment.  If they are out for two or three days, or even for a fortnight, they get half wages or full wages.  If public servants are out ill for a week or a fortnight they get full pay. I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the section and come to the rescue of these people.  I think their case requires special consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that every member of the House who has been connected with local authorities and has been brought face to face with social work of one kind or another, will support the views put forward by Deputy Hickey and Deputy McGrath. I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this position, because if we <Col N="1223" /> are trying to prevent a delinquent from getting something we are at the same time putting a hardship on the 95 per cent. who are honestly looking for work or who are genuinely ill.  The pressure of economic circumstances is such at the present time that anybody who is idle and is seeking work, will be glad to take it if it is offered.  Undoubtedly, the Minister has gone a certain distance already.  I would make a special appeal to him to consider especially the case of men with families who are left without anything whatever for three days.  That will mean hardship not only for himself but for his family.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that has been made, that the time period should be reduced for all these purposes to two days, would, if accepted, go some way to meet the position.  The suggestion has been made that, if a man is ill for a week or more, he should certainly get an allowance, small though it is, for all the days that he has been ill, no matter what the expense of meeting it might be.  I think there is a duty on us to do that.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, charity will always remain one of the theological, one of the divine virtues, and so neighbours and families will help one another in their difficulties.  It would be a sad day if that spirit were to die out of Irish life.  It is a virtue that we see practised amongst the dwellers in crowded areas in our cities.  They all try to help one another in their difficulties.  At the same time everybody knows that the allowances which are made under these Acts are not entirely adequate, and so whatever is given should be given for all the days a man is out of work so as to enable him to meet the requirements of his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that when I had to deal with this problem, the problem of the period during which unemployment benefit should be paid in respect of people who had lost their employment, I was impressed by the case which could be made for dockers. I do not think it is impossible to meet the situation which arises specially in that particular occupation.  As Deputy <Col N="1224" /> Hickey has said, there is a problem common to dockers which has no parallel, I think, in any other occupation. Dockers are employed to load and unload boats.  Boats do not come in regularly and dockers have not available to them the regular volume of work that is available, say, in a factory, Their employment is necessarily geared to the arrival and the discharge of boats, so that anybody who follows the occupation of a docker will have to face up to the fact that it will be extremely difficult for him to get continuous employment throughout the year.  But, yet, you must have dockers to load and unload boats, with the result that anybody who follows that occupation necessarily loses a considerable amount of employment during a year because of the irregular character of his employment.</P>
      <P>Efforts have been made elsewhere, and efforts are now about to be made here, to try and evolve a scheme known as the decasualisation of dockers.  The occupation is one which is very subject to casualisation.  I think, however, in our circumstances, since we are not a mammoth commercial nation, it is going to be extremely difficult to deal with the problem of the decasualisation of dockers here.  We must face up to the situation that anyone who becomes a docker has to be satisfied with one, two, three or four days' employment in each week, and the docker who gets four days' employment each week regards himself as relatively lucky.  It means that, for his employable life, he will lose two days' income per week. He has to pay unemployment insurance contributions, and can only get benefit now if he is employed for three days. The position is that he will be almost on the verge of qualifying, but, because of the insistence on three days' interruption of employment, will be denied the benefit on a great many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be going too far&mdash;and, frankly, I was prepared to face up to going this distance&mdash;to take power to enable the Minister, in consultation with the trade unions catering for dock workers, to evolve a scheme which would recognise the casual nature of employment in dockland and whereby those workers who <Col N="1225" /> regularly lose two days' employment per week might be able to cover that risk.  It might necessitate some amendment of the normal unemployment insurance scheme which operates in respect of other classes.  I can see that, but I do not think it is wholly impossible to devise a scheme in respect of dock workers which would enable benefit to be paid in respect of those who regularly lose employment each week because of the nature of the employment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to close his mind to that.  It is well worthy of examination if ultimately we evolve a scheme which obviates the casualness of the work of dockers.  Under such a scheme the scheme that the Minister now uses will fall into desuetude.  That may not matter if in the meantime we can cover those who have genuine grievances in respect of unemployment benefit by the way in which legislation is drawn at the moment and will have grievances, although to a lesser extent, under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to undertake to examine the matter between now and Report Stage.  If he took a general power to devise a scheme for dockers he might, when the Bill is passed, have consultations to see if a suitable scheme could be worked out. Could we have any word from the Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot say very much more than I said already. What I did point out was that the period has been reduced from six days to three days and, as Deputy Norton knows at any rate, if the docker qualifies in any particular week, then for the three months following he would be eligible for unemployment benefit for any day he is idle.  It means that he must qualify in one week.  It does not mean, as Deputy Hickey might think, that he must qualify every week for three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let us not misunderstand the position.  I said no such thing because I know the position too well.  I am pointing out that for every week of the year a docker can be idle <Col N="1226" /> two days and sign at the labour exchange and will not get any benefit for it.  In other words, he is idle 17 weeks and two days throughout the year and he must go to the labour exchange and sign on, even though he will not get benefit for the two days. There are 17 weeks and two days in that year for which he receives not one solitary penny benefit and he is paying the same amount of contributions as a man with constant employment.  He is the one man that is subject to standing in wet and cold in the morning on the off-chance of getting employment. Every morning he must go out and stand there on chance, and if he does not get work he must go to the labour exchange and sign on.  If he gets three and a half days' work and is two days idle every week in the year, he does not get a penny for that. A special case can be made for this class of worker.  I do not see that it would be difficult from an administrative point of view.  These problems are there to be met and to be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the suggestions made by Deputy Norton for special consideration of dockers.  It is true, as Deputy Hickey has just said, that casual dockers may be idle for 17 weeks in the year and get nothing for it.  In the past the Government provided what was thought to be an impossibility when they provided wet time for the building trade, which was a very valuable concession.  If they did that I want to know why dockers, who stand by waiting for hours for a ship to come in, should not be provided for. There may be 50 dockers waiting and only 25 are wanted.  The other 25 must go home.  Surely that type of man is worthy of special consideration by the Government.  At the present moment I know that is going on at the North and South Walls.  One hundred men will turn up and wait for a boat to be unloaded and, out of the 100, 50 might have to go home without getting work and may have to wait for another two or three days.  Some special provision ought to be made, and I plead with the Minister to consider the points made by Deputy Norton and Deputy Hickey.</P>

      <P>It would appear that a good case is made for that particular section of our workers.  As has been very properly pointed out, the wet-time provision has been made for certain people and it ought to be possible for the Minister to make a regulation for dockers such as that suggested by Deputy Norton.  It certainly appears to be a very great hardship that it is possible that a man would be 17 weeks idle.  I suppose it is not probable that every man would be idle for that length of time, but it is possible that for quite a number of weeks a man would be idle and get no benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If his work is very casual, in all probability, he will be eligible after three days, some way or other, and, if he is, he is qualified and remains qualified for the next three months.  He is not too bad then.  If he gets five days a week, on account of the hard work that Deputy Hickey has impressed on us, five days is enough to work.  It can only possibly occur in the very case that Deputy Hickey mentions, where a man gets four days a week work the whole year round and never less than four or never more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be understood. The Minister is taking entirely wrong the point I made about four days every week.  I want to tell the Minister that I know a number of casual dockers who only get one day in the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number get four days' work a week and a number get three <Col N="1228" /> days' work and some of them get two days' work.  The Minister talked about being qualified for three months.  That is not the point I am making.  I know he is qualified for three months.  I am referring to the docker who gets two, three or four days.  If he is idle, he has to go to the labour exchange and sign on.  He may work three days in the week but it may not be on consecutive days.  He may work Monday, Wednesday and Friday and he has to go to the labour exchange for the other days.  He gets three days' benefit for that week. The following week he may work only one and a half days at the docks and he will sign on at the labour exchange and get four days' benefit.  The following week he only gets two days.  He will sign on at the labour exchange and will not get any benefit for the two days.  If he is in that class of employment for 12 months, it means that for 17 weeks of the year he is not getting benefit for being unemployed.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about a number of dockers who sign on every week at the labour exchange, whether for two or three days, and in respect of whom it works out like that in practice.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration for me to say that there is a very small number of dockers who could get four days' work as casual workers at the docks.  In Dublin they have casual casuals, men who are called on nearly every day, but with regard to the suggestion about a docker trying to stay away from a day's work, that is not so in practice at all.  One fellow might do it, but one swallow does not make a summer.  If any men are inclined to work, it is these dockers, and I should like to impress on the Minister that, if the docker lives in a corporation house which is rented on a differential rent system, if he works three days this week, he gets a reduction in his rent, but if he works four, five or six days the following week, up goes his rent, and he is therefore not in any privileged position in the matter of getting a higher rate as a docker. There is a case to be made for men of that kind and a principle involved with regard to them.</P>

      <P>I have some considerable experience and knowledge of the working of dockers in the Port of Dublin, and, listening to the Minister, I wondered whether he has been in consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce on the matter. A scheme for the decasualisation of dockers in the Port of Dublin was submitted to the Department some considerable time ago, and the information contained in that submission would be very valuable to the Minister in relation to this matter.  I urge him, if he has not consulted the Department already, to do so before the next stage. The system in Dublin is different from that in other ports because as many ships are being dealt with in the Port of Dublin for the past couple of years as the quays can accommodate, and ships often have to wait out in the bay for a berth at the port.</P>
      <P>There is a priority list for the employment of dockers, so far as it affects deep-sea and cross-channel dockers. The majority of those on the list so far as cross-channel working is concerned, get five days' work.  Some of the dockers voluntarily surrender one day in the week in order to give their sons or other dockers a fair chance.  I appeal to the Minister not to close the door on this matter without looking into it further, and having a further talk with the responsible officials of the Department, or with the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself. It is deplorable to watch dockers turning up at 7 o'clock on a wet morning, hoping to be called for work and these same men who are not taken on during the day very often turning up on a wet night for work and failing to get it.</P>

      <P>A deputation of the dockers recently called to see me in regard to this very problem and I agree entirely with what the Minister has said that it would need a special scheme.  It would be very difficult to provide for it within the four walls of this general Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, but the Bill ought to contain a section enabling a special scheme to be put into operation in regard to them.  Deputy Davin, Deputy Byrne <Col N="1230" /> and Deputy Norton have mentioned particular features but there is another feature which operates in the docks in Dublin which is known as the &ldquo;button&rdquo; scheme.</P>

      <P>Are we overlooking the other point about the man who falls ill?  I am prepared to admit that there is a difficulty but a man will not get national health insurance unless he submits a medical certificate stating that he is ill.  If he is out for two or three days and goes back to work on the fourth day he does not get anything and he is minus his three days' wages.  Why, if a man is out for three days and gets a certificate, should he not be paid for these days?  We are penalising the most helpless section of the community, so far as workers are concerned.  A man will lose his £1 a day wages through being out, and if he has a wife and family he is not going to fall ill.  Doctors tell me very often that many of the tuberculosis cases could be dealt with if these people gave up work in time, and I know that it is poverty and lack of income which prevent a good many decent workers from reporting their illness.  I maintain that we are penalising these men by such restrictions.</P>

      <P>Is that not unfair to the man who has been contributing to the unemployment fund, as in many cases I know of, for 25 or 30 years, and who is cut off?  I am talking of a man in private employment.  No one wants him when he is 60 years of age, and he is left on the stones.  He goes to the labour exchange and draws for six months, and then has to go off for six months and go on unemployment assistance.  I hold he should get benefit for whatever stamps he has. He has to go back after the six months and then can continue drawing another six months' benefit from his stamps.  That is one 12 months' benefit he has drawn from his stamps, towards which he has been paying for 25 or 30 years.  He is no longer entitled to draw benefit from his stamps until he has been 13 weeks employed and has 13 stamps to bring him back into benefit, in spite of all the stamps he has to his credit.  Is that not unjust to a man who has worked honestly, and who never shrank from work all those years?  What is the justification for that penalty on the workers?  I made that case to Deputy Norton when he was Minister, and I make it now.  It is most unjust to the workers.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there should be no such penalty there, that a man should at least draw the value of the stamps he has paid for.  If he had not stamps to his credit I could understand it, but he has years and years of stamps to his credit yet he cannot draw against them until he has 13 more, which means he must be employed for 13 weeks to bring him back into benefit.  The Minister should reconsider that and allow the man who has stamps to his credit to draw the benefit until they are exhausted.</P>
      <P>There was a time when one stamp was guarantee for one week's unemployment insurance benefit, but we cut that off and said one stamp would count only for one day's benefit.  The Minister should reconsider the matter on no other principle except the principle of justice to those honest workers. They should be entitled to draw benefit over the full period covered by their stamp contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that anything should be done to abuse the fund, but only that he should be able to draw the benefit to his credit when he is unemployed at the end of his days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time, as the Deputy knows, a person only draws six months' benefit in the year and can draw only one day's benefit for each week's contribution.  That is a considerable improvement.  Under this Bill he can requalify when he has 13 stamps and will get six months.  It is true that a man who has been working for 25 or 30 years can draw only six months' benefit, but taking it all round it is a very considerable advance.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that if a man is genuinely looking for work and has drawn benefit for six months and cannot find work, he will fall back on unemployment assistance which, if this Bill goes through with the amendments now proposed to it, will be at least a considerable improvement even on the present unemployment insurance.  Taking the Bill as a whole, between unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, the position will be considerably improved.</P>
      <P>One must remember that we are dealing with the insurance part first in this Bill&mdash;that is the unemployment insurance, national health and widows' and orphans' part.  That is framed so that the contributions being divided equally between the employer, the employee and the State will pay for the scheme.  If we were to accede to certain proposals by Deputy Hickey and others, the contributions would not be sufficient and would have to be raised.  Looking at it from the point of view of an insurance scheme, we must keep that in mind.</P>

      <P>I am, but I have also in mind the fact that the class of man I have been referring to has been a burden on no one.  He has not been a burden on the unemployment fund for all those years.  It is not justice to him to cut him off after he has drawn six months' benefit.  Then, when <Col N="1235" /> he comes back again, what I am objecting to is that, after another six months, he can draw nothing and is cut off completely.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that and not make it 13 stamps as that would mean that he must be employed for 13 weeks. I could understand some taken period, but do not make it 13, as he never would be employed for 13 weeks, since no one would want him when he is over 60.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> In sub-section (4), page 16, to add at the end of the sub-section (not as part of paragraph (c):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and the period of disqualification shall commence on the day on which the loss or leaving of employment, refusal, failure or neglect (as the case may be) occurred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section deals with various disqualifications and special conditions. Amongst the disqualifications is one where a person does not seek employment or refuses suitable employment offered to him.  He can be penalised for six weeks.  This amendment is put in to say that the period of disqualification shall commence on the day on which the loss or leaving of employment, refusal, failure or neglect occurred.  It is really put in to safeguard the worker because if it were not the Minister would have power to come along six months or 12 months afterwards and penalise a man for something which had occurred.  The man must be penalised within six weeks and at the end of six weeks the penalty ceases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

He goes to the labour exchange and because he has lost his job through his own fault he can be penalised up to the end of the six weeks' period.  It is about time that we amended that kind of regulation. Then the man must go before the court of referees.  Their report goes to Dublin and the decision must come back.  It is unfair to the worker that he may be penalised for six weeks because he left the job through his own fault.</P>

Suppose that a man who goes to the labour exchange must go to the court of referees.  For three weeks he is signing on at the labour exchange.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be feasible in a Bill like this to give some executive authority to the local man to deal with those cases?  As it is, it is nonsensical.  A chairman presides, a case is tried on its merits and a man may be deprived of benefit.  If he has lost his employment, it is unfair that he should not get benefit.  The case goes to Dublin and, very often, after two or three reminders, we get it back. All the time that man's wife and children are waiting.  He has to go to the home assistance officer.  We should give some executive power to the manager of the labour exchange in Cork City, for instance, rather than have the case sent to Dublin, where some junior clerk will decide on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the point Deputy Hickey makes.  I know that the view the Department has on the implementation of a scheme as comprehensive as that which we contemplated is that it could only be done on the basis of decentralisation. It is, unfortunately, true that the manager of a local exchange, a man of standing, judgement, ability, a man with years and years of experience, is obliged by over-centralised regulations to send cases to Dublin for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very frequently the decisions in Dublin are made by officers substantially junior in rank to the submitting officer, although the final decision which issues from Dublin may be countersigned by an officer of higher <Col N="1239" /> rank.  The officer of higher rank, however, could not possibly get down to all the minute details, and must rely on the judgment of the person who assembles the material and gives a decision on that material.  It would make for more smoothness in the administration of the unemployment insurance benefit scheme if arrangements could be made to give more responsibility in the matter of decisions to the managers of local exchanges, particularly of the large control exchanges, so as to take away the bottle-neck caused by a lot of cases coming to Dublin for decision.  Local managers should be given wider discretion regarding the circumstances in which benefit should be withheld or paid, even if the case went to the court of referees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember putting that view before Deputy Norton in 1948.  As he is in sympathy with it I am afraid that officials in the Department are preventing this from happening. Cases are held up for a very long time on many occasions.  As Deputy Hickey pointed out, the man gets home assistance in the meantime, and then the home assistance man is after him to collect it.  Surely to goodness there should be some way of getting the benefit paid, even if it had to be confirmed later in Dublin.  If a man were paid illegally there is plenty of machinery to make him refund it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment is of very great importance.  The punishment starts to operate on the day the man left his employment.  It is as well to let the punishment start on that day as on any other day if he is found guilty.  How will he be proceeded against?  What is the evidence on which he will be disqualified from benefit for a period? Sub-section (c) says if he has failed or neglected to avail himself of any reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment.  That does not call for his employer to disqualify him. An anonymous letter can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter could be sent to the effect that X, Y or Z had refused a job. That is what has been the case up to <Col N="1240" /> now; the authority of the manager automatically disqualifies that man.  I have had a case where six, seven or eight weeks have elapsed before a man was eventually brought to trial and justice and the money refunded to him, and all because the news conveyed in the anonymous letter was bogus.  I feel there should be something done to prevent victimisation of that kind.  I have in mind the case of a man with six or seven children who was left without benefit for two months all because of information conveyed in a malicious letter.  I am not very much concerned with this particular amendment but as to how a man who is brought to trial is going to suffer before he is proven guilty or innocent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further case, and I do not know whether or not the Minister can cover it by regulation. I came across the case personally some time ago of a man with one leg who was disqualified from benefit because it was alleged that he had not availed himself of every reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment.  At the time, I and every other Deputy had tremendous difficulty in finding employment for a two-legged man.  I feel that that treatment was rather harsh.  However, the case was put right on appeal, and I do not think it is proper that there should be a summary decision taken to stop benefit and then put the onus on the man to prove he is entitled to benefit.  That is unjust.  This is the same point that has been already raised.</P>

A man is sacked from his job because he has partaken of too many pints of stout or because he struck a foreman who has spoken wrongly to him.  He has then got to go to the labour exchange and all this machinery is used against him.  Is it not time that we should attack these problems from a <Col N="1241" /> humane point of view rather than through the medium of regulations inherited from the British régime?  I can assure the House that the court of referees in Cork are sick and tired of cases such as this.  Sometimes they would feel sympathetic towards the man in question because of his wife and family.  We are not approaching our problems in a proper way by introducing an Act in this Parliament which says that if a man loses his employment through his own fault he will not get any benefit for six weeks even though he might have had a clean record for 15 years.  If a docker is found even slightly under the influence of drink, he is put off immediately.  He has to go to the labour exchange and will not get any benefit for six weeks because he has lost his employment through what is called &ldquo;his own fault&rdquo;.  I think we have reached the stage now where we should work out our regulations differently.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he should display a different attitude towards men who lose their jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there is a case for probing this matter in the light of this discussion.  We are dealing here with the cases of persons who, in the future, if they have 156 contributions paid, will be eligible to draw benefit for a period of 156 days in any one year.  Then if they are qualified by getting a further 13 stamps to their credit, they qualify for 156 further days, which means, in effect, that one may qualify for unemployment benefit for nine months as against six months at present.  That is a substantial improvement on the existing legislation. Bearing in mind the fact that we are recognising the extended right to unemployment benefit, would it not be possible for the Minister, from the standpoint of seeing if people on first examination of the case are likely to incur a penalty and disqualification, if the case comes before the court of referees, to provide that the Department will nevertheless pay benefit to him until such time as he has actually had his case heard and a decision arrived at.  At most it means he gets benefit for, let us say, two weeks at the outside if there is a speedier method of hearing these disputed cases.  In any case, as the person is likely to qualify for benefit for a prolonged period, so long as he is idle, it can be arranged that whatever benefits he improperly received, because of having been found guilty of some irregularity before a court of referees, could be deducted from subsequent benefit to which he was entitled.  In other words, his card could be marked in such a way, <Col N="1244" /> that he was liable to refund whatever amount was improperly paid to him in benefit by reason of the fact that he was found guilty of an irregularity and, therefore, not entitled to draw benefit during the period it was paid to him. I think that should be examined sympathetically at this stage without the Minister making any commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not common sense that what I am advocating should take place.  If a person is not drawing benefit at the labour exchange, he goes to the home assistance officer.  The home assistance officer takes cognisance of his dependents and will give him home assistance.  If it is wrong for the social welfare officer to give him benefit, it must be equally wrong for the home assistance officer to give him benefit under the same circumstances. These regulations should not be enforced so stringently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really only one point, and no matter how this matter is argued, it comes back to the ordinary elements of justice.  In this case a man is entitled on his stamps to the benefit.  The Act gives him the right to apply for benefit for a period not exceeding six weeks.  What I am putting to the Minister&mdash;and I think it is the same case that has been put by Deputies Hickey, Norton and Keyes&mdash;is that you should not stop benefit unless it is proved at a hearing at which he is present that he is entitled to forfeit the benefit for this period.  It is really a matter of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Something on those lines could be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory. I would like the Minister to satisfy me on sub-sections (2) and (3).  This is an improvement on the position as it was. It is a thing that came to my notice during the strike at the docks, when as a result of that strike, a number of people who were engaged, not as dockers but employed at the docks, lost their employment and, consequently, it was held that under some decision under the old Acts they were not entitled to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the officials administering the Acts found that there were difficulties there that they themselves <Col N="1245" /> could not get over because of this particular decision.  Has this section been so drafted as to get over the difficulties that were in that old decision? It does provide that where &ldquo;a person has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the factory, workshop, farm or other premises or place at which he was employed shall be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit&rdquo;.  Sub-section (3) provides that &ldquo;where separate branches of work which are commonly carried on as separate businesses in separate premises or at separate places are in any case carried on in separate departments on the same premises or at the same place, each of those departments shall, for the purposes of the immediately preceding sub-section, be deemed to be a separate factory, workshop or farm or separate premises or a separate place, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It may be that that section has been specially drafted to overcome the difficulties because I do not think it was right, if dockers were on strike, that every person employed in, around or about the docks should lose employment as a result of that strike and should be debarred from receiving unemployment insurance as they were debarred during the last strike.  I want to know do these two sub-sections improve the position so that workers could in those circumstances receive unemployment insurance in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in the law.  The wording of sub-sections (2) and (3) is practically the same as the relevant provisions in the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  If the Deputy looks it up he will see in Section 8&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to look it up.  Apparently the officials in Beresford Place are in the difficulty that there has been some old judicial or other decision that binds them and that prevents a person employed about the docks who loses his employment benefiting under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  That loss of employment was brought about by a trade dispute somewhere else.  I do <Col N="1246" /> not think that is right.  If that is the position I would like the Minister to look into it.  If the passing of these two sub-sections does not alter the position then I would say that he should take power in this Bill to give unemployment insurance to people who lose their employment indirectly as a result of a strike in which they are not involved.</P>

Men who are employed delivering coal or working in warehouses or some other employment of that kind are not interested in the withdrawal of that labour.  When they go to the labour exchange they are told they are not entitled to benefit.  Although they are not on strike themselves they are treated as though they were.  I think it is most unfair to prevent those people from obtaining assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had any discussion with the Trade Union Congress or the Congress of Irish Unions in connection with this section? As it stands the section is a copy from the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and is to-day the same as it was in 1920.  Frankly, I do not say that it is due to any want of goodwill on the part of the people who have been called upon to deal with this particular difficulty.  In Britain they have got away from those two clauses which were in their 1920 Act and they got a substitute clause dealing with a situation such as those two sections are intended to provide for.  But I do not think the British section has given satisfaction to the trade unions there and the committee which was set up by the British Ministry of Labour charged with the responsibility of <Col N="1247" /> trying to remove whatever hardships that were contained in those two sections as now phrased finally reported that they did not think they would get satisfaction on this problem, that no set of words could be devised which would give satisfaction.  In the long run they made an effort to try to ease the situation.  Quite frankly I think the British attempt to remedy the situation creates a position which makes it more rigid, in fact, than it is in sub-sections (2) and (3) here.</P>
      <P>I discussed this matter with both the Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions, and said to them that, subject to the unemployment fund not being used for the purpose of financing or even appearing remotely to finance the continuance of a strike, I was prepared to look with sympathy on any amendments which they could suggest to these sub-sections.  That offer remained open to them, but it was not availed of, because I think they both found difficulty in dealing with the situation envisaged here.  Of course the situation is still more difficult where you have an organisation which caters for a large number of workers, only one section of which may be involved in a strike although the remainder may be in the same organisation.  It is a situation of that kind which presents the greatest difficulty, because it is easy to create a situation in which a strike applies only to a very minute section of the organisation but has ramifications over a much wider field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested to both congresses that they might try their hand at devising something.  The best one I got from either of the congresses was the present British substitute for these two.  After discussing it with them, however, I was certainly convinced that it was no improvement on the present situation.  In the end, I think they were also convinced, but the offer still remained open to them to try their hand at doing something which would give reasonable satisfaction, and I was prepared to approach it with a bias towards accepting anything which they thought would remove the hardships which are inherent in this.  I <Col N="1248" /> should like to know whether the Minister has had any such discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aware that Deputy Norton when he was Minister did ask the Trade Union Congress&mdash;I do not know about the Congress of Irish Unions&mdash;to make suggestions on this question.  They have not really any suggestions to make.  As the Deputy mentioned, the British Minister of Labour brought in an amendment to his scheme, but some time afterwards he said that it must not be assumed that it would be entirely satisfactory. He said that no matter how it was worded many would be entitled to benefit but, if the whole truth were known, they would be excluded.  Others would be excluded who, if the whole truth were known, ought to get benefit. It is impossible to make any change for the better.  No suggestion has been made by the Trade Union Congress or anybody else that could be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the position has been made clear both by Deputy Norton and the Minister, that the Trade Union Congresses, who after all are the responsible bodies, have not been able to suggest an improvement. I know of the hardship that was caused in connection with that particular strike.  As a matter of fact, I attended the court of referees with the men concerned in an effort to get them benefit.  Where a strike was declared by a section of a union I felt that any other members of that particular union who lost their employment as a result of that strike could hardly claim unemployment insurance. The situation would be entirely different with members of other unions not associated with the strike in any way.  I realise the difficulties that must be there.  But I think these two sub-sections are no improvement and do create hardships for particular classes of workers.  However, I cannot suggest any way out if the Trade Union Congresses cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make this point to the Minister although I have not given it any consideration. Here are two sub-sections which have caused a good deal of irritation to trade unions through the years.  Somebody <Col N="1249" /> might have a brainwave and produce a solution for the difficulties but, once we pass this Bill and it becomes an Act, then the most meritorious suggestion that can be made for remedying the position cannot be given effect to except by means of an amending Bill. Everybody knows, however, that what would happen in a case such as that would be that the suggestion would be parked away to be considered in due course when an amending Bill would be under consideration.</P>
      <P>I was wondering if the Minister would look at these two sub-sections again from the standpoint of allowing them to remain as at present because there is no suitable alternative, but giving himself power to make regulations substituting for them either one or more sub-sections which might be devised as a result of agreement between the Minister and the Trade Union Congresses.  That would enable any useful suggestion which might overcome the difficulty to be given effect to without having to wait for an amending Bill.  I do not know whether the Minister can do that but I imagine it is possible to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the payment of maternity benefit at the rate of £2 in respect of a confinement. My regret in connection with this section is that the Minister did not allow the amount to stand at £5, which was provided for in the Bill which I introduced.  Instead the Minister has reduced the provision in the previous Bill from £5 to £2, with the result that £2 is now the normal payment which will be made in cases of maternity instead of £5 which was provided for in the previous Bill.  The existing £2 was decided upon many years ago.  In so far as it was intended to be a contribution towards easing the financial difficulties of a family consequent upon the birth of a baby it made, in the year it was introduced, a contribution comparable with the living costs in that particular year. Quite clearly that £2 has so shrunk in value to-day as not to have anything like the purchasing power which it had originally.  I felt sure that in increasing the maternity benefit from £2 to £5 we were doing little more than bringing the £2 maternity benefit to its current value and that if it should happen that £5 was even more than that, then it was meritorious to give the increased contribution to a person who was facing both the risks and expense of childbirth.  In this Bill we have left the sum at £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a great mistake.  It is a pity that the Minister has interfered <Col N="1251" /> with this particular section as it stood in the Bill which I introduced. If the amount of the benefit had been left as it stood in the previous Bill it would have been a particularly useful benefit and, when tied-in with the maternity attendance allowance, would have made a very tangible contribution towards easing the difficulties in ordinary working class households where the arrival of a new baby is often accompanied by considerable expense to the family.</P>
    <P>I provided in my Bill for increasing the maternity benefit from £2 to £5. In addition, I provided that the mother, where she was not an insured person but the wife of an insured person, would get a maternity attendance allowance of £1 for four weeks.  In other words, under the Bill for which I was responsible, a confinement in a household meant that the family got £5 maternity benefit and £4 in maternity attendance allowance, making £9 in all.  The provision in this Bill is simply to continue the present £2, which has so shrunk in purchasing power as not to be worth anything like the £2 originally contemplated.  This section, with the section which is missing from the Bill&mdash;the maternity allowance section&mdash;means that for a confinement in an ordinary working class household in the future the family get £2 instead of the £9 originally provided for.  I do not think our standard of living and our standards of comfort surrounding childbirth are so high that we ought to economise in that domain. I think we spend far too little in trying to help those who bear heroically the task of facing childbirth, and who have to meet the heavy responsibilities involved.  Indeed, I would regard a saving of money on that as something for which I personally would have no responsibility.  If there should have to be any trimming at all, it ought not to be in that connection.  Some other potential beneficiaries might be found to yield something instead.  In the field of maternity services and in the field of helping the ordinary workers over the expensive periods which childbirth means for them, I think we ought to have left the provision as it was in the Bill which I introduced.</P>

      <P>My view about maternity benefit was that it was needed just as much by the self-employed as by the wife of the insured worker or by a woman insured in her own right.  Hence I decided that this benefit should be dealt with under the health scheme. That scheme will, I hope, provide maternity benefits of various kinds for all women, whether insured or not.  I think it is better that it should be done in that way.  Generally speaking, in all these various schemes it appeared to me that where the self-employed person needed the benefit just as much as the person working for an employer it should not be done under an insurance scheme but either under an assistance scheme or under the health scheme, and preferably under the health scheme.</P>

A problem was raised by Christian Scientists who, apparently, do not think too highly of medical officers and who, apparently, dislike sending in certificates from them.  I undertook to meet them.  In fact, I think I circulated an amendment for the purpose of avoiding ruffling the feelings of Christian Scientists by being willing to take evidence otherwise than by way of the certificate of a registered medical practitioner.  The amendment I circulated was to provide that the allowance would be paid on the production of the certificate of a registered medical practitioner or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Minister.

I still think that a strong case can be made for paying maternity benefit in proportion to the number of children born.  It is certainly somewhat odd&mdash;and I think indefensible&mdash;that you pay the same maternity benefit to a woman who gives birth to one child as you do to her neighbour next door who gives birth to triplets or quadruplets.

      <P>If a widow is to qualify for a pension, the husband must have paid 156 contributions.  If two young people get married after a very short time in employment, it is possible that the widow would get no pension because neither of them would have qualified.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter how long they were married.  The qualification arises from the period during which contributions have been paid.  If she was married only a month, she would get a pension if the husband had paid the qualifying number of contributions. If he has qualified by the payment of 156 contributions and he dies inside a month after the marriage, she will get a widow's pension.</P>

      <P>I might explain to Deputy Hickey that the payment of the <Col N="1256" /> widow's pension is not dependent on how long the parties have been married.  The husband pays from the very day he goes to work; consequently after he marries the only question that arises about the entitlement to a widow's pension is: has he qualified himself to get her a widow's pension when he dies?</P>

      <P>I do not know why the Minister put in sub-section (3)  of this section at all, or whether it is a carry-over from some other legislation. I can see tremendous trouble and difficulties about it for everybody and opportunities for &ldquo;Peeping Toms&rdquo; and different types of persons of that kind to send in anonymous reports.  I think it could cause a tremendous lot of trouble.  Every widow is entitled to a contributory pension while she is a widow.  She would, of course, cease to be a widow if she married again, but to put in this clause, that she will be disqualified from receiving a widow's pension &ldquo;if and so long as she and any persons are cohabiting as man and wife&rdquo;, is altogether unnecessary.  Who is going to decide that?  I think it will cause a good deal of trouble.  It is the sort of thing that will give rise to all sorts of malicious reports and investigations. In fact, if a person were to visit a widow frequently, the Minister would have complaints that she was cohabiting with that particular individual. I do not think it right that that sub-section should be put in the Bill, and as to what cohabiting means, I do not know who is going to decide that either.  Is it defined, is it a carry-over, or what is it?</P>

      <P>I think there is another class which should be covered&mdash;there are a good many of these cases in the country&mdash; where unmarried brothers and sisters are concerned, where the sister is at home housekeeping for the brother or his wife and where he becomes idle and does not get any dependent's allowance for that sister who has been caring for him all that time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and very serious hardship on the household.  I have in mind two cases at least.  One is that of a chap who is 26 years of age who has to be wheeled about in a chair.  I was asked a few times if anything could be done for him.  The reason nothing has been done is that his brother, who is a tradesman, is living with him and that brother is expected to look after him.  That poor chap was wheeled to school for a while and was trying to do some paintings, as he was not able to move around.  He is not taken around until night-time and then has to be wheeled.  He has not as much as a penny coming from any source except his brother.  His brothers and sisters are married and he is there with his aged mother and the brother who is living there also is expected to look after him without getting anything from the State.  I suggest to the Minister that these are matters which we should not allow to continue.  I have a couple of such cases in mind and believe they should get some assistance from the State. There is the case of what are known as handicapped children.  I know one chap who has only one hand and another who has only part of his right hand and is not able to do anything for himself.  His father has passed away and because his brothers are working he is not getting anything at all.  I agree that from the moral point of view the brothers are expected to look after him but I also believe that it is the duty of the State under the Constitution to give some assistance to this citizen who needs it.  The Minister might consider these points. I admit that there may be difficulties but what problem is not difficult?  If we have the will to get over the difficulties we will do so.  I hope these cases referred to now will be dealt with and will get some assistance from the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case mentioned by Deputy Hickey is different from that <Col N="1259" /> mentioned by Deputy McGrath.  We are dealing with cases where an insured person has a female relative looking after children.  Supposing he is a widower, that is covered here. Deputy McGrath goes further and speaks of the case of a man who has a sister keeping house for him for years.  When he becomes unemployed he gets benefit only for himself. Deputy McGrath says that the sister should be covered.  I examined that sympathetically, but found it extremely difficult to cover it, as it would bring so many people into it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey mentions quite a different case.  Persons who are permanently disabled present a different problem.  I have great hopes of dealing with that also in the Health Bill&mdash; not here, as they would not be insurable in any case.

      <P>As expressed here, of course, this is far too rigid, and I do not think it was ever intended that it should operate in this particular way <Col N="1260" /> without some qualifications.  It is not intended, for example, that where a person leaves the State for holidays or for a long period of medical treatment there would be any disqualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was my view that if a person left the State permanently, that was one matter; but if he left the State for holidays, for medical treatment or for any good reason, that person would not lose entitlement to benefit because of that fact.  If, for example, a person were ill or drawing benefit but were advised to go to some home in Britain or elsewhere to get special treatment, training or exercise, that person should not be denied benefit.  It was contemplated then that regulations would provide for cases of that kind.  I would like to know if that is still the Minister's view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a person undergoing penal servitude, imprisonment or detention in legal custody, here again, operated in this way without qualification, it would cause hardship. A man may be undergoing a term of imprisonment in respect of some offence, which may be a trivial offence&mdash;it may even be a political offence, which would not mark him out as an objectionable member of society &mdash;but I do not think it was ever intended that merely because the husband was in prison, the wife should not get maternity benefit if a child were born.  Again, I do not think it is intended that an orphan's allowance would not be paid to the orphan merely because the person to whom it was being paid was temporarily in custody.  My intention was that where a person was undergoing imprisonment the punishment would be confined to him as much as possible and his wife would not suffer; and an orphan would not be penalised because the drawer of the pension were in a State prison.  Will the Minister clarify the position for us?  I take it that otherwise this section is the same as the section in the previous Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this section will be governed by regulations made under it.  The cases the Deputy has mentioned are cases that will have to be dealt with by regulation. First of all, there will be a general regulation that one cannot draw benefit while residing outside the State, but of course a person drawing sickness benefit might be advised for instance to go outside the State for treatment and naturally that would be permissible.  There is another case which comes to mind in relation to members of the Defence Forces resident in the Six Countries who would be entitled to unemployment or sickness benefit after discharge from the Army; though technically speaking they are outside the State they would be entitled to draw benefit in such cases. In the case of a woman drawing maternity benefit, whose husband is in prison, regulations will be made to cover all cases of that kind.</P>

      <P>I have in mind two specific cases.  One is that of a woman whose husband was in Northern Ireland for a number of years.  He died there and she got either 10/- or 15/- a week pension.  Within the last few years the pension has been increased but she received no increase.  The Department responsible was written to and the reply was that the widow lived outside the State and was, therefore, not entitled to full benefit under the Act.  I think the Minister should investigate that matter.  In the second case the widow's husband died in England after having lived there for a number of years; she is getting a pension but it is not the full pension.</P>

      <P>There is an anomaly it might be well to bear in mind in connection with this Bill because this may be an opportune time to remedy it.  I came across cases where old people in Donegal, enfeebled through physical infirmity, found a home for themselves in an institution in Derry called the Nazareth Home.  They had qualified for old age pensions whilst living in Donegal.  This home was a convenient place for them to end their days and they were anxious to be admitted to it when vacancies arose.  When they were in the home for three months their old age pensions ceased because they had been living outside the State for three months.  That seems to me to carry punctilio to absurd extremes.</P>
      <P>I suggested that someone should take a bus down to Derry and bring these old people back to Donegal for a day so that they would not be continually absent for three months from Donegal. I do not know whether or not that was done.  In an administrative sense they are living outside the State but the fact remains that they are inside the the national territory.  Because we do not provide such a home for them in Donegal or elsewhere in the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Where an employer fails to stamp cards the onus is placed on the employee of taking that employer into court.  I think that is a great hardship on the employee.  I know cases where, having gone into court, the employers subsequently went into bankruptcy and were not able to pay.  In the Bankruptcy Court first preference was given to employees whose cards had been stamped.  The others were not able to succeed in getting stamped cards and they were debarred from drawing benefit.  I think that the onus in such a case should be placed on the State rather than on the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come across cases quite frequently where an employer does not stamp his workers cards.  The worker is entitled to bring civil proceedings to recover the benefit from the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that should be changed, and that it should be a summary proceeding brought by the Minister against the individual on the criminal side of the court, whereby the district justice could punish the employer as well as <Col N="1265" /> summarily ordering him to pay the benefit the worker was entitled to.  I certainly would be very strongly in favour of that.  I do not know that this is the Bill or the section to deal with that.  I am very strongly in favour of provisions whereby, if the wages to which a worker is entitled are not paid to him, recovery would be by way of summary proceedings in the District Court.  However, that does not arise here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It very often happens that an employer has not sufficient means to meet the demand of an employee, and so the employee suffers.  I think there should be a provision to the effect that it is the Department, and not the employee who should recover from the employer. Whatever chance the Department would have of collecting from an employer, in a great number of cases the employee would have very little chance of doing so if the employer is not a person of substantial means. Suppose he is a small farmer.  We all know it is very hard to get a farm sold out.  It would be very hard for an employee to get that done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) means that the Minister may again proceed in a civil way as if it were an ordinary contract debt.  In other words, the Minister would have to instruct the Chief State Solicitor to serve a civil process on the particular person.  That would be dealt with as an ordinary contract debt in the District Court.  Sub-section (3)  gives the Minister power to take proceedings against the person separately.  Instead of this money being recoverable by civil action, I would like to see it recoverable by summary proceedings, <Col N="1266" /> and that is why I am supporting Deputy Hickey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be all right if the employer were a person of substantial means.  But in two or three cases that I knew of the employers were bankrupts and, of course, the employee could not succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put the employer in jail if he did not pay up the benefit.  It is a strange thing that if you go to put him in jail, whether he is a bankrupt or not, you will get the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept all that, but what I suggest is to eliminate this civil procedure altogether and provide that, if there is any benefit due to a man, the Minister will proceed immediately, on being so satisfied, by summary proceedings in the District Court.  If say, I write to the Minister and refer him to these different sections in the Act, I will have a reply back from the Department referring me to the rights of my client under this section to sue.  I do not want that loophole there since it is such a serious thing not to stamp a man's cards.  I would make that a criminal offence to be dealt with summarily.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister not make regulations whereby, on payment of a certain contribution, the man can be brought in under some of these excluded benefits?

      <P>I want to explain.  Sub-section (2)  is dealing with a different matter.  Sub-section (2)  is dealing with a person who ceases to be an ordinary contributor and becomes a voluntary contributor.  As Deputies are aware, a person who ceases to be an ordinary contributor, even if he does not become a voluntary contributor, is entitled to benefits for some time.  They do not lapse immediately.  This sub-section (2)  is giving that right&mdash;that is, when he becomes a voluntary contributor he is not immediately cut off the other benefits; he continues to be entitled to these benefits for whatever length <Col N="1269" /> they are given to the ordinary contributor.</P>

What is the justification for cutting him off the <Col N="1271" /> benefits that he is entitled to?  Is it because his employer is no longer paying it and that he is paying it himself?

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the Minister checks on this he will find that there are more than that and more categories than that.  At one stage you had a situation in which the ceiling for national health insurance for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes was £250.  Then that was raised to £500.  Where persons went over a rate of £250 they were in this position: They were covered up to then.  Take a State servant, a clerical officer in the Department of Social Welfare.  That person was insured for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  When his salary went over £250 he ceased to be eligible for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes but he could exercise his right to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months of the date on which his salary went over £250 and, if he exercised that right, then he could become a voluntary contributor but that imposed upon him the responsibility of becoming a contributor under the National Health Insurance Act.  Under that Act, since he had no employer who was liable to pay contributions for him, he had to pay his own and the employer's contribution as well.  That made him a voluntary contributor and enabled him to stay in for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  If he were sick in <Col N="1272" /> such circumstances he would be entitled to draw national health insurance benefit in the ordinary way, and if he had three years' membership in that way he would be entitled to avail of the treatment benefits as well.  That situation continued and a number of people got into that category.  Then the ceiling was changed from £250 to £500 and that brought back a lot of these voluntary contributors under the ceiling of £500 and made them liable to compulsory insurance for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.</P>
      <P>A number of them also elected to remain as voluntary contributors under the National Health Insurance Acts and are still voluntary contributors under the National Health Insurance Acts by virtue of the fact that they became voluntary contributors in that period between the ceiling for insurance purposes being £250 and being raised to £500.  You have now got these categories and I want to find out where they stand in relation to Section 37.  You have the case of the voluntary contributor.  Again, take the clerical officer in the Department of Social Welfare.  You may have two of these people in the Department of Social Welfare and they may be in two different categories.  You may have one man who is a voluntary contributor, who paid his own contribution for national health insurance purposes and the employer's contribution and became a voluntary contributor then, as well, for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  You may have another person who was in that category but who, when the ceiling was raised from £250 to £500, decided that he would drop the voluntary side of national health insurance and become a compulsory insuree under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. These are two separate classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we will have another class in future.  We will have in future the case of a person who is covered by this Bill so long as his salary does not exceed £500 per annum and, if he is covered and builds up credits while he is under a salary ceiling of £500 per annum, and then goes above the £500 ceiling, he will be entitled to become a voluntary contributor.  There will <Col N="1273" /> then be a third category of voluntary contributor.  Will the Minister tell us where precisely these three categories stand under Section 37?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be all in the same position, voluntary contributors. The contribution will be ? per week and the only benefit to which they will be entitled will be widows' pension or orphan's pension, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister right in that.  Surely that is a sweeping way of dealing with it.  That is the attitude of saying: &ldquo;Get out of my way and do not bother me.  You are too small and not numerous enough to kick up a row.  Therefore, get out of my way.&rdquo;  They are not all in the same position.  We are dealing to-day with only two of these classes.  The third class cannot be born until the Bill becomes operative, and therefore you may say to that person: &ldquo;If you are coming in as a voluntary contributor under the Bill, you are coming in with the conditions written down there.  You need not become a voluntary contributor if you do not wish, and you need not pay if you do not wish, and you need not therefore pay to qualify for these benefits if you do not wish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one problem with which you can deal in a separate way, but there is another, the problem of the man who is a voluntary contributor at the moment, the man who is paying his own national health insurance contributions, the employer's contributions as well as his own, the man who has built up a vested interest in the funds of the national health insurance section of the Department, and who has an interest now in the treatment benefit provided at the moment and continued under this Bill.  Is it suggested that in the case of that man who has the right to-day to sickness benefit, maternity benefit and treatment allowance, under this Bill all these rights are to be swept away and he is to be told: &ldquo;You will not get any benefits except widows' and orphans' pensions, and all the credits which you have built up are credits which are going to be swept away&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a brutal way of dealing with a case such as that.  They <Col N="1274" /> may not be numerous people, but that is all the more reason why we should respect their rights.  This is not by any means an insoluble problem, but it should not be dealt with petulantly.</P>
    <P>We should try to understand their position and make an effort to meet it. I wonder whether the Minister in what he has said has correctly interpreted ever his own intention in respect of these people because he first assumed that there was only one category of voluntary contributors.  I have now told him of three&mdash;two actual and one possible.  The latter will not be born until the Bill is in operation and is in an entirely different category from the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill makes provision in itself for the voluntary contributor and the voluntary contributor is a person who has 156 unemployment contributions.  Contributions to the number of 156 have been paid in respect of him and he can, if he applies to the Minister in the prescribed manner, be deemed to be a voluntary contributor.  If so deemed, he pays ? per week and for that ? he is entitled to the benefits set out in Section 37.  In other words, he is entitled to benefits other than disability benefit, unemployment benefit, marriage benefit, maternity benefit or treatment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only reading what is in the section.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister may, in respect of a voluntary contributor, prescribe that, if he pays an additional contribution&mdash;although that is not set out, he nevertheless could do it&mdash;he may be entitled to any of the benefits&mdash; disability, unemployment, marriage, maternity or treatment benefit.  There <Col N="1275" /> is no trouble about that part of it&mdash;it is as clear as can be; but what Deputy Norton puts forward is that at the moment there are a number of voluntary contributors who do not come within the definition of voluntary contributor in this Bill.  They do not come within the machinery laid down in Section 4 for becoming a voluntary contributor.  The Minister may say that I have not studied the Bill to the extent which would enable me to be helpful in regard to it, but I should like to know if there is any other provision in the Bill whereby a voluntary contributor at the moment can be continued as a voluntary contributor.  It may be that there is no such provision in the Bill and, if not, I think it would be sufficient if the Minister indicated that he would have the point examined because, clearly, if there are voluntary contributors at the moment, who are contributing, they have some rights and it may be that when they see the provisions in the Bill, they may not wish to continue to be voluntary contributors, but there should be some short sub-section or section in the Bill whereby they would be for the purposes of the Bill, considered to be voluntary contributors.</P>

      <P>The Minister tells us that he will get only the widows' and orphans' pension.  In the case of a good many employments there will be men who will be put off at 65 on a certain pension&mdash;not a very liberal pension.  If they continue to pay their contributions to the national health insurance and unemployment insurance funds as they have been paying all along, plus the employer's contribution, is the Minister going to deny them the right to be insured persons, and if that is so, on what ground does he propose to cut them off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to have a scheme of social insurance except for those who are employed by another person&mdash;who are working for an employer. The case Deputy Hickey has in mind is the case of a man who becomes a self-employed person, and I am afraid we have to say in that case that he can no longer continue for all the benefits laid down.  He could continue as a voluntary contributor as we are discussing here and as is laid down here and he would be entitled to widows' pension and orphans' pension, or both.</P>
      <P>I did not contemplate, I must say, more than bringing the present voluntary contributors into that same category and see that for the future, at any rate, the only benefit they could draw would be widows' pensions or orphans' pensions.  Deputy Norton thinks that is unfair. Deputy Cowan wants to know if there is any way of dealing with it.  There is, I think, under Section 66 (2)  provision which would give power to deal with these present categories of voluntary contributors if we thought they were unfairly treated because it does deal with those who would suffer by the repeal of certain enactments.  Regulations can be made to deal with such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to recognise frankly that people have <Col N="1277" /> built up an interest as a result of being permitted and encouraged by the Department and the National Health Insurance Society to become voluntary contributors.  The Department even issued leaflets explaining to them how to become voluntary contributors, and explaining the benefits to them. Having accepted the Department's invitation to become voluntary contributors the only fair way of dealing with the situation is to give them the option.  Some of them do not get the option; the clerical officer will not get the option of getting in compulsorily.</P>
      <P>The obvious thing to do is to permit him to remain as a voluntary contributor for the purpose of this Bill and to permit anybody who has the right to become a voluntary contributor, as the Minister says in the future, for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes only, if you wish, by recognising the special rights of those who contributed. We should carry these.  There are only a few and the fewer there are, the sooner the programme will be disposed of and then anybody who is not now covered by national health in the future can only cover themselves for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes. For those who come in under this Bill it is an entirely new problem which will be dealt with under the regulations the Minister may make. Since these people have built up a vested interest by reason of their contributions, the Minister should frankly recognise the obligations to carry them.  There should be a frank statement that the rights of those limited number of voluntary contributors will be respected.</P>

When I was dealing with another Bill&mdash;the Social Welfare Bill of 1950&mdash;a point was raised then by the Opposition Party at the time that the decision in the future would be given by officers of the Department in appeal cases&mdash;that is, national health insurance appeal cases.  It was alleged that it was unfair, wrong and improper that officers of the Department should have to decide whether a person was entitled to national health insurance benefits in a particular case because the previous practice had been that it was decided by an appeals officer and subsequently by an arbitrator, both of whom were not on the pay-roll of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Court of Referees is constituted at the moment of representatives of the employers, representatives of the workers and an independent chairman. To that extent those going before the Court of Referees may feel that they have a fairer tribunal to adjudicate upon their case than that which is offered to them now.  To what extent will the decisions of the deciding officers encroach upon the work now discharged by the Court of Referees and how far will the independence of the chairman of the Court of Referees now be lessened by the deciding officers who will be on the Minister's pay-roll?</P>

      <P>I want to get the Minister's mind on this.  I contemplated the possibility of providing for what I am now about to mention.  So far under unemployment insurance legislation we have had an appeal board which was balanced, as it consisted of equal representation of workers and employers.  The court was presided over by an independent chairman who, although he need not necessarily be a legal man, in 95 per cent. of the cases was in fact a legal person.  That court of referees dealt with appeals against the disallowance of unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance benefit.  The advantage of that machinery will be obvious to anybody who remembers the circumstances in which the Unemployment Assistance Act was first introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> It was necessary at the time to create confidence in the machinery and for that purpose it was decided to have workers' and employers' representatives on the court of referees.  We are now getting away from that.  It stands only in respect of unemployment insurance legislation at the moment. We are now going over wholly to the scheme envisaged under the Children's Allowance Act and the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Act where you have referees who hear cases which have been dealt with at a lower level but where the referee is an official of the Department&mdash;although he has certain statutory powers&mdash;and he decides all the appeals submitted to him.  At one time the case was made for having assessors as well as deciding officers. The idea was to give an opportunity to the applicant whose educational qualifications did not enable him or her to make a good case to be assessed by somebody who knew his general pattern of life and the conditions in his employment and who would act as a kind of advocate for the person whose appeal was being heard by the court.  There is something to be said for that mode of procedure particularly if the man created confidence in the applicant that he would get a fair hunt before the appeals tribunal.  What is the Minister's mind on that?  Does he intend to do anything?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I have not considered that in detail at all.  It is obvious of course that the workers and employers will be asked for suggestions and that a panel will then be formed in that way.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the section broadly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with the fixing of places for the payment of benefit. It provides that certain benefits may be paid through the Post Office.  It is intended to continue the payment of the widows' and orphans' pensions benefits through the Post Office and national health and unemployment benefits as they are paid at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on this section a matter which, if it was proposed to remedy it, might be dealt with on the section.  At the present time there are a number of persons who are described as unestablished officers employed in the Post Office Department.  When sick they receive two-thirds of their pay less national health insurance benefit; in other words, let us for convenience sake assume they have £3 a week; two-thirds of their pay would amount to £2 a week: the amount to be deducted for national health insurance benefit would be £1 2s. 6d. from the £2 per week, and they would get the net sum of 17/6 per week which, with the 22/6 national health, would make £2 per week.  These figures are fictitious from the wages point of view but they serve to illustrate the case I have in mind.  Efforts have been made to induce the Post Office Department to pay those people the two-thirds pay while sick and to collect from the Department of Social Welfare or the National Health Insurance Society the amount of sickness benefit which was due to be paid by the Department or the society to the insured person.  But whenever solution was sought for the problem along those lines the attitude of the society and the Department was that the contract was with the insured person and that only he could receive the benefit payable under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arrangement which operates to-day in the Post Office is a very inconvenient one because if the person is sick, let us say this week, the Post Office assume that he will get 22/6 national health insurance benefit for the week whereas, in fact, he will get no national health insurance benefit at <Col N="1286" /> all this week.  He will get portion of it next week but the Post Office make the deduction this week on the assumption that the person concerned will get benefit from the Department of Social Welfare.  As I say, he will not get that benefit until the following week and the Department of Social Welfare say they cannot pay it over to the Post Office even if the Post Office pay him the equivalent in the first week in which he is sick.  That seems to be a stupid rigidity, in my opinion.  I think some power might be taken by the Minister to deal with a case of that kind so as to make the position much more flexible than it is at the moment. If, for instance, an insured person would say to the Minister by written authority: &ldquo;Pay my sickness benefit to somebody nominated by me, and you will satisfy my requirements,&rdquo; the Minister ought to be empowered to do so.  If he were so empowered, it would probably help in the solution of the particular problem to which I have adverted.  I would like the Minister to examine the matter to see if he could put into this section a clause to cover a situation of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very doubtful that it could be brought in under this section. However, I would like, first of all, to have the matter examined, but it appears doubtful that what the Deputy has suggested could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all?  When I made inquiries I was told that the difficulty lay in the fact that there was no provision for such a case, that the problem was not insoluble and that it could be dealt with in a measure of this type.</P>
