      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has any up-to-date records of figures of emigration from this country to Great Britain and America; and, if so, if he will convey them to the House.</P>

      <P>The currently available statistical records of migration into and out of the State have been fully described in the article &ldquo;Statistics of Emigration and Passenger Movement&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin,</i> June, 1951, pp. 76-84.  I have nothing to add to the information given in that article and in my replies to the question addressed to me by Deputy Hession on the 1st May, 1952, and the question addressed to me yesterday by Deputy D. Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the very great volume of emigration from the midlands to America at the present time not cause very grave concern to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and to that of the Government?</P>

      <P>The particulars asked for by the Deputy in respect of each cargo of wheat delivered in Irish ports in 1951 and 1952 are not available. I propose, however, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the average c.i.f. price of wheat imported from (a) United States of America, (b) Canada, (c) Australia, in each month of the period January, 1951 to September, 1952.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, with reference to the statement made by him on Thursday, 16th October, to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, (1) the particular aspects of the country's circumstances which have been made the subject of examination by experts or groups of experts; (2) upon which of these a report has been received; and (3) whether it is his intention to publish these reports immediately.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, with <Col N="200" /> reference to his statement to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, 16th October, he will give particulars of the special separate interests which, by reason of being considered to be directly concerned, (1) have already been furnished with the reports of experts, and (2) are intended to be so furnished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>During the latter half of 1951 a general appraisal of Ireland's industrial potential was carried out by American experts under the E.C.A. Technical Assistance Programme. The report which has been received deals with the industrial, financial and agricultural economy of the country.  The question of publishing the report is under examination in consultation with other Departments concerned.  There are no special separate interests concerned with the report which is of a general nature.</P>
      <P>The dollar export potential of a number of our industries has recently been examined by a group of United States experts engaged by Córas Tráchtála Teo.  The report made by the group includes a general survey of dollar export possibilities, an appraisal of certain industries and individual factories visited by the experts and certain suggestions for new industrial development.</P>
      <P>I have requested Córas Tráchtála Teo. to prepare for publication an edited version of the report omitting confidential information about individual firms.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála Teo. will convey the unabridged findings of the group to all the special interests directly concerned. Advantage was taken of the presence of this group to get them to examine the organisation and operation of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Their report is with the Minister for Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say when he expects publication of these reports will be made available generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="201" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it difficult to say.  The first report to which I referred is a very elaborate report, and if it had to be reprinted it would take some time, I think.  Consideration will be given possibly to some limited publication and of making some copies available to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider in the meantime making a copy of the report available in the Library for reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is in the custody of the Industrial Development Authority and they tell me that they are asking the observations of the different Departments of the Government on the publication of the report. Having regard to its contents, and following the receipt of the comments of the Departments, the question of publication will then be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he has received any reports as a result of the industrial and other surveys made under the technical assistance projects agreements with the United States; and, if so, whether he will make copies of such reports available to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports have been received in the case of certain surveys carried out under the E.C.A. technical assistance programme which was terminated at the beginning of this year. The degree or kind of publicity to be given to such reports must be determined in the light of the contents.  It is my intention generally to publish such reports, as well as reports of surveys financed out of the Technical Assistance Vote, as fully as is consonant with the necessity for preserving confidential information such as, for example, information about individual firms.  I will arrange that any material published will be placed in the Oireachtas Library for use of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, far from giving any confidential information concerning any particular firm, the Minister will agree that these reports, <Col N="202" /> even if they are on the present system of industrial organisation, should be published?  I take it that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The general intention is to publish.  I assumed that the Deputy's question related not merely to these reports on investigations carried out here by foreign experts but to reports which I have received from a group that went from this country to America under the E.C.A. technical assistance programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we likely to see the report which is stated to have been made by American experts on restrictive practices before the Second Reading of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such report.  There were, in the reports to which I have referred, some general comments about restrictive practices but no report on restrictive practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have the benefit of seeing these observations on general restrictive practices in advance of the Second Reading of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not undertake that.  Whatever publication is possible will be carried out as soon as it is feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And, if possible, before the Second Reading of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Bill relates only to one group of restrictive practices&mdash;restrictive practices in the sale of goods&mdash;and I do not think that these reports would have any bearing on the debate on that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the impression that has been conveyed to the public through the newspapers in the last two or three weeks.  As a matter of fact it has been played up in the daily papers that the Minister's case&mdash;I know this is not so&mdash;is based on the reports or comments of these American experts.  The Press, however, has so put it in the last two or three weeks that the Minister's intentions <Col N="203" /> in regard to this matter have been strengthened very considerably by the comments or reports made by these experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments to which I made reference related to restrictive practices generally and not merely to the sale of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, and naturally that is the reason why we are so anxious to get this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have seen the report of his own speech on this subject in which considerable publicity was given to the fact that he was rather startled by the observations of the Americans and that that was an impelling reason.  Perhaps it is.  All I want to do is to judge the Bill against the background of whatever observations these folk made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I made it quite clear that these observations were not directly related to the Bill and my own view is that the Bill deals only with one narrow section of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister undertake to re-read his own speech before we discuss the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will if the Deputy promises to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will. I will take very, very good care to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if any Government grant has been made available to a firm in Athy, County Laoighis, to establish an industry west of the Shannon or any offer been made; and, if so, the amount of such grant and its terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume this question refers to the administration of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  If so, I refer the Deputy to replies given on <Col N="204" /> April 2nd and May 21st, to similar questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply which the Minister has just given does not indicate whether this particular firm has got a substantial grant for the establishment of an industry west of the Shannon.  I have asked the Minister if it is a fact that a very substantial grant has been made by the Government to a firm in Athy for the establishment of this industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that Foras Tionscal has been set up as an independent authority.  I have nothing to do with its functions.  That body can give any grant it likes without coming to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister deny that this particular firm, of which he himself was a former director, has received £90,000 to establish an industry west of the Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has introduced a personal remark, I will go so far as to say that it is not true.  Let me be quite clear, I do not know whether the firm has made application. If it does make application I do not know what the decision of Foras Tionscal will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why the Banagher to Clara branch line is included in the list of Córas Iompair Éireann branch lines to be closed, and furnish details of the traffic and business, including passenger traffic, on this line, and if it is correct that business has improved on this service in recent years; and, further, if he will arrange to meet a deputation representative of clergy and others from Ferbane, Clara and Banagher.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the statutory functions formerly exercisable by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to branch railway lines were transferred by the Transport Act, 1950, to the Transport Tribunal established under that Act.  A notice appeared in the public Press on 18th October indicating that Córas Iompair Éireann have applied to the tribunal for an order authorising the permanent discontinuance of train services between Clara and Banagher and inviting any body of persons desirous of objecting to the making of such order to send their objections in writing to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it has been made impossible in this and other cases to work the branch lines at a profit because of the keen <Col N="206" /> competition carried out by the road freight and cartage section of the same company?  Is he aware that in this case the cream of the traffic in the last couple of years has been picked up by the road freight and cartage section and taken away from the rail section? Would this be allowed by any Government or body outside of a lunatic asylum?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the big differential between the price paid by the Dublin consumer for eggs and the price received by the producers, and in view of the fact that 8d. per dozen is considered a fair margin of profit for the wholesaler to cover the cost of collecting, grading, testing, packing and transport to the nearest British port, if he will state why the same profit should not be sufficient for bringing eggs to the Dublin consumer; and, further, if he will undertake to have the whole question referred to the Prices Advisory Body for a public investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence available to me does not disclose that the margin between the price paid to producers for eggs and the prices paid by consumers in Dublin is unreasonable. The Deputy refers to a margin of 8d. per dozen received by wholesale traders in respect of eggs exported to Great Britain, but apparently he overlooks the fact that eggs reach the consuming public through the retail traders, who also must be allowed a margin to cover their costs.  About ten months ago the Prices Advisory <Col N="208" /> Body inquired into the position and decided that neither wholesalers' nor retailers' margins were excessive.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is not proposed to request the Prices Advisory Body to hold a public investigation into the matter but it is, of course, open to that body to hold such an investigation if it considers that this course is warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total amount in a full year of the wage increases granted since 1st June, 1952, to persons employed in (a) the milling of wheat and (b) the manufacture of bread (exclusive of any increases paid to directors and higher executives by way of increased salaries, fees or allowances).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As to (a) of the Deputy's question regarding the wages of flour mill workers, the position is that the Labour Court has made certain recommendations for increases but I understand that these have not yet been accepted by the trade unions concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards (b) it is estimated that the cost in a full year of the increases granted to bakery workers following on the recommendation of the Labour Court on the 21st August, 1952, is approximately £225,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister supply us with a break-down of that figure of £200,000 which he has given as representing the increase in wages to the bakery workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is the increase in wages.  It represents an increase of 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in regard to the recent Orders made by him providing for an increase in the price of bread and flour the total increase which the consuming public will have to pay in a full year in respect of (a) 2 lb. loaves of bread, (b) other loaves of bread (including fancy bread) and (c) flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of a fairly liberal estimate of bread consumption and on the assumption that all bread is sold at the maximum price <Col N="210" /> prescribed, it is calculated that the extra amount to be paid by the public for bakers' bread as a result of the recent price increases may be about £337,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>From the information available it is not possible to state what proportion of the increase is attributable to the types of bread referred to at (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question.  As regards (c) of the question, I assume that the Deputy refers to flour used for home consumption.  On the assumption that all flour is sold by retail at the maximum prices prescribed, it is estimated that the recent increase in the price of flour may cost the consuming public a sum of approximately £100,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the estimate of the increased price for the consumption of bread cover fancy bread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It covers the batch loaf and the 1 lb. loaf, the ones affected by the recent prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fancy.  It has always been extremely difficult to calculate the quantity of fancy bread sold.  This question asks the Minister the total increase in respect of 2 lb. loaves and other loaves, including fancy bread.  Does the Minister's estimate include the fancy bread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, it is only batch bread and these loaves that are subject to price controls and on the assumption that the same number of loaves will be consumed and sold at the higher price fixed by Order, that is the effect of the increase in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So if you can get an estimate in respect of fancy bread that is sold, the estimate of increased cost would, in fact, be higher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better check on that.  Fancy bread covers a multitude of articles and there are some types of bread which are legally described as fancy bread which are subject to price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it clear that fancy bread is not included in the estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I authorised increases <Col N="211" /> in prices of two types of bread&mdash;the 1 lb. loaf and the 2 lb. batch loaf.  The effect of these increases in price would involve that additional payment on the public, if the same number of these loaves is consumed by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the price of flour has gone up, clearly the price of fancy bread has also gone up and clearly the public must pay more in respect of fancy bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the wholesale price of flour?  If so, that would not be correct.  The adjustment in the price of flour to bakers has been merely in order to get back from the bakers the difference between the extra receipts they will get from the higher price and the extra amount they will pay in wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not borne out by the figures the Minister has given. The Minister has said that the increase in wages amounts to £200,000, whereas the increase collected from the public was £330,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Two hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds was the increase in wages and £330,000 was the increase in the price of bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <P>The information given by the Deputy as to the precise location of these four proposals is so limited that I have difficulty in definitely identifying the roads to which he refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to No. (1) I can trace no previous representations from the <Col N="217" /> Deputy concerning this proposal which I assume is an accommodation road in the townland of Cloghernoosh &ldquo;leading from the county road near John Casey's cottage west to the road junction south of John P. Donoghue's house.&rdquo;  The unemployment position in the electoral division of Churchtown in which the above mentioned road is situated does not warrant a full-cost grant under minor employment schemes, but if the beneficiaries submit the proposal under the rural improvements scheme the matter will receive due consideration.</P>
    <P>I assume that proposal No. (2) refers to a road in the townlands of Cappanacuss West and Capparoe in the electoral division of Dromore, described as an accommodation road &ldquo;commencing at the county road at Capparoe and continuing east to Patrick Palmer's house.&rdquo;  An offer under the rural improvements scheme of a grant has now been made to the applicants through their representative, Mr. David Doran, towards the cost of repairing the road in question.</P>
    <P>No. (3) presumably refers to an accommodation and bog road in the townland of Gerah South &ldquo;leading west off the county road 30 perches south of the national school and continuing to the Killarney-Sneem county road 80 perches east of Gerah Bridge, with branch road leading south at Jeremiah Gallivan's house to Mary Mahony's house.&rdquo;  The applicants have not yet replied to an offer of a grant under the rural improvements scheme towards the cost of this work, which was issued to their representative, Mr. Philip Coffey, on the 5th August, 1952.</P>
    <P>With regard to No. (4) a number of applications have been received in respect of road works in the townland of Gortagown, and if the Deputy will furnish more precise particulars of the location of the road to which he refers, giving the names of some of the beneficiaries, I shall inform him of the position.  I may add, however, that road proposals in the electoral division of Tahilla can be considered only under the rural improvements scheme, to which beneficiaries are required to make a contribution.</P>

Anyone who was laid off with a length of service must not have the second qualification which is desirable.  As far as the second scheme is concerned, I know nothing whatever about it but if the borough corporation promotes any special employment scheme in the area the men laid off, if they are then on unemployment assistance, must take their chance with the men similarly unemployed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state in regard to the proposals for new health services outlined in his recent White Paper the total estimated cost of the proposed services showing the cost in respect of the services which it is proposed to make available to each of the following categories of persons enumerated in the White Paper: (1) lower income group (i.e. persons in the present public assistance class); (2) persons in the middle income group who are compulsorily insurable under <Col N="222" /> the Social Welfare Act, 1952, or dependents of such persons; (3) persons in the middle income group whose main income is derived from farming and whose rateable valuation does not exceed £50 or dependents of such persons; (4) persons in the middle income group whose family income does not exceed £600 a year, or dependents of such persons, and (5) persons not included in the above categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost of the new Health Services.  Details of the scheme will not be settled until discussions have been held with local authorities and other interested bodies. For the reasons given by me in reply to the previous question by the Deputy it will not be possible, even when the over-all cost has been determined, to give a reliable estimate as to the proportions of the cost which would be applicable to the different groups mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state in relation to the proposed health services outlined in the recent White Paper, the estimated number of maternity cases which will have to be dealt with in a year in respect of each of the following categories: (1) lower income group (i.e. persons in the present public assistance class); (2) persons in the middle income group who are compulsorily insurable under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, or dependents of such persons; (3) persons in the middle income group whose main income is derived from farming and whose rateable valuation does not exceed £50, or dependents of such persons; (4) persons in the middle income group whose family income does not exceed £600 a year or dependents of such persons and (5) persons not included in the above categories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average number of births per year is about 65,000.  For the reasons given by me in reply to a previous question by the Deputy together with the fact that statistics are not available regarding the birthrates among the different classes mentioned by the Deputy, it would not be possible for me to give a reliable <Col N="223" /> estimate as to the number of maternity cases which will have to be dealt with in each class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The one estimate I mentioned to the Deputy was that one-third of the population is in the lower income group.  It is possible that more than a third of the births is in the lower income group but I am not sure about that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been directed to the report published by the Medical Research Council of Ireland for 1951, in which it is stated that lack of money is preventing the council from undertaking any significant expansion in its research activities and if in view of the seriousness of this report and the increasing death-rate through cancer he will cause a full inquiry to be made into the needs of those engaged in cancer research, and ensure that ample funds will be made available for further continuous research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  The grants payable to the Medical Research Council were reviewed in September, 1951, and were substantially increased at that time, when I received a deputation from the council.</P>
      <P>The council are not at present engaged in cancer research.  It was agreed at the meeting with the representatives of the council last year that a proposal for cancer research which had been put forward was unlikely to be fruitful, on account of the necessarily restricted scale of such research which would be possible with the funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister was <Col N="227" /> recently at the opening of a new cancer clinic.  Does he propose to suspend all research work in connection with a disease for the treatment of which he opened a new clinic?  It seems retrograde.</P>

This salary scale has been increased recently and any temporary nurse who <Col N="228" /> is paid less than the minimum of the new scale may be granted an increase to bring her salary to the minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.  In order to ascertain it each local authority which maintains a hospital would be obliged to abstract from the valuation lists the valuations of all farmers who paid in whole or in part for their maintenance or for the maintenance of their dependants in the hospital during 1951.  This would involve a great deal of work and I am not satisfied that I would be justified in requesting local authorities to undertake it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last question, I have no power to order county managers to pay a certain rate or to charge a certain rate, but I think it is likely that they will adopt a uniform rate all over.  With regard to Deputy Mulcahy's question, I am meeting the local authorities in groups to discuss with them many matters arising out of the White Paper.  Some of these will be the provision of specialised clinics, the provision of hospital beds, etc., and the question of paying for people who have to go to hospitals outside a county.</P>

Following a recent discussion which I had with representatives of the Joint Committee of Management of Cork Sanatoria I am approaching the Waterford authority with a view to the reservation of a further 40 beds which will shortly be available in Ardkeen Chest Hospital for Cork patients.  In addition I have agreed to a proposal that the joint committee should negotiate for the acquisition of additional accommodation in Cork which might be used for the accommodation of tuberculosis patients pending the completion, in about two years' time, of the Regional Sanatorium at Glanmire.  By all of these means I am hopeful that within a few months Cork tuberculosis patients will be able to secure admission to a sanatorium without undue delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that allowances under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations payable to a woman in County Offaly in respect of two of her children have been reduced by the Offaly County Council, following the recent reduction in the rates of national health insurance; and, if so, whether this reduction is in accordance with the policy of his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the reference in the question to &ldquo;the recent reduction in the rates of national health <Col N="240" /> insurance&rdquo; is intended to refer to the increase in these rates.</P>
      <P>In the case of the two patients referred to by the Deputy the weekly amount of the allowance payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations is reduced by 18/- only in respect of the weekly amount of 24/- national health benefit received by each of these patients.  It is understood that prior to a recent re-assessment of the means of this family, no deduction was made in respect of the national health benefit payable to these patients.</P>
      <P>In calculating the amount of the allowance payable to a beneficiary under these regulations health authorities normally make an abatement in respect of any other income of the patient.  Where such abatement in full would cause hardship the health authority may exercise a discretion and waive the whole or a portion of the abatement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the action of the health authorities in a great many cases has resulted in depriving patients of the increase granted recently under the national health scheme?  Does he not consider that that is undesirable?  I think his intention and the intention of the House was that this increase should be made available to patients.  Will the Minister have the matter looked into?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been looked into Health authorities have been advised&mdash; all I can do is advise&mdash;that in my opinion they should get some increase as a result of the increase in the social welfare benefits &mdash; not the whole increase, but at least some increase. In this particular case it appears that it was a mere coincidence that the means were revalued at the same time these benefits came in.</P>

      <P>The Wexford County Council have decided to provide a new dispensary in New Ross, but firm proposals for the implementation of this decision have not yet been submitted to me.  As an immediate measure, however, in view of the very unsatisfactory condition of the existing dispensary, the local authority have rented a premises at Mary Street, New Ross, for five years; the repair and reconstruction of this building, which is necessary before it can be used as a dispensary, is at present being carried out.

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Suspension of Dental Benefits.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the serious inconvenience caused to insured persons by reason of the suspension of dental benefit; if he will state what steps have been taken to bring about a settlement of the dispute between his Department and the dentists, and how the matter now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the large number of fully paid-up members of the National Health Insurance Society who are entitled to dental benefits are not receiving these benefits; and, if so, if he will state the reason and if it is proposed at an early date to restore full dental treatment and benefits to insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that persons insured under the National Health Insurance Acts have been unable since the 1st April last to avail of dental benefit under the scheme of additional benefits administered by my Department. The reason for the suspension is that the dental profession, after negotiation, refused to provide their services unless they were permitted to &ldquo;contract out&rdquo; for the supply of dentures &mdash;that is to say, unless they were permitted to charge for dentures what, in many cases, would be their private practice fees.  I could not accept this principle as I am satisfied it would not be justifiable in a scheme of this kind to require insured persons to pay the additional fees required under such an arrangement.  In March last, in a final effort to keep dental benefit available, I offered the profession a further improvement on the fees, which had already been increased by me as recently as August, 1951, but <Col N="244" /> they decided to reject my proposals by what, I have been given to understand, was a very large majority. Since this rejection no steps have been taken to bring about a settlement of the dispute, and as the issue is a fundamental one I do not consider that any real progress can be made in reaching agreement until the dental profession withdraw their demand for &ldquo;contracting out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regret that in the circumstances it is not possible to provide dental treatment under the Department's scheme or to state when this benefit will again become available to insured persons.</P>
    <P>I should point out to Deputy Byrne that the National Health Insurance Society ceased to exist in 1950.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he be prepared, if the Dental Association agree, to submit this matter to independent arbitration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, in view of the fact that this dispute has continued for a long time, that the Minister will not submit the matter to arbitration and that it now looks as if the dispute will continue for a further prolonged period, would the Minister give favourable consideration to the question of paying to the insured persons the equivalent of what he previously paid to the dental profession in respect of the agreement which is now the subject of dispute.  In other words, the Minister's Department should not be making a profit, at the expense of the insured person, out of the dispute which exists between the Minister and the dental profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy gave a lot of thought to this because he was up against the same problem. The proposition he makes is, in fact, giving the dental profession what they are looking for&mdash;that is, getting a certain subvention and then charging what they like on top of that.  That is what they are looking for and it is entirely unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="245" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are obvious advantages to the dentists in having some kind of agreement with the Department, and clearly dentists ought to be reasonable in a matter of this kind because a comprehensive contract has considerable advantages for them.  But it is no consolation to folk who are suffering from dental defects to be told that this dispute is going on and that there is a matter of high policy involved.  This is no solace to toothless citizens or folks suffering from other dental ailments.  Would the Minister consider doing something to enable the insured population who are entitled to dental treatment to get some grant from the funds available for such treatment in order to enable them to attend to their dental defects which cannot be postponed indefinitely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that the only matter in dispute between the Department and the dentists is the price of dentures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if you like.  Under the old system there was a price laid down for dentures and the society, as is was then, or the Department now, usually paid half of that and the insured person paid the other half. Now the dentists want to give the person the option of &ldquo;contracting out&rdquo; for the supply of dentures.  In other words: &ldquo;If you pay more I will do as well for you as for a private patient.&rdquo;  We think they should do it in any case and we do not want this additional amount added on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty being entirely about dentures, do I understand that because of the difficulty with dentists about the price of dentures the Minister has deprived the ordinary people of the benefits to which they would normally be entitled in respect of treatment other than dentures, that is, has he deprived the ordinary people entitled to these benefits of these benefits in order to punish the dentists?</P>

      <P>Even if we approve that stand is it not obviously unfair to the unfortunate folk who need this treatment that if they do have the treatment they must now pay out of their own pockets?  Some of them are having the treatment but instead of the treatment being paid for as to half by the State under the national health insurance code they are having to pay it out of their own pockets.  Where they have done that surely there is a good case for refunding whatever the State would normally have paid because you are now compelling them to pay out of their own pockets.</P>

      <P>The conditions under which unemployment benefit is payable in this country in respect of contributions paid by an insured person in Great Britain are set out in an Order made by the Minister for Social Welfare on 25th March, 1949.  A copy of the Order, which is similar in form to the corresponding British Order, has been issued to every employment exchange and branch employment office in this country.  Detailed instructions in regard to the implementation of the arrangements have also been issued to every office.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the great interest taken in the adult education courses promoted by University College, Cork, and my Department has facilitated these courses in every way in its power and has co-operated to the full in regard to them.</P>
      <P>The history of the grant is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The first Government grant was given in 1949-50 and was £1,700.</P>
      <P>In 1950-51 it was increased to £2,500 and has remained since at that figure.</P>
      <P>In 1951-52, however, University College, Cork, found that it had incurred up to then a deficit of about £1,500 on the courses, and the Government was requested to provide £1,500 extra in 1952-53 to cover this deficit.</P>
      <P>This the Government agreed to do, and at the same time the President of University College, Cork, was notified that &ldquo;the additional funds [i.e., the £1,500 over and above the normal £2,500] are for the sole purpose of clearing the deficit to date&rdquo;, that the Government could not accept responsibility for any future deficits and so that the grant for future years could not again exceed £2,500.</P>
      <P>From the beginning, therefore, the grant to University College, Cork, has been the exact sum requested.  The extra £1,500 provided this year is to liquidate a debt for the incurring of which the Government had no responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is therefore not a fact that the Government grant towards these courses has been reduced.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has received memorials from citizens of Dublin requesting an alteration of the present school hours, which now involve a visit to the schools four times per day by the parents to accompany their children under eight years of age to and from the school for safety reasons, and, if so, if he will state if it is proposed to meet the request for the shorter day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received two such memorials recently.  The minimum period of attendance at school for secular instruction is four hours per day but in the case of children enrolled in infants' classes or in first standard&mdash; generally children up to the age of eight years&mdash;this period may be reduced to three hours.  These periods are not unduly long when regard is had to the breaks allowed at the end of each hour of instruction and to the vacation arrangements for these schools.  I do not, therefore, propose to make any alteration in the minimum periods of attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to these requirements, the arrangement of the time-tables in <Col N="272" /> national schools is a matter for the managers and it is open to the manager of a school to arrange the time-table so that the school day shall consist of one meeting with an interval for recreation of half an hour or longer, but not as a rule exceeding one hour; or he may arrange to have a school day of two meetings with an interval of more than an hour between the meetings.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many parents prefer the dual-day arrangement as it affords the children an opportunity of having a hot mid-day meal at home but that others favour the one-meeting school day with a short interval for recreation. In these circumstances, it would obviously not be possible to devise any arrangement which would be acceptable to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that memorials have been presented to his Department requesting that, in the case of smaller children, mothers should not have to go to the schools four times a day, especially during wet weather?  There was one day last week on which the children were brought home at 12.30.  They were supposed to go back at 2 o'clock, but they were drenched by the time they got home and they had to be put to bed.  Having regard to these circumstances, could the Minister not arrange that the school day should consist of one meeting, say from 9.30 to 12.30 or 1 o'clock, with half an hour's break for young children?  Many schools are doing that with great satisfaction at the moment.  I think the House will agree that it is most unreasonable to expect housewives to go backwards and forwards to school four times a day with their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that it is mainly a matter for the managers of schools to arrange the school day?  My own experience inclines me to the belief that one meeting is the better arrangement.  Nevertheless, there are differences of opinion.  For instance, the City Medical Officer of Health reported for the year 1949: &ldquo;The longer mid-day interval, permitting teachers and children to go home to dinner, was introduced because of wartime restrictions. Yet it is one of the greatest measures adopted for improving the <Col N="273" /> nation's health.&rdquo;  That is another point of view.  My own view is different, but it is entirely a matter for the manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has any proposition under consideration to alleviate the impact on the small dwellings acquisition loans of the increase in the rate of interest on advances from the local loans fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 99, 100, 101 and 102 together.  The making of advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and the rate of interest to be charged on such advances to individual borrowers are matters for the local authorities, subject to Section 40 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, which provides that the rate of interest shall not exceed a ½ per cent. per annum in excess of the rate at which the local authority borrows for the purpose of making the advances. Where local authorities borrow from the local loans fund, the rate to be charged by them must be related to the rate for issues from the fund. Since the announcement of the variation of the interest rate, representations have been received by me regarding the position of local authorities and borrowers in respect of commitments of the nature referred to in some of the questions under reply.  In <Col N="277" /> order to enable me to examine this position generally, I have requested the housing authorities to furnish specific information as to the amount represented by these commitments in each housing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether, as a matter of principle, he will permit local authorities to grant the loans at the former rate of interest where application was made for the loan prior to the date of the announcement of the higher rate of interest? If he could do that it would relieve the considerable anxiety which is now being felt by persons who may have to borrow money at a rate of interest outside their capacity to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have issued a circular to all local authorities as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to state that, following the issue of this Department's circular letter of the 3rd instant, notifying the giving by the Minister for Finance of a direction under the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, increasing the rate of interest on issues from the fund made on or after 6th October, 1952, for the purpose of financing advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, representations have been received from a number of housing authorities, and from persons directly concerned, regarding the position of housing authorities and the borrowers where advances under the Acts have been granted or promised at the old rate of interest.</P>
      <P>In order to enable the matter to be examined generally, I am to request you to furnish a certificate of the amount, not met by issues made before the 6th instant from the Local Loans Fund, which is represented by any such undertakings given before the 6th instant, where binding commitments had been entered into before that date for the erection or purchasing of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In notifying allocations of advances financed from the Local Loans Fund, some local authorities already make it clear to the borrowers that the rate of interest will be governed by that at which the amount of each advance was issued from the Fund. <Col N="278" /> It is desirable that this practice should be adopted generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I can say is that when these local authorities have submitted whatever information they have, all the facts and particulars, then, in consultation with my colleague who has agreed to treat sympathetically all applications where there is evidence that a commitment was entered into prior to the announcement of the higher rate, I will decide the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister regard as a commitment a provisional sanction for a loan?  Would he say also when he hopes to be able to give a firm decision on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>So many different types of case are sure to arise because of the different practices followed by local bodies that it would not be safe or wise at all to give an assurance in advance as to what would be regarded as a commitment.  The assurance which I have given to the local bodies and to the House is that when these bodies have given the information which they think should be furnished as a result of this circular the facts and circumstances will be examined on the basis I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister would agree that in a case where a deposit had been paid to a builder and an assurance given by the local authority to the applicant that a certain amount of money would be forthcoming by way of loan, that at least would constitute a commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that if I said that this would be taken or that would be taken, I would be induced to cover all the factors which would weigh with me and my Department in determining the issue.  I can only repeat here that a case where there was evidence of a fairly binding contractual obligation between the individual borrower and the council would be sympathetically treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the way the Minister is putting it.  The Minister is talking about a case where the person and the local council had a contract, but he is not taking into consideration a case where a person received a pamphlet on the Small Dwellings Act and entered into a contract to buy a site from a builder; he had not applied to the council for a loan but had prepared his plans.  Surely that unfortunate individual is not to lose his deposit of anything from £100 to £300?</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.  The allegations in the circular are a repetition of allegations brought to the notice of the Department on 28th May last.  Following a comprehensive and impartial investigation by senior officers of my Department, these allegations were found to be unwarranted.  Quite apart from this fact I would like to say that long before 28th May, Mr. O'Leary had several times come under serious disciplinary notice, commencing as far back as 1947, during the service of a previous postmaster.  In fact, on April 30th of this year I had deemed it necessary to direct that he be given an absolutely final warning of dismissal. Despite this warning he came under serious notice in May&mdash;still before the allegations were brought to the notice of the Department&mdash;and my Department recommended to me that he be dismissed.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 143, 144 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to an announcement that a large quantity of barley had been exported from Great Britain to the Continent, verbal representations were made to my Department that a continental export market existed for <Col N="292" /> malting barley.  No satisfactory evidence was furnished, however, as to the price obtainable abroad or the price likely to be payable to growers in this country in respect of any barley which might be exported.  Even if a price of 75/- per barrel were obtainable abroad, growers could not expect to receive more than 55/- per barrel when account is taken of cost of collection, drying, delivery to place of export, transport to the Continent and other incidentals, including a profit margin for the exporter.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that it will be necessary this year to provide a substantial quantity of imported grain to supplement home production of animal feeding stuffs and that the price which must be charged to feeders for this grain is higher than any price likely to be obtained by growers for barley for export.  As long as this position lasts, I can see no reason for permitting the export of barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a farmer in North County Dublin was offered 70/- a barrel, ex-barn, on condition that the purchaser would be permitted to export it as malting barley and that he applied on four successive days to the Department of Agriculture for a licence to export on that basis and was refused?  Surely the Minister will agree that if a malting price were obtainable for our barley abroad it would be wise and prudent to sell barley of malting quality in the malt market and, if necessary, use the proceeds to buy feeding barley or any other feeding grain that was necessary at a much lower price in whatever was the most advantageous market, but that it is altogether wrong artificially to depress the price of malting barley so as to force it into the feeding barley market?</P>

If the factor was such a fool as to pay the farmer too much, why should not the Department have said: &ldquo;Certainly, if the farmer is going to get 70/- from anybody we will give him every facility.&rdquo;</P>

The qualifications of the persons appointed are that they have experience of the various branches of the potato industry.  The first directors of the company were appointed by my predecessor in consultation with the Irish Potato Marketing Association; the two official nominees were likewise appointed by him, and a vacancy in the latter has been filled by an appointment made by me.

In regard to the cases of applicants who wish my Department to do the work for them, I am aware that a number of farmers in all counties, who have applied to have reclamation work on their holdings carried out by the Department, are anxious to have the work attended to at an early date. Work is being pushed forward as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the practical limitations arising from the development of the operations of the land project generally and to the rate at which it is possible for the available staff to plan schemes of work for execution by machinery.</P>

      <P>As regards (1) and (2) in question No. 153, it is not the practice to supply information relating to the trading of any individual concern.  As regards the reference to the restriction in milk supplies to the firm mentioned, the position is that, with a view to conserving essential supplies of milk for butter manufacture which must, of course, have priority, this firm, in common with other manufacturers of chocolate crumb, was restricted in the quantity of milk which they could use during the current season.  The Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate that it is only such quantities of milk as can be spared from butter-making from time to time that are allocated to the manufacturers of chocolate crumb.  Following the receipt of representations on behalf of the firm that they were running short of milk supplies for the requirements of their home trade in chocolate, I arranged to allow the firm the extra quantity of milk which they requested.  So far as I am aware, therefore, the question of unemployment to which the Deputy refers does not arise.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, however, the manufacture of chocolate crumb being seasonal, there is always some disemployment of workers during the winter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a) to delete the figures &ldquo;1953&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1955&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I covered pretty well yesterday all that I intended to say on this.  Briefly, my argument in favour of the amendment is that this imposition on lorry owners has been inadequately considered. The increased taxes in some cases would appear to be reasonable. In other cases the increase is far too steep.  In still other cases we are apparently facing up as a matter of national policy to the continued use of our roads by very heavy lorries carrying merchandise which would just as well and to greater national advantage be carried on the railways.</P>
      <P>This Financial Resolution does not appear to have considered in all its implications what our future transport policy should be.  I think it is a mistake for us, a small community such as we are, to be spending very large sums of money in endeavouring to make roads in the character of fortifications to carry enormous lorries, when the traffic which is conveyed in those lorries could as easily be transported over the traffic-starved railway that we have.  In my view, our policy should be designed to keep that exceptionally large lorry off the road, because our resources are not such as to permit us to provide the type of road that that lorry needs if it is to continue to operate throughout the country.  It would be far better policy for us to allow all that heavy traffic, now carried in very heavy lorries for which our roads were never intended, to be carried by the railways instead.  If there is to be an increase in respect of other lorries, then it ought to be an increase which is related to the capacity of the lorry owners to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Financial Resolution No. 2 I think the Minister has been unfair in the amount of the increase which he is imposing on lorry owners who employ men or earn a livelihood in the transport of goods from place to place.  I think one of the inevitable results of <Col N="308" /> Financial Resolution No. 2 will be to lay off a number of persons who now find employment as lorry drivers, helpers and loaders.  In a motion of this kind it will show itself in lesser employment in the transportation of goods through the medium of the privately owned lorry.</P>
    <P>One has got to recognise that in many rural areas firms employ a large number of lorries for the transport of their own goods.  They provide employment that might not otherwise be provided in that area.  If the effect of the new taxes is to impose upon them very heavy financial burdens the real danger will be that it will result in the curtailment of employment and the sentencing of many people, who have regular employment in the transport service, to go to the labour exchange instead.</P>
    <P>I think this matter might have been approached in a way that would equate the burdens to the capacity of the people who bear them but that does not seem to have been done in this instance.  Not only are we imposing very heavy burdens but apparently we are imposing them more from the standpoint of getting the money than with any regard to the capacity of the persons concerned to pay.  I think the burden is a very heavy one and an unfair one.  Whatever was wanted might have been got by other methods or by a better adjustment of whatever taxation problems the Minister had in mind.</P>
    <P>The most unfair aspect of Financial Resolution No. 2 is the crippling burden it will put on taxi owners and hackney owners and their helpers. Employment in that capacity does not yield a high standard of living at present and to impose these new taxation burdens on hackney owners and taxi owners is unfair to them.  It will inevitably result in less employment being provided in these two agencies of employment as we know them to-day.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to get anything more from that section then, as I said yesterday, he ought to go out after those people who managed to get a public service vehicle licence and want to use their vehicle for purely private purposes or merely to use the vehicle <Col N="309" /> to skim off from the normal taximan or the normal hackney owner the creamy traffic which they take in their own time and on their own terms.  In present circumstances, having regard to the increased cost of living, the increased cost of petrol and the increased cost of repairs, it is unfair to those taxi owners and hackney owners, whose sole asset is a motor car which they own for the time being, that they should be asked to carry a burden of the kind contemplated in Financial Resolution No. 2.</P>
    <P>This matter has been inadequately considered.  I will not vote against the motion because there is no alternative, but the Government would be wiser if they took back the whole matter for reconsideration, approached it in a more realistic manner than they have done and approached it with some regard to the capacity of those concerned to carry the burden which this Resolution will impose on their shoulders.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister would be able, before we proceed further with the discussion of this Resolution, to give some indication to the House of the total amount that the Resolution will impose by way of additional burden on Córas Iompair Éireann?  It seems to me that it would be a relevant consideration.  I do not know if the Minister has considered that aspect and would be in a position to indicate the total amount which the Resolution will impose on Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not know if the Minister has heard the question I have put to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but I have to assume that this Resolution will impose a very substantial additional burden on Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think that this is a matter which should be considered in deciding <Col N="310" /> whether the Resolution, as it stands, should receive the support of the House or not.</P>
      <P>We have recently learned that Córas Iompair Éireann, as a result of requests made by the Government for economy, dismissed a great many of their employees, both on the road transport side and on the railways, and that in a great many instances bus services in the City of Dublin have been curtailed for economy reasons.  I think something like 500 or 600 employees were dismissed or suspended from the various Córas Iompair Éireann works in the City of Dublin, and that, in addition, a number of branch lines have been closed down throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at question time to-day, emphasised that the Government had no responsibility for this.  Of course, there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with butter.  It seems to me that one effective way of ensuring the dismissal of more men at present in employment by Córas Iompair Éireann, of ensuring the further curtailment of bus services in the City of Dublin, and of ensuring the cutting off of branch lines, is to impose an additional burden on Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the passing of this Resolution will impose a burden of £100,000, £200,000 or £300,000 on Córas Iompair Éireann, which is already in a very shaky condition, but I do know that every additional taxation which this Resolution imposes on Córas Iompair Éireann will result in the further disemployment of Córas Iompair Éireann employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the exact effect of these additional duties on the financial position of Córas Iompair Éireann is a very relevant consideration.  Does it mean, in fact, that the House is being asked to pass a resolution which will result in further unemployment and will we be told then, possibly in a month's time or in two months' time, when the question is raised in the Dáil, that the Government has no responsibility, that any additional disemployment which is caused is due to the fact that the House passed a resolution which <Col N="311" /> imposed a higher burden on the company?  I would, therefore, ask the Minister, as soon as he can get the figures, to inform the House of the total additional burden that this Resolution will impose on Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think that probably the ordinary motorist is able to bear a certain degree of additional taxation.  If additional has to be raised probably the ordinary motorist is as good a mark as any other section of the community, but we should be extremely careful when imposing additional taxation on motor cars, lorries, vans and so on that we do not, firstly, cause additional unemployment and, secondly, increase the cost of living.  I know that if you take it fractionally, the additional tax imposed may appear to be small when you relate it to the quantity of goods carried, but I also know that every additional increase in the cost of transport or in the cost of raw material or in taxation has general repercussions and that in the end the consumer is faced with a much larger bill than the actual cost of the particular increase. We had it to-day at question time with regard to the cost of bread and flour. We were told that that was due to the fact that the workers had received an increase of wages.  Ultimately, however, it transpired that £100,000 was being collected, not by the workers but by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should like to have some indication as to the effect which the passing of the Resolution will have on the price of commodities which have to be transported; how far it is likely to affect prices, particularly in the country, because, presumably, the price of goods to be transported some distance will be increased.  Under cover of any increase that takes place in the country districts it will be found also that prices in Dublin will be increased, without possibly the same justification. The Minister was asked yesterday by Deputy Mulcahy, I think, whether he would give an undertaking that the money sought would be used exclusively for roads.  I do not think the Minister gave that undertaking.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is doing everything at the moment except giving the assurance. Will the Minister give an assurance now that every penny and pound of that money will be used for the roads? Any hesitation to give that assurance on the part of the Minister, I take it, is an indication that the money is being raised, not for the purpose of the roads, but for other purposes.  We have also been asked from the Government Benches, I think by Deputy Cunningham, who made, if I may say so, a very reasoned speech on the question, to make suggestions as to alternative sources of revenue.  I do not think that that responsibility rests on us.  But, so far as £100,000 or £150,000 is concerned, there is one source to which I will point immediately and that is the tax on dance-hall proprietors that was removed.  I do not think that that tax had any effect on the cost of living.  I do not think that that tax would result in the dismissal of people from their employment, whereas the present tax, unless I am mistaken, will undoubtedly result in further unemployment among Córas Iompair Éireann and other transport workers throughout the country and probably a further curtailment of the transport system in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might make this submission for the consideration of the Government in regard to the transport position.  One of the dangers of the present policy in regard to transport is that there will be strong public agitation and reaction against Córas Iompair Éireann.  It has already developed.  There will be in Dublin a strong and not unreasonable agitation that the Dublin transport should be taken away from Córas Iompair Éireann and placed under municipal control.  These matters should be taken into account.  A very strong case could be made for that to-day and the more <Col N="313" /> uneconomic Córas Iompair Éireann becomes, the more it is forced by the Government and this House through economic circumstances to curtail its services, to disemploy men, to do things which are unpopular, the more agitation for the control of the Dublin transport, or the paying end of it, by the corporation will develop.</P>
    <P>I should also like to join in what has been said by Deputy Norton in regard to hackney owners.  I have tabled an amendment to deal with that position.  I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment.  I am not saying that the amendment is an ideal one.  I drafted it yesterday in a hurry.  But, if any other form of amendment would meet his view or would be acceptable to him, I would be prepared to alter the amendment which I have tabled in order to meet any technical objections he might have.</P>
    <P>I think it is unsatisfactory that taxation of this kind should be raised in this indirect method throughout the year.  We should have an annual Budget and we should try then to impose any additional taxes which have to be imposed.  We should deal with the whole financial business of the State at one time and not take it piecemeal later.  It is unsatisfactory to have a prolonged discussion on all these questions at a later period and is not a satisfactory way of considering the over-all economic position of the State.  For these reasons, unless the Minister can make a very strong case in regard to it, I could not support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should intervene in this discussion for a short period.  It was my intention to speak on Resolution No. 1 if it were not for the manner in which the House was obliged to dispose of it.  It would not be in order for me to deal now with any of the arguments advanced on that Resolution, but another occasion will arise when that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I have regarded the discussion here as a very peculiar kind of debate, and I have listened to a good many debates in this House for a long number of years.  I could well understand <Col N="314" /> the Opposition tactics when this matter was moved here yesterday. There was obviously an effort on their part to engender a good deal of heat into our discussions on the effect of these two Resolutions But the one thing that amazed me was the ineffectiveness of those Deputies who addressed themselves to the matters with which the Resolutions dealt to make anything approaching a case that would justify all the heat and thunder that they displayed here.</P>
    <P>Let us come down to examine this matter carefully and objectively.  A number of questions have been addressed to me here in which I am asked to give assurances and to supply information of one kind or another, and as far as I can&mdash;I know I will not be able to deal with them all &mdash; I will give any information I have got.  I will give any assurance that is reasonable and practicable, and I think I will be able to make not only a reasonable case but an excellent case for the proposals that are outlined here and covered by these Resolutions.</P>
    <P>I happen to be Minister for Local Government, and there is no day on which this Dáil meets that questions are not addressed to me by one Deputy or another as to the condition of our roads, asking me to make grants for the relief of unemployment, asking me to make additional grants for the improvement of tourist roads and roads opening up areas that would be valuable from a tourist point of view.  All these things would create employment for our people where employment is needed, and there are only two sources from which the moneys that go to make and to repair and maintain our roads have come in the past, and I suppose, will come in the future.  Those two sources are the rates that are struck by the county councils and other local bodies, and the grants that are made available from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement I gave a clear picture of how the Road Fund was created, how it grew up and, if you like, generally how it was treated by all the Governments in this part of Ireland for the last 30 years.  I mentioned the fact that the last review of motor taxation in this country was as far back as 1926.  I mentioned also <Col N="315" /> that the cost of making a mile of road now is two and a half times what it was in 1939.  I gave a number of arguments to show that if we are serious in our desire, first of all, to improve our roads, and, secondly, to create the greatest amount of employment in the reconditioning and in the maintenance of our roads, we must provide the ways and means &mdash; that is the money by which that work is to be undertaken.  I am not going to say here that it is a pleasant thing to come along and make this imposition upon all the classes that are covered by these two Resolutions &mdash; the people who take out driving licences, the people who have a small private car, the people who use a commercial van, the people who are hackneymen, the people who are taximen, the people who have commercial vehicles, the commercial vehicles employed by industrial concerns of one kind or another, by Córas Iompair Éireann, and so on.  I am not contending that it is a pleasant thing to have to come forward in this House with the announcement of these increases, knowing, and of course accepting, if you like, that criticism of the kind that was levelled here at these proposals yesterday and was levelled here to-day, would be levelled against them. But since we all have to admit that the two sources I have mentioned appear to be, as they have been for the last 30 years, the only sources from which our roads can be improved and maintained, then is it not natural that we should look now to those sources and see whether or not those two contributors, or to see which, if any, of those two contributors, should increase their contributions to the general pool?  The rates struck by county councils for the maintenance and improvement of roads have been doubled since 1939.  The taxation being paid by commercial vehicles and, in fact, by all vehicles with the exception of private cars is exactly the same since 1926.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that, too, very easily.  Is there any Deputy <Col N="316" /> in this House or is there any Deputy who is also a member of a county council, knowing the facts, knowing that we have in this country 34,000 miles of our county roads unsurfaced and untarred, that we still have almost 2,000 miles of our main roads untarred, who will say that, having regard to the fact that the rates have increased for the making and maintenance of our roads by 100 per cent. since 1939, that it is fair and equitable that the vehicles most in need of the roads and that have caused most damage and have necessitated all this expense, or most of it, should be allowed to remain at the rates of duty fixed when the prices were as they were in 1926?</P>
      <P>I do not suppose anything I say will induce Deputies to see this matter in a reasonable way.  All the assurance I can give to those Deputies who have requested me to give information as to what my attitude will be and as to the purpose to which this money, when collected, will be applied is my own performance since I became Minister for Local Government.  That performance is that every single penny that came into the Road Fund since I became Minister has, for the first time in a considerable number of years, gone in grants to local authorities for the making of roads, and all I can do is to ask the House to regard that performance as an indication of what I will endeavour to secure so far as this fund, the roads of the country and the grants paid out of this fund to local authorities for the purposes here stated are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's opportunity will come.  I am dealing now with resolutions I am presenting to the House which impose taxation and the result of which will go into a road fund which has been there for almost 30 years.  I have stated here that, for the <Col N="317" /> first time in a great many years, I have persuaded the Minister for Finance and the Government, in spite of the need for money so far as the Minister is concerned, to let that fund be used for the purpose for which it was created, and I am coming to the House not only to say that, so long as I am Minister for Local Government, that will be my attitude but to ask the House to go still further, because of the picture I have painted, and to make it possible for me to deal, not with £3,500,000 next year, but with £4,500,000, so that the 34,000 miles of county roads and the 2,000 miles of main roads and all the other roads in the country which are calling out for improvement from every source will be tackled and that, although they will not be completed in a year or two, there will be a progressive approach to seeing the necessary work done.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that when one comes into this House with proposals of this nature&mdash;it is only proper that it should be so&mdash;one is going to be attacked from every corner.  Deputy MacBride has asked me what will the implementation of this Resolution mean to Córas Iompair Éireann, and when I deal with his request for information by giving it to him so far as I can, together with my own slant on the criticism he offered, it will help to show the different ways we have of looking at things.  The amount which this will cost Córas Iompair Éireann, so far as I know, will be between £70,000 and £90,000 a year.  I suppose that, in one sense, a case could be made that there is not apparently much purpose in taxing the vehicles of a nationalised concern which is and has to be heavily subsidised.  I can see quite clearly that that argument can be very forcibly advanced, but I have a different way of looking at it. My belief is that if a state organisation, a nationalised concern like this, must receive a subsidy from the Exchequer, it should not receive any hidden subsidies, that it should be open and above board and that it should not, by being excluded from the operation of increases mentioned in this proposal be given an advantage over its competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a proper approach, but it does not mean that members of <Col N="318" /> the Government did not hold a different view.  We all can have different views on a matter of that kind, and I have no doubt that if I came in here with proposals which excluded Córas Iompair Éireann and the vehicles used by Córas Iompair Éireann, I would be accused of favouring this nationalised concern, of paying to a nationalised concern this indirect subsidy.  Some Deputies would in some way or other try to tie this up with certain proposals made recently by the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, and the whole picture would be painted so as to show that we were all deliberately set on conferring benefits, direct and indirect, on this nationalised concern.  I have deliberately sought a decision to include Córas Iompair Eireann in the payment of the tax, so as to show that they and all users of the road, because there are other users, must bear their share.  The State also makes use of the roads, and not only did I persuade the Government to ask Córas Iompair Éireann to meet its commitments in this regard, but I persuaded them to pay the tax into the Road Fund on the vehicles used by the State.  I did that for the purpose of being able to come to the House to present proposals which should satisfy any reasonable man that they represented a genuine attempt on my part to build up a fund which would meet, over a reasonable space of time, the demands being made, and legitimately made, here and outside by local authorities all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I might.  Deputy Norton took me to task, because, as he alleged, <Col N="319" /> this matter had not been properly considered. While he approved of some of the proposals, he was doubtful of the wisdom of implementing the over-all proposals contained here.  Deputy Keyes had the same sort of view to express.</P>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Norton that these proposals have been very carefully considered.  They are the result of examination of this whole question by an inter-Departmental Committee, the report of which I have very carefully studied.  What is outlined here has had consideration, examination and discussion by the Government. What we in the Department were aiming at, what we thought we would get, as an addition to the Road Fund was in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000. Our approach to getting a figure of that size was that we would try to get it by doing the least injury and causing the least hardship to those who could least afford it.</P>
      <P>If you take the case that is made here, the case that was made to me by private car owners, the case that was made to me by hackney and taxi owners, the case that was made to me by lorry owners, the case that was made to me by the representatives of the motor trade all over the country, and if you examine our proposals here, having regard to what we set out to achieve and what we are convinced is necessary, you will find that there is nothing unreasonable in them.</P>
      <P>Much emphasis has been laid on the case for the hackney owner and the taxi owner.  Deputies appear to forget that, from the day on which motor taxation was introduced, the hackney owner and taxi owner paid exactly the same rate of duty as the private car owner up to the year 1947-48.  In that year the rate of tax paid by private car owners was increased by about 50 per cent., and, because of the conditions operating at the time, it was decided, until normal conditions were restored, to exclude taxi and hackney car owners from the effect of that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit that once you give a concession to any class <Col N="320" /> of people, it is only natural that they will try to retain it.  The facts are as I have stated.  In 1947-48 an assurance of some kind seems to have been given to private car owners that the 50 per cent. increase then imposed would be removed later and how would Members of the House think I could justify, not only refusing to remove that 50 per cent. increase, but putting an additional increase of £1 on certain types of car and £2 on another while at the same time ignoring the fact that there were two classes that had been treated very exceptionally a few years previously that were not being asked to pay anything in addition, although the maintenance of roads meant more to them than to anybody else?</P>
    <P>There was another consideration that had to be taken into account and which I did take into account.  Deputies have stressed the importance of the hackney car owner and have emphasised the important part he plays in the life of the country.  Deputies, those who represent rural constituencies especially, must be aware that since petrol, cars and tyres have come on the market freely, since controls were removed from the issue of hackney licences, all sorts of people have purchased cars and have taken out hackney licences at a cheaper rate and have not made and do not mean to make those cars available for hackney purposes.  There is no Deputy who does not know that what I am saying is true.  The concession that was given in 1947, which was designed to help hackney owners to carry on their business and to make a living in the special circumstances that existed, is now being abused.  While I realise that any section of the community will struggle to maintain a concession such as I have referred to, as far as hackney owners are concerned I can say that that concession is being abused in a wholesale fashion.  That was an additional reason for removing the concession that they had enjoyed in the last three or four years.  If it had not been for the fact that these classes were excluded, there would not have been a word about this proposal so far as hackney or taximen are concerned.  At least they can say that they have had the advantage of <Col N="321" /> enjoying this concession for the last five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it really necessary to punish the regular taximan and the hackney owner by increasing his charges in order to get at the pirate who is invading the trade for the purpose of skimming the best part of the traffic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give that as my only reason.  I gave it as one of the considerations.  Another consideration was that a hackney car owner uses the roads and it is more important to him that the roads should be in fairly good condition than it is to any other user. While it is not a pleasant thing to say to a man that he must pay £2 more than he is paying, all sensible people will admit that, as costs have gone up, as there is need for better roads, there is no alternative but to call on the other partner to make good his contribution.</P>
      <P>The next class about which there was some discussion were lorry owners.  Deputy Norton suggested that, instead of approaching this question of the heavier type of vehicle in the way in which he alleged I was approaching it, I should prohibit these vehicles by law and not allow them to travel on our roads.  He also suggested that the policy enshrined in this Resolution, if pursued, would have the effect of decreasing employment. I know the opposite to be the case.  I am aware that some commercial concerns have put these heavy vehicles, with trailers attached to them, on the roads for the purpose of relieving themselves of the necessity of sending two men along with a smaller vehicle and of having to carry the cost of these men's wages.  If the proposals contained in this Resolution are examined, so far as commercial vehicles are concerned, it will be seen that the policy I announced I was aiming at is met; I have set out to save the smaller vehicle as much as I could and to progressively increase the amount of tax on a vehicle as the weight increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did so not for the purpose which Deputy Norton seemingly thought I <Col N="322" /> had in mind&mdash;to put the vehicles entirely off the road.  I feel it would be a very high-handed approach on my part if I were to attempt to prohibit legally the use of any type of vehicle on the roads, and if I brought along such a proposal for the approval of this House we all know what I would be told.  I am not, therefore, increasing these rates, in a progressive way in order to put these vehicles off the road, but because the information we have from our technical advisers as to the damage they are doing to roads never meant to carry them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased charges will be passed on to those for whom the goods are conveyed, and the vehicles will continue to destroy the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, you can apply that argument all down along the line if you wish.  I have travelled after those heavy vehicles on roads that were never designed or never meant to carry them.  I travelled behind them for miles, because it was impossible to get past them because of the width of the roads.  I saw some of them entering by-roads and in one ten minutes they had done more damage than they would pay for in taxation in five years.  I do not know what Deputy Norton has in mind when he chastises me because of my policy.</P>

      <P>Industrialists are, in the main, the owners of these heavy vehicles.  After all, they are naturally entitled to fair play and to consideration just the same as any other citizen. So far as the Labour Party is concerned, I would expect that the matters to which they would give primary consideration would be matters such as Deputy Norton had in mind, when he addressed a question to me to-day about employment conditions in Kildare, and about the fact that in a number of areas there was not sufficient road work.  I would have thought that these Deputies, who have shown from time to time some concern about the working classes, would have looked upon these proposals, not from the point of view of those who own heavy commercial vehicles, but rather that they would have said to themselves: &ldquo;The Minister comes into this House with proposals designed to build up the fund, that, in so far as he is concerned, has been used exclusively for the maintenance and improvement of our roads, <Col N="326" /> and the Minister will give to the House an assurance that so far as he is concerned that Fund, to whatever size it may grow, will be used for this same purpose in future.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One would have expected a different approach from the Labour Party to such a question in these circumstances. I, therefore, can be excused for expressing my disappointment with the attitude of the Labour Party.  There is no doubt in my mind but that these proposals are overdue, when we have regard to the importance of the matters with which they deal.  As I have said, when a Minister approaches this House seeking additional funds from certain sections of the citizens, it is not a matter for which he will get many pats on the back, but Deputies, especially Deputies who have experience of the problems of local bodies and of the difficulty of increasing rates to improve roads that in many cases should be 100 per cent. better than they are, will surely admit that what I am aiming at, and hoping to secure without doing a great deal of hardship to any section of the community, is well worthy of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister opened his speech by telling us that he had listened to hundreds, if not thousands of debates in this House and that the debate on this motion was the strangest to which he had ever listened, that it was the most peculiar debate to which he had ever listened.  I agree with the Minister that it is a peculiar debate but not for the same reasons as he gave.  It is a rather peculiar debate.  It was initiated yesterday not only in a peculiar, but in an unprecedented fashion.  I will not say that the Minister's contribution to it yesterday was a peculiar contribution but I do not think it was an entirely helpful one.  The Minister added to the peculiar character of this debate to-day because when this motion was called from the Chair, the Minister said that he was just moving it formally and that he had nothing to say.  As a matter of fact he had covered all the ground yesterday and at any rate he would have the right to intervene during the debate.  The Minister later intervened to make the speech which he has just <Col N="327" /> delivered.  For some peculiar reason of his own, he waited until Deputy Norton had moved the amendment and until Deputy MacBride had spoken and then the Minister started to deliver his speech, with very little, if any, advertence to what Deputy Norton had said in support of his amendment and with only one reference to what Deputy MacBride had said and that reference was merely to avoid answering the questions which Deputy MacBride asked.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride's question to-day and Deputy Mulcahy's question yesterday, was a very clear, straightforward question.  The question was so simple that the Minister should not have any difficulty whatever in giving a specific answer to it.  The question was: Can the House get an undertaking that every penny raised under this motion and the motion passed yesterday will be given over for the roads of this country?  Neither yesterday nor to-day has the Minister given a specific answer to that question.  Neither yesterday nor to-day was he prepared to deal with it.  The furthest he was prepared to go in the speech he has just delivered was to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Look at what I have done in relation to the Road Fund this year. I, this year, persuaded my colleagues in the Cabinet not to do what they have been doing for many years&mdash; raiding the Road Fund.  I give an undertaking as far as I am concerned&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and let me say, in passing, that I accept absolutely the Minister's good faith in that undertaking&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;every penny will go to the roads.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that is not an answer to the question asked by Deputy MacBride and Deputy Mulcahy.  It will not be in the Minister's power to determine whether it will or will not. That will be determined by the Government, and may I say, with all respect, it will be determined to a greater extent by the Minister for Finance than by the Minister for Local Government. The Minister told us that there are 34,000 miles of county roads in this country that, in his own words, are <Col N="328" /> neither surfaced nor tarred.  If that is the position, then we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.  Neither the Minister nor his Department, nor the Government, have anything to be proud of in relation to that statement. We are told that there are no fewer than 2,000 miles of our main roads still untarred.  May I ask the Minister to what extent this imposition, this heavy imposition, under the resolution will affect the 34,000 to 36,000 miles of road?</P>
    <P>This, undoubtedly, is taxation which will hit a very considerable number of the people of this country severely. We cannot talk about this particular resolution as if we had no additional imposition of taxation this year except it.  We must take it in conjunction with the Budget and with the impositions on petrol and so on.  We must remember that by far the greater part of this will be passed on to the ordinary citizen of the State.  The point was already made that if the State seeks to raise £800,000 to £850,000 in this way, by the time it is collected from the ordinary citizen it will probably be double that amount.  It will certainly add to the cost of living and add to the charges and prices which the ordinary citizen will have to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked&mdash;and he answered the question&mdash;to give an estimate, if not an aggregate figure of the additional amount which would have to be found by Córas Iompair Éireann to meet this additional taxation as far as their road vehicles are concerned.  The Minister's answer was, I think, somewhere between £70,000 and £90,000&mdash;let us say £80,000.  The Minister subsequently said that the estimated additional amount which would have to be paid in respect of State vehicles would be £70,000.  That is £150,000 out of the £850,000.  If we had even an estimate&mdash;and we may be able to get it before the conclusion of this debate&mdash; of the additional amount which will have to be paid by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna and the various other State or semi-State organisations in the country then we would have some idea of the real amount which will be made available to the local authorities for the roads of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> I am opposed to this.  I do not think that it will do any good to the roads and it will certainly not do any good to Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister said that he could not conceive himself bringing proposals into this House to limit the weight of lorries on the road, and immediately after saying that he proceeded himself to make a first-class case for doing that.  There is no doubt whatever that there are vehicles on the roads of this country that those roads were never intended to carry.  I will go further and say that I do not believe that the Minister could charge a tax on these lorries that would compensate the local authorities for the amount of damage done to the roads.  What the Minister is doing is to make it still more expensive to distribute goods.  The way to deal with the injury to the roads and the way to make more economical the supply, distribution and delivery of goods and commodities all over the country is not the way in which we are now asked to do it.  The fact of the matter is&mdash;and the Minister knows it as well as I do and so do his colleagues in the Government&mdash;that there is infinitely too much transport in this country.  There is far more transport on the roads of this country than we have goods to be carried.  I am speaking now from recollection but I think I am right in saying that there are three times, if not three and a half times, the number of commercial vehicles registered in this country than were registered in 1939.  I do not think that anybody will venture to suggest that we have even 20 per cent. more in the volume of goods to be carried to-day as compared with 1939.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably the £70,000, £80,000 or £90,000 addition on Córas Iompair Éireann will have to be made good either by the taxpayer through additional grants or by the people who will be using either the road freight or road passenger vehicles.  Alternatively, the services will have to be still further reduced, and the citizen will be paying then in hardship perhaps rather than in additional cash.  The additional £70,000 for State vehicles will have to be found by the taxpayer, and the taxpayer is also the ratepayer.  We are talking here, of course, as if the taxpayer, <Col N="330" /> the ratepayer, and the person who is taxing his car, lorry or tractor are all different people each paying only one tax, when in fact they are the same people.  It is those who own neither lorry, motor car nor hackney car, who own none of these vehicles, who to the greatest extent will pay this tax, because it will be passed on to them in so far as it is humanly possible to pass it on.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about heat being engendered in this debate.  I did not notice any heat engendered at all except the odd little spark which the Minister himself threw off.  May I ask the Minister to try for a moment to imagine himself on this side of the House and those proposals put forward by somebody else on the far side?  I can see the Minister, as I have often seen him before, going all out and engendering heat with infinitely less provocation than is contained in these proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the proposals contained in this resolution will do any good at all, or any appreciable good, so far as the roads are concerned.  Certainly they will impose hardships on the greater number of those who will be directly affected.  They will impose still more hardship on those to whom the additional tax will be passed on. If, and many people seem to think that this is so, the reason for raising so steeply the tax upon the big heavy lorries was an effort to divert the carriage of the types of commodities which they carry from the roads to the rails, then I am sorry to say&mdash;and I mean it&mdash;that it will not succeed.  Far from bringing any relief to the national transport undertaking, I think we are merely putting another burden on it.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Norton was unfair when he suggested that it might be better if the proposal were withdrawn for further consideration. Having regard to the fact that this is only one of a series of resolutions imposing a level of taxation never before witnessed in this country, the Opposition have dealt with it in a very moderate and, so far as one can do it, an objective way.</P>
    <P>I am opposing this resolution because, apart from the fact that it will impose hardships, I cannot see <Col N="331" /> that it will do good.  I do not think that it will do good from the point of view that it will find its way to road construction and road maintenance: I am not as optimistic as the Minister appears to be that as much of it as he seems to think will find its way to the roads.  I have a pretty shrewd idea that if his ministerial colleague in the Department of Finance finds that there is not as much in the bag at the end of the year as he hopes will be there, he will make love to it again and not for the first time.  I do not believe that the amount of good, if any, which may come out of it will be such as to justify, even to an extent, the imposition of this further heavy taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the debate so far has centred on the position of the so-called genuine hackneyman: I represent a rural constituency and, naturally enough, I am not concerned so much with the problems of the taximan as I am with those of the hackneyman. Quite recently we had a meeting&mdash;at which, unfortunately, I was not present&mdash;of the local Hackneymen's Association in County Mayo. Apart from a rather foolish political dodge by the secretary of the association, there was a very useful discussion on the entire problem.  Deputy Morrissey is perfectly right: there are far too many vehicles of one kind or another in the country at the moment. It is obvious, from all the speeches we have heard, that nobody has an easy solution to the problem of the genuine hackneyman.  It is not for me to say what is the distinction between the genuine hackneyman and the nongenuine hackneyman.  I presume the latter class comprises people who have alternative means of livelihood.  In point of fact, most of those who are running hackney cars in the country at the moment have shops or other means of livelihood besides the car which they use as a public service vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say that the feeling of this House is that something should be done for the man who has no means of earning a livelihood other than that of his motor car.  I think it is further true to say that no Deputy on either side of the House&mdash;I am not saying <Col N="332" /> this in any spirit of criticism&mdash;has, during the course of this debate, put forward an easy solution to the problem of the genuine hackneyman.  The proposal to increase the tax has precipitated discussion on a matter which was bound to come to public notice sooner or later, and that is that in the past 18 months or two years it has become virtually impossible for any person to support himself, his wife and children merely on the proceeds of a hackney car.  That is the problem which we here must endeavour to solve.</P>
    <P>The net result of the discussion at the meeting to which I have referred was a suggestion that the Minister should place a flat rate of £20 or £25 and charge that rate to every person who applies for a hackney licence.  The effect of this provision would be that a person who bought a small car capable of carrying three people would have to pay as much as a person who bought a big car capable of carrying five or six people.  I think, also, that it was explicitly stated that a hackneyman should be obliged by law to have a vehicle which would enable him to carry at least five persons.  I believe it was the general feeling of the meeting that the men who are doing the damage are (1) those who are running very small cars, and (2) those who have an alternative means of livelihood. Obviously we have nothing, or we should have nothing, against those who are running a car and who have an alternative means of livelihood.  Such persons are perfectly justified, and I should hate them or this House to imagine that my view is that we should do something against them.  I think, however, that we should try to protect the men who have been in the hackney business for upwards of 20 years, and who now find that the business on which they are depending for a livelihood is disappearing.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a man this morning who had been running a hackney car for the past 20 years.  He told me that things have become extremely difficult as a result of the encroachment of casual hackney owners on his province and that he is finding it very hard to make ends meet.  I should like to urge on the Minister that he should consider carefully the suggestion which <Col N="333" /> was made, after plenty of discussion, at the meeting to which I have referred and that he should give careful consideration to the proposal to adopt a flat rate for all hackney cars, as well as obliging hackney owners to have cars of a certain seating capacity. It is quite possible that the Minister would obtain more revenue under that system than he will obtain under the proposals which are before the House at the moment.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the actual proposals themselves, I think it is rather a pity that £13 should be the minimum tax chargeable, no matter what type of car a person may buy.  I think that £13 would be too much if, for instance, the 2 h.p.  Citroen car, which is now a very popular small car in France, were introduced into this country.  I urge on the Minister to consider the striking of a lower rate than £13 for cars under 6 h.p.  The avowed principle on which the new taxation has been based is that cars damage the roads in proportion to their weight and power.  Since the Minister has not placed a ceiling on the amount of tax to be levied by the State, I think he should not fix a lower level but should go right down and thereby encourage the use of smaller vehicles, or at least not discourage their use.</P>
    <P>As regards the Road Fund, the Minister mentioned that since he took office he has devoted every penny that went into the Road Fund to the improvement of the roads of the country. He deserves every credit for that, though I think that could always have been said.  I more or less agreed with Deputy Corish last night, until I heard the Minister to-day, that the Road Fund should be abolished altogether. I have no doubt that the Minister will stick to his statement in spite of what Deputy Morrissey has said, and that the money will, in fact, be used.  I should like to see it used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>There is one method by which the roads could be made considerably safer without a great deal of cost to the Exchequer.  There are many blind corners on the roads which are blind <Col N="334" /> because of excessively high hedges. The cost of butchering those hedges so as to make the roads safe would be comparatively insignificant compared to the cost of laying down a road to any considerable length.  If that involved the cutting down of those horrible furze bushes which infest the countryside it would mean doing a service to the farmer as well as to the road user.  Indeed, those in charge of the roads could, with profit to the farmer, make an occasional foray into his land to remove those bushes.  It would not be an expensive matter, in my opinion.  It is important to bear in mind, in connection with these blind corners on roads, that very often they are not on a right-angle bend.  From a distance of 30 or 40 yards, they do not appear to be bends at all.  Most people are careful when driving towards a dangerous right-angle bend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I shall say nothing further about it.  There is one aspect of the proposals which, so far as I know, has not been mentioned, and that is the fact that the tax on the cyclemaster has been reduced from £3 to £1.  That is a very laudable provision indeed because, as we all know, the cyclemaster can be said to be the <Col N="335" /> poor man's method of getting about. It was time, therefore, that the tax on it was reduced to £1.  I do not think any person using the roads would object to paying a somewhat increased amount in respect of road tax if the roads were really improved.  In that connection, I should like to make an appeal to the Minister to consider the claims of a county such as the County Mayo, where the roads are all laid on a boggy foundation.  Deputy Cafferky has often mentioned in this House in a different connection, that the average poor law valuation of the small farmers in the County Mayo is somewhere in the region of £2 10s.  I would be interested to know if Deputy Cafferky would like the roads in County Mayo, or in any other county for that matter, to be paid for exclusively by those people who find things hard enough as they are at present.  I am quite sure that he could not honestly and would not try to make the case that the ratepayers in the County Mayo should be asked to bear the entire burden of putting the roads in a condition in which they would be capable of carrying the traffic which they are being asked to carry at the moment.</P>
      <P>I think I mentioned, in this connection previously, that about 12 months ago the county engineer publicly stated that the road system in the county was rapidly deteriorating, and that there was very little that could be done about it in the existing circumstances. I think it will be freely admitted by Deputies that, as a result of the enormous traffic which the roads of the country have had to bear that the road system has rapidly deteriorated in the past 12 months.  If that is so, then surely we should face the fact that the ordinary ratepayer should not be asked to carry such an enormous burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratepayer very often uses the road only for the purpose of driving cows on it or at most of driving a cart on it.  In that situation, we have to look for some alternative means of finding the necessary revenue.  The only sensible and logical means of getting that revenue is by increasing the taxation on those who use the <Col N="336" /> roads, proportionate to the damage which they do to them.</P>
    <P>In that respect, it was mentioned by Deputy Morrissey that he suspects the object of the Minister in increasing taxation on the heavier lorries is to divert a certain amount of the traffic which the roads have been carrying to Córas Iompair Eireann.  I do not know what justice there is in that statement.  I know that private hauliers, if they pay for the roads, are entitled to use them and that there should be no suggestion of limiting them to 20 or to 50 miles.  I also know that the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann are specialists in their job. Many of them have been working for the company for 20, 25 or 30 years, They are entitled to security in their employment and the State is bound to look after them because they are specialists in their own way.  They cannot be asked, at the end of a very long period in a specialised job, to turn to some other form of employment.  It is a very difficult problem for any Government but it is nevertheless one that must be faced.  These employees are as much entitled to protection by the State as the genuine hackneyman to whom I referred earlier.  But I go even further than that.  It is often alleged that the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann must take whatever comes their way because their directors are incompetent and do not know how to run efficiently or manage a transport system.  I am not competent to say whether or not Córas Iompair Éireann is efficiently and properly run, but irrespective of whether it is or whether it is not, the position of these innocent men doing an honest day's work in an honest job and the position of their wives and children should be considered quite apart altogether from the question of whether or not the company is being efficiently and economically run.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is at present on the roads here a young generation of motorists, and the standard of driving in that generation has been very adversely commented upon by visitors from outside.  It is the opinion of the Royal Irish Automobile Club that a system of motor-cycle patrols should be instituted.  I urge upon the Minister the desirability of setting aside from <Col N="337" /> the moneys he will receive now sufficient to place a squad of these motor-cyclists on the roads in order to make the roads safer and educate this very ignorant young motoring public. I understand that the cost of one of these motor-cycle patrols is roughly in the region of £500 per annum.  Out of the moneys that will be received into the Road Fund, I think a sufficient number of these patrols could be placed on the roads to make them safer for the community in general.  It is not enough to make the roads reasonably good.  The Government also has a duty to make them reasonably safe.</P>

      <P>I expressed my views on this matter last night, and I am still unrepentant in relation to the views I expressed yesterday despite the Minister's castigation of them.  I still believe this proposal is worthy of reconsideration and reference back for that purpose.  The Minister stated this evening that the matter had received very full and careful consideration.  I still say that it is ill-considered, unjust and unwise.  It is my view that the Minister had little regard to the effects of these penal impositions on the people who will have to bear the burden of this new taxation.  Its main objective is to get a certain amount of money for the maintenance and preservation of our roads.  I share his enthusiasm for the maintenance of our roads in proper condition, and I congratulate him on his efforts to do a good job of work in that direction. I do not quarrel with him on that. My quarrel is that I consider the methods adopted to raise the necessary funds have not been given due consideration and are not calculated to give the best results.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Deputy Norton's argument that this would cause unemployment was completely wide of the mark.  He said he believed it would create employment.  That is a most astonishing statement.  The Minister thinks that the money raised by means of this resolution will increase work on the roads.  He seems to forget that it will create unemployment in other directions.  It will be no advantage to the hackney driver or the taxi driver to offer them alternative employment on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> At the moment these men are barely eking out an existence.  I said last night that that was due to several causes.  It is due to the increase in the number of private motor cars and to the decrease in the amount of money in the pockets of the ordinary people as a result of recent taxation. These people can no longer afford to engage taxis or hackney cars.  These men must keep first-class vehicles ready at all times for inspection.  They must keep high-powered, up-to-date cars.  The costs of these have gone up considerably.  The Minister stated that this class was exempted from taxation in 1948, and he his now levelling things up.  Surely there was justification for that exemption in 1948.  That justification exists to-day, but it is now proposed to make up for lost time and bring them up to date, notwithstanding the fact that their means of earning a livelihood has not improved.  Indeed, it has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>Due consideration has not been given to these people.  I think it is unjust to imply a level rule over all.  I believe that those men whose livelihood depends on serving the community with hackney cars and taxis should not be brought within the scope of this new impost.  It will not result in increased revenue to the State, because it will drive these men out of employment. The Minister made a pretty able effort to give an appearance of common sense to what is not, in fact, a common sense proposal.  He talked of the maintenance and upkeep of the roads.  He adverted to the destruction caused by heavy vehicles.  The Minister has told us that his experts have advised him that the roads are not calculated to stand up to these juggernauts tearing over them, carrying goods and merchandise that could be more suitably carried on our substantial railway lines.  Surely the Minister could influence the Government to take steps to remove this menace.  The moneys that he will get under this impost will not make good the damage done to the roads if these heavy vehicles are permitted to continue in operation.  He said that he himself had seen one go in on a side road and do damage there that would take five years to repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I sympathise with the Minister in that, but this is not the remedy.  This is the application of a minor remedy to a major evil.  The Minister saw fit to congratulate himself on being able to preserve the Road Fund, and I suppose he is entitled to his self-laudation and back-slapping in that respect in having succeeded in keeping the voracious hands of the Minister for Finance off the fund.  In my own defence, I would like to point out that the raiding of the Road Fund was a legacy inherited by the inter-Party Government from its predecessors in Fianna Fáil.  The only thing is that we raided it to a lesser extent than they did.  I congratulate the Minister on being able to preserve that money for the Road Fund.  I would have been glad to have also been able to preserve the money for the Road Fund. But the congratulations would be much more genuine, and I am sure the Minister for Finance would feel much more sincere in his congratulations to himself, if he had been able to preserve that Road Fund without doing it at the expense of the food subsidies. I consented to the withdrawal of £300,000 that was applied to the relief of poor people trying to buy food.  It is easy for the Minister to congratulate himself on preserving the Road Fund, but the price he has paid is rather dear to the country and I would suggest that there is not so much room for clapping or crowing about it.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, he proceeds now to see if there is any subsidy not properly plucked and fleeced by the first Budget.  He uses his falcon claws to attack the taximen, the hackneymen, the motor drivers trying to make an existence, in case someone may not be fully fleeced, and they will be fleeced this bit more.  The Minister is trying to justify that and says it will provide more employment.  That, however, is going absolutely against commonsense, since it will have the reverse effect&mdash;it will create unemployment and hardship amongst the deserving sections of the community.  In my opinion, it will not bring in even the amount of money that has been estimated, as it will drive some of these people away <Col N="340" /> from being able to pay taxation at all. I want to repeat the statement I made yesterday, that I consider this illadvised. The matter should have been reconsidered, but the Government is not going to do that; they will rely on their machine majority to put this hardship on an already hardpressed section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government to-day complained of artificial heat that was engendered in this debate and, whipping himself into periodic bursts of passion, he endeavours to justify this obnoxious effort, on the plea of rates versus Exchequer.  He tries to justify it on the basis that he was the hero that stood in the gap and prevented any of the moneys in the Road Fund drifting to some other Exchequer purpose.  I pressed the Minister for certain information&mdash;information which I suggest to the House is readily available and should be available to aid this discussion. The Minister purports in this White Paper to get somewhere between £800,000 and £900,000 which he says is going to be entirely designated for road improvement.  How much of it is going to be obtained by way of book transfers from one Department to another?  How much of it is, in fact, going to be indirectly filched from the general taxation?  I pressed the Minister and, with his usual surliness and display of ill-temper, he refused to come down to practical reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the position going to be that between the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the State transport, Army transport and other transport such as Board na Móna, practically £500,000 or £600,000 of this money will be raised by one Department paying it to another?  We have to analyse that in the light of the fact that the Minister is going to ask the hackneymen and taximen to carry a burden of £54,000, and no matter how he may talk about the 5/- tractors or about &ldquo;this number of smackers&rdquo;, to use his own expression, there is no gainsaying the fact that the tractor owners are being asked in this White Paper to contribute £31,000 more to the Exchequer <Col N="341" /> this year.  Let agriculturists twist it any way they like, let them talk about the 5/- tractor, it does not detract for one moment from the fact that an indirect tax of £31,000 is being placed on the backs of the farmers&mdash;at a time when you have a Government exhorting them to increase production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, from Mayo, came into the House this evening to be rational and reasonable in one aspect of the case&mdash;because I suspect he is being pinched pretty hard by the Mayo Hackneymen and Taximen's Association. I made a plea yesterday in all sincerity to the Minister for deliberate and constructive reconsideration of the problem where these people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day made some naïve suggestion capable of conception only in the peculiar intellect of the Minister himself, that the hackneymen could have expected, when things came back to normal, that their tax would go up. If the Minister is trying to make the case that things are normal to-day for the hackneymen and the taximen, I think he might as well be holding a conversation with the mythical man in the moon.  The position is that the genuine taximan to-day is competing, at a time of increased cost of cars, increased cost of repairs and of tyres, increased cost of petrol and increased wages, against an ever-increasing supply of private cars and an ever-increasing abuse of private owners of their privilege.  I am not afraid to say on the floor of this House that, to my own knowledge, people not having hackney licences at all are using their cars in parts of rural Ireland to deprive hackneymen of what might be legitimate fares.  That is what the present Minister is trying to suggest to us is a position of normality for the hackneyman or the taximan.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to advert to this fact, that a large number of these hackneymen and a large number of these taximen of recent years have been granted their plates and their hackney licences by virtue of a priority they were given for service rendered to this country during the emergency.  I want to impress on the Minister the urgency of the reconsideration of the <Col N="342" /> case where the hackneymen and the taximen are concerned.  The genuine hackneyman and the genuine taximan are facing an economic problem for which, with this impost, there will not be any solution.  Mind you, in this particular type of effort by the Government, it is the weak man without considerable financial resources, the man working his own cab, who will be most likely to fall first.  The wealthy companies that are running fleet cab services or fleet taxi services have a chance of surviving because, with the gradual elimination of competition, they will be in the position to corner what business may be left and charge what fares may commend themselves to them at any time.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely anxious in this particular matter to impress upon the Minister the fact that he may be in a most unjust and unfair way eliminating the living of a lot of small people in this country who deserve better from the State than this will give them.  I am not going to elaborate much further on that problem.  I made a direct and determined assault on the Minister last night for the savagery of this particular proposal.  I think there is no basis of truth nor is there any scintilla of wit associated with an argument that suggests that there is in that limited section of the community a back broad enough to carry an impost of £54,000 increase on it.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear later in the course of this debate Deputy Martin Corry justify the impost of £31,000 on the farming community envisaged in this White Paper as the excess to be drawn off on tractors and tractor users, to say nothing of the odd few pounds&mdash; or to be more euphemistic and to use the Minister's own expression &ldquo;the odd few &lsquo;smackers&rsquo;&rdquo; that will be dragged off the farmers by way of increased price for driving licences.</P>
    <P>This problem and the problem of the roads is a big one: This solution and that solution have been suggested, but one fact has emerged in the course of this discussion upon which we are all <i>ad idem</i> and that is that the excessively heavy trucks of this country are undoubtedly doing immense damage to the roads.  Is the solution to that problem the way the Government is <Col N="343" /> going?  Is it the solution to endeavour to crush out that type of traffic by prohibitive taxation?  Would it not be more manly and, indeed, a more honourable thing for the Government to face up to the responsibility of deciding what was the maximum laden weight the roads of this country could carry and by use of the clause that is in the transport legislation fix an upper limit on weights of lorries that can ply on the roads?</P>
    <P>What is the situation?  We have heard much of &ldquo;X&rdquo; type of lorry.  The fact remains that various State institutions or subsidiary State companies are the greatest transgressors where the question of heavy lorries are concerned. Very heavy equipment is being used by the Department of Agriculture and by the Electricity Supply Board. A considerable fleet of very heavy trucks is being used by Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board are carrying immense loads on low trailers.</P>
    <P>It seems farcical to me, as a rational being, if we are discussing road and road maintenance, that the Government would not take some cognisance of the damage that vehicles immediately under its own control are doing to the roadways.  Would it not be a far more effective solution if the Government, instead of trying to crush out by excessive taxation, took the honourable line and fixed an upper limit?  What will happen so far as heavy transport is concerned when these prohibitive taxes are enforced? Again, it will be the man of limited resources or the one-truck trailer owner who will go to the wall first.</P>
    <P>I heard much criticism in this House of Córas Iompair Éireann, but I venture to make this prognostication, that, if any Government in this country faced up to the problem of fixing an upper limit on heavy transport, there would have to be a diversion of heavy traffic to the railways.  With a reasonable diversion of that traffic to the railway there would be an immense step forward towards making the railway system of this country an economic unit.</P>
    <P>The number of people employed on <Col N="344" /> the very heavy type of trucks operated either by Córas Iompair Éireann, the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Agriculture or any other semi-State organisation would not create the problem that has been created by the gradual deterioration in the economic stability of Córas Iompair Éireann.  If there was a reasonable diversion of a small percentage of the heavy traffic to the railways of this country it would immensely improve the earning capacity of Córas Iompair Éireann and achieve the object so sought after by Deputy Flanagan from Mayo of preserving employment for the members of the staff of Córas Iompair Éireann, and ensuring, at the same time, the survival of their wives and families in the reasonable comfort they should expect after long years of service in such an organisation.</P>
    <P>The answer to this problem, as suggested by the Government in this White Paper, is the answer of the butcher and the oppressor.  It is not the answer of the thinker or of the person who is prepared to work out a plan that will redound to the benefit of the country as a whole.  This is a further instalment of that insatiable lust that Fianna Fáil seems to have conceived for grabbing as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, from the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Let us analyse the spurious case made by the Minister for Local Government to-day.  He tells us in one breath that there are 34,000 miles of county roads untarred and over 2,000 miles of main roads untarred.  To use the oft vaunted expression of many of his colleagues in the Government and, indeed, the oft used expression by himself: &ldquo;What is this odd £800,000 but a ha'porth of tar where that mileage of road is concerned?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the problem must revert in the final analysis to the fact that the roads can only carry the weight of traffic that they are built to carry.  If the Government will not support local authorities, and if local authorities will not support the central authority to exclude some roads incapable of carrying excessively heavy traffic, this scheme will provide no solution to the problem.  With limited repair and patchwork on the roads, and a constant <Col N="345" /> increase in the amount of the traffic it has to bear, the rate of deterioration will far outstrip the rate of improvement that could be hoped for, no matter how large the Road Fund would become.</P>
    <P>Is this a rational solution of the problem?  I do not think it is.  As I said yesterday, I will not voice any tremendous objection on behalf of the motorists to the tax increases proposed. They have reached such a stage of stoicism that they expect to get the &ldquo;dig&rdquo; all the time.  The Minister talks about revenue for the Road Fund as if motor taxation and the cost of a licence were the only charges motorists are carrying.  Let him have a look at the financial accounts for the year, and see what an extraordinary yield to the revenue came from light hydro-carbon and hydro-carbon oils, and he will see what the Exchequer got out of this limited section of the community over a period.  If the Minister could bring into the Road Fund even 50 per cent. of the contribution made by motorists through oil and petrol duties, then he might be in a position to deal adequately with the local authorities in regard to road repairs.</P>
    <P>At its best, this is an unsavoury effort to deal with an immense problem. Unfortunately, in the main, it is not the person against whom the tax is directed who will be the ultimate payee of the tax.  We know well that where distribution costs are concerned they will be passed on to the consuming public.  The people who are likely to suffer extinction under this resolution are the people deeply committed to hire purchase companies for lorries or taxi cabs running on limited capital and trying to make a living for themselves and their families and in many cases employing a helper or two.  They are the people who will suffer extinction, while the people who are able to operate fleets of lorries will have sufficient capital resources to weather the immediate impact of this severe increase in taxation and at the same time adjust their rates to meet, over the year, whatever additional cost may be put on them by way of taxation. I venture to suggest that in that adjustment of rates they will add a little <Col N="346" />&ldquo;tilly&rdquo; to ensure themselves against any further increase that might be imposed by this Government.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to realities, when dealing with the problem.  The problem of Irish roads as envisaged by the Minister is not a question of rates versus the Exchequer.  If we can do something to arrest the rapid deterioration of the roads by manfully facing the problem and putting an upward limit on the weight of loads that can be carried on the roads, we will be doing something that will very rapidly ease the difficulties of the ratepayers, something which would be infinitely more valuable as a contribution than £800,000 distributed between all the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Take the area of West Cork, which I represent.  The mileage of roads there creates an immense problem. The road problem is not one of maintenance and repair.  It is one of a tremendous mileage of unnecessary roadways and in many cases of necessity for further roadways.  It is a problem which must be attacked in a national way and which cannot be dealt with in a patchwork way.  It is a problem which will have to be met by removing the primary cause for heavy road destruction by limiting the type of vehicles which will travel on the roads to the weight which the roads can carry.</P>
    <P>If you travel on the main road from Dublin to Cork you will find miles and miles of it in various places where the whole foundations have gone because of the weight of traffic in excess of what it can carry which it is asked to carry.  The repair of that road and the resinking of foundations in some boglands through the Midlands to reset that road properly involves a cost so large that it must forcibly bring to the notice of the Government the necessity for a constructive and realistic plan for the transport and roadways of the country.</P>
    <P>The problem has been aggravated by the large increase in the number of vehicles.  According to the best information I can obtain, there are 23,000 vehicles in this country between the two-ton rate and the heavy rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> In the heavy vehicle group there are some 2,000 which one might describe as monster vehicles.  Ironically, some of the heaviest vehicles using the roads belong to a company which purports to be a road repairing company. With their vehicles carrying 15 and 20 ton of sand on the way to whatever repair job they are doing on the roads, according to the Minister's own statement they are doing more damage than they would pay for in taxes in five years.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government quite seriously that this is only a &ldquo;slap happy&rdquo; method of trying to deal with a major problem.  I suggest that they should take back the whole scheme for reconsideration, set about the task of finding a constructive and realistic plan for the roads throughout the country and fix a limit to the weight of vehicles which will be allowed to travel on the roads.  The roads should be only asked to bear the burden which they are able to bear.  In that way the deterioration of the roads will be prevented.</P>
    <P>Why single out limited classes of the community to carry the entire burden? Why impinge again for this tremendous sum of money on a section of the community whose contribution to the Exchequer through the petrol and oil tax is far out of proportion to their numbers?  I ask the Government to withdraw this scheme and plan something that will inure to the credit of the country and perhaps inure to the benefit of the Government rather than force on this Dáil, by virtue of a precarious and ill-procured majority, something that may do untold harm to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under ordinary circumstances I know what my attitude would be on this question.  I can give briefly here my policy contained in the private members' proposals, dated 14th February, 1951.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the deplorable state of the roads, mainly caused by heavy motor traffic which they were not constructed to take and of the intolerable burden which their maintenance would impose on the ratepayers, <Col N="348" /> Dáil Éireann is of opinion that for the next three years an amount equal to the revenue derived from motor taxation, petrol tax and import duties on imported motor vehicles and parts, should be allocated to local authorities to enable them to bring main and county roads up to the standard required for modern road transport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was my opinion and would still be my opinion had we normal circumstances. In 1948 the then Government put forward grants of over £4,000,000 towards the local authorities to help them out in road maintenance for this country.  There was a change of Government.  Certain taxes were taken off and to meet that bill those people borrowed £2,500,000 on the strength of the Road Fund, for which each year there has to be deducted £287,000 from the Road Fund to pay interest and Sinking Fund.  That is the manner in which those people faced their commitments.  &ldquo;Anywhere we can borrow, let somebody else pay.&rdquo;  They did more than that.  The following year they reduced the road grants for Cork County alone by £84,000; that much deterioration on the roads.  That was continued for the two and a half years following that those people were in office.  A quarter of a million pounds was taken from the roads in Cork County.  The choice left to the ratepayers was: &ldquo;You go and meet it or let the roads rot.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the attitude and that was the policy adopted by the inter-Party Government.  In addition to that £287,000 each year they faithfully extracted from the Road Fund the sum of £300,000 for Exchequer purposes; that is, out of motor taxation, after they had made their borrowing, each year they extracted £587,000 out of motor taxation alone.  The roads of this country were deprived of that, together with receiving a reduced grant amounting in Cork County to £250,000.  I still would have stuck to my attitude that petrol tax and the other taxes paid by motorists in this country should go to the maintenance of roads in this country and to the building up of the roads.  But what did we find?  We found that that money <Col N="349" /> which in the ordinary course would be spent in the manner I have indicated had to go to paying the debts that were piled on over the three years of squandermania that went on in this country.  A sum of £6,000,000 a year had to be met.  That is where the money went that should have gone to the roads.  We were left with one choice and one choice only, whether we were to call on the ratepayers of this country, on the farmers for whom Deputy Sean Collins was weeping salty tears and whom Deputy Blowick represents according to his speech last night. They were to face the burden.  We had a choice as to whether they should pay it or whether the men who were using the roads should pay it, and with that definite distinction I have no hesitation in saying that the men who use the roads must pay it.  That is the only choice left.</P>
    <P>We have to meet each year now a sum of £287,000 to pay back to the Road Fund the £2,500,000 that was borrowed out of it in 1948-49 and charged to the Road Fund.  That money has to be found each year out of the Road Fund to pay their debts.  There is no choice left except to throw on the farmer not the £30,000 that Deputy Collins alluded to a while ago but to throw the other £900,000 on him as those people had no scruple in doing when last they were in office.  The roads have deteriorated.  If you travel any road in Deputy Seán Collins's constituency you will see the effect there, step by step, of the reduction of £80,000 odd a year that was made in the grant for roads to Cork County during the years of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>You will see it there, for we did not provide the money in the Cork County Council.  We refused to provide the money, and I had as colleagues in refusing to provide the money all parties in the county council.  It was a State liability.  Let the State pay it.  Now we have a way.  This year, for the first year in 15 or 20 years, the full amount of the motor taxation of this country is going into roads, less the £287,000 that we have to pay every year towards the debts left on us.  That is the position we must face Deputy <Col N="350" /> Blowick, representing the agricultural community here, the Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party, says to the farmers: &ldquo;You should not be asked to pay that £30,000 extra on the tractors.  You should not be asked to pay that, but you should pay £800,000 instead.&rdquo;  Deputy Blowick smiled here and trotted into the Lobby to vote in favour of a policy of reduced road grants for three and a half years, a policy of allowing a gradual deterioration of the roads, with the heavy lorry belting away on them and tearing them up, with nothing to repair them, so far as the State was concerned.  That was the policy and the attitude adopted by Deputy Blowick then.  Now we have the wailing, the moaning and the gnashing of teeth.  The question is who should pay for the roads.  Is it the man who uses the roads, whether in a motor car or a lorry, heavy or light, or the man who probably has no road at all to his house, who has to come down a boreen of a mile and a half length which he has to keep and prepare himself before he reaches any kind of a road, the man who has to pay in his rates, living on top of God knows where, to keep the swanky road for the motorist?  In ordinary circumstances, I would insist that the money for these roads should be found from the petrol and the other items mentioned in my motion.</P>

We know what happened.  We would have had £1,800,000 to devote to these roads if the previous Government had made provision for paying the losses of Córas Iompair Éireann.  There should be good business men in this country and it has been proved that there are.  We need look only at the Sugar Company and at Irish Steel Ltd. to know that the ability is there.  Let us take somebody with that ability and put him in charge of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>We will deal with Córas Iompair Éireann as they should be dealt with&mdash;let there be no doubt about that.  These people, having pledged the Road Fund in respect of £2,500,000, in the full knowledge that £287,000 every year must be taken from the Road Fund, from the motor taxation paid by motorists, to pay their debts, now say: &ldquo;Why increase the taxation on the poor motorist?  Why not put it on the old farmer and let him pay it on the rates?&rdquo;  There is only one course.  If we are to do anything with the roads, the money must be found either by the ratepayer or by the users of the roads, the motorists.  I say that it is the user must pay.  In ordinary circumstances, I would say that he is already paying in the petrol tax which is taken by each Government in turn and devoted to other purposes, but that petrol taxation is now pledged to pay the debts left by the Deputies opposite.  It must go each year to meet the £6,000,000 we have to pay for the next 30 years for the luxury of having those gentlemen here for three years. That is how that money has gone.  It all boils down to this, that the money for these roads must be found from one of two sources&mdash;the ratepayer or the motor user.  In these circumstances.  I say the motor user has to pay.  There is no way out of it.  I have been pestering the Minister for Local Government and the Minister who came before him and the Minister who came before him again in connection with the unfair burden that has been thrown on the ordinary ratepayer in regard to roads. The roads are the property of the local authority.  The deterioration of the road is the responsibility of the user of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under ordinary circumstances, I would say that the user of the road is paying enough.  I would say, as I have said in this House under all Governments, that portion of the petrol tax should go each year towards maintenance of the roads, that portion of the petrol tax should go each year to the Road Fund, because the more petrol that is used the greater the deterioration of the roads.  But, when we are left with the position that you cannot touch that because it is <Col N="353" /> pledged, that you cannot touch the whole of the revenue from motor taxation because that is pledged also, or £287,000 of it is pledged, there remains the man who uses the road with motor cars, lorries or other vehicular traffic, or the ordinary ratepayer, and in those circumstances, I would say that the user of the road must pay.</P>

      <P>Everybody who saw this proposal some time ago in the White Paper regarded it as a very serious impost upon an already heavilytaxed section of our community.  I was satisfied that the Minister and the Government would try to defend it on grounds somewhat similar to the ground on which Deputy Corry has attempted to defend it, namely, on the ground that it was necessary.  When I saw a report that the Minister met members of the Motor Traders' Association and assured them that he would move this motion with the greatest pleasure, and would get it through the House with the greatest amount of support that any man could ever get, I was astounded.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good; I will accept that&mdash;that the proposals were just.  His proposals were just to the extent that a section of the community that is already heavily taxed in the ordinary way and who, strange as it may seem, contribute one-tenth of the total revenue derived from petrol, oil, motor taxation, drivers' licences, tariffs on cars, etc., should bear a further imposition of £800,000. I admit that it will not be on all of them but the portion of that £830,000 that the Minister hopes to get from that section is very great.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry defends it on the ground that the Road Fund was raided to the extent of £300,000 by the previous Government, giving the impression that the Road Fund was not raided by any Government other than the inter-Party Government.  I deny that.  The Road Fund has been raided by previous Governments time after time, sometimes to the extent of £100,000, sometimes to a greater extent.  The Road Fund will not be raided to the extent of £300,000 this year and, therefore, that £300,000 is in the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>This figure of £800,000 is to some extent a fictitious one because public vehicles, that is, State cars, Army lorries, Civic Guard lorries, cars, Post Office vehicles, motor cycles, the Minister tells us, represent £70,000.  No doubt the State can pay that £70,000 without any difficulty because it is the taxpayer who will pay that.  The remainder comes from the ordinary people.  It will come from the ordinary people in two ways.  First, it will come from the people who will have to pay it to Córas Iompair Éireann on the buses and to the various other State or semi-State concerns, the Electricity Supply Board and so on. Then there is the large number of people, ordinary business people, the lorry owner, and so on, who will pay this increased taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This impost is being put upon them so that more money can be collected into the revenue, because, at the moment, as far as I know, there is no indication of increased grants to local authorities this year or as to what the increased <Col N="355" /> grants from the Road Fund will be next year.  We are not told what moneys we will get.  All this money will come into the Central Fund.  I would like to see the Minister for Local Government manning the Bearna Baol against the Minister for Finance if he decides, next March, April or May, to raid the Road Fund again, not to the extent of £300,000 but to the extent of £600,000.  The Minister for Local Government would have a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the people who were already paying one-tenth of the total revenue are now being taxed by this Supplementary Budget in an unreasonable and unmerciful way.  I assert that part of the taxation is a fake because persons who have these heavy lorries will not be able to pay this duty.  It is a positive prohibition, done in a different way.  Is not £800 or £1,000 taxation on a lorry a prohibition? It is not a tax.  It is simply making a law that will compel a great number of these people to get off the road.  Many of them will not be able to pay it and would not have sufficient capital to meet that demand.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund this year ought to be £1,100,000 more than last year, according to the calculation that we have got.  Therefore, with that strength there will be a corresponding increase in road work and in road maintenance. I could understand it, if the pill were gilded in a different way.  It is being gilded at present by the assertion that the present steps are being taken so as to relieve the farmers.  It is said that if the present action were not taken the farmers' rates would go to maintaining the roads.  That is nonsense. For years, local authorities, county councils, the General Council of County Councils and other types of public bodies have made demands that the construction and maintenance of the main and trunk roads should be a charge on the central authority. What is happening to these resolutions now?  I am aware that during the regime of the inter-Party Government such resolutions were passed <i>ad lib.</i> Why are they not pressed for now?  Is it because there is a change of House?</P>

      <P>You are going to vote against the General Council of County Councils now.  Listening to Deputy Corry, one would think that the present method was the only one that could be adopted, but that is sheer nonsense.  £10,000,000 is being paid by motor owners into general taxation, and surely £830,000 could be taken out of the £10,000,000 without imposing this further taxation.</P>
      <P>It has been correctly and well said that the taxation upon the hackney and taxi owner is a tax on the implements of their profession, and that it is unfair and unreasonable.  I am astounded when I hear Deputies such as Deputy Cowan, and Deputy Cogan speaking against this taxation and then proceeding to vote for it.  That is not fair play.  Deputy Corry says that because there was £80,000 taken from the Cork County Council, the roads in Deputy Collins's section of the county were not properly made.  It could be argued that it was because Deputy Collins was supporting the inter-Party Government that his section of the county was left bare and that because Deputy Corry was a Fianna Fáil supporter the roads in his end of the county were well looked after.  It is time that this sort of thing came to an end.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry asserts that £6,000,000 of the taxation upon motor owners is earmarked to pay our debts.  A statement like that should not be made, because there is no truth whatever in it.  However, Deputy Corry pushed that remark across with all the vehemence at his command, and a smile appeared upon the faces of a number of the Fianna Fáil back-benchers. There is no smile upon the faces of the taxi and hackney owners because of this imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever grounds can be put forward, let them be put forward correctly and let no incorrect reasons be assigned.  No portion of State <Col N="357" /> revenue was used by the inter-Party Government for borrowing purposes. That was all catered for, just the same as the Minister for Finance has catered for the annulment of the recent loan over a certain number of years and for its repurchase.  It is incorrect to say that there was any malpractice in the financial policy of the inter-Party Government.  It may have been good propaganda at the change of Government to try to damage the good name and character of the people who had occupied the Government Benches. However, everybody realises that that propaganda damaged this country very considerably and, perhaps, put us into the position to-day where we have to put all this heavy taxation upon a certain section of the community.  I am open to correction, of course, but I think that when the Minister received the deputation he was satisfied with the justice of the motion.  That is a matter of opinion.  I think that the Minister's sense of justice and fair play is not of a very high standard, when he asserts that.  However, that is my opinion.  I assert that it would be much better if, he were to bring the motion to the members of the Government asking that £830,000 of the £10,000,000 collected from the motorists be paid over to him.  There would be more justice in that demand if he were making it to the Government than there is in his coming to this House asking that these taxes be imposed on the people.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this point: the public are under the impression that Dáil Éireann can reject this motion. They could if a few people could be got to vote according to their conscience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that this impost is put upon the people by the Government which, unfortunately, is composed of Fianna Fáil members. They are imposing this tax on the people and Deputy Corry and every Deputy supporting them must toe the line no matter how much they disbelieve in the proposal and no matter how well they know how unjust and how unreasonable it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I am satisfied that, if they were free, there is no Fianna Fáil back bencher in the House to-day who would not accompany these deputations to the Minister, asking that these taxes be removed, but they dare not do so.  If Deputy Flynn from Leitrim tells me in this House that he would vote for this taxation, even if the Party Whip was not on, I would say to him that he has more courage than I thought possible, because he would have to go back to Leitrim and say to his constituents: &ldquo;I put £1 upon every person who is driving a motor car or a motor vehicle.  I am going to increase taxation upon every person who has a motor car, be he school teacher, taxi owner, hackney owner, or whoever he may be.&rdquo;  If he is going to defend that, I may tell you that it will be the last thing that Deputy Flynn will attempt to defend in this House.  Of course he will try to brazen it out in the very same way as Deputy Corry did, and I do not blame him.  It does appear to me that in all this increased taxation, these new proposals and this Supplementary Budget, there is only one objective, and that is to reduce the purchasing power of the people.  In other words, the principles enshrined in the Butler Budget in Britain are being pushed forward here to-day.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach smiles at that, but he is not a member of the Government.  He does not know, poor fellow.  He may hear things now and again, but until he becomes a member of the Cabinet he cannot know what the Cabinet plans are.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government knows all about it.  He knows that when this increased taxation was decided upon, it was as a result of the conference that took place between the Ministers of this State and the Ministers in Great Britain.  None of them told us what the proposals were then, but everyone knows that the British Government budgeted for a surplus.  Whether or not they have succeeded in achieving it, that was the plan.  The plan may have gone a bit awry because there is not as much stout being drunk or liquor consumed as formerly, and the revenue is not coming in.  Similarly, the Government <Col N="359" /> will not get as much as they expect from this tax because they will push many people off the road.  The whole objective, however, is, as I say, to reduce the purchasing power of the people, to compel them to buy less and to give more to the Central Fund. That in certain circumstances might be all right, as Deputy Corry says, but in the conditions under which we live to-day that is not the case.  I shall not go further into that now, except to say in conclusion that this taxation is unfair, unjust and unreasonable, imposed as it is being imposed upon an already heavily taxed portion of our community.</P>
    <P>The Minister intervened a short time ago to correct a statement which I had made.  I have here now an extract from the <i>Independent</i> of 21st of October which I shall quote: &ldquo;Mr. Smith, the Minister, told a deputation organised by the Federated Society of Irish Motor Traders on Monday that he was confident that the proposals would receive more overwhelming support from the Dáil than any proposal he had ever sponsored.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion here to-night on the question of raids on the Road Fund and accusations have been hurled across the House, one side accusing the other of this terrible crime.  I think both sides have raided the Road Fund at various times and that should dispose of that particular accusation.  A certain question was asked by Deputy Costello and one or two other Deputies here to-day.  It was a simple question and they wanted a straight answer from the Minister, namely, whether the extra money raised as a result of these Financial Resolutions would finally find its way into a fund which will be devoted exclusively to improving our road system. So far as the Minister was concerned, the assurance he gave was that he would not allow the Road Fund to be raided.  I accept the Minister's statement in that regard, but, at the same time there are stronger men in the Cabinet than the Minister for Local Government and if the Minister for Finance wants money, it does not matter who suffers, he will get that money even if it means raiding the Road Fund.  I think Deputy Costello and other Deputies knew that perfectly well and it was sheer waste of time asking for an assurance that this money would be utilised for the purpose of improving the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry made the rather extraordinary <Col N="361" /> case here this evening that this extra money was being raised to pay for the debts of the previous Administration.  That is asking me as an Independent to swallow too much.  I cannot follow that line of argument but I do think that one of the reasons impelling the present Minister, driven by the Minister for Finance, to look for the money is that the cost of money has gone up.  The cost of everything has gone up in the last 12 months.  If Deputy Corry wants to talk about the debts contracted by the inter-Party Government or by Fianna Fáil, he has only to cast his mind back to the last few weeks to remember the debt of £1,000,000, interest on the new National Loan, that will have to be paid by the unfortunate people of this country to the people who were able to invest in that loan.  That has to be got somewhere to pay this interest to people who are already well off, to make the rich richer.  Here we have the first steps taken by the present Government to get money to meet their future commitments in regard to that National Loan.</P>
    <P>I say that in all seriousness because, without wishing to repeat all that was said last night on the issue of the increased cost of drivers' licences, it is evident that it was the need for money that caused the Government to bring in that Resolution.  If they were serious in their professed desire to improve conditions on the roads, the first step taken by the Government would have been to ensure that those who have licences are fit and able to drive cars.  I, for one, would not criticise the Government if they did find it necessary to raise the cost of drivers' licences by a considerable amount provided they ensured that the people who got these licences were fit to drive cars.  The Government, as far as I can see, do not care whether you are deaf, dumb or blind; you can get a driver's licence for £1 as long as more money can be gathered into the Department. It was merely for the purpose of raking in more money that that additional tax was imposed last night.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of the Road Fund, I am not satisfied that the money raised under this Resolution will be devoted to the improvement of our <Col N="362" /> road system.  I feel that until we have an iron-willed Minister for Local Government, who is prepared to stand over the Road Fund, we shall not see the money collected under these Resolutions expended on the roads, county roads and other roads, to maintain them at a proper standard.  Some Deputies on the Opposition side have suggested that all the money raised from road users through taxation and so forth should be expended on roads. I do not know what the exact amount is per annum which is raised by all sorts of taxes on vehicles, but I understand that it is in the region of £9,000,000.  I may be wrong, but I do not think I am far out.</P>
    <P>It would be a grand thing if that amount of money could be used on the improvement of our roads but I am afraid that this Government or any Government I see coming into office in the near future or during the next few years will not be attracted to utilising all that money on the roads, because too many other pressures will be brought to bear on them and the money will be used for other purposes.  I understand that if you compare the position of this country with that of Britain you will find that there £250,000,000 is collected per annum in road taxes, the licensing of vehicles and so forth and that the total amount out of that £250,000,000 which was spent on roads last year was £30,000,000.  There is a similar state of affairs then in Britain because although they take in a large sum of money, £250,000,000, they expend only a small portion of it on the road system.</P>
    <P>The question of the haulier, the lorry owner, has been raised.  This is a question which should get and is of course getting a great deal of attention in the House.  I believe that apart altogether from the increased revenue that will be available, this move of increasing the burden on the lorry owners is an indirect method adopted by the Government to squeeze these people off the roads.  If you like it is an indirect tax in order to force these men who have made a livelihood for years in this type of work off the roads and give a free hand to Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister himself mentioned <Col N="363" /> this evening that more damage is done in five minutes by a heavy vehicle on a byroad or an ordinary country road than could be paid for by taxing that vehicle for a year.  That is quite true.  The county roads and byroads in rural Ireland were never meant to carry the heavy lorries and trailers that pass over them from day to day.  When the Minister made that statement I felt that his idea was that these large heavy vehicles and trailers should be removed from the road, but instead of that his idea is to put a heavy tax on them.  It would have been a simple thing to my mind to pass a measure in this House imposing a weight limit for roads especially county roads and byroads.  It would be a very simple thing and would receive the support of the majority of this House.  He might have said: &ldquo;I am going to ensure that no heavy vehicle will be allowed to use the ordinary country roads, the second and third class roads and byroads of rural Ireland,&rdquo; but this is the significant point of the Minister's statement: he took an indirect crack at the private lorry owners some of whom have large trucks or trailers but the biggest offender with regard to heavy vehicles and trailers is Córas Iompair Éireann. Nobody can deny that Córas Iompair Éireann with their heavy vehicles and trucks have done more damage to the roads of rural Ireland than the private lorry owners.</P>
    <P>If the Minister took the straight and narrow path and brought in legislation preventing heavy trucks from using the county roads he would be in direct opposition to the wishes of Córas Iompair Éireann.  They do not mind what they pay in increased taxation because it is the taxpayers and the ratepayers who will pay in the long run but they know that the private man will find it hard to stand up to the increased tax.  The Minister, therefore, instead of being the straight white-haired boy he wished to seem this evening was the first to fall in with Córas Iompair Éireann's plan to squeeze out competition on the roads. I would like to refresh the minds of Deputies here by pointing out further that the big stick is still held in the <Col N="364" /> background by Córas Iompair Éireann: if this measure is not successful in driving the private owner off the road they have the further measure of the 20-mile limit at a later stage.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce being a shrewd politician said to this House that these were only recommendations of Córas Iompair Éireann and that he and the Government had not decided to adopt them.  They are held for the future.  We may not be faced with the 20-miles limit until next year or the year after.</P>
    <P>This measure, apart from bringing in extra money, is designed to give full scope to Córas Iompair Éireann heavy vehicles.  We should take serious note of the Minister's remarks in the House and if it is possible at this stage an effort should be made to force the Minister's hand to limit the weight of vehicles using our roads.  The amount of money handed out from our Road Fund this year to local authorities and the amount raised as extra contributions on local rates is not sufficient to my mind to put our roads in a proper state.  It is not sufficient to steam-roll and tar a sufficient mileage of roads in a reasonable period of time.  While local authorities are doing their best in this regard they find it very hard to keep up the maintenance when these heavy vehicles and trailers are allowed to undo their good work in a few days.  The Minister would be doing a great service to local authorities and to the Exchequer in the long run if he brought in legislation limiting the weight of these vehicles in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It would save the Exchequer and the rates in the long run, because maintenance of roads would be much lighter.  I need not explain to either side of the House the amount of damage a heavy vehicle can do on a road barely 13 feet wide in a boggy country area.  I hope I will get some support of that suggestion from members of both sides of the House.  I do not know whether I will or not.  It is a pious hope.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to ask the Minister whether he and the Government have seriously considered the alternative way of dealing with the whole road question.</P>
    <P>In this Resolution we have a very <Col N="365" /> intricate plan of road taxation.  For a long time I have felt that people should pay for the roads in proportion to their use of them, just as in the case of a man with a shotgun licence.  If I take out a shotgun licence for £2 5s.  I pay a flat rate for the gun from July to the following July.  If I want to use the gun every day of the week I pay for cartridges, and in that way I pay extra every time I use the gun.  Have the Government given careful consideration to the question of a man who will use his motor car for, say, only three or five months of the year?  What is wrong with putting a flat tax of £5, £7 or £10 on the car&mdash;I am not competent to state what the figure should be&mdash; and then, whenever such a man uses his car, let him pay for it through a tax on petrol.  To my mind that is the most equitable way of imposing taxation. It would, also, cut out a lot of addition, subtraction and juggling with figures.  If such a man does not use his car for some months of the year he has paid a flat rate for the 12 months, and why should he be forced to pay a large sum when he is not utilising the roads?</P>
    <P>Suppose, for instance, that petrol and oil were taxed.  Suppose another 1/- were put on the price of petrol, and that the flat tax on cars up to 22 horse-power were reduced to £5.  According as each individual utilised the roads he would pay for the use of them through the increased price of petrol.  Such a proposal would benefit those who utilise their cars to a limited extent, and it would ensure that outfits such as Córas Iompair Éireann, and so forth, would pay their just share.  In addition, to a great extent it would cut out the heavy administrative work entailed by the system which is in operation at present.  I do not know whether that suggestion has been considered by the Government, but I feel sure that portion of it has, at any rate. The system which I have advocated has worked successfully in other countries, and I see no reason why we should not copy, where applicable, the best of the legislation that is enacted in other countries.  In the past we have not alone copied but kept in operation some very unsuitable legislation enacted by an alien Government&mdash;and <Col N="366" /> yet we very seldom take an opportunity, when sound legislation is passed elsewhere, of enacting legislation similar to it for the benefit of our own country.</P>
    <P>I intend to oppose this motion, and I can assure the Minister that there is no whip on my back either inside or outside this House.  If I had an assurance from the Minister for a complete reorganisation of the road system, and of the methods by which road improvement is financed, I should walk into the Division Lobby to support him in any steps which he might take to bring it into operation. This Resolution and the Resolution which was before the House last night, are simply makeshift, lazy methods by which the Minister can bring in extra money to the Department, and at the same time giving Córas Iompair Éireann that long-awaited opportunity of removing some of the competition which faces them on the roads at the present time.  I feel sure that I should not be justified in supporting the Minister on this particular Resolution.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the year the Minister for Local Government issued a White Paper on tht revision of motor taxation.  The only object of that revision was the provision of increased revenue for the Road Fund.  I believe that all unprejudiced and fairminded Deputies will commend the Minister and the Government on their proposal to supplement the Road Fund by increased revenue.</P>
      <P>I have noticed, after two days' debate, that no Deputy of the Fine Gael Party, or indeed of the Labour Party, who is also a member of a local authority down the country has stood up to give the House his views on this proposed taxation.</P>

      <P>The proposal in this White Paper and in the Financial Resolution is to increase the Road Fund by approximately £800,000. When I saw the proposal in the White Paper my first reaction was that the Minister was not getting sufficient money for the Road Fund on this occasion <Col N="367" /> and that the £800,000 which he proposes to bring into it next year is only a mere fraction of the amount required by local authorities to reconstruct and maintain the roads of this country.</P>

      <P>From the figures which the Minister read out in this House this afternoon it is apparent that there are approximately 36,000 miles of road where scarcely a shovelful of extra stones have been applied yet. These roads must be reconstructed over whatever period of years it will take the ratepayers, the taxpayers, the farmers, the motor owners and every group in this country to provide the capital necessary to enable the local authorities to carry out that work.  The present cost of reconstructing a mile of road is roughly between £4,000 and £4,500.  The work to be done will, therefore, cost well over £150,000,000 capital expenditure&mdash; apart altogether from the question of maintenance that will be required in the course of the next five, ten or 20 years or whatever period it will take the community of this country to provide that amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem is more urgent than many Deputies seem to realise. Transport has changed in this country in the past 25 years.  About 25 years ago there were very few private cars or vans or lorries operating in this country.  The main traffic on the roads was horse traffic, and it was very easy to maintain the roads for that purpose. Nowadays, two-thirds of the transport which was formerly done by the railways is done by motor cars, vans, lorries, and so forth, and, in addition, three-quarters of the passenger traffic formerly carried on the railways now goes by road.  We have small public service vehicles of all kinds.  We have thousands of motor cars and small vans, not to speak of all the different types of lorries.  As a result of all that road traffic, it is no longer possible to maintain the roads of this country in a reasonable condition unless the surface is sealed.  That can only be <Col N="368" /> done by a combination of tar macadam and broken stone or by grouting with cement.  One or other of these two methods must be adopted on the greater number of roads in each county in the immediate future.  It goes without saying that a substantial increase is needed not only next year, but for many years, in the Road Fund to supplement what the ratepayers are providing for the upkeep, maintenance and reconstruction of roads. Already, the farmers are bearing a huge burden in maintaining the roads, not to speak of reconstructing them at all.  The local authorities have no possible chance of extracting out of the rates sufficient money to provide the capital necessary to reconstruct those roads.  Therefore, it must be provided from some other source.</P>
    <P>The last time that this road taxation was revised was in 1926.  That is 26 years ago.  Certain figures were given to the then Dáil when proposals were put before it.  The Dáil, at that time, was told the sum that was being raised at that time from taxation and by the local authorities, and what is was proposed to provide from the Road Fund.  At the same time, it was pointed out that the total expenditure on all roads in 1914&mdash;on what I suppose would represent the Twenty-six Counties&mdash;was £650,000.  In 1926 the total expenditure was £1,550,000 of which the Road Fund provided £680,000. These are the figures which were given to the Dáil in 1926.  As I have said, the Government at that time introduced proposals to revise the motor taxation and to increase it in many respects. The total all-in cost of road maintenance and construction on all roads in 1926 was, as I say, £1,550,000.  In this year, 1952/53, the total from the Road Fund and from local taxation spent on the roads is £6,000,000, and that sum is inadequate to maintain and reconstruct them.  I would say that of that £6,000,000 approximately £4,000,000 is spent on the ordinary maintenance and upkeep of the roads so as to enable transport to pass over them, and the balance of about £2,000,000 is devoted to capital expenditure for reconstruction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The proposals of the Minister to bring a further £800,000 into the Road Fund will be welcomed by local authorities because it will have the effect of easing the burden on them to some small extent, and will enable them to do in a small way some of the work which is urgently needed to be done.  The local authorities would have no hope whatever of raising that money from the ratepayers.  They could not possibly do it.  In the county that I come from, one penny in the £ brings in roughly £1,500, so that it would take threepence in the £ to make one mile of road and to reconstruct four miles of road would represent 1/- in the £. That gives a fair idea of what it would cost to do about 1,400 miles of road.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies on the far side of the House, and indeed on all sides, to approach this question in a realistic way, and to forget for the moment the political kudos which they think may accrue to them in the belief that some groups in the community will vote for them at the next electiion&mdash;if one may put it that way&mdash;because they are defending their interests and attacking the proposals of the Government on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the House that each and every group here has a big responsibility placed on it in this matter as public representatives.  Local authority representatives have an added burden of responsibility cast on them on two grounds: first, to the local ratepayers, and secondly to maintain the services within their counties.  One of the big services is the ever-growing demand, the unsatisfied demand up to the present time, for the maintenance and the making of roads.  From some source or other, large additional funds are required to build the roads, or even a fraction of them, up to a middling standard and to try to maintain them at that standard.  Not, I think, in a lifetime of any of us, will half the mileage of the roads in this country ever be brought up to that reasonable standard at which it would be necessary to maintain them for the service of the ordinary people of the country, apart altogether from what would be required for tourists and big motor transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> We hear a lot of talk about people leaving the rural areas A lot of it, unfortunately, is true.  To my mind the bad condition of the roads contributes to some extent to that.  In addition to the 36,000 miles of main roads, there are over 20,000 miles of boreens on which scarcely a single shilling of public money has been spent.  If we want to keep the people in the rural areas, the people who live on those long boreens, then something should be done to provide better roads for them. They are not much concerned with providing smooth roads for motor transport, because they only use those roads to a very small extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities are forced, year after year, and much against their will because they do not want to increase the rates on the ratepayers, to build and maintain those roads for motor transport.  That all leads me to this, that I think this increased taxation on the motoring community, on those who own motor cars, motor vans or any other type of motor vehicle, is just and reasonable. I am prepared to defend it here or elsewhere as being a reasonable tax. So far as the motoring community is concerned it is a very reasonable tax. An extraordinary change seems to have taken place so far as some people in this House are concerned when one compares the views they express now with the views they expressed, when the Road Fund was being built up over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 20 or 25 years resolutions have been passed by the General Council of County Councils and by the county councils themselves asking whatever Government was in power to take over the maintenance, reconstruction and building of the main and trunk roads of the country.  They have asked that it should be done at the expense of the taxpayers.  It is quite possible that there was something to be said for that.  All that shows that public representatives have appreciated that this burden was too great for the ordinary farmers to bear&mdash;the small farmers and the medium-sized farmers of the country.  It was too <Col N="371" /> great to provide all the capital needed to put the roads into decent condition and maintain them.</P>
    <P>This is an effort in the right direction. It is an effort for that purpose and that purpose only.  It has nothing to do with the Budget.  It has nothing to do with the future and maintenance of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Córas Iompair Éireann is charged with its due share of that increased taxation like any other group of motorists. Whether Córas Iompair Éireann sinks or swims, whether or not the present board is fit and capable of organising and maintaining that institution has nothing to do with motor taxation.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that there has been an increase in the number of registered motor vehicles of 260 per cent. on the 1939 figure.  That has imposed an added burden on local authorities and on local ratepayers because additional moneys must be brought into the Road Fund in order to maintain the roads to carry that increased motor traffic.  There is motor traffic on all roads at the present time and all roads need improvement.  They need improvement more rapidly than local authorities can do the work and any money that can be provided for that purpose from any source will be very quickly spent and spent with justification.</P>
    <P>I suppose the chief Opposition Party is entitled to make all the political capital it can out of this proposal, but I am surprised at the attitude adopted by the Labour Party.  The Labour Party is particularly concerned with one large section of the community, the workers who live in the rural areas. Their constant plea is that these people should get fair and constant employment if it can be provided for them.  I am surprised that they should oppose this Resolution, which will make full employment available for anything up to 1,000 men per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking irrespective of who is listening to me in the Gallery.  There are other increases <i>pro rata.</i>  I agree that these increases represent a burden, but the burden is a small one.  If only the genuine hackney car drivers operated hackney cars there would be a living for them. The reason they cannot make a living at the present time is because there are people who have hackney car licences and who only run the cars in their spare time as an addition to their regular means of livelihood.  I understand that some members of the Dáil have hackney car plates.  If these people stayed out of the field there <Col N="373" /> would be a livelihood for genuine hackney car drivers.</P>
      <P>It is significant that away back in 1926 the changeover was first made. Up to that time there was a differential between the hackney owner and the private owner.  There was a committee set up by the Government to inquire into this matter, and a sub-committee on the taxation of road vehicles recommended that the differential should be done away with and that hackney car owners should be brought up to the same level as private owners.  They pointed out that the allowances made to the hackneyman proper were being abused.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (27) of the report it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The sub-committees are convinced that revenue is being lost by reason of persons licensing what are purely private vehicles as hackney owners at a lower rate of duty and that, having regard to the apparent difficulty of securing convictions in such cases, some radical alteration in the system is necessary.  The sub-committee, therefore, have recommended in paragraph No. 68 that hackney motor vehicles seating not more than seven persons should be taxed at the same rate as private motor vehicles.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the report made by a special committee of the Rates Advisory Committee in 1946.  The Government of the day adopted that report and brought the hackney owner up to the same rate as the private owner.</P>
      <P>That position prevailed up to 1947. In the Supplementary Budget in that year increases were put on private owners of all cars but the hackney owner was exempt from that increased taxation for the same reasons that the Minister gave here this evening, namely, because of scarcity of petrol, because they represented a vital link in the transport system and because of the difficulty of getting tyres, spares and other motor repair materials at that time.  It was for those reasons they were exempt.  The private cars suffered an increase of 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes in this Financial Resolution to bring hackney owners once more up to the same rate <Col N="374" /> as the private car owner.  He does that for a very specific and definite reason.  It is not because of the extra revenue he hopes to collect.  It is because he hopes to cut out these fraudulent drivers who have taken out hackney licences and whose cars are not available for hire except for a few hours at night.  These people are injuring the genuine hackney drivers in the city and country.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increased taxation on lorries, it was argued here to-day and yesterday that lorry owners will be put out of business.  I do not believe one single lorry owner will be put out of business.  Does not everyone know that the reason why heavy transport has left the railway and been diverted on to the roads is because motor transport over the years has proved cheaper than rail transport? That is the reason why all the transport has come on to the roads&mdash;for better or for worse, and for worse in many directions, adding great burdens on both the taxpayer and the local ratepayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That traffic has come on to the roads because it was cheaper&mdash; at the expense of the local farmers and ratepayers.  They were maintaining the roads and all the transport of the country left the railways and came on to them.  So long as the people who owned green fields and who were trying to eke out an existence, the little farmer in Mayo and the large farmer in Meath, were prepared to maintain the roads, all the transport and heavy goods left the railways and came on to the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The popular lorry is what is known as the three-ton lorry.  Its tax at the moment is £45&mdash;for two to three tons unladen weight.  It is proposed in this financial motion to increase that tax to £60 for the three-ton lorry&mdash;£15 or 300/- a year of increased taxation, which amounts to a shilling per working day for 300 days.  That is the total increase in taxation on the popular lorry.  Assuming that that lorry is <Col N="375" /> fully employed, I take it that it travels roughly 100 miles a day&mdash;otherwise it could not be fully employed&mdash;and earns 1/- a mile or £30 a week, it will not be a whole lot at 6/- in £30.  It is a very small fraction of increased taxation. Let anyone who likes give any other set of figures to disprove that.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there has been a very substantial and heavily weighted increase on the larger motor vehicles.  I want to ask the Minister a question or two about that.  At one time, under some legislation, the laden weight of all vehicles could not exceed eight tons. Is that law or order still in operation or is there any maximum laden weight for any vehicle on the roads?  There is a further question: is it with the Minister or with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the power rests to limit the use of roads to some of these heavy vehicles?  If local authorities want to make representations to have heavy traffic forbidden on certain roads, to what Minister should they apply?  I would like the Minister to deal with these two matters when replying.</P>
    <P>As I have said, most of the heavy traffic left the railways because motor transport was cheaper.  Quite recently I was discussing that with a man in the motor trade for the last 30 years. He said&mdash;and I agree with him from my own experience&mdash;that motoring is cheaper to-day than it was 20 or 30 years ago.  Then petrol was 2/6 a gallon.  The price went gradually up and down by a few pence, but it was never below 1/7 or 1/8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That might have been so for a short time.  You have had an improvement in 6,000 or 8,000 miles of road in the country, and the main end of the travelling is done on those roads and it costs less.  In the case of the motor engines of 30 years ago, I suppose that even the most popular of <Col N="376" /> them did not give more than 50 miles to the gallon.  They were getting about 8,000 miles out of a set of tyres 30 years ago, and so on in many other respects.  Those figures can be checked &mdash;I am giving them for what they are worth&mdash;and if they are examined home it will be found that motoring is costing less than it was 30 years ago. Cars are more durable and will give double the life.  There is double the mileage from the petrol&mdash;unless it is a car of high horse-power.</P>

      <P>I believe this House should have been unanimous&mdash;it is their own affair whether they are or not&mdash;that they should have been putting pressure&mdash;farmer representatives and local authority representatives &mdash; on the Minister for Local Government to provide an increased fund, whether he got it from motor taxation or otherwise, to build roads and maintain them in the interests of the people who live in rural parts of the country and should not have all the burden put on their backs.  It is extraordinary that it is the city dwellers, the professional politicians on all sides, who are opposed to that all the time.  They want the whole burden of road maintenance carried by the small farmers and large farmers.  It is time that stopped and that each Party used pressure and influence with the Minister to provide extra money this year and to give the whole Road Fund to the maintaining and making of roads.  He is bringing these proposals before the House.  I think he should be commended and that it is in the <Col N="377" /> interests of the ratepayers, in the interests of tourism and in the general interest of the whole community that these additional taxes should be provided for the making of roads.  This is something to be welcomed and it is one which I am sure if there were not such prejudice in the Opposition, they would claim as a great achievement of the House.</P>

      <P>Indeed you are not. For a man who has been a member of a local authority and a member of the General Council of County Councils for a number of years, he has muddled two things, but I am going to take them asunder, no matter how much he dislikes it.  He has succeeded in mixing up the maintenance of roads already in existence with the rebuilding of new roads &mdash; I am referring to the steam-rolling, the capital cost involved in the reconstruction of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Deputy Allen leaves the House, I want him to understand that I want to see the second and third class roads reconstructed but do not want to see the motor users and lorry users of the present day saddled with the burden of reconstructing them. The job is too big for any one section of the community to bear the cost. The Minister told us that there is 36,000 miles of second and third class roads to be reconstructed or rebuilt. That is approximately correct, but if <Col N="378" /> we take the cost as £3,500 per mile we reach a very alarming figure.  If that is clapped on the road users of the present day we can easily see what the result will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to understand that the maintenance of roads is one question and the reconstruction and rebuilding of new roads is a totally different question.  These two things should be kept apart and not confused.  When Deputies are voting on this Resolution they should remember that.</P>
      <P>If the Minister came in and told us he was putting a tax on road users for the purpose of maintaining the roads in their present condition there might be some justification for it.  He does not do that.  Deputies Allen and Corry and several other speakers on the Government side have put forward different and conflicting views.  Deputy Corry said that the reason for these proposals was in order to pay back a sum of £287,000 with which the inter-Party Government are supposed to have played ducks and drakes during their term of office.  Deputy Allen in a very lame attempt to bolster up the proposals said that the money was needed for a totally different purpose. Which of those two gods are we supposed to believe?</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that the Government did not take the Deputies into their confidence and ask them whether they would support these proposals.  In fact, the Government never consults any of their back benchers on any of these proposals in order to feel the pulse of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance of roads should not be confused with the reconstruction and rebuilding of roads. A great deal has been said about one class which will be hit hardest by these taxes, the taximen and the hackneymen. I think these men were paying their fair share already.  I say that openly because I believe that I understand the position of these men fairly well.  The petrol and road tax which they pay at the present time is more than paying for the use they make of the roads.  I say it is wrong and unjust for the Government to tax these people in the way that this Resolution proposes to tax them further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen said that the Minister wants money for the reconstruction of the 36,000 miles of second and third class roads but I say that the taximen and the hackneymen of the present day should not be blistered out of existence to rebuild roads that will be there for generations.</P>
      <P>The policy of the inter-Party Government in its capital Budget is being vindicated.  In respect of permanent capital expenditure, which the rebuilding of the 36,000 miles of roads requires, posterity should pay its own share.  I do not see why the hackneymen or the lorry owners or the taximen of the present day should be put out of existence in order to build roads that will be there for the next 200 years provided they are built properly.  I think that unfair, unjust and inequitable treatment of a class of our people at the present day.  No matter how nasty it may seem to say, our hackneymen and lorry owners are not wanted in the country by the present Government. They are being crushed out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen's talk about the Minister's worries to get money is just so much pious humbug.  The Deputy does not believe a word of it.  The lorry man is being crushed off the roads.  The hackneyman down the country, one of the most useful members of the community, is not wanted.  His business should go to a big monopoly.  Is not all this in perfect keeping with the spirit of the Budget which has resulted in the closing up of the small businesses, the travelling shops and small public houses all over the <Col N="380" /> country?  The small man is not wanted by the present Government.  All that is wanted in this country is a huge mass of hewers of wood and drawers of water on the one hand and a few huge monopolies and cartels on the other.  That is the aim of the present Government.  If it is not the aim it is the result of the policy they are pursuing.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I told the Government that is the road they are treading.  All these men must live within the country.  Perhaps, there may not be much respect on the Government side for the man who is trying to make a living, the lorry owner, the taximen in the cities of Dublin, Cork or Limerick or the hackneyman in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen tried to confuse the issue by saying that a number of private car owners had procured hackney licences and he even went so far as to say that some Deputies were using their private cars for hackney purposes.  This latter I do not believe. The Minister for Local Government has ample power to deal with that by Order.  It does not require legislation. That cock will not fight.  That situation, if such existed, could have been dealt with very quickly.</P>
    <P>It is just as well for Deputies to realise that the taximen, hackneymen and lorry owners are being crushed out of existence, and there is a mild attempt to put those who use tractors out of existence as well.  Last night I spoke on that question.  Tractor owners at the present time are being asked to pay £31,000 more.  These are really the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Last night I asked the Minister a question but the Minister was not in the House at that moment.  I am now asking the Minister whether the tractor owners of this country are doing £31,000 extra damage this year to the roads of this country?  Most of these tractors do not use the roads one day in the month.  The most they do is to travel around on rubber tyres.  They do no damage.  They may carry a hydraulic plough or some other hydraulic implement which is a <Col N="381" /> part of the tractor.  What damage does that do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>The fact remains that these taxes are instigated for the one reason and that is to crush out of existence a certain class of people who are in business and who are playing a useful part in the life of the community. How far more will the Government go on picking the pockets of the people? Since they came into power, they have sought out one section of the community after another.  After the Government have been 15 or 16 months in office there is absolutely no section of the community which has not been hit hard&mdash;for what purpose I do not know.</P>
      <P>I want to ask Deputy Corry a few questions.  He tried to justify the present imposition and to make out that it was due to some debt or other which the inter-Party Government left behind them.  Let us assume that we left crushing debts all over the place after our period of office from 1948 to 1951.  I want to ask Deputy Corry what Government was in office just immediately before October, 1947, which without any cause whatever imposed increased taxes on tobacco and drink which were calculated to bring in £6,000,000 a year?</P>
      <P>Is not this just taking up where they left off then?  What excuse have they for that?  Was it the debts which the inter-Party Government left behind them which induced the Government to make a free gift to the dance hall proprietors of £140,000 and then calmly bring in a Resolution last night, stampeding it through the House in a few hours without any previous warning to Deputies, to collect about the same amount from the drivers of mechanically-propelled vehicles?  Does Deputy Cowan know that the two figures are remarkably similar?  A sum of £135,000 is estimated to be collected from the increase in the cost of driving licences and £140,000 was given as a free gift to the dance hall proprietors.</P>

      <P>I have not addressed Deputy Cowan or anybody in particular. <Col N="384" /> I was directing attention to the remarks I was making through the Chair.  Deputy Cowan interjected about North Mayo.  All I have to say about that is that the present Government won two by-elections out of three, of which North Mayo was one.  I am sure that the constituents in these two places feel mighty sorry now about the two representatives they returned. When they look at them they can say: &ldquo;We voted for this pair of boys and we get this blister on our backs in return, thanks to Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  That is the way they feel about it I am sure. We will wait until the next election.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister has he consulted the sugar company which has a fleet of heavy lorries or lime distributors which are used in the ground limestone business and in the distribution of factory lime?  These cost about £3,300 each.  The tax on them will be £1,105 per annum each.  I want to ask if the sugar company must now pay £1,105 tax on each of these lime distributors or scrap them.  They were only purchased a short time ago.  That is only one possible dislocation of business which may be caused by the present tax.  If the Government are aiming at giving us good roads by the increased tax on tractor owners, car owners, lorry owners and motor bicycle owners it is just the same as trying to wash potatoes in a thimble when we consider the huge sum necessary to reconstruct 36,000 miles of roads at £3,500 per mile if we are to bring them up to a fairly good condition.  If this is the Government's best contribution to finding that sum of money, then I am afraid it is a very poor one.  It will have the effect of putting a number of people out of business on the one hand.  On the other hand, with this extra £800,000 per annum it will take about 200 years to do the 36,000 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our mileage of tar-surfaced roads is all too little.  The ratepayers of the country built most of the roads and they are getting very poor service in some cases.  When I say that, I am referring to the condition of some of the second-class and third-class roads and the boreens which are in a wretched condition.  Nevertheless the ratepayers have to pay rates to maintain <Col N="385" /> them.  I, for one, will be behind the Government in any good scheme which they will bring in to give the country good roads and tackle what has come to be known as the boreen problem, but by this kind of shortsighted, narrow-minded policy which they are indulging in they are fleecing and blistering one small section of the people.  If these people do succeed in meeting the extra taxation the contribution will be very small in proportion to the vast amount of expenditure and work involved.  The Government should tackle this problem in a proper way, such as establishing a road board to deal with the whole question of roads.</P>
    <P>The question of the use of heavy lorries on the roads is too big to go into during this discussion.  For taxi and hackneymen and lorry owners who are performing a very useful work for the community this increased taxation is unjust and inequitable.  It cannot be said that they are not paying already for whatever use they are making of the roads.  If Deputy Allen's contention is true, that these people are being asked to pay for the construction and laying down of new roads, the only thing I have to say about that is that the Government have gone mad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone agrees that in Deputy Sweetman we have one of the most alert Deputies on the Fine Gael Front Bench.  One can see how he stepped into the breach when Deputy Blowick was floundering in a bog of illogicality.  Here is Deputy Blowick's logic: &ldquo;You are going to blister the people by heavy taxation.  You are blistering all those people.  You are putting them all out of business so that they will not have any lorries, any cars or any tractors to pay tax on&rdquo;.  Which way does he want it?  If you are going to blister them it means that they will be paying and if you are going to drive them out of business they will have nothing to pay, so the whole contention is absolutely absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made here that the purpose of this tax is to raise an enormous sum of money and it will raise an enormous sum of money, it is alleged, if the people who have the cars and the lorries and the tractors <Col N="386" /> will pay the increased duties, but to say they will all be driven out of business and that none of them will be in a position to pay any taxes at all does not seem to be very sound logic.</P>
    <P>I intervened in this debate only for the purpose of making a few observations. We have heard it said this evening by Deputy MacBride that there would be a strong movement in Dublin to take over Córas Iompair Éireann and to have it run by the Dublin Corporation.  That matter has been under discussion and the Dublin Corporation has decided not to do any such thing.  Dublin Corporation could not estimate the number of million pounds that it would take to acquire Córas Iompair Éireann for Dublin City.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we are not but I am only dealing with a point that was made here this evening, a point something like Deputy Blowick's logic that has no regard whatsoever to the real facts.  It was further suggested that the effects of this tax will be a reduction in the number of people employed in the bus services in Dublin City.  Any person who has studied this whole matter of Dublin City transport will realise that there cannot be any reduction of employment as far as bus services are concerned and that while there may be revisions of certain routes, more buses and more bus services are needed in the City of Dublin. It has been stressed here in the course of this debate, and it has been stressed on other occasions, that Dublin City is the real paying part of Córas Iompair Éireann, and obviously there cannot be any reduction of employment in Córas Iompair Éireann in Dublin.  Of course, the threat of reduction causes a scare, a scare used for political purposes.  Those scares help to create a certain amount of discontent and unrest and in that way they are considered to be desirable politics, just as the scare being created by Deputy Blowick and others here this evening that it is the policy of the Government to drive all taximen out of business, to drive all hackneymen <Col N="387" /> out of business, to drive all lorry owners out of business, drive the owners of taxis out of business&mdash;that is just a scare that is being used for purely political purposes.  Those scares generally last a couple of weeks at the most and disappear, but it is a pity that a feeling of insecurity or discontent should be brought into the homes of any of our people by Deputies who are using that for the purpose of gaining perhaps a temporary political support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper dealing with these increases has been in the hands of Deputies for a long period.  It has been available to the newspapers.  It has been on the radio and the general public have had quite a considerable time to consider them and to pass judgment on them.  There has not been that outcry in regard to the proposals that one would expect from the calculated speeches that were being repeated so often yesterday evening and here to-day.  As a whole people have taken a realistic view of the proposals and there was a feeling of relief amongst a number of people who had heard the announcement of the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement that the proposals were not more severe.  It is a great pity that we cannot discuss a matter like this entirely divorced from the question: What political kudos or support may I get out of this proposal?  It is a pity it cannot be discussed on the basis of whether it is a good proposal or a bad proposal, whether it is desirable that the roads should be improved, whether it is desirable there should be a fund which would provide for the continued employment of men maintaining and repairing the roads.  I think that Deputy O'Leary and members of the Labour Party who are here would agree that it is desirable that there ought to be such a fund.  It would provide continuity of employment and would also ensure that our roads were kept in the best condition possible.  I know of no proposals anywhere in the country to create new roads.  Deputy Blowick suggested that perhaps new roads were to be created.  As I understand the proposals they are proposals <Col N="388" /> to improve and to put into decent and serviceable condition, the roads of the country.</P>
    <P>As I see it, if the roads are maintained and if this Road Fund is properly used for that purpose, it will not be adequate for its purpose and will have to be improved or supplemented in some way in the near future. We should have general agreement in the House that the Road Fund will be used for the maintenance of roads, that there should be no raids on it and I am satisfied, because of the necessity for maintaining and improving the roads and the expense of maintaining and improving them that there will be no possibility of making any raids on that fund in the future and that the liability of the fund to the extent of £200,000 per year for the next seven or eight years will be the most that will be paid out of it for any purpose other than the purpose of road improvement.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in a discussion such as this, we will have references to the use, or, if you like, the abuse of the roads by enormous vehicles thundering tons of material all over the country. It is one of the big problems which has to be considered not only by this Government but by the Governments of other countries.  In America, on the Continent, in Britain and in all the countries which are supposed to be more civilised, the roads are being more and more extensively used for the conveyance of heavy cargo, and we cannot be the exception.  If progress means the placing of more and more and heavier and heavier vehicles on the road, we cannot stand in the way of it.</P>
    <P>Our problem is a reasonably big problem, but it is not as big as the problems of other and bigger countries in regard to the same thing, and I feel that, however undesirable we may think it to be, there is no possibility of restoring to the railways all these loads of which Deputy Norton said last night the railways were being starved.  You could do it by some form of dictatorship, but a dictatorship is not possible in this country at the moment and I do not think it is possible for some years to come.  Without that form of dictatorship, we could not force <Col N="389" /> this traffic which the railways have lost back on to the railways.</P>
    <P>Our local authorities, our Government and public men generally will have to realise that we have the problem of building better roads, safer roads and bigger bridges for the purpose of conveying these great loads in big vehicles from place to place.  The public want it They want the loads brought from their door to somebody else's door.  They want their cattle taken from the loading banks at the fairs off to wherever they are to be brought.  They do not want to drive them, as they used to, to railway waggons, to put them on, have them brought a certain distance, taken off and driven again.  These people want the road facilities for the heavy vehicles and the heavy loads, and that is why I said some time ago that the provision we are now making for road maintenance, for road repair and upkeep, will not be adequate in a couple of years' time.  We should face that problem, and it is and should be the concern of every Party here, whether on the Government or on the Opposition side.  I am sure that members on the Opposition front bench have desires, ambitions and hopes with regard to being over on this side some time in the future.  If they ever do come over, they will have to face&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whether he does or not, I am making it.  The Minister <Col N="390" /> was approached some time ago in a responsible way by representatives of the taxi proprietors and the employees of taxi proprietors in the city of Dublin.  These men put forward proposals to him and to Deputies.  I read these proposals and I was in contact with them by correspondence.  I told them that I would advocate these proposals in the House and I now ask the Minister to give serious consideration to them.  They were proposals whereby a flat rate of duty would be provided in the case of taxis.</P>

      <P>Yes, provided that the cars are being genuinely used for taxi purposes.  I agree with Deputy Norton that there are alleged hackney owners who are paying a smaller licence duty and in some way defrauding the law, but it is reasonable that these people who use their taxis for the convenience of the public should get some special consideration from the Government, and I strongly impress on the Minister that he should give a trial to these proposals.</P>
      <P>I want to say in conclusion that we can better serve the just cause of a section of the people, such as taxi and hackney owners, by making a reasonable and just approach to the Minister and to the Government than by using them as political ammunition or as footballs to be kicked about on the floor of this House.  I ask Deputies who propose to speak on this matter to request the Minister in a reasonable and genuine way to meet the wishes of the taxi and hackney proprietors.  If they do that much more good will be done for these men than will be done by using them, as I say, as political ammunition or footballs on the floor of this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> It is in the power of Deputy Cowan&mdash; he is one of the very few privileged people in this House&mdash;having looked for that circular amongst his papers, to proceed to the offices of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, either to-night or to-morrow morning and to say: &ldquo;Put the terms of this circular into immediate effect for the Taxi Owners' Association and, if you do not, you will go out of office to-morrow night.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan is one of the few people who have that controlling power over the Minister. Deputy Cowan is so closely connected with Deputy Cogan that they are the political twins of the present-day bag of rags that is bringing this misfortune on the people of the country.  Deputy Cowan is the only man that can insist on a measure of relief being given to the taxi owners and their association in the City of Dublin.  He will do that if he is sincere and if he means to advance the interests of the unfortunate taxi owners for whom he has made this half-hearted appeal in the House to-night.  Anyone who knows Deputy Cowan knows quite well that in his heart he is more concerned about &ldquo;the few miserable votes&rdquo; than any other Deputy.  It is only on account of the &ldquo;few miserable votes&rdquo;, as he described them, that he made this appeal so that he will be in a position to send the secretary of the association the Official Debates showing that he complied with his promise and mentioned it in the House, that he pressed the Minister. The Minister, as usual, gave it, not alone the blind eye, but the deaf ear, but Deputy Cowan will have done his part.</P>
      <P>The people were just recovering from the shock of the Budget when a disastrous, disgraceful and despicable White Paper appeared in Deputies' post, on the desks of newspaper reporters and in the newspapers on the following morning.  What did it contain?  It contained further taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> Anyone with commonsense or intelligence would know that the Fianna Fáil Party, plus Deputies Cogan, Cowan, Browne and ffrench-O'Carroll, were bound to concoct some red herring to direct the attention of the people away from the main issues of the additional burden that is being placed on them and to focus their attention on the condition of the roads.  The Fianna Fáil Party, with all their cunning and cleverness, knew quite well that there were more ratepayers than owners of lorries and motor cars.  They asked themselves how they could successfully divert their attention from the main issue of increased driving licences, increased roads tax on tractors, motors, merchandise lorries and private lorries. They felt that the only way to do it was to gull the people, to say to the honest, hard-working countryman: &ldquo;look at the heavy lorries and the big cars that are using the roads and look at the potholes in the roads that would swallow the cart that you have to use along those roads; look at your unfortunate children having to tramp to school morning after morning up to their knees in the water that collects in those potholes.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil in that way are endeavouring to divert the attention of the people from the main issue.</P>
    <P>We have had a Fianna Fáil Government for 20 years.  I have been ten years in this House and I never heard so much about the roads from Fianna Fáil as I heard in this debate.  If they were mainly concerned with the roads why did not they give active consideration to repairing the roads and doing what we hear they are threatening to do now from 1932 to 1947?  They were not concerned with the roads then.  They know in their hearts that there was more work done on the roads and more employment given on the roads in the three years in which the inter-Party Government was in office than in the 17 years of Fianna Fáil administration prior to that.  During the régime of the inter-Party Government the late Deputy Tim Murphy gave special consideration to the question of road repair.  He was not concerned, as the present Minister is, about having main roads widened and tarmacadamed and made suitable to carry the heavy <Col N="393" /> type of motor cars.  He was concerned to relieve small farmers by improving the roads that they use and by eliminating the potholes on those roads that we heard Deputy Allen crying about to-night.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was the greatest asset and the most beneficial Act that ever passed through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer, Sir, with your permission to the plea that was made here for an improvement of the roads and that the roads be made fit to carry heavy traffic.  I say without fear of contradiction that there are less workers employed on the roads to-day in every county than there were when the inter-Party Government was in office.  If Deputy Maher from LaoisOffaly were here he would have to express agreement with the statement that as a result of the present Government's road policy we have had to dispense with the services of 375 road workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are now unemployed because the present bag of rags is controlling the affairs of this country.  Then we hear about employment and unemployment. Every concern that has a lorry has a driver and a helper and in most cases two helpers.  It is only a gold mine concern that could afford to keep a heavy type lorry on the roads and pay £800 to £1,000 tax on it per annum. This additional burden, as has been pointed out, will be not only a burden on the owners of taxi cars, motor cars and lorries, but on the city people, the townspeople, the room dweller, the cottage tenant, the professional man, the solicitor, the tradesman, the businessman.  Every section will be affected by it.  This is how they will be affected.  The Office of Public Works owns very heavy trucks and lorries which must be taxed at the new rate.  This means that an increased estimate for that office will be presented to Dáil Eireann, and it is the taxpayers who will really have to meet the increase.  The Department of Defence must pay increased taxes on their lorries and the other vehicles <Col N="394" /> which they use for conveying officers, and equipment from place to place. Therefore, this House must pass an increased estimate for that Department, and we will be forced to impose additional taxes upon the people as a result of this unsound and silly piece of legislation.  The post office vans and engineering vans used to transport the men in the engineering section of that Department must also be taxed at the increased rate which means that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be bound to bring a demand for an increase in his Estimate to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The same story will hold good for the Departmnent of Agriculture; their vehicles must carry the additional tax, meaning a further demand on the Central Fund which must be met out of the taxpayers' pockets.  Aer Lingus have lorries, utility vans, public service vans etc. which must carry the new taxes.  As Deputies who are intimate with Bord na Móna know, most of the transport used by that company is of the very heavy type, which will be taxed very much as a result of the present legislation.  This means that there will be a higher estimate for that concern.  The vehicles belonging to the Department of Justice&mdash;police cars, squad cars, prison vans etc. will be taxed at the higher rate, which will in turn, be reflected in an increased Estimate for that Department.  The ordinary taxpayers, who own motor cars, lorries or hackney cars, and the ordinary people in the tenement rooms about whom Deputy Cowan worries so much will have to foot the bill caused by this legislation.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the red herring which Deputy Cowan, Deputy Allen and even the Minister himself endeavoured to throw across the path will not be successful, and the taxpayers know quite well that, since the advent of the present Government, the only legislation that came forth was legislation which increased taxation, reduced the standard of living of our people and increased unemployment.  This Government has made our people poorer and poorer, and has caused further distress and further misery to all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The legislation which is passing <Col N="395" /> through this House at the moment is not being examined as it ought to be examined by those who are supporting the present Government.  Deputy Allen speaks about responsibility, but does he know the meaning of that word? Does Deputy Cowan realise its meaning?  If they mean by responsibility to starve the people and to impose additional taxes upon lorry owners, hackney drivers and everyone connected with the motor industry, if responsibility means adding further to the list of unemployed, it is nothing to boast about.  We hear Deputy Allen saying:&mdash;but who with any commonsense could believe him&mdash;&ldquo;It is cheaper to motor to-day than it was 30 years ago.&rdquo;  To whom does Deputy Allen think he is talking?  If Deputy Cowan made that statement it would pass without comment; if Deputy Cogan uttered it we would not be surprised, but it is surprising, coming from Deputy Allen&mdash;one of the intelligentsia of the Fianna Fáil Party having the facts and figures at his disposal. Deputy Allen informs us that it is easier and cheaper to motor to-day than it was 30 years ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan's motoring was expensive for him only a month ago.  We all realise that motoring to-day is very expensive.  In addition to collecting money from driving licences the Government have made the price of petrol prohibitive, and they collect duty from batteries, plugs and spare parts coming into the country.  A large section of our people to whom motoring was absolutely essential will have to abandon the practice, as it would not pay them to tax their cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wish to encourage the people in the North of Ireland to throw in their lot with us.  However, they will hardly be encouraged to do so when they notice that a driving licence costs £1 in Dublin and in the remainder of the Twenty-Six Counties, while they have only got to pay 5/- for one in Derry and Belfast.  They will hardly say: &ldquo;We do not want a driving licence for 5/-.  We want a £1 one from Mr. Smith <Col N="396" /> and from the Fianna Fáil Government of the Twenty-Six Counties.&rdquo;  They would not be as daft as the Deputies sponsoring this crazy legislation.</P>
    <P>It can be said, without the slightest fear of contradiction, that this is a second Budget.  Newspaper reports informed us that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was making a speech some time ago he slipped up when he threatened that lorries and the distance of the lorries were about to be restricted.  However, he informed us in the House yesterday that that is not so, that the Government have not given consideration to that. Some Deputy suggested in the House to-day that there is a more clever way of restricting the lorries than by putting them off the road completely&mdash;by taxing them to such an extent that it will not be possible for any owner or concern to tax lorries, cars or the other vehicles that they now need.  If this does not work, I prophesy in this House that before this time 12 months legislation will be introduced here and passed, with the support of Deputy Cowan and his colleagues, restricting the activities of lorries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I gave notice that I would raise this matter of the increased rates of interest for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts which affect a very large number of persons who are endeavouring to buy houses or to have their own houses built.  The Minister told us yesterday that he would make a statement to-day on the matter but the statement he made to-day was not a satisfactory reply to any of the five questions on the Order Paper&mdash;one from me, one from Deputy Norton, one from Deputy <Col N="397" /> McQuillan, one from Deputy Doyle and one from Deputy Collins.  I want to point out the hardships that are being inflicted on people who entered into contracts and purchased sites in order to enable a builder to proceed with the work of erecting their houses.  These people had in their possession, before entering on these commitments, a pamphlet issued in connection with the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts stating that the rate of interest on loans under these Acts would be 3¾ per cent. Suddenly, without warning, at a time when some of these houses had been completed and when others were only half completed, the borrowers were told that the loans would be granted only at a rate of 5¾ per cent. and, in some cases, I believe, at a rate of 5½ per cent.  All these people had entered into these commitments on the assumption that the rate of interest would be 3½ per cent. or at most 3¾ per cent. and had budgeted accordingly.</P>
      <P>As a result of the increase in rates of interest, they now find themselves faced with an increased weekly charge of 10/- to 12/6 and in one or two cases of 15/.  Deputies will realise the hardship which such an increase imposes on people whose wages average from £7 to £8 per week.  There may be a few who earn £10 a week, but the majority of these people are in the £8 a week class&mdash;young men who are about to get married and those already married with one or two children who cannot qualify for houses built by the local authorities and who cannot get houses at a fair rent in any part of the city or county.  These people, I suggest, showed great courage, initiative and a magnificent spirit of citizenship by entering into contracts to build their own houses.  They were encouraged by the low rates of interest which they thought they would be charged under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts which they are now informed are to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the question, which I put to the Minister to-day, I pointed out that if the borrowers, who have signed contracts with builders, find themselves unable to proceed with the contracts they may find themselves in the law courts for failure to fulfil their signed <Col N="398" /> contracts and I asked the Minister if he would direct that loans be issued at the old rate of 3½ per cent.  We had no reply, whatsoever, to that question. Deputy Norton, in his question, asked whether with a view to encouraging house purchase, as a desirable social policy, the Minister would arrange with local authorities that money would be made available under the Acts at the former rate of interest.  Another question by Deputy McQuillan asked whether, in view of the unforeseen hardship that would be caused by the new rate of interest on loans to people who have already entered on contracts for the erection of houses on the assumption that they would obtain loans at approximately 3 per cent. interest, the Minister would arrange that the new rate of interest would not be applied to those people.  These questions were not answered either.</P>
    <P>Another question from Deputy Doyle asked if the Minister was aware of the grave injustice which the proposed increased interest imposes on persons who have applied for, and who have been notified of the intention to grant them, loans and who have signed definite contracts and agreements for the repayments of such loans.  The question further asked the Minister if he is aware that, under the revised loan terms, many borrowers would be unable to meet their commitments and would be forced to forfeit their deposits or, alternatively, undertake to pay an exorbitant rent over a period of 35 years and if so if he would state what steps he proposes to take to relieve borrowers of this burden.  That question was not answered either.</P>
    <P>A further question from Deputy S. Collins asked the Minister if he had any proposition under consideration to alleviate the impact on the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Loans of the increase in the rate of interest on advances from the Local Loans Fund. Again, that question was not answered.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of the reply which he did give, said that since the announcement of the variation of the interest rate, representations had been received by him regarding the position of local authorities and borrowers in respect to commitments of <Col N="399" /> the nature referred to in some of the questions.  He added: &ldquo;In order to enable me to examine this position generally, I have requested the housing authorities to furnish specific information as to the amount represented by these commitments in each housing area.&rdquo;  That is the statement which he promised yesterday, a statement that we all thought was going to relieve the minds of those young people, nearly a thousand of whom we have in Dublin alone.  I am aware that there are at least 600 of them in Dublin because over 600 people met in O'Connell Hall during the week to make a protest against their treatment and against the proposed imposition of an extra 10/or 12/- a week.  There are people in Dublin who, to-day, were sent for by their solicitors and were called upon to sign a mortgage to-morrow morning under the terms of which they would have to pay 5½ per cent. interest.  If they sign that mortgage, they have no possible chance of getting any redress from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hold that the Minister should instruct the county councils, especially the Dublin County Council, that in the case of any applications for loans lodged with them before the issue of the recent National Loan, these loans should be granted on the terms which the applicants then understood would apply to such loans.  Where it can be proved that some of these people purchased sites, and entered into contracts with the builder to build their houses within the last six months or the last two months, that, I suggest, showed a genuine intention on their part to purchase their homes under the terms of the pamphlet issued in connection with the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, by loans granted at 3½ per cent.  I am asking the Minister to see that the pledge given to these people is honoured.  I do not want to give offence to anybody, but I understand that applications made to the county council for loans some time ago were held up or delayed because of some scarcity of staff or because of the absence of some official through illness.  A large number of young men and women are now going to be victimised because of that shortage of staff in <Col N="400" /> the county councils and because of the failure to deal with the applications in the rapid manner in which everybody hoped they would be met.  I was asked by one man who attended the meeting of protest to ask the Minister&mdash;and I hope he will not take offence at my putting the question to him&mdash;whether it was a fact that since the issue of the Report of the Central Bank he gave instructions to local authorities to go slow with these applications.  I scarcely think it possible that the Minister would issue such instructions but I promised to ask him the question.  I do not propose to occupy the time of the House much further as I should like to give one or two of my colleagues who have a special interest in this matter an opportunity of speaking.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine two years ago decided to build.  He looked for a site because he had a pamphlet on the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act setting forth 3¾ per cent. rate of interest.  He went ahead from that date and started the house in January, 1952.  The application went to the council in January, 1952, and he got approval in February, 1952.  Now the house is ready and he has paid a deposit of £130.  If he does not get the money immediately he loses that deposit.  Let no one think that the unfortunate builder, who holds the deposit, will make anything because he is now pressed&mdash;the smaller builder particularly&mdash;for interest on the money he has borrowed to purchase the goods that built the house.  Is it possible that once an applicant gets approval for a loan and asks for a grant the grant cannot be made ever again on that house; that if the person who applied does not go on he kills the opportunity of anyone else getting a grant on that same house?</P>
    <P>The next case is in Dublin, too.  In May, 1951, a friend of mine looked for a house immediately to rent.  He had no hope and decided to buy a house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  He approached a builder, paid a deposit of £200.  He sought a loan on the 5th March, 1952, and got provisional approval on the 23rd April, 1952.  The house was commenced in June, 1952, and notice of completion was given on the 18th September, 1952.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> The final valuation was dated October, 4th, 1952.  He must now pay interest at the rate of 5¾ per cent.  The mortage is now to hand and he must sign immediately or pay the builder 6 per cent. on the full value of the house until the money is paid to him.</P>
    <P>These cases show the hardship inflicted in Dublin City.  Here is a letter from the very centre of the city from Deputy Cowan's and my own constituency.  Maybe that is why this letter is written firmly and in a way that others will not like.  Here is the letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Byrne:</P>
    <P>I appeal to you, on behalf of myself and thousands of others, to do all in your power to bring the grave injustice of the Government's new decision to increase the county council loan by 2 per cent. home to those responsible for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, will I bring home to the Government what is happening.  The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We applied for a loan from the county council last July and it was duly sanctioned on the 5th September. My future husband signed a contract with the builder and paid our deposit.  It has taken us three to four years to save this deposit and by withdrawing now we lose all this.  On the other hand we must now pay 54/- per week for our house.  An increase of 10/6 weekly out of a wage of £6 15s. is quite a lot.  We shall have £4 1s. left to live and bring up children on.  We had budgeted to the last halfpenny when considering buying our house and now find it would be impossible to go ahead.  We shall have to do either of three things:</P>
    <P>(1)  Break off our engagement and forget about marriage.</P>
    <P>(2)  Save for another 10 years to get a sufficiently high deposit to make the weekly repayments smaller.</P>
    <P>(3)  Emigrate.</P>
    <P>Are Irishmen and women not supposed to get married?  Must they go on saving for another ten years before they can get a home, and even <Col N="402" /> then may not be able to afford to have children?  Must we leave our own country to enable us to get married?  Surely this order is wrong on moral grounds.  God never meant any country to be governed like ours, and may He forgive those responsible for it.</P>
    <P>I know your constituents can rely on you to show the drastic consequences of this measure to the Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The letter concludes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You have helped us before and will not fail us again; something must be done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This letter is from an employed girl who is working over eight hours a day. She helped the young man to save the deposit and that is what they are faced with.  I do implore the Minister to get ahead quickly and, thinking of those people who depend on him, on the Government and on the House, to put forward their case, to do so immediately.  I understand that there are from 600 to 1,000 such people in the City of Dublin.  I got a number of such cases and everybody in the House has got a number.  The total number in all Ireland, I understand, does not exceed 2,500.  I understand further that many are cases affecting Dublin County Council.  These are nearly all City of Dublin boys and girls, workers living in the city in one or two rooms, who had to get away and go out to the county because the City of Dublin is being extended and there are no sites for private building in the centre.  We in the corporation are going further. The City Manager and Dublin Corporation had some money in hand and as long as the money lasts he will with the approval and gratitude of the corporation deal sympathetically with these cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Byrne for leaving me three minutes.  I do not wish to appeal to the <Col N="403" /> Minister on a sentimental basis; I want to make a forthright appeal for people who have already negotiated for a contract or entered into a contract to build their houses.  I am more interested in the limited number of people in my own area who are affected by this.  The Government profess to be anxious to keep the people in rural Ireland.  Here is an opportunity for the Minister for Local Government who himself has sprung from rural Ireland and who himself understands very keenly the difficulty of the housing problem in rural Ireland. I want to make an appeal on behalf of the person who has <i>bona fide</i> entered into a contract and partly completed the contract for his house on the basis that his loan would be repayable at the rate of 3¾ per cent. The impact of the extra 10/- or 11/on the people for whom I am advocating is very serious because in the main they cannot compete with the type of wage or remuneration available to industrial workers or the people for whom my colleague Deputy Alderman Byrne has pleaded.  There is a very limited number of cases in rural Ireland where the initial stage of the contract has been completed, where in many cases the building has been completed and where approval for a grant has been issued for a considerable time by the local authority. Their number is limited and this is not a recurrent responsibility.  I would urge the Minister to examine them and to find some solution of the difficulty. I can appreciate that he may be in a position to say: &ldquo;We have got the money at 5 per cent. and we cannot give it out at less.&rdquo;  I was wondering whether it would be possible for his Department to work out a scheme amending the Small Dwellings Act so as to extend the period for payment. That would minimise the impact now. They might find a compromise solution by extending the time.  If they could find some measure to meet the people involved they could alleviate the full impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making this appeal on any grounds other than the ground of justice to people who <i>bona fide</i> have committed themselves under the new <Col N="404" /> repayment rates to payments a little in excess of their capacity to carry. I do that because I know that only a limited number of cases is involved, that it will not be a recurrent charge on the Minister's bounty and that it will give justice to very deserving people.  Deputy Byrne has already pointed out that the people involved have shown an excellent spirit of citizenship because, not being able to obtain houses otherwise, they have undertaken the task of building their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that a limited number of my constituents are affected by this matter. I believe that the sudden decision on the Minister's part to increase the interest rate on loans issued under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts came as a complete bombshell to those people in my constituency who had already committed themselves in respect of the purchase of new houses. Many of the people involved studied the position very carefully from the point of view of financial expenses before they took the preliminary steps in the purchase of a new house.  They <Col N="405" /> made certain commitments on the understanding that they would be able to obtain a loan at the old rate of interest.  Many of these people will not be able to bear the extra burden imposed upon them by the increase in the rate of interest.  I feel there is a moral responsibility on the Minister to ensure that those people who have already committed themselves in this respect will not suffer as a result of the change in the rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to that of Deputy Byrne, Deputy S. Collins and Deputy McQuillan.  I am concerned with those people who have applied to the Dublin County Council for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  There may be some doubt about it in the minds of some Deputies but I say that the number of people affected in Dublin City and County runs into well over 1,000. It is manifestly unjust that these people should be victimised&mdash;particularly those who had already made contractual agreements with builders and who, in many cases, had put down a deposit.</P>
      <P>The Minister said to-day that he had written to local authorities asking them for an estimate of the expenditure that would be affected by those who had already made commitments.  I submit that that is not enough.  If the policy of increasing the loan charges to 5¾ per cent. is pursued by the Government it will have the effect of halting that particular end of the housing drive.  The people affected are people who need houses and who want to build them for themselves.  The Minister's proposal will deny them the opportunity of doing so with the result that they will be thrown back on the local authorities who, by force of circumstances, will have the task of providing houses for them.  I suggest to the Minister that this step was very unwise and needs to be reconsidered immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only two points.  The first one is that we are in the middle of the financial year and that a programme of £35,000,000 capital development was announced on Budget day up to the 31st March next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> I feel that it should be financed from that programme which was announced at that time.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like the Minister to finance the programme already under way in respect of those cases where applications have been made.  If he could even finance the programme under way I think he would bring a certain measure of relief to those people who have already committed themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin City we have decided that no person who applied prior to the 24th September will in any way be affected by the Order.  I understand that the Dublin County Council have £200,000 which they can make available for people who had submitted applications.  I think there is a moral responsibility on them to do so and that, in providing for the rest, they should have the full co-operation and support of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the speeches made in the past 25 minutes, I am forced to the conclusion that the Deputies were more interested in hearing themselves than in hearing my explanation: I should not like to accuse Deputy Byrne of such thoughts, but still I am sure he will not blame me if I am tempted to think so on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of Dublin would not believe you, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that I came away from Question Time having satisfied the reasonable requirements of those Deputies who addressed questions to me on this matter.  I am just as alive to the whole position as any Deputy in the House and I should be just as anxious to observe any contract which I might enter into with an individual, as any of the Deputies who have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first thought, as soon as the change was announced to local bodies, was for those people who had contractual obligations or who had entered into the type of arrangement to which Deputy Collins has referred.  I was concerned as much as any Deputy to <Col N="407" /> see to it that any such applications would be honoured to the fullest extent.  I told the Deputies who addressed these questions to me that, in order to deal with the matter, I had sent a circular to local bodies asking them to certify the amounts which were involved in such contracts and such undertakings.  I do not know what assurance Deputies desire me to give, in addition to that assurance which I have given them.  One can, of course, in a matter of this kind, roam over the whole question of interest rates and so forth.  One particular problem was raised in the questions which were addressed to me.  I was concerned with that same problem following the announcement of the increase in the rate of interest.  I have told the House the steps which I have taken in the matter.  All that I can do, further to that, is to give to the Deputies, and to all those outside, the assurance that I will do my best to ensure that any contracts made or understandings arrived at between local bodies and outside individuals who have arranged to build or to purchase their own houses&mdash;where these contracts can be shown to have been made&mdash;will be honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is proposed to build a separating station at Ahakista to relieve the problem of milk collection there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Ahakista district is within the supply area of the Drinagh Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., the question of the erection of a cream-separating station there is a matter for that society.  I understand, however, that the Society does not propose to establish a cream-separating station in the Ahakista area as it is satisfied that the operation of such a station would be wholly uneconomic and furthermore would divert milk from neighbouring <Col N="412" /> stations owned by the society, thereby rendering their operation also uneconomic. The only solution for the farmers in the area who live at undue distances from the existing cream-separating stations is for them to arrange for the conveyance of their combined milk supplies to the nearest station as is done to advantage in many other areas throughout the country.  I also understand from the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society that they are now about to make a strong effort with the co-operation of the Drinagh Society to persuade the local farmers, in their own interests, to combine to operate such a cartage system.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I presume the Deputy wishes to know how much of the total quantity of milk delivered to creameries was used for the production of butter in the period specified.  The answer is approximately 102,000,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, on the basis that production of butter from 1st October to 31st December, 1952, is at the same level as for the corresponding period of 1951, the total production of butter for the calendar year 1952 would be about 682,000 cwt.</P>

      <P>My Department does not operate fishing trawlers.  The position as to the fishing boats to be operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara was given in my reply to the Deputy on 11th June last.  The establishment of fish-canning and fish-curing industries is a matter for private enterprise.  As regards quick-freeze plants the position is that until sufficient experience has been had of the results accruing from the operation of the small plant installed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara at Killybegs with the object of testing the possibilities for such plants at other centres I would not feel justified in asking the board to consider the setting up of a quick-freeze plant elsewhere.</P>
