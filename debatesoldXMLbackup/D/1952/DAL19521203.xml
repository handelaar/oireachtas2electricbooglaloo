      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the quantity and value of fruit pulp and juice imported during the years in question.  As the official import list did not prescribe a separate heading for pulp, it is not feasible to segregate fruit pulp from fruit juice for these years.  The amount imported by jam <Col N="478" /> manufacturers is not available as a separate total.</P>

      <P>The provision of a public water supply is the responsibility of the local sanitary authority. There is provision for a State contribution through the Department of Local Government towards the cost of water supply schemes and I do not think it would be appropriate that An Bord Fáilte should also be asked to contribute.  It was not the intention that the funds which may be made available to An Bord Fáilte under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, should be so utilised.</P>

      <P>As I stated last week in reply to a question by Deputy MacCarthy, the Government have decided that there should now be a detailed examination of the nature and extent of the facilities required for an airport at Cork and of the minimum cost at which such facilities could be provided. This examination is now being undertaken in my Department and during the course of it the suitability of the site at Ahenesk, Midleton, and of various other possible sites will be fully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a statement on the 16th July last he said that there were two suitable sites in Cork?

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the 5,000 tons of timber recently exported to Belfast from Dublin were sold at approximately £130 per Dublin standard, this price being some £50 less than current Dublin prices, and if he will state whether before the issue of export licences for such timber inquiries were made by his Department <Col N="484" /> as to whether or not the timber in question was offered at the reduced price to local authorities or others engaged in building in Éire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to questions on the 19th November about this timber, I have no information as to the terms upon which the timber was sold.  The reply to the second part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that an export licence was issued in respect of timber bought at a high price with hard currency, and that it was sold to merchants in Belfast at a considerably lower price than that prevailing at present in the Twenty-Six Counties? Were no inquiries made to see if that timber could be sold locally at the reduced price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is as I have explained it in my reply.  In this country there is available an abnormal stock of timber which was purchased at prices substantially higher than those now prevailing in the world markets.  I considered that it would be an advantage if some part of that stock could be disposed of by way of export.  I informed the Timber Merchants' Association that I would give an export licence if they could find an opportunity of disposing of part of the stocks.  They did, to a very small extent.  My undertaking to give that licence was in reply to a claim by them that there was an obligation on the Government to relieve them of the possibility of loss in having built up that stock at the then Government's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that this export represents 4 per cent. of the available stocks of timber in this country?  It is known that a further offer was made of a similar quantity. It is also known that a further quantity, equal to the other offers, is also available.  These are facts.  The present prices of timber are fixed by a Maximum Control Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  That Order was fixed last year.  There has <Col N="485" /> been a considerable drop in the world price of timber.  The timber which was exported was bought at high cost with hard currency.  If an advantage is to be given by selling our stocks at a reduced price, surely that advantage should be given to people in the Twenty-Six Counties and not to merchants in Belfast who are taking advantage of a loophole in their own import legislation.  There is a difference of more than £50 a standard between the price which our builders pay and the price at which it was sold in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to any alteration in the Maximum Prices Order, the Prices Advisory Body tell me that they must have regard to what the timber actually cost the importers. If anyone can import timber at the lower price now prevailing there is no restriction on him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a supplementary question to the Minister when this matter was previously raised in the House.  I asked him whether he was aware that the price at which that timber was exported was lower than the price at which local authorities are buying the same timber in this country. Does the Minister deny that the timber has been exported at £50 a standard less than the local authority can buy the same timber in this country?  Why should our local authorities not get first preference in the matter of buying timber at the reduced price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the terms on which the timber was sold.  Deputy Larkin said that the price was less while Deputy Donnellan said it was higher than the price prevailing here.  I did not inquire.  In reply to a request from timber merchants who said that they imported stocks to an abnormal extent in response to a request to do so from the Government then in office, and who claimed that they were liable to lose money because they had complied with that request, I offered to help to relieve their situation if they could secure export possibilities.  They have not been able to do so except to an insignificant degree in relation to the stocks available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="486" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem rather unusual that persons in Belfast can buy timber from us at £50 a standard lower than the price at which local authorities here can purchase timber?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's information.  I have no such information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They can purchase it at £50 a standard less than the Dublin Corporation or any local authority in this country can purchase it.  The Minister says that he has no information. He has the Prices Section of his Department and he also has the services of the Prices Advisory Body. Surely there should be no difficulty in getting his Department to ascertain the price at which this deal went through?  In any case, the exporters themselves will tell him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that a number of firms are involved.  One firm might decide to sell the timber immediately at less than it cost them, while another firm might try to avoid a loss by not disposing of their stocks for a longer period of time.  It is a matter for decision by each individual firm and not by any organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But if cheap timber is going, surely our own local authorities ought to get first preference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say, in view of his repetition of the statement that there are abnormal stocks of timber in the country and in view of the suggestion by Deputy Larkin that further offers are being made from outside for some of our timber, what steps he has taken to examine the situation and whether he proposes to allow an open door for the sending of further supplies of timber from this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as further exports are concerned, the number of applications for additional export licences are very few.  There is no scarcity of timber anywhere.  It is possible for any timber merchant to buy all the timber he wants and to import it into this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inquire if the timber exported to Belfast was sold at £83 per Petrograd standard and if there is a further offer for £80?  Is there not a responsibility on his Department to see that timber bought at a higher price with hard currency is first made available to our own citizens at the reduced price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks me to request the Prices Advisory Body to investigate the position regarding timber and also, whether on its recommendation or not, that I should make an Order fixing a maximum price for timber at less than the price which was paid for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that these timber merchants who are holding these stocks will incur a loss.  It is for themselves to see how they can minimise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <P>In the case of certain goods subject to export control the position is as follows:&mdash;(i) Goods made from or containing <Col N="490" /> sugar (for example, jams, cakes, sweets, chocolates, etc.) may be exported without a licence provided they are sent by parcel post.</P>
    <P>(ii) The Minister for Agriculture has arranged that, during the Christmas period, the following may be sent as <i>bona fide</i> gifts to persons in Great Britain without an export licence:&mdash; One turkey, one goose, one duck or fowl, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, tinned vegetables, fish (other than salmon), honey.</P>
    <P>I think I should emphasise that what I have said covers the position regarding our own export controls, but it must be remembered that gift parcels are also affected by British import regulations.  I understand that the two main British controls relating to food parcels from this country are:&mdash;(i) A regulation prohibiting entirely the importation of gift parcels containing canned fruits, dried fruits, chocolates and sugar confectionery; and (ii) a regulation prohibiting residents in Britain from sending money abroad for the purchase of rationed foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>The restrictions in the export of hides, together with the fixed price and grading requirements, are part of comprehensive arrangements designed to ensure adequate supplies of suitable hides for the home tanners, and to encourage the development of carcase beef exports.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As matters stand national teachers already fall fully within the scope of the Social Welfare Act, 1952. It is, however, my intention to make under Section 12 of the Act regulations that will have the effect of confining their insurance to widows' (contributory) pension and orphans' (contributory) allowance.  National teachers belong to a general class that includes such groups as established civil servants and pensionable officers of local authorities.  I do not see any <Col N="495" /> sound reason for making an exception in the case of national teachers; in fact I think I would be doing them a disservice if I did.  There is this great difference between the position under the present law and what it will be after the new scheme comes into operation.  Now a woman cannot qualify for a widow's pension on her own insurance; when the new scheme comes into operation she can.  And in the future, moreover, a woman who is compelled to retire on marriage will be able to carry on her insurance by becoming a voluntary contributor in her own right.</P>

      <Col N="497" /> As regards the second part, I understand that under the scheme of free passages for ex-members of the British forces emigrating to Australia, Irish citizens are treated in exactly the same manner as British citizens.</P>
    <P>The scheme was brought into operation by the Australian Government in March, 1947.  It provided that applications to take advantage of the immigration facilities which it offered would be considered from ex-members of the British Armed Forces if submitted within two years from the 31st March, 1947, or within two years of the date of the ex-servicemen's release from those forces whichever was the later, provided that in all cases the date of release was not later than the 31st December, 1948.</P>

These works are extremely costly.

      <P>Would the Minister put before the commissioners that this particular estate, which I believe is about the worst of its kind in the whole country, should be given priority in regard to any new holding which will become available and which is the property of the Land Commission and have migration on a large scale carried out on that estate with a view to eliminating the rundale that exists there; in other words, will the Minister give it immediate priority?</P>

      <P>Although the Dickens estate is certainly one of the worst estates, there are, of course, other bad estates, and I have found it very difficult up to the present, in dealing with this rearrangement problem, to determine the order of priority.  The Deputy will appreciate that it may not be possible to deal with the estate which is most badly in need of consideration by reason of the fact that there is no land available to go into the pool to <Col N="501" /> increase the holdings.  The question of the Dickens estate is under consideration and, if it is possible to take any steps by migration or otherwise to speed up the rearrangement, I will do everything possible to ensure that that is done.</P>

Arrangements for such review were put in hand immediately on the termination of the experimental scheme but the review could not be completed pending the outcome of negotiations in connection with a revised Civil Service scheme.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will direct that an inquiry be undertaken into the existing arrangement for collection of taxes or rates by local statutory bodies with a view to establishing whether the necessity still arises for the employment of collectors particularly in urban areas when the ratepayers could pay the amounts due direct to the offices of the local authorities or to their treasurers and, further, if he will inquire into the possibility of arranging that these taxes be paid quarterly or monthly as many ratepayers complain that the demands for two moieties of rates within a space of six months are heavy burdens on their resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to direct that an inquiry on the lines suggested by the Deputy be undertaken. The existing system of rate collection has proved to be both cheap and efficient. While the rate is normally payable in two moieties, to meet cases of hardship, provision is made for acceptance by the rate collector of payments on account.  In the case of small dwellings and local authority houses, the tenants' payments in respect of rates are included in and payable with the rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations on this matter, but not from the town commissioners.  The onus of providing weighing facilities generally rests on the market authority, but the Ballybay Town Commissioners relinquished their lease of the markets in 1947.  The clarification of the responsibilities of the local authority and the owner of the markets would seem to be a matter for legal investigation in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a request for a licence for the establishment of a cheese factory in the Ballymore-Mayglass area of County Wexford.  The proposal was that a proprietary concern would operate the factory.  On grounds of general policy I was not prepared to grant the licence and I so informed the <Col N="518" /> applicants.  I arranged, however, for a number of surveys of the area and other neighbouring areas in south County Wexford to be made by my Department and by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society to ascertain whether the local farmers desired the provision of creamery facilities, and what milk supplies would be available or likely to be made available.  All the reports furnished to me in this matter indicated that the farmers had no interest in the provision of creamery facilities in South Wexford and that milk supplies were very low in these areas.  I even offered to arrange for the provision of a travelling creamery to test out the milk supplies but the local farmers did not accept the offer. I may say that this offer is still open if the farmers should themselves decide to avail themselves of a travelling creamery for next season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept the fact that there would be material there for the purpose of setting up a cheese factory since the application is made by the local branch of Muintir na Tíre, who represent the local farmers, and should be in a position to know whether or not there is a sufficiency of milk to justify the establishment of a factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Several recommendations and representations have been made to me by various organisations and by Deputies for the provision, first of all, of a travelling creamery and, secondly, of a cheese factory.  I have refused on three occasions already to grant facilities for a cheese factory because I do not believe that it is good policy to allow proprietary interests to go around collecting milk from the farmers; and, secondly, we want to have all the milk available diverted into the creameries for the purpose of manufacturing butter.</P>

      <P>On the last day I was discussing the lack of progress under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I want to impress on the Minister now the absolute necessity that exists for having that Act reviewed at this stage in the light of our experience over the past year.  In so far as the Act has failed to come up to expectations in establishing industries in these areas, we should now review the whole situation and see how far the Bill can and should be amended.  I believe that there is room for amendment.  Might I suggest that while the principle contained in the Bill might be retained&mdash; that the initiative should come from the particular locality or from the <Col N="523" /> people of the locality to establish an industry &mdash; it should have over-all power in respect of areas from which the initiative or the necessary capital may not be forthcoming through no fault of the people there.  In so far as the Bill is framed to assist industries which would be proposed on the initiative of the local people&mdash;people with the necessary capital or the necessary experience and the enthusiasm to go ahead&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose was to offer some useful suggestions to the Minister which might help to alleviate the poverty and hardship that is occurring in certain areas.  Lest it should be the cause of widening the debate to the point of irrelevancy, I shall not pursue the matter except to repeat what I said here last year. The development of forestry in these areas is a matter to which the Government should give full attention.  It can help to stop the flight from the land and it can help to stop emigration. It can help to bring work into areas which cannot be catered for by any other measure that has been passed in this House.</P>

    <P>I should like to remind the House <Col N="524" /> of what has happened in North and South Mayo in respect of three forests which were established there during my time in office.  The same could apply to many country areas where other industries may not be established or where, perhaps, it would not be possible to make them a commercial success if they were established.  In the course of a reply to a parliamentary question which I put down, the Minister for Lands informed me on the 5th November last, as will be seen from column 896 of the Official Report, that the amounts paid in wages in Lough Carra, Doolough and Nephin Beg forests, from the dates of establishment up to the 30th September, 1952, are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I think it is fairly easy to reduce unemployment in towns and cities.  It may not, however, be so easy to devise a means of reducing unemployment or of providing employment in certain rural areas.  If the Minister and the Government are seeking a solution of the unemployment problem I suggest that the Minister for Lands has the answer to it and that it will be of twofold benefit.  On the one hand it will help to wipe out or to reduce unemployment in certain areas where no other industry can come to the rescue and, on the other hand, the State is establishing for itself a crop of timber which in a short time will be of immense value to the country.  At present, the value of our imports of timber is in the neighbourhood of £8,000,000 per annum.  If we devoted more attention to forestry, that figure could be reduced considerably in a short period of time and would confer immense benefit on the country.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index has now reached 122 points as against 102 points less than two years ago.  That represents an increase of 20 per cent.  Quite definitely, the Government is in large measure to blame for that increase in the cost of living by reason of the fact that they have no policy.  The last general election was fought on the question of an increase in the cost of living.  I think it would not be out of <Col N="525" /> place to ask the Minister now to mention, when he is replying, any single article of food, or any article that is taken into account in compiling the cost-of-living index, which increased in price during the period of office of the inter-Party Government with the exception of butter which went up 2d. a lb. and petrol which went up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A stupendous increase. A crippling increase on the working man.  Before being returned to office, it was stated that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party was to bring down the cost of living.  In particular, the people of Dublin appear to have been misguided and misled in that respect. They understood that if the Fianna Fáil Party were returned to office not alone would the cost of living be stabilised but it would be reduced. Their rightful anger at being taken-in and duped has been portrayed in the result of the by-election which was held in North-West Dublin a few weeks ago. They showed then, quite clearly, that they did not want to be taken-in.  It is possible that some increase in the cost of living might have taken place even if the inter-Party Government had been returned to office but there would not have been an increase, as there is to-day, to 122 points as compared with 102 points in February, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister's word.  However, even the increase from 109 points to 122 points is a very steep increase for the working man. Is the Minister behind his colleague, <Col N="526" /> the Minister for Finance, or is it Government policy now that the ordinary working man must pay income-tax? Is the Minister aware that county council workers in Mayo have been assessed for income-tax and are compelled to pay it on £4 a week?  I should like to hear the views of some of the Labour Deputies in that respect. This is the first time in the history of our country that the working man has had to pay income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He is working for the county council to-day.  If that work should cease he might go into the Forestry Department and get the same wage there, or he might go to work for a farmer for the same wage.  In any case he is billed for income-tax. Nurses in county hospitals in every single county all over the country have also been served with assessment forms and have got to pay through the nose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that that policy of squeezing absolutely the last drop of life-blood from every citizen in the State, which now appears to be the policy of the Government&mdash;not a single class appears to escape &mdash; is all wrong. Even at this late hour I would suggest that the Government should examine the policy which was pursued by the inter-Party Government.  They should remember that the country is pretty much the same all the time.  They have to deal with the same people, the same land, the same workers, the same towns and cities and the same weather that the inter-Party Government had to deal with.  What is puzzling everybody is how this sudden change has come about in the short space of 16 or 18 months.  While we were in office our policy was assailed here.  That policy was to give the greatest possible measure of employment and to provide as decent wages as the taxable capacity of the country could afford, to put money into circulation and to induce our young men and women to engage in the task of <Col N="527" /> rebuilding the country.  The country is not ours, nor does it belong to Fianna Fáil.  The country belongs to every single citizen of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I think our approach to the problem was the correct approach and the policy pursued by the present Government for the past 18 months has proved that it was the correct approach. Every man and woman down the country, even diehard supporters of Fianna Fáil, now admit that ours was the correct approach.  The present Government apparently believes in freezing the life-blood of the nation &mdash;in slapping down increased taxes upon those in receipt of wages and in taxing food and the necessities of the people generally.  I say that is a wrong and a disastrous policy and the people will not have it.  They are emigrating to countries where conditions like these do not exist and where there is not such a tyrannical Government in power.  Time has shown that the inter-Party policy was the wise policy. The people of North-West Dublin have proved that and I have no doubt that the people of North Mayo and Waterford would have given the same verdict had they known what the full effect of the Budget meant.  These two by-elections took place within a short period after the Budget was introduced and before the full impact of the Budget was felt but the people know it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>It does not matter who selected the time; the people had not felt the full impact of the Budget at that time but the people of North-West Dublin had felt the impact of the new taxation and they have given their verdict.  Might I point out to the Tánaiste that in my hearing some of the Government speakers in the North Mayo election said: &ldquo;Oh, this Budget will never come into operation?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil supporters there could scarcely believe their ears but they were anxious to clutch at any straw and they did believe that but the Dublin people did not believe it.  The people of North Mayo and of Waterford would not have accepted it if they had had more opportunity to reflect.  Now they know that the steep increase in the price of food is a real danger to their existence. I do think that the change in the people's attitude will serve a very useful purpose and that is that Fianna Fáil will think twice in future before they seek power on false promises&mdash; promises which they have no intention of fulfilling.</P>
      <P>I want to say that a new Party, full of enthusiasm and with the desire to turn the country into a Utopia, might possibly be excused for making false promises, but here we have a Party who had 16 years of Government, who knew exactly what the taxable capacity of the country was and they cannot be excused for the propaganda in which they indulged during the elections.  If one goes into any shopkeeper, big or small, or to any man engaged in industry at the present time, they have all the one complaint: The bottom has fallen out of their business completely and trade is stagnant.  Every single phase of life and business in the country has been attacked and undermined by the policy of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I repeat what I said a moment ago, that the policy of the inter-Party Government is well worthy of consideration now when the opposite extreme is being tried out.  I suggest in all seriousness to the Government that they have got to change their policy, that they have got to adopt a policy which will give employment to our young people at home and utilise taxation for the purpose of rebuilding and developing our country, which is sadly behind the time in many <Col N="529" /> respects.  There are immense schemes of development still awaiting to be carried out even before we get level with many of our neighbours.  It would be well, even at this stage, to go back to the policy of the inter-Party Government and to examine the whole position anew.  Our young people who are being forced to emigrate are willing to work at home if work is provided for them.</P>
    <P>There are very few anxious to leave the country if work could be provided for them at home but the flight from the country was never as great as it is at the moment.  Simply because the passport regulations have been eased off, no statistics are now available as to the extent of emigration but anybody who watches the trains, particularly from the West, from my county and neighbouring counties in the springtime, or even now when some of these people are returning for Christmas, will know exactly what the position is.  Train-load after train-load, bus-load after bus-load, is leaving the country.  These young people are being deliberately forced out of the country. There is no other expression for it.</P>
    <P>The official figures for unemployment have gone up by 10,500 in the last year. We could add another 5,000 to that so that the correct figure would be about 15,000 because I understand that roughly 5,000 more young men have been taken into the Army in the last eight or nine months.  As a result of Government policy the only hope left to our young men is to join the Army or to emigrate.  There is no opening outside the Army for these young men to take part in the work of rebuilding the country or to earn a decent wage in the development of their own country.  I should like the Tánaiste to let the House know whether that is the policy of the Government.  The Army, no doubt, provides an honourable profession for some of our young men and an army of a certain size is necessary even when the world enjoys peace, but I do not think it is wise to offer enlistment in the Army as the only means of providing employment or occupations for all our young men.  I believe that many of our young men would be much better employed building <Col N="530" /> up the country &mdash; doing forestry work, in factories, in Land Commission work and in a thousand and one ways besides.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this measure last year, I uttered a warning to the present Minister. The Government at the time was seeking an increase in agricultural production.  We are all trying to do that.  The Minister mentioned that it was necessary to increase our exports. Our principal exports from this country are in the form of agricultural produce of one kind or another.  Agricultural produce is our major export.  I warned the Minister at that time that, if an increase in agricultural exports was to be brought about by lowering the standard of living of our own people, I for one would oppose it.  What I suspected then has since come about.  The methods that have been employed by the Government are quite plain.  These are to tax the people.  In other words, to completely deprive them of the power to buy our own home-produced food.  That action of the Government, since the Budget was introduced, has deprived our own people of the power to buy our own home-produced food. In August last, for the first time, exports and imports just balanced each other.  That position was brought about, to a certain extent, by depriving our own people of the power of being able to buy our own agricultural produce. That is a desperate state of affairs.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about increased agricultural production.  How have we gone about it?  During the time of the inter-Party Government genuine and businesslike efforts were made to increase agricultural production.  One of the greatest schemes ever undertaken to do that was the land rehabilitation scheme which aimed at bringing into production 4,500,000 acres of the land of this country which previously had been completely useless.  That scheme has been slowed down by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I suppose the fact that it was introduced by Deputy Dillon was enough to have it slowed down, and to abolish it altogether if they dared do it. Deputy Dillon, who thought out that scheme, brought it to the pitch it had <Col N="531" /> reached at the time of the change of Government.  If this Government is sincere in trying to increase agricultural production they have these 4,500,000 acres of land, marginal and submarginal land, most of which previously had been producing nothing but rushes and weeds.  There is also an amount of alluvial land that could be brought into production.  Under the land rehabilitation scheme the greater part of these 4,500,000 acres could, over a period of ten or 12 years, be brought into production.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that the average farmer is not producing as much on his land as he might.  The fact is that agricultural production has increased in volume.  For some years past there has been an increase in volume.  The yardstick by which to measure agricultural production is not by the amount of agricultural produce which is exported.  We must also take into account an increase in the purchasing power of our own people, that is if they have it, to purchase our own produce first.  One of the most glaring instances, so far as that is concerned, is butter.  In 1935, the consumption of butter by our own people was in the region of 360,000 cwt. annually.  By 1950 the consumption by our own people of home-produced butter had reached over 750,000 cwt. annually, an increase of approximately 300,000 cwt. as compared with 1935.  That increase in production is not available now for export because our own people are using it, and who have a better right to do so?</P>
    <P>The same applies to beef, eggs, bacon and many other commodities which are produced on our farms.  It is, therefore an absolute fallacy to think that the volume of agricultural production has not increased.  It has, and anyone living on the land can see that when he reflects on what the conditions were 20 or 30 years ago.  In fact, we can go right back to the time when this country got its freedom in 1921.  The production from an average acre of land to-day must be very close on double what it was then, due to the advances made in many directions.  Let me take cattle diseases as one example. <Col N="532" /> These have been mastered by our veterinary services over those years. The mortality rate, as regards all classes of live stock and poultry has, to a very great extent, been mastered. These diseases are not now a serious thing in any farmer's budget.  Away back in those days it was quite a common thing to find diseases prevalent amongst live stock, diseases such as blackleg, intestinal worms and a hundred other diseases which were then ravaging our live stock.  Great strides have been made by the Department of Agriculture in that direction. I may also mention that better quality seeds are now available to the farmers while new methods for managing their land are also available to them.</P>
    <P>The point that I want to insist on is that the volume of agricultural production has increased very considerably over that long period.  The fact that our exportable surplus has not increased is due to this, that we are using more of our own agricultural produce ourselves.  The policy of the present Government seems to be to deprive the townsman and the countryman of the purchasing power to be able to buy our own agricultural produce &mdash; in other words, to eat less and to use less, so that we will be able to balance our trade by sending more food out of the country.</P>
    <P>During our period of office from 1948 to 1951 the country experienced a wave of prosperity such as it had never known before.  The present Government can examine the figures and they will find that that is so.  Taxation is not going to make the people more prosperous.  It is not by squeezing the people, by squeezing the life-blood out of them, that you are going to get in revenue.  The more you tax the people the less revenue you will get.  We were never short of revenue.  Our programme aimed at full employment and at giving a decent wage to workers.  That meant that there was full and plenty for everyone.  The more employment there was the more money there was in circulation.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that we are back to the stage when at week-ends I and my colleagues are besieged by young people coming to us looking for <Col N="533" /> jobs.  They are looking for work with the county council or in the Forestry Department or with the Land Commission if work is available.  They even ask us if they can get a job in Dublin.  They are looking for something to stay at home rather than go away.  During the period of the inter-Party Government that system had vanished.  It seems to be inseparable from the Fianna Fáil management of this country that young people have almost to go on their knees to some Senator or Deputy or to a county council looking for a job.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, my successor, is now in the House, and he can verify this in his Department, that in the year 1950 the Land Commission had to close down work in seven different areas in South Mayo alone because they were not able to find men to do the work.  Gangers went out to open up jobs and they could not find men to work on them because the men were employed elsewhere.  There was plenty of employment then.  At the same time we had almost succeeded in bringing emigration to a complete standstill for the first time in 100 years. The downward trend in the population of the country was arrested during our period in office for the first time in 100 years.  That was all due to the fact that we gave a new outlook and a new life to the people of the country.  Our young people then saw that it was worth their while to remain at home and help in the development of the country.  Young men found that they could get a decent livelihood at home. They found that they were able to get a fairly decent wage, not perhaps as high a wage as they could get across the water, but a wage that made it attractive for them to work in their own country.  We are back again where we were in 1947.</P>
    <P>I make a strong appeal to the Government to examine that whole question instead of taxing and fleecing everybody.  They have now reached the ordinary worker drawing £4 a week from the county council and are asking him to pay income-tax.  I ask them to review the whole position instead of scourging everybody in the country by <Col N="534" /> higher prices for everything and by taxation of all kinds.  They are bringing the work of the whole country to a standstill by this policy.  I ask them to make a cool and calm examination of our policy as opposed to theirs and possibly they will begin to see some sense in it.  It is a desperate situation when our young men realise that the best policy for them is to fly from the country and give ten, 15 or 20 years of the best part of their life in the service of a foreign country.  If that policy goes ahead, I do not know what kind of a country we shall have in five or six years time.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I must condemn as something which will undermine agricultural production and prevent an increase in the volume of exports is the increased interest rates on loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the banks and the general feeling that the Government have succeeded in pumping into the people of the country that if they want a loan they must pay a higher rate of interest for it.  In my opinion, that is absolutely unnecessary.  People cannot understand why we can lend some £55,000,000 to the people across the water at 1 per cent. or 1? per cent., while if a farmer wants a loan of a few hundred pounds to restock his land, or if a young man after getting married wants to manage his land to the best advantage and wants a loan he must pay 6 per cent. interest.  It is a complete puzzle to me why we must charge our own people 6 per cent. interest while we are lending £55,000,000 to British banks at 1 per cent. or 1? per cent.  These are the figures which the Minister for Finance gave the other day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The forester in charge of a well-managed forest gives employment to a certain number of men from approximately the 1st April until the middle of October in preparing, clearing, fencing and draining areas to be planted the following winter.  In my time every forester used to balance his work so that the same number of men got employment during the summer months in preparing for the planting season and also in the winter season.  It requires the same number of men to plant the areas so prepared during the months from October to the 1st April.  I admit that thinning operations are seasonal, because when it is necessary to thin 50, 100 or 200 acres a certain number of men must be got to do that and when it is finished there is no further work for them.  But, in the ordinary work of establishing forestry centres which the Department should be engaged in the big lay-off of men which has occurred lately is not justified and is inexplicable to me.</P>

      <P>I will not dwell further on it except to say that the forestry programme was cut down by 4,000 acres last year and a further 3,000 this year and I presume that that will be followed by another 3,000, so that we will be back to the 3,000 or 4,000 acres. Forestry work is one of the most useful ways in which young men can be employed and unemployment lessened. In addition, it will be creating an increasing asset year by year and in time it will help completely to eliminate the expenditure of £8,000,000 a year for foreign timber.</P>
      <P>The hand-won turf scheme got a great deal of publicity in this House during the period of the inter-Party Government.  There is not a word about it now.  An effort was made to use the stopping of that scheme against the inter-Party Government, while in 1947, before they left office, the Fianna Fáil Government sent out word that the hand-won turf scheme should be closed down all over the country.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> and elsewhere that was depicted as being one of the savage things which the horrible inter-Party Government had brought about. The Government have now been in office for 18 months and what have they done to restore the hand-won turf industry?  It is only now that the truth is coming out; the cat is out of the bag now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> It has been proved that we were right when we said that Fianna Fáil had taken the first steps towards abolishing that scheme in August or September, 1947, five or six months before they left office.  What have they done to re-establish it since they came back into office?  I have not asked that question up to now because we wanted to give them a reasonable period to get going.  What have they done to re-establish the hand-won turf industry and to give employment?  They have done nothing.  It is now exactly where it was.</P>
    <P>I hope this will serve to bring a little bit of truth into public life, particularly at the next general election. I hope it will at least teach the Fianna Fáil Party that the people cannot be so easily gulled by false promises.  They can see very well whether they are being fooled or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley, the Parliamentary Secretary, speaking on this measure last week, said it was unfortunate that Fianna Fáil took office at the time they did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it was a political disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Bartley should realise it was the same Ireland, the same Twenty-Six Counties that Fianna Fáil and the inter-Party group governed.  They have never got any obstruction from any of the four Parties on this side of the House&mdash; Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan and Clann na Poblachta.  They have received useful and helpful criticism, absolutely unlike the barrage to which we were subjected when we were on the side that Fianna Fáil occupies now. They did every possible damage they could, even to the extent of scaring the people and trying to frighten them from investing in the loans being floated in our time of office.  We have not indulged in anything of that kind. We believe this House is a place where there should be a great deal of realism and sincerity.  Whatever promises we make at election time we should use our time here in trying to put them into operation if they are for the good of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> Deputy Bartley says it was a disaster when Fianna Fáil took over.  I cannot see the disaster but I can see that Fianna Fáil is making no honest effort to try to run this country as it ought to be governed.  They are making no attempt to get down to the good. sound management of the country.  He said it was a good thing to increase the price of bread, that it was the cause of reducing a lot of waste and that he does not see as many half-loaves kicked about as he did before the price went up.  Apparently the one way to save wastage in bread is to increase the price so that nobody will buy it and so that it will be left in the baker's shop.  Is that the policy? Does Deputy Bartley think that anybody outside a lunatic asylum would swallow that?  Anyway, I never saw any of this waste he is talking about. I know now that people are not able to buy bread which they need to consume. They are being denied this commodity as they are being denied bacon, beef, eggs and butter, the products of our own country.  But of course, the Minister for Finance wants to balance his trade and, according to him, there is only one way to do it: tax the people; take all the money out of the people's pockets by excessive taxation so that they cannot afford to buy essential foodstuffs and must go hungry.  In this way, the exportable surplus is swelled and our balance of trade is set right.</P>
    <P>Is that the way to run the country? If the Government is so anxious to bring about a balance of trade, which every Deputy in this House is anxious to see, is there not at least one other way that should be tried first?  My suggestion is that as an experiment we should cut out the importation of a great deal of luxury trash that the average man or woman in this country does not worry about and does not give two hoots whether it is imported or not.  This would be a wiser solution to the problem than depriving our own people of decent food and clothing because of excessive taxation.</P>
    <P>Is there anyone on the Government side of the House who can tell us what quantity of certain kinds of luxury <Col N="539" /> trash is coming into this country which must be balanced by food and other essentials that ordinary men and women in the country could do with? If the balance of trade was temporarily out of adjustment why did the Government not prevent these imports before they resorted to the expedient of taxing the people and preventing them from buying their own produce?  The Minister knows as well as I do that there is a great deal of luxury commodities coming into the country and he could prevent these imports.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the complaint which the Fianna Fáil Government have against us is that when we were in office we increased wages and we had no right to do it.  When the inter-Party Government increased wages and made living conditions fairly good for the people, there was only one thing for the present Government to do: go out and tell the boys to scatter up and down the country the news that the inter-Party Government had sunk this country in debt and that now they must put on taxes.  The real truth of the matter is that the taxes were put on simply because the increases in wages were given during the period of office of the inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951.  These taxes are now put on in order to take back those increases from the workers and prevent them from living up to the standard they had during our period in office. It would have been more honest and more decent for them to slash the wages of those who had received the increases, road workers, forestry workers and others, from £4 10s. a week down to the £2 8s. they were getting when we came into office in 1948.  The present Government by their actions have attacked all sections of the community&mdash;the children, the housewives and the workers.</P>
    <P>Business has been brought virtually to a standstill in Ireland.  If you speak to any businessman he will tell you his trade is very slack and that he is idle most of the time.  The effect of the Budget, the effect of the taxes on tobacco and drink has been to put some businessmen out of existence.  That is being closely followed up now by the <Col N="540" /> tax on vans, lorries and cars and the tax on petrol and drivers' licences.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to make this appeal to the present Government, to drop this method of fleecing and taxing everybody in the country out of existence. No progress will be made by those tactics.  The Minister for Finance admitted in reply to a question by Deputy Donnellan a few weeks ago that the amount of extra tax which was supposed to come in from the Budget taxes on drink had fallen very considerably. I would appeal to the Minister to put the money into circulation for the rebuilding of this country.  As I said a moment ago, after 700 years of conquest the country needs rebuilding in many directions.  While great strides are being made in some directions, quite an amount of leeway must be made up.  I believe our own youth are more than anxious to take a hand in it but it is a bad policy to ask them to stay in a country where there are little or no prospects of getting work.  If that point of view were accepted, even at this stage an immense improvement would result. It would mean a complete change of face from the present policy.  I believe our own youth are more than anxious to stay at home if decent employment is provided for them.  The Minister for Lands is now in the House and I appeal to him again to establish new forest centres.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first things the Government should do is sack the Minister <Col N="541" /> for Finance.  His mischievous and wholly irresponsible handling of the finances of the State has brought disaster into practically every home. Citizens are puzzled as to how a Minister could bring about such disaster in such a very short space of time.  Why could not the present Government have continued running the country on the lines on which it was being run during the period of the inter-Party Government?  The present Government has caused half the people to be thrown out of employment and reduced the other half to short commons.  Our people are completely puzzled as to how a Government could succeed in bringing about such an extraordinary change in such a short time.</P>

      <P>This debate so far has proved to be a rehash of the debate we had this time last year on the same Bill.  Listening to the Opposition speeches one can only conclude that there is a particular weakness in democratic Government in certain circumstances, namely, the tendency to create too great a desire to play up to the susceptibilities of the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the disaster of inter-Party Government for which we are now paying is due solely to that particular weakness.  I believe that our Government was sorely tempted on resuming office in 1951 to do certain things which would be pleasanter from a political point of view.  They took over in a situation which called for certain measures, measures by no means popular from a political point of view.  The fact remains that certain steps were necessary in order to make the country fundamentally sound from a financial point of view and preserve our economic development.  Such steps are not always popular with the electorate but certain measures had to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have spoken at length, including the last speaker, in connection with the measures taken by the inter-Party Government.  The insinuation is that we could have continued in the same old rut in which <Col N="542" /> the inter-Party Government operated without bringing ultimate disaster on the country.  Naturally the people are anxious to know whether or not it was possible to so continue when we resumed office.  Was there or was there not a problem?  If there was a problem, then the inter-Party Government was wrong.  If there was not a problem, then the inter-Party Government was right.</P>
    <P>We have certain things to guide us in coming to a decision on that question. We have the advice of certain experts in economics who were actually responsible for our economic problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to put the Deputy out of pain, let me say at the outset that one of the mystery-men is Deputy J.A. Costello.  In 1948 he drew the attention of the House to the fact that our position in relation to our adverse trade balance was a serious one and was bound to create serious problems unless immediate remedial action was taken to restore order to the disordered state of our finances.  So far no single member of the Opposition has made any attempt to explain why our adverse trade balance in 1948 could be so serious as to bring calamity on the country according to the leader of the Government of the day, and why an adverse trade balance standing at twice the amount in 1951 is portrayed as something that does not really matter very much.</P>
      <P>We had another expert in the inter-Party Government too.  We had the Minister for Finance drawing attention in his Budget speech to the serious situation that existed and calling for immediate remedial measures.  But we had no action.  Why?  We had no action because of the particular weakness in democracy in certain circumstances to which I have already referred.  I claim those circumstances existed in the inter-Party Government. No coalition Government will introduce measures that will be unpopular with the electorate no matter how sound those measures may be from the point of view of the ultimate benefit and welfare of the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil took over last year the situation called for action.  That action was not popular but it was essential if the people were to be saved ultimately from the situation into which they were rapidly being led, a situation in which there was a serious diminution in our savings, a situation which was adding seriously to our national debt, a situation which was inflating our adverse balance of trade and a situation in which we were consuming more and producing less.  No man with any experience of economics could say there was not a serious problem calling for immediate remedial measures, no matter how unpopular they might be, in the ultimate interests of and from the point of view of the welfare of the community as a whole.  It was a courageous step which the Fianna Fáil Government undertook and which the Coalition Government never could undertake. Eventually, that step will prove to have been the proper course to take, if it has not already proven so.</P>
      <P>The tone of the Opposition speeches in this debate, as it was in the same debate last year, is such as to lead the people of this country to believe that we can lower prices, have higher wages, better services and lower taxes.  I think no sane person would agree with that outlook.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the inference to be drawn from the attitude of the Opposition on this Bill, as was the case last year, too.  They condemn rising prices and, in the same breath, they claim higher wages for all sections of the community.  They condemn increased taxes and, at the same time, they advocate better services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another rather remarkable omission from the speeches of Opposition Deputies in this debate.  While they talk about unemployment and blame the Government for not taking <Col N="544" /> proper action to prevent increasing unemployment, not one speaker on the Opposition Benches has attempted to point to any particular feature or any piece of capital development which was curtailed by the present Government. That is a most important point.  If we peruse the figures we will find that more money is available to-day for such schemes as rural electrification, turf development, tourist development and so forth than was available at any time during the term of office of the Coalition Government.  Bear in mind that that is the position despite the fact that when Fianna Fáil resumed office last year this country had just been notified that Marshall Aid had ceased.  The inter-Party Government had the benefit of Marshall Aid during their term of office although we cannot point to a solitary piece of constructive work done by the inter-Party Government under that generous loan.  We have not a single monument to which we can point as a result of the generous assistance which we got under that loan during the years when the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>

      <P>When that question is posed to the Opposition they point out that the land rehabilitation scheme was one of the things for which they were responsible.  On the admission of Deputy Desmond last year, land rehabilitation was not started by the Coalition Government even though they talk a great deal about it.  Facts and figures show that, during their former term of office, the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the land reclamation and the farm improvements schemes and that, during that former term of office, they spent twice as much money on those schemes as the Coalition Government did during their entire period of office and, further, Fianna Fáil spent all that money at a time when they had no Marshall Aid or generous loans from any other nation to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking in this House last week, Deputy O'Donnell referred to the lack <Col N="545" /> of attention by the present Government to the Gaeltacht.  This Government established the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Government which carried out a fairly intensive survey of the Gaeltacht and undeveloped areas to ascertain the problems which exist there and the priorities which might be given as well as a general picture of the situation. Fortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary got the co-operation of all sections of the people in those areas.  He received a mass of suggestions. Material and data were provided in every area which he visited.  I think that one thing which applied in every single area which he visited&mdash;the only problem which was general in the Gaeltacht and undeveloped areas&mdash;was the poor state of the roads in those areas.  We who live in those areas know well that one of our first requirements is the construction of better roads to the backward townlands and along our seaboards to facilitate a better standard of living.  We know that, no matter what other steps may be taken for our welfare, our first requirement is a decent line of communication into our districts.  Second only to that is the housing problem in those areas.  I am glad to say that, as a first gesture towards the alleviation of the circumstances of the people in those areas, the Parliamentary Secretary has announced the expenditure of £3,000,000 on roads in those areas.  I am glad that he has recognised that general problem to that extent.  That sum of money will give very necessary employment in the areas in question. In addition to improving the roads in those districts, it will help to solve the problem of emigration there for the time being.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies who refer to what they claim to be lack of attention by this Government to the congested areas and to the Gaeltacht that the Fianna Fáil Government, through a Bill in 1952, remedied a serious omission in the 1950 Housing Act which the Coalition Government passed into law.  In that 1950 Act, the Coalition Government completely neglected to provide anything whatever for the congested or <Col N="546" /> Gaeltacht areas of this country.  That was a serious omission.  Not until it was rectified in 1952 by the Fianna Fáil Government were the local authorities enabled, by way of retrospective payment, to make good the omission in the 1950 Act.  These are some of the things which, I think, point the way to what this Government intend to do for the Gaeltacht and congested areas and which are bound, eventually, to bring a measure of benefit to those areas.  We have many roads&mdash;and I am sorry that the Deputy to whom I referred in speaking last week neglected to give due consideration and credit to the Government&mdash;which will undoubtedly be repaired under that scheme to give necessary employment in the areas where it is so badly required&mdash;and give decent lines of communication to areas which did not enjoy the amenities which midlanders and people in more wealthy areas have enjoyed for years past.  Deputy Blowick stressed very much the question of forestry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Certainly not agreeably.  We are anxious to see afforestation carried out and we are getting afforestation now in Donegal. As I said at the outset, there are things which appeal very much to the individual for the time being and there are things which, although they may not be very palatable at the time they are carried out, are strictly necessary for the future success and welfare of the nation.  That particularly applies to the measures which were taken by the present Government in order to put the country on a sound economic footing.  Sometimes a patient needing an operation is slow to consult a doctor. He does not like to take the serious step of having the operation carried out to ensure his future health.  It is the easiest thing in the world to put off a distasteful or unpopular measure from day to day but the correct thing, of course, is to submit to the proper solution of a problem immediately in order to enjoy improvement and better results afterwards.  The Coalition Government were perfectly well aware, as was indicated by the statements of Deputy Costello, the then Taoiseach, that they were up against the serious implications of the adverse trade balance, as was shown by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government were perfectly well aware that there was a serious problem developing rapidly which would ultimately call for serious measures but they were prepared to postpone the evil day and to leave the burden for somebody else to bear.  In this country, posterity will read in <Col N="548" /> history of the courageous measures taken by the Fianna Fáil Government to solve that problem handed over to them and time will vindicate and justify the action they have taken, as being the only sound action at the time, although it did not appeal to the immediate susceptibilities of the electorate.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was introducing this Bill on last Thursday he was most polite and people who were beginning to know him immediately got suspicious.  Was there anything constructive in this Bill to redeem the promises that had been made by this Government during their three years in opposition?  So far as I heard his speech and read it afterwards, it was a most apologetic performance. He was sorry for having gone off the straight and narrow path while he was in opposition, for having criticised unduly and wrongfully the actions of the inter-Party Government &mdash;a title which I think would be somewhat more appropriate than the Coalition Government.  The present Government, on the other hand, may be termed the balanced-ration Government, held together by two doctors, a solicitor and a farmer.  But let me say the country is getting fed up with the particular material it is getting from the Government as it stands at the moment.  It is a new departure when we hear Deputy Brennan speaking about playing on the susceptibilities of the Irish people.  I think the present Minister for Industry and Commerce at one time was responsible for the famous poster of 1931 or 1932&mdash;&ldquo;We have a plan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister immediately after getting into power removed certain controls.  One of these controls was the control of the price of milk. <Col N="549" /> As a result of that, in a certain institution in Munster for the period between the 1st April and the 30th September, the price of milk was 3/4 per gallon.  It was pure blackmail on an institution where the patients had to be provided for.  That was all made feasible by the Minister's decontrol of the price of milk.  We had various promises from the Minister's Party in the constituency I represent.  The cost of living was to come down and an immediate Utopia was to be created.  The farmers were to get 6d. per gallon extra for milk. Oats was to be 50/- a barrel and barley 75/-.  The farming community were to be put in the position in which they could produce more.  We were to have a balanced economy and production was to be improved.</P>
      <P>That is the picture that was presented by Fianna Fáil.  It was to cure all our ills.  Instead of that being so, the farmers got 48/- a barrel for barley, which was the lowest price since 1940, and for oats they got 30/- a barrel. That, too, was practically the lowest price on record.  As a matter of expediency, the Minister for Agriculture gave a penny a gallon increase in the price of milk.  But, against that, the prices of tea, sugar, butter, bread, stout, beer and whiskey were increased beyond all proportions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, if he did not actually say it, certainly implied that we were doing all we could to obstruct any progress that is to be made in the very, very distant future by the present Government.  I want to assure him that we did not put out any pawn signs when the Fianna Fáil Government were looking for a loan.  Neither did we obstruct the rural electrification scheme, such as happened in my part of the country when the inter-Party Government was on the job.  At that time, the Fianna Fáil Cumainn, on orders from headquarters, did all they could to jettison or sabotage the schemes promoted by the inter-Party Government.  They did all they could to impede their progress.  The result of that has been that schemes which could have been completed by now will not be completed for the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The Minister, in his opening speech on Thursday, built it up from the foundation on bread.  He mentioned the increase that was given by the inter-Party Government in 1951 and the increase that he gave in 1952.  I asked him a question to-day about the wages paid to bakers, to boardmen and foremen, and despite all the statistical information which he has at his disposal from the Labour Court in Griffith Barracks, he was not able to tell me what one baker is paying his men in all of the towns in East Cork which I mentioned.  The Minister is a very cute man and perhaps may have smelled some of the rats which Deputy Cogan was speaking about at one time. A very modest baker in one of these towns employs four bakers.  In 1951 they each got an increase of 15/- in their wages from the Labour Court. The master baker was allowed to offset that increase in wages by increasing the 2-lb. loaf by a halfpenny.  The Minister must know that there are approximately 90 loaves to a batch. He mentioned last Thursday that a farthing on the 2-lb. loaf would bring in 3/9 a batch.  Allowing 2/6 of that for the increase in wages given in 1952, that meant in or about £6 gross for the master baker.  The amount of the increase in wages at that time was 12/-.</P>
    <P>To go back to 1951, 7/6 per batch was the amount which the master baker gained by the increase of a halfpenny on the 2-lb. loaf.  His target was 48 batches a week.  The increase in wages actually cost him £3 per week.  As against that, he drew a gross sum of £18 extra which left him with a net profit of £15.  Those figures are incontrovertible. A further increase was given by the master baker to his workmen of 12/- per week.  As a result of that we are paying a farthing on the 2-lb. loaf.  The master baker makes a profit again of 3/9.  The Minister says that he is allowing a half-crown of that to equate the rate of wages that is being paid, and that 1/3 goes back to the food subsidies.  In my time at school, 48 half-crowns amounted to £6. Four times 12/- amounts to £2 8s.  That leaves the master baker with a net profit of £3 12s. on that transaction, of, on the two transactions, an aggregate <Col N="551" /> profit of something like £18.  That is not bad.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Bartley, the people are kicking half-loaves around Galway and Connemara.  If, by any chance they have an opportunity of reading my statement in the newspapers in the morning, they will think twice before they again kick half-loaves around.  I challenge the Minister to contradict the statement I have made.  There must be something very wrong in the bread trade when some of the port-miller-bakers in Dublin can sell bread cheaper in towns 50 miles from Dublin than they can sell it in Dublin.  I am sure the Minister, when replying, will give us some indication, one way or the other, as to how it has come that he has allowed this thing to happen.  I think that, even before he replies, he should investigate the whole facts as I have given them as to what has happened down in East Cork.  Yet the farthing increase was made.  That public-spirited master baker, who was making a profit of £15 out of the increase he got in 1951, religiously put on the farthing on the loaf again.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce allowed that to be done, not through the Prices Advisory Body, but through his Department, as he said he was convinced there was a justification for it.</P>
    <P>There is no justification either for the monopoly which is operating at the moment in the importation of tea.  I do not know where the Minister's tea importers are procuring their tea, but I am sure that the tea we are getting is the first run through the sieve. Three-quarters of it is dust and the rest of it consists of small leaves, and that is what we are paying 4/- a lb. for at present because the Minister for Industry and Commerce says we should never place ourselves at the mercy of Mincing Lane.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give some answer to my statement with regard to the bread.  If he wishes, I will give him the name of the master baker and of the town.  I do not intend to be as obstructive or obstreperous as the Government back-benchers were when they were on this side of the House. <Col N="552" /> I would be prepared to co-operate with the Minister and to give him all the information at my disposal if I thought it would have the slightest effect in bringing down the cost of living.  I know a master baker in another town who refused to put on the ¼d. increase and immediately an ultimatum was issued to him.  Through <i>esprit de corps</i>, or perhaps from dread, he put on the ¼d. increase.</P>
    <P>Although butter is being sold at 3/10 a lb., we are not able to produce sufficient to supply our own needs.  It was always well recognised that it would pay us better to export chocolate crumb, cheese and dried milk and import from Denmark or some other place a supply of butter in the winter time.  We had not to wait for the present Minister for Agriculture to tell us that and to explain what would happen.</P>
    <P>Whatever promises were made about constructing autobahn roads in Donegal to make it easier for the Gaels to fly out of the Gaeltacht&mdash; they will only use them once and that is when they are clearing out of it&mdash; it is very noticeable that we have not heard from Deputy Brennan or Deputy Brady about a market for oats or potatoes or various other things in Donegal for the past 12 months while conditions were never so bad as they are now.  Surely it is not necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government to make a survey of the housing problem or of the road situation. We have county council officials and county councillors in these areas who realise that the roads are bad and who can make that point to the Minister for Local Government.  If the Minister for Finance can see his way to make a grant of money the roads can be improved and houses built. The Fianna Fáil Party never played so much on the susceptibilities of the people of the country as at the last election.  Never was so much said and so many false promises made by so few.</P>

      <P>The circumstances in which we approach the consideration of the powers proposed to be continued by the measure before the House are entirely different now from <Col N="553" /> what they were when the original Supplies and Services Bill was enacted by the Oireachtas.  It may be said that at that time there was a very considerable shortage of goods and a comparative plenitude of money.  To-day we find ourselves in almost precisely the opposite condition where there is an abundance of goods and a serious shortage of money, with rising prices and rising unemployment. In those circumstances, it would seem that it is not really powers which are required to be conferred on the Government but that the Government should have proper policies for the changed circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his opening on this Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as reported in Volume 135 of the 27th November, said that he would wish that the House should join with him in his desire not to conceal economic realities from our people. Earlier in his remarks he made use of the expression, as reported in column 168: &ldquo;Perhaps some time there may be a different approach to these matters, but not yet.&rdquo;  He had, I think, somewhat ruefully recalled the time when he was on the opposition benches and had indulged in rather biting criticism of those of us who were then on the bench which he now occupies. While he said that he could not resent what was done by him and his colleagues when in opposition being done by opposition Deputies now, nevertheless he seemed to express the hope that some time there might be a different approach.  I do not know why he added the words &ldquo;but not yet.&rdquo;  I think the considerations that arise on this Bill, the conditions that face the country, the economic and financial plight of our people, require from us on this side of the House a constructive approach to the problems involved and which fall to be considered on this measure.  In present circumstances, when the structure of our economy is so gravely imperilled, we, on this side of the House, feel we have a serious responsibility and that our duty here is not merely to indulge, however great the temptation might be, in the recollection of the past treatment we received at the hands of those who now occupy Government benches&mdash;we resist <Col N="554" /> that temptation&mdash;but to do what in us lies to make constructive proposals.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, propose, in some measure at least, to meet the Tánaiste in what perhaps may have been his desire, in those expressions to which I have referred, for a new approach to these problems.  We have to consider in the circumstances facing us here now discussing this Bill, really the whole economic state of the country, but we confine ourselves, as far as possible, to the consideration of the level of employment, recession in trade, the prices position and the cost of living. I hope I will approach the consideration of these problems in a serious and responsible mood, fully conscious of the fact that in our democratic institutions one of the most important functions, paramount even to its duty to serve the country and of exposing evils in general Government policy and arising out of defects in Government proposals, is the duty of the Opposition to be available for the people as an alternative Government.  I approach the consideration of these problems in the serious mood to which I have referred because of the fact that we are fully conscious that the people as a whole are looking for a lead and seeking anxiously for at least some hope being held out to them of the solution of the difficult problems facing them and some early alleviation of their anxiety and difficulties.</P>
    <P>I adopt this approach also because of the fact that there has been in recent times a certain amount of criticism of our politicians and of our Party system from publicists who seem free to impute to our politicians and our system any motives, however unworthy, and who apparently completely misconceive the functions of this House and the significance of our debates.  I think it will be agreed that while we, in opposition, criticise Ministers or their policies or Deputies of the Government Party, we do not impute to them unpatriotic motives nor do we believe that, while we disagree with their policies and point out the defects, that our political opponents are not as alive to the defects in these policies as we are.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, in the remarks I have to make on this measure, that <Col N="555" /> so far as I indulge in criticism I will base that criticism on facts and deal with facts factually and not in a destructively critical fashion and that I then will give by constructive suggestions and the indication of a policy, at least some intimation that there are remedies which can be applied with some hope of curing the economic ills which are afflicting us at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the adoption of this attitude by me is my great realisation and appreciation of the fact that the situation which has developed in this country will sooner or later, and probably sooner than later, require that important changes should be made in our financial and economic institutions. It would be a very useful thing if all these desirable changes were brought about, if not with the agreement&mdash;and perhaps it might not be desirable that there should be full agreement on matters of that kind&mdash;at least with the goodwill of all Parties in the House.  Whether these changes will fall to be made by the present Government, if they continue in office, or by a Government formed of the Opposition if the Government falls and there is a change of Government, it is of extreme importance to the welfare of the people that in regard to those changes, which may be very fundamental when they take place, all Parties should be agreed upon the fact that no unfair campaigns would be launched against the authors of such changes by those who happen at that time to be the political opponents in opposition.</P>
    <P>We have difficult economic and financial problems to face and to solve. It would be desirable in the public interest that in meeting those problems and in trying to solve them through our economic controversies, each side of the House should maintain towards its political opponents an attitude of scrupulous fairness, that any arguments put up should be relevant and constructive and that Ministers and others should refrain from the political polemics of a trivial character which are so frequently indulged in by the present Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>An approach of that kind towards <Col N="556" /> most of our problems is desirable.  It is vitally necessary in dealing with credit and credit institutions.  It does not require any emphasis from me to underline the importance of dealing with credit in a responsible fashion. Credit is such a fragile institution that the consideration of matters and problems dealing with it should be approached by every side of this House in a responsible, cautious and patriotic fashion.</P>
    <P>Having made these preliminary observations I would like to say that the manner in which I hope to deal with these problems which seem to me to fall for consideration in this debate will be that I will very shortly state what I conceive to be the facts of the financial and economic situation and the evils from which we are at present suffering and with which both the country and its people are afflicted. Then, having dealt very shortly with those matters, I hope to unfold or to give at least the indication of a policy which will be concerned with the creation of wealth, the maintenance of employment and the securing, if possible, of a relatively stable price level.</P>
    <P>Those who have spoken before me in this debate have referred at length, and very properly so, to the problems of unemployment, the high cost of living, the recession in trade and to some extent the restriction of credit.  Very shortly, without, I hope, wearying the House, I propose to summarise the position in relation to unemployment. In the month of October of this year there were 8,400 more unemployed than in the same month last year and in that month in last year, 1951, there had already begun to be apparent an increase in unemployment following the recession in business and in industry which manifested itself during the autumn of last year.  In the month of October of this year there were almost 11,000 more unemployed than in the month of October, 1950, and in the month of October, 1950, there were 6.5 per cent. of insured persons on the live register who were unemployed.  This figure had risen to 6.7 per cent. in the month of October last year.  This year it has risen to 8.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> In that year, when it ought to have been quite favourable, it stood higher than it had ever stood save in the two worst months&mdash;that is, the two opening months&mdash;of the year 1951.  That position, from the point of view of unemployment, does not reveal the extent of the trouble because of the numbers of persons who suffer from part-time employment, no employment and the constant fear and anxiety of complete unemployment.  It is, indeed, an understatement to say that the position is very bad.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to prices can be very briefly stated because everybody, irrespective of the walk of life in which he finds himself, has felt the impact of the rising cost of living and the rising price of every commodity and practically every service. Deputy Norton referred to this matter, as did Deputy Blowick to-day.  At column 203 of the Official Report of 27th November Deputy Norton said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost-of-living index figure in February, 1951, was 102.  It is now 122....  In other words, the cost of living has increased by approximately 20 per cent. over the past 18 months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Being, perhaps, a little fairer to the Minister than these figures might reveal, and taking for that purpose the figures for the last months of the inter-Party Government's régime, between May, 1951, and August of this year, which is the last month for which figures are available, there was a rise of 15 points &mdash; in other words, a rise of 12 per cent. roughly.  That is, I think, giving as fair a picture as the figures allow of the situation that has been created in the last 12 or 18 months.  It is not, perhaps, without its own significance that, while the British Government removed food subsidies relatively to the same extent as our Government did this year, the rise in price level in England has been less than it is here.</P>
    <P>The third point to consider is the recession in trade and business.  That matter has been dealt with fully by those speakers who preceded me.  There has been a recession in trade, business and industry generally.  That is beyond all question.  There is an abundance of <Col N="558" /> goods but notwithstanding that abundance our people are unable to buy because of the fall in the purchasing power of the community and the rise in the cost of living.  There is, consequently, a recession in trade, business and industry with consequential unemployment.</P>
    <P>The level of economic activity is to be found by reference to the volume of industrial production.  In the second quarter of the year 1950 the volume of production rose by 25 points over the volume in the same quarter in the previous year.  In the year 1951, during the first part of which we were in office, there was a rise of nine points in that quarter over the same quarter in the year 1950.  This year there has been quite a remarkable drop of 15 points. Industrial production should always be an ascending factor but it was actually in that quarter below the 1950 figure. That is very clear evidence of the condition in which trade, business and industry find themselves to-day.  The people who are engaged in industry and business and trade do not require statistics in order to appreciate the serious position in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>Our total external trade&mdash;that is the total of exports and imports which, as the Minister knows, determines the level of our employment here&mdash;is very much down on last year's figure. Recently we had the officials of the Department of Finance appearing before the Arbitration Tribunal for the Civil Service and maintaining there that the yield of taxation had declined, indicating at the same time a recession in business and a fall in business profits.  If any further evidence is required we have the reports of our public companies in recent weeks which would dispel any illusion that there was not a serious recession in trade because in every instance a substantial decline in profits is reported.</P>
    <P>We have had controversy on the subject of the restriction of credit and as to whether or not the Government was responsible for credit restriction by the banks in relation to business, industry and agriculture.  Whether or not the Government is responsible, the <Col N="559" /> fact remains that such a restriction is in existence and has been unduly harsh.  That is beyond all doubt and all controversy.  I do not know whether the Minister&mdash;knowing the serious condition of our economy, as he must know it&mdash;will take steps under the powers that will be given to him by this Bill to see that that restriction of credit stops and stops at once.  On numerous occasions I have drawn attention, in public utterances, to the serious effect which heavy taxation has on the cost of living and on business and industry.  I do not want to repeat what I have said over and over again since this Government took office.  In speeches before the last Budget, I took every possible occasion to warn the Government against the consequences of heavy taxation and certainly to make as emphatic as possible our view that heavy taxation was unnecessary and unjustifiable in the circumstances, difficult as they were, facing this country in the past 12 to 18 months.  Heavy taxation has a very heavy impact on the cost of living.  It encourages tax evasion, as everybody knows, and, in consequence, the burden of the tax is very inequitably distributed.  Some people who are easy marks for the Revenue Commissioners' activities have to bear more than their fair share of the burden.  Heavy taxation leads to spurious and quite useless expenditure. It destroys initiative and enterprise and leads to less work and less production.  It adds to costs, increases prices and makes it more difficult for us to sell our goods abroad.  Part of the troubles from which we are suffering here at the present time is due to the entirely unnecessary and harsh taxation that was imposed by the Minister for Finance in the Budget of this year.</P>
    <P>I have just indicated those few topics.  I hope I have not overstated or exaggerated anything: I think I have not.  For the purpose of indicating what the country is suffering from at the moment, I want to say now, before I proceed to make certain comments upon them and to offer my constructive suggestions, that the tragic feature of <Col N="560" /> all these matters and the anxieties, miseries and human sufferings that have been unnecessary, as we believe and are convinced, brought about in the past 12 months is that they have been due to calculated and deliberate Government policy.  The basis of all that policy, what has brought about all that suffering and all that misery and anxiety, has been the erroneous view of the Government and particularly of the Minister for Finance, that the conditions of this country require that the consumption of our people should be drastically reduced and that the way that consumption should be reduced is by raising taxation, increasing prices through the dropping of the food subsidies and reducing the income of every section of our people.  That, unfortunately, is the basis of the policy which has brought in its train the consequences to which I have very briefly referred in connection with each of the four or five topics that I have mentioned just now.  All the results of that policy are making it impossible for people to live.  We heard a lot in the course of last year and early this year to the effect that people were living beyond their means.  We were told by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement that the incomes of people had advanced beyond the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The policy that was enshrined in his Budget, and which found its expression in the heavy taxation imposed by that Budget, was directed to scooping up that supposed excessive income over the cost of living which he thought existed in the incomes of our people. The position, as I have said, is serious beyond exaggeration.  I think it is no matter of mere hyperbolic utterance to say that the patience of the people has been strained to breaking point, that the temper of the people at the present time &mdash; particularly in the urban areas&mdash; is such that unless there is some alleviation of their anxieties and their troubles and some hope is held out to them soon of lower prices and better times, we may very easily face something very nearly approaching to social revolution.  That dangerous situation requires that there should be an immediate and drastic change of policy on the part of the present Government <Col N="561" /> or, if they do not change that policy drastically, that they should get out and leave way for some other Government whom the people will select to carry out the only kind of policy which can give any hope of alleviation to the sufferings of the people at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the course of what I have now to say, I hope to give some indication of the lines along which that policy should be directed.  Before I deal with those suggestions, however, there are just one or two comments which I should like to make in connection with some of the topics to which I have to refer. I have called attention to the facts in connection with the price rise.  We do not accept that the rise in price and the rise in the cost of living need necessarily have been so sharp, that the recession of business ought to have been so grave or that the increase in unemployment ought to have been so considerable.  I realise at once that some of the rise in price is due to factors beyond the control of the present Government and beyond the control of any Government.  I appreciate that the rise in import prices was bound to bring about an increase in the cost of living but we think that it should not have risen to the extent which we have experienced. The rise&mdash;which we say was unjustifiable&mdash;was due entirely to the policy of the Government in the sudden withdrawal of the food subsidies and to the unjustifiable increase in taxation.  There has been a recession in trade.  For that recession in trade the Government is not entirely responsible.  There were certain outside factors which would have had their impact upon trade and industry in this country no matter what Government was in office.</P>
    <P>Some of that recession in trade was inevitable, was likely to follow, and did follow, the post-Korean inflation, but unfortunately the present Government, particularly the Minister for Finance &mdash; I doubt very much if the Minister for Industry and Commerce really believes in his heart in that policy, but at all events that was the policy that was put into operation&mdash;did not realise the real nature of the problem or appreciate the kind of <Col N="562" /> disease they had to treat.  By their policy they have pushed that recession in trade and industry further than it need have been pushed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was undoubtedly, and apparently still is, obsessed with the problem of the balance of payments.  We endeavoured to point out to him during the time when he first made his somewhat frantic expressions in connection with this so-called disorder in the balance of international trade and payments, that that was a serious enough problem but that it was not as serious as he made it out to be, that it was certainly not a problem calling for resort to the drastic remedies which he subsequently applied.  There was certainly, as we believed, no necessity whatever for the imposition of those-drastic measures which he applied in connection with that problem of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate there was at least one amusing incident.  At one time last year, we were told that there was no stockpiling during the term of the inter-Party Government. It is now recognised that there was stockpiling.  We were told in the course of this debate by one speaker that the-stockpiling that was carried on in the year 1951, the existence of which was at one time denied, was responsible for the recession but last year when the Minister for Finance was cavorting round the place, in regard to the balance of payments, he did not once allude to the fact that whatever was wrong with the balance of payments was due to that stockpiling, that it was a matter that would be merely temporary and that when the very causes which produced an inflation in that balance had passed there would be an automatic readjustment in the balance of payments.  Of course, the real reason for the policy which has been pursued by the Government is one which they dare not announce in this House or outside it.  They have only one justification for that policy, a policy that they allege did not permit them to keep people employed in industrial, business and agricultural activity at the level which existed in 1951 when we left <Col N="563" /> office and to keep prices even at the level which they had reached as a result of the post-Korean inflation. That according to Government policy and according to the Minister for Finance's determination to adhere to that policy, was something that could not be afforded by the country because it enabled our people to live too well and because they were using up our external reserves, which according to him and his Party had to be preserved at all costs.  That justification we do not accept.</P>
    <P>The condition of affairs as they are at the moment, in my view&mdash;and I submit it to the Minister as the correct view&mdash; requires that there must be a complete change of policy immediately, that the policy of austerity and restriction must be replaced by a policy of financial easement and economic expansion, otherwise matters will go from bad to worse.  The policy put into operation by the present Government has released forces which have since gained in impetus, and which the present Government will not be able to control unless there is a complete reversal of financial and economic policy.</P>
    <P>I have said that I hoped to give some indication of steps which should be taken and policies which should be adopted.  These suggestions, of course, turn very largely upon the necessity for capital development.  I am an unrepentant believer in the policy which we adopted of productive capital investment for the cure of the economic ills from which this country is suffering.  It is the amount and the degree of capital investment, its pattern and direction, that determine the measure of business, industrial and agricultural activity.  For that reason, there is urgent necessity for capital development and before I finish with this matter I shall give my own view on the type of capital development that should be adopted as soon as possible. Not merely should there be Government capital development under the auspices, control and direction of the Government, through the means of public loans, but there should be the fullest possible co-operation in capital development by all institutions and <Col N="564" /> private individuals in this State, if possible to ease governmental activity in capital development.  It should be the aim to increase the flow of capital from the main sources from which capital can be acquired and that is through savings.  Of course, you cannot have savings if incomes are depressed by heavy taxation and by the policy of austerity of the present Government.</P>
    <P>There must be also what I have very frequently referred to as the prudent repatriation of our external assets through deliberate planned deficits in our balance of payments.  There must be achieved for our banking system the liquidity which they insist upon and which is desired, through the medium of the setting up of a money or bill market in this country, in Dublin or elsewhere, and through the creation of a proper stock exchange which will work in the national interest, and the formation of a capital investment board to regulate and order the flow of capital, such as I referred to in the various speeches I have made in the last 12 months.  That is an outline of the means with which I hope to deal further at a later stage.  These suggestions if carried into effect, certainly if carried into effect by a Government formed from this side of the House will go very far, if not the entire way, in reversing the trend that exists at the moment and in securing employment for the people who are suffering from the ills which had been inflicted upon them by the present Government, ills which have been wrongly diagnosed by the present Government and particularly by the Minister for Finance and which have been accentuated by the application of wrong remedies to the real disease by the same Minister.  The cure is to impress on the mind of the Minister for Finance and I believe on that of his colleagues, that they must bring this problem of the balance of payments into proper perspective.  That is a problem, but it is not the only problem nor is it the greatest problem we have to face in this country.  We have repeated that again and again since we started in 1948 to formulate our policy of productive capital investment.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Brennan who, <Col N="565" /> this afternoon, referred to the fact that I had drawn attention to this problem, and of the very serious character of it, as far back as 1948. I drew attention to it in that year in one of the earliest speeches which I made to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I have on another occasion quoted that speech.  It will be found in the Dáil Debates for the 19th July, 1951, at column 2048.  I said this shortly after the inter-Party Government was formed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two main long-term economic problems confronting this country are the necessity for greatly increased agricultural and industrial output and the rectification of the unhealthy condition of our balance of international payments.  The first of these problems is the more important.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the problem of increased agricultural and industrial production.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we can solve it, we will have gone a long way towards improving the balance of payments position as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those words have been proved this year to be true and accurate in every respect.  It is not entirely, I agree, but very largely, through the operation of the increase in our agricultural exports, that our balance of payments is about to, and probably will, be brought into almost complete equilibrium towards the end of this year.  In the speech which I made to the bankers, I again referred to the matter.  I am again quoting from the Debates of the 19th July, 1951, at column 2051.  I there referred to this problem of the balance of payments and to our policy of deliberately creating a deficit in our international balance of payments for the purpose of financing our policy of productive capital expenditure.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments is inevitable according as repatriation of capital takes place.  There are greater evils, however, than a temporary deficit in the balance of payments. This Government &mdash; I was, of course, referring to the inter-Party Government&mdash;believed that <Col N="566" /> impoverished and unnecessarily infertile land, lack of housing and shortage of hospital accommodation are far worse evils, evils which we are determined to extirpate, and which would even justify short-term economic loss for the sake of social and long-term economic gain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every word which I uttered there in 1948 I am proud to stand over, and proud to be able to justify.  The facts which have since taken place prove that beyond all controversy.  But that problem of the balance of payments must be got into its proper perspective.  We had to watch our balance of payments, but we have far greater problems to watch, far more serious matters to direct all our attention to, than the balance of payments.  But, unfortunately, the Minister for Finance was so obsessed with that particular problem that he was unable to see or appreciate that what we told him is a fact: that the problem of disequilibrium last year was a temporary one, that it had, even when he was talking, righted itself, and that our increase in agricultural exports and in our industrial exports would right that matter automatically, and that the trend at that time showed and demonstrated that the disequilibrium was automatically being adjusted.  Until that problem is got into its proper perspective by the Minister for Finance and by his colleagues, we will have no proper economic or financial policy in this country.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that, when we speak of the problem of the balance of payments, we are speaking of a payments problem.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I rather think he does&mdash; appreciates the importance of the word &ldquo;payments&rdquo; because, in the course of his speech&mdash;unfortunately I have not got it with me&mdash;in which he was making a case in connection with the balance of payments and the results that were likely to accrue, when he was adding up and prognosticating what it was likely to be, he did subtract from the £61.6 million, which was the reputed adverse balance of trade for last year, the sum of £4.9 million from the deficit which was a grant from the E.C.A.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> That is a matter which, I think, the Minister for Finance does not understand. Neither does he understand what really appears from the report of the Central Bank which is published for the year ending 31st March, 1952, which is the most recent publication of that august body.</P>
    <P>It will be observed from that report, page 7, that, in spite of all the hullabaloo about what was happening our external reserves&mdash;that our resources were being dissipated by the awful policy of the inter-Party Government in repatriating our external assets and in spite of the stockpiling and all that happened in 1951&mdash;a sum of £37,000,000 only was required to be taken from our external assets to help defray this deficit of £61.6 million for the year 1951.  Having set out a table of the estimates for the balance of payments during the past five years, the report of the Central Bank shows how that £37,000,000 was arrived at.  It was arrived at by taking the sum of £17.3 million, which was the amount that the associated banks or what we call the commercial banks, realised of external holdings&mdash;£14.5 million representing the degree of realisation of external holdings of the Central Bank, £3.3 million representing private holdings abroad and £2.2 million representing the proceeds of external securities of State funds.  But £37.3 million was all that was required to be resorted to of our very considerable holding of external resources and external assets in that year when the Minister for Finance said that our payments account and our financial position was such that it was desperate to the point of despair, or something of that description.</P>
    <P>Now, when you find that that is the position, it must be realised that in his effort to balance this payments account, all he succeeded in doing was to balance our sterling payments.  We had last year, which was supposed to be a desperate year, a surplus of £20.5 million with the United Kingdom.  We had to pay our way with Great Britain and we more than paid our way with her.  If we had a surplus of £1,000,000,000 to balance our sterling <Col N="568" /> account we would still have the problem of balancing our international payments as long as sterling is not convertible. That is the mistake which the Minister for Finance made.  He balanced it with sterling, but we still had the problem of getting hard currency from the sterling pool.  Therefore, from the point of view of our payments, the position of our external assets is quite irrelevant.  It has been put into a position of pre-eminence entirely unjustified in Government policy, and particularly the policy of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, when speaking in the Dáil a few nights ago, referred to the reason why he and the rest of his colleagues in the inter-Party Government reappointed the chairman of the Central Bank and some of his colleagues with whose policy none of us was in agreement.  He did it in order that they should be in a position, I think he used the phrase, to flash the red light when they thought it proper to do so in accordance with their particular and peculiar views, if I may say so, and then the Government of the day could take into account to such an extent as they wished this view on the flashing of that red light.</P>
    <P>The position is, however, that the financiers in this country have so long been looking at the red light that they have become financially colour blind, become so obsessed with the necessity for restriction that they have not yet realised that when our balance of payments is in balance, or almost in balance, as it will be this year, our actual payments problem will remain completely unaltered.  But the position where we have a surplus of sterling, where our payments problem from the point of view of paying for those goods that we get from hard currency areas remains unsolved by our solution of the balance of payment problem, has been brought about by the assault which has been made on personal incomes through the financial policy of the Government, by the lowering of our standard of living and by the unemployment which has been such a marked feature of our economy during the last 12 or 18 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> Might I on certain aspects of this case draw the Minister's attention to an article which appeared in a responsible British journal last Sunday, <i>The Observer</i>?  There appeared in a recent edition of <i>The Banker</i>, an article dealing with the pattern of sterling area payments and that article is remarkable for the fact that the figures given for the deficit in our balance of payments in each year are given in the most pessimistic possible way.  They lead to the most pessimistic possible interpretation of our financial position from the point of view of our international balance of payments.  The table in that article in <i>The Banker</i> was reproduced in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Observer.</i>  We find that where the table purports to set out our sterling area balance of payments Ireland is put down as having an adverse balance of £70,000,000 for the year 1951. Even the Minister for Finance had to admit that he was wrong in that figure. But it appears in the Central Bank Report for 1952 that our adverse balance of payments in the year 1951, our deficit as it is called in the table on page seven of that report, was £69.9 millions.  Obviously that table rounded off the figure at £69.9 million, entirely overlooking the fact, which was not properly brought out by the Report of the Central Bank because of the particular view they appear to have about the matter, that there should have been deducted from that £69.9 million a sum of £8.3 million under the heading &ldquo;balance unaccounted for&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Here in a responsible newspaper, which has a comment on the Commonwealth Conference which is taking place during this week and the issues of an important character which are likely to be discussed there, we are put down as having an adverse balance on our balance of payments of £70,000,000 instead of £61.6 million, and that error is repeated in the table right through to the year 1946 because of the particular way in which the Central Bank insist upon presenting our national trading accounts.  That £8.3 million, which ought to be deducted from the £69.9 million, is called a &ldquo;balance unaccounted for&rdquo;. It is believed to be the fact by responsible people that the attitude of the <Col N="570" /> Central Bank towards that figure of £8.3 million, which should have been deducted to arrive at our trade deficit, is that it is something in the nature of a capital figure, something for which we must provide a reserve, that it is really a debt and not, what in fact it is, a receipt.</P>
    <P>It is of course well known also that the very experienced and expert officers of the Central Statistics Office took precisely the opposite view to what is taken and persisted in by the Central Bank and its members to the point that this method of presenting our trading accounts may operate and, we believe, will operate this year, to the injury and detriment of the Irish economy and the Irish taxpayer.  That balance unaccounted for appears in the report of the Central Bank for 1952, and there is a figure for it going back to 1947.  You have on page 7 of the report something which is called first a deficit and then an assumed current deficit.  They call it an assumed current deficit, but <i>The Banker</i> and <i>The Observer</i> do not call it even an assumed current deficit.  We are credited with having a deficit of £70,000,000 last year while the real figure is only £61.6 million.</P>
    <P>That is of importance for this reason.  We all know that the Minister for Finance last year went over to London, or was summoned over, apparently, by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  None of us knows at present, except perhaps his ministerial colleagues, what took place at that conference.  All we know is what happened as a result of the conference. We know that when the Minister arrived back he put into operation a certain policy, and the excuse or explanation offered in defence of that policy was that it had been put up to him, by the British, apparently, that something was absolutely needed by our economy, some drastic steps were necessary to redress the disorder of our economy because of what is revealed by these accounts, because we were £70,000,000 &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; in our balance of payments.  We were told, if we are to make what is probably a reasonable deduction from the subsequent conduct of the Minister for <Col N="571" /> Finance and his colleagues and their policy, by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, that our balance of payments must be put right because we were in such a disordered state that drastic remedies were necessary before we would be entitled to draw upon the sterling area pool for the requirements to which we are entitled as a right in connection with our purchases in hard currency areas.</P>
    <P>These accounts are put in the most pessimistic form, and they give to our opponents or people who are entitled to take advantage of them, if we put them in that way, the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;There is something wrong with your economy.  Go and put it right.&rdquo;  We say there is nothing wrong with our economy except that the proper steps are not being taken to develop an underdeveloped economy and that what is wanted is expansion and not restriction.  We happen to look beyond what the British themselves do.  Would they bring in an item of that kind?  Would whoever is the counterpart of our chairman of the Central Bank and his colleagues adopt this extraordinary method of economy and put in this super-cautious item?  Not at all.  The British always state their position in terms very different from ours, and show, month by month, the effect of the varying economic situation upon the state of their reserves.  If they get any money by way of capital account, that is put in as a method of strengthening sterling.  But cautious as we are, we put it here in our national accounts as if it were something we owed instead of something that comes in.</P>

      <P>When we restrict imports, as we apparently have been doing, either by direct order or direct restriction, which apparently is the foundation of the Budget policy, or by cutting incomes, which obviously is Budget policy, and by these methods bring our international balance of payments into account, what we really are doing is not assisting ourselves to get hard currency, because we are only accumulating sterling which is inconvertible, but making it easier for the sterling area to carry on at our expense.  We do this by making smaller demands, because of reduced imports, upon the sterling area pool. Therefore we have given freedom to the British to increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We agreed that while we had the proceeds of the Marshall Loan we would make no net draw on the sterling area pool but we got from Sir Stafford Cripps this undertaking that if and when we required to draw for our dollars or for other hard currencies, whether by reason of lack of dollars from Marshall Aid or at the conclusion of Marshall Aid, or when we wanted it, then we would be entitled as a right to draw upon the sterling area pool.

      <P>What I have said I believe to be an absolutely accurate statement of facts.  Perhaps the Minister is hypersensitive that I was accusing him or any of his colleagues of the vilest motives.  What I was doing, when he interrupted, was speaking about what we were supposed to have done in 1948, in consultation with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I did not refer to the Minister at all.  These accounts were prepared in such a way that anyone who wanted to take advantage of our so-called difficulties in connection with our balance of payments was given that opportunity by the form in which these accounts were prepared.  It would have been perhaps better for the people of this country had we been told what occurred between the Minister for Finance and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer rather than be left to speculate.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister give me one&mdash;not several&mdash;and I will apologise here and now.  So far as I could I have kept to the facts.  Apparently the Minister cannot take the facts.  He has spoken about the arrangements we made with the late Sir Stafford Cripps.  The actual details of all that have been given by me and my colleagues on several occasions.  I believe I stated those details accurately.  I was present throughout the entire discussion with the late Sir Stafford Cripps. That arrangement was come to with him in the full realisation that we were doing what was proper and right for our people and we secured for our successors the right to go to the sterling area pool, not with our hats in our hands but as a customer to a banker and as a matter of right and justice.  That is what we secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will <Col N="576" /> show me where I suggested that, I will withdraw it at once.  I was pointing out that because of the form of our accounts an opportunity is given to those people who, if they like to do so, want to take advantage of the fact that our accounts appear to show that our adverse trade balance is in such a state of disequilibrium that there is something wrong which must be set right and, in order to set it right, we require the policy of the present Minister for Finance, apparently with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, causing such anguish to and such harsh repercussions upon every section of our people.  That is the point I am trying to make.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the necessity for the repatriation of our sterling assets so often in the past that I do not think I need repeat my arguments again tonight. We have now to look for the source of the capital that is required. That source in the first instance lies primarily in the savings of our people. We cannot have any savings until we stop the assault that has been made on the incomes of our people because of the heavy and unnecessary taxation imposed by the Budget this year.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of gratification to know that this year despite all the dismal features of our economy there have been considerable savings by our people.  Whether that is due to the stocking up because of the Korean War or to anticipatory buying for other reasons I do not know.  Again and again, I have given details of the methods by which a savings campaign should be initiated in order to get capital.  I do not wish to go over the ground again.  The ground has been covered in several of the speeches I have made in the course of the last 12 months.  I have suggested the establishment of a central savings office, the help of trade unions, industrialists and local groups all over the country. Changes in taxation should be made and directed towards encouraging private saving.  It has been suggested that industry and business should be encouraged to build up savings instead of paying out dividends.  Further reliefs should be given with suitable safeguards on life insurance premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a source of capital in the <Col N="577" /> money deposited by our people and particularly by our farmers with the commercial banks.  Our farmers have a tradition of putting their savings on deposit receipt in the banks rather than of investing them in Irish industry and the banks act as savings institutions and not as investment institutions. Deputy McGilligan in the course of his speech on the Estimate for the Minister for Finance analysed and expounded the motives of the commercial banks in their investment policy in connection with deposits.  Their excuse for the enormous amount of money they invest in British and foreign securities is their desire for liquidity.  One might concede that there is some necessity for something like liquidity. How can that liquidity be secured?  It can be secured in three ways.  It can be secured by the co-operation of the Central Bank.  It can be secured by the establishment here of a money market and by an improvement of the stock exchange.  We discussed with the representatives of the commercial banks the necessity for their giving the moneys required by the Dublin Corporation to finance their housing operations and we told them that they had failed in their duty of setting up a money market here and improving the operations of the stock exchange.  We believe that is a policy that any Government&mdash;certainly any Government from this side of the House&mdash;would take immediate steps to implement in order to ensure that capital would be provided for the establishment of such a money market.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to notice that the bankers of India who are, I am informed, very conservative financiers have recently set about establishing a short-term money market.  We pressed upon the representatives of the commercial banks the absolute necessity for their co-operation in connection with these matters which would, in effect, very shortly give them the liquidity they so much desired without the necessity, which they so much insist upon, of investing the savings of our people in British and foreign securities. If steps were taken to establish a money market and create jobbing houses, which act I believe as wholesalers in stocks and shares, and if the <Col N="578" /> Central Bank was prepared to co-operate in these, too, then the necessary liquidity would be very easily secured at a very early date.</P>
    <P>The stock exchange at the moment is in its structure a barrier to industrial progress.  Had we the institutions to which I have referred the moneys that now go into the commercial banks would by-pass those institutions and be diverted into Irish industry and into the schemes of capital expenditure necessary for the development of our own resources.  The present stock exchange is a barrier to that progress. That body if it was working in the national interest should provide the motivating force for an expanding Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I take it that all Deputies will agree that an efficient stock exchange could be a useful institution and could act and should act in providing perfect competition for the sale of stocks and shares.  I am not talking about a matter that has occurred to us in the past few days. It is nearly two years since we raised this matter and pressed it upon the banks when we discussed the necessity for the financing of the housing loan for the Dublin Corporation.  It was not <Col N="579" /> yesterday or to-day that these considerations were pressed upon the banks. Until this liquidity that they desire and that, apparently, is necessary for their operations, or until some degree of liquidity is provided for them by the method I have suggested, we will still have the position where the depositors' money is invested through the medium of the commercial banks in every institution except Irish institutions and in every industry except Irish industry, with the possible exception of a very small amount.</P>
      <P>I said at an early stage that I favour capital expenditure.  I do.  I favour it also by all institutions whose duty it is to co-operate in spending the capital necessary for the development of the land, industry and the resources of this country.  I am informed that here in Dublin we have no real competition in the sale of stocks and shares.  There is nothing but an auction from time to time, which largely serves to punctuate the stagnation of that concern.  I believe, as we believed years ago, in the necessity for recreating the institution of the stock exchange and in the creation of a short-term money market. With that would go a wish to co-operate by the Central Bank, and with that would be given that necessary liquidity which would give safety, security and investment of Irish money in Irish land and Irish development.</P>
      <P>I have already said that, in the course of speeches which I made throughout the country, I suggested the formation of a capital investment board.  I gave details of it in several speeches.  Its duty would be to see that there was an orderly and regulated investment of capital that was being put into Irish industry and Irish land, and generally in the enterprises of a protective character which were the subject of our policy in our programme of capital expenditure which we initiated in 1950.  That board could take away the matter from the arena of Party politics.</P>

      <P>I can refer the Minister to the speech I made when I adumbrated this matter and developed it.  Actually, I made the speech in February last&mdash;almost 12 months ago. I will read the relevant part of it now. Deputies can then choose between the Minister's view and the views that I put forward.  I will quote my own words now so that judgment can be made upon them:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recognising that the wealth of Ireland depends upon the skilful application of Irish labour to the exploitation of Irish resources a high and well-ordered programme of investment must be maintained to provide Irish labour with the capital required. The dual Budget must be continued and extended.  If the system of the dual Budget is to be a success its principles must be clearly understood, and that system must be placed as far as possible beyond politics and beyond misrepresentation. A new administrative machine could well be fashioned with the duty of sifting and passing all projects which are proper for financing as capital projects out of capital and not out of the proceeds of taxation. By the use of this instrument it would become impossible for political opponents to allege that money was being borrowed which should properly be raised by taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no constitutional difficulties in the way of a national investment board constantly concerned to relate the level of investment with the rate of saving and the state of the balance of payments.  To such a board would be entrusted the general control and direction of national investment, and such control would include the exercise of any power required in a matter such as the <Col N="581" /> expansion or restriction of credit. Treasury control would continue its useful but strictly defined purpose of financial watch-dog.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There I expounded in public the policy which I now repeat for a capital investment board.  If the Minister says that that brings it into the arena of politics let him say how that is so. When I first expounded it in that speech it was for the purpose of bringing it outside the arena of politics. When the Minister himself was in opposition he tried to bring the matter of productive capital development in this country&mdash;which was such a success under the aegis of the inter-Party Government&mdash;into politics and to make political capital out of it.  I said that the country requires something to be done at an early moment to alleviate the anxieties and the miseries which we are facing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been waiting a long time for something to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that will face any Government in connection with prices and price control.  The present Government threw the matter into chaos early this year by their sudden withdrawal of the food subsidies.  As time goes on, that withdrawal will create not merely for themselves but for any Government that may succeed them difficulties of an almost insuperable kind in connection with price control and the reduction of the prices of food.  I drew attention to that matter in Athlone last June.  I have the fullest appreciation, as have my colleagues, of the difficulties of rising prices and price control, and of the task of bringing about anything in the nature of price stability. The only way in which that can be done is by a drastic reduction in taxation. The only secure way in which any impression can be made on the cost of living and on price structure is by a drastic reduction in taxation.  How can that be achieved, having regard to the policy pursued by the Government in its financial concerns?  To bring about a reduction of taxation in this country it will be necessary to curtail Government expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> The problem will be to reconcile the curtailment of Government expenditure and the task of increasing capital productive enterprises which are essential to cure unemployment, to raise the standard of living of our people and to bring some measure of price stability into our country.  The only real way you can do that is by decreasing taxation and in order to get decreased taxation, and at the same time carry on a policy of productive capital expenditure, it is essential that the greater part of that productive capital expenditure&mdash;perhaps not the greater part but to a very great extent&mdash;should be undertaken by other institutions and other individuals within the State. That should be encouraged.  Private citizens should be encouraged to put their money into Irish industries and into productive enterprises of the character to which we have referred. In that task, I say, the banking concerns and the Central Bank must play their part if there is to be a continuation of the policy of productive capital expenditure which was initiated by the inter-Party Government. We must have the co-operation of all institutions and private individuals. The last loan which was issued was issued at such a rate that it will be, to say the least of it, extremely difficult for any Government in the near future to obtain a substantial amount of money at a lower rate than 5 per cent. That rate is so crippling that it will not be possible to carry out anything in the nature of a forward policy of expansion.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by repeating what I said in the earlier part of my remarks.  The public temper at the present moment is such that it will not bruit any longer the anxieties and the worries that are affecting every section of the people.  I have endeavoured, no matter what the Minister in his truculent mood may say or think, to approach this matter in a constructive fashion.  I say, whatever the Minister may say in reply, that if the Irish people impose upon us the very burdensome task of resurrecting this country from the desperate situation into which it has been plunged by him and his colleagues, at least it can be said that <Col N="583" /> we have declared in opposition the policy which we will put into effect as a Government.  We believe, and sincerely believe, that that policy will do what the Minister and his colleagues have failed to do&mdash;give some hope to the people of the country, give employment to those whom they have put out of employment, that it will do what should have been done and what could have been done to develop our undeveloped resources in men and material, that it will do something that will show that we have confidence in Ireland and the Irish people, and that it is not our policy to fasten austerity upon them.  The policy which I have outlined in the remarks which I have made to-day and in the speeches which my colleagues and I have made in the last 12 months will substitute, for a policy of austerity and restriction, a policy of expansion, a policy that will bring increased wealth and increased comfort to our people, who have been so bemused, fettered and cast down by the policy pursued by the present Government.</P>

      <P>The speech made by the Minister introducing this Bill contrasted very much with the speech he made in 1950.  Those of us who remember what the Minister said when he sat in opposition on this side of the House can recall the wild speech which he delivered then, which contrasts very much with the speech he made on this Bill.  It appears as though he was talking the other day with his tongue in his cheek.  The passage of time has shown that the attitude of the Minister and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party two years ago was completely dishonest.</P>

      <P>Anybody who read the debate of 1950 and who heard Deputy Lemass then can see his approach at that time and his effort to nail on the inter-Party Government the difficulties that arose from the Korean War.  At that time the attitude of Fianna Fáil was that any slight upward trend that had taken place in prices was being caused by the inter-Party Government and not by the Korean conflict.  Here the other day we had Deputy Bartley pointing out that the difficulties at the present time were due to the fact that the war in Korea did not go well for the Americans.  Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.  It was either the effects of the conflict in the East that caused this upward trend or it was the inter-Party Government.  It cannot have been both.</P>
      <P>The Minister was content in his speech on this Bill to deal particularly with the bread and flour situation.  He made only very limited reference to any other matters coming within the scope of the Bill.  He was content with tossing the bakers' farthing.  He tossed it several times and in the long run we found him splitting the farthing and saying that finance was manipulated by dealings in the half-farthing. People at the present time are not thinking of farthings.  They are thinking of bread and butter.  This time the Minister's speech was a tame approach to a very difficult problem. It was supported by a number of lame excuses.  It was significant that his speech was very brief and was not so wide in its scope as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1950 we were told all about high prices, unemployment and emigration. When the present Government came into office it proceeded not only to sanction an increase in prices but to decontrol prices.  Even recently we have seen another set of prices decontrolled to the disadvantage of people with limited earnings.  The futility of <Col N="585" /> the Fianna Fáil Party is becoming more and more apparent.  They seem to have nothing only excuses to offer instead of a solution for the problems which are confronting the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>The cost of living, since this time two years, has risen by more than 20 per cent.  There has been a particularly significant rise since the present Government took office.  But that was natural, due to the fact that prices were increased by ministerial Order and decontrolled by ministerial Order.  They were, consequently, allowed to rise.  During the inter-Party régime, the cost of living only went up 5 per cent. in three and a half years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell him that the cost of living is calculated at the present time on a basis made out by Fianna Fáil in 1947.  The basis of calculation, at the present time and over the years, has been taken on a 1947 set of figures.  Take it at 100 in 1947, it was 102 in February, 1951, and it probably went up another 3 per cent. between that and June when the present Government took office, thus making a total of 5 per cent. in three and a half years.  Anyone who wishes <Col N="586" /> can get these statistics, and can also get the last figure of 122 in comparison with the 100 for 1947 for the August calculation.  The November calculation will not be known for a couple of months.  That is just as well maybe for the Fianna Fáil Party.  It has probably been more than 20 per cent. since February, 1951.</P>
      <P>Let us remember, too, that on the average wages went up between 10 and 20 per cent. during the inter-Party régime.  The rise of 5 per cent. in the cost of living was more than met by the upward adjustment of wages during that time.  Now, we have upward adjustments of wages, in many cases 5 per cent. and less than 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Eleven per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even supposing it is 11 per cent., that is supposed to offset a cost-of-living rise of nearly 25 per cent. Obviously, therefore, the balance is against those people who have to depend on weekly earnings and on an upward adjustment to their wages.</P>
      <P>The standard of living is also down. The people are now unable to buy the quantity of food or the essential commodities which they were able to buy with their wages during the inter-Party régime.  The figures easily prove that.  It is true, even from the round figures I have given, that £5 now will only buy what £4 could buy in June, 1951, when the Fianna Fáil Party took office.  It is apparently the deliberate policy of Fianna Fáil to cut down the standard of living.  Apparently, in their view, the people were living too well. I remember that, in 1950, it was pointed out that our consumption of butter amounted to 13 oz. per head per week of the population, that is, taking men, women and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rationed then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They were buying their ration at 2/8 per lb., and buying as much more as they wanted at the ordinary economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Four shillings per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Now, they are paying almost 4/- per lb. for all the <Col N="587" /> butter they eat.  When the inter-Party Government came in, our people were on 2 oz. of butter per week.  It was not very difficult for them to pay for their ration at that time.  That ration was increased to 8 oz. per week by the inter-Party Government, and the butter was made available to them at 2/8 per lb.  Butter is now 3/10.  That is a rise of 1/- per lb. since the inter-Party Government left office and the present Government took control.</P>
      <P>Butter is not the only commodity in respect of which consumption has been restricted by the price.  It is well known that people are not now consuming as much bread as they did formerly.  In the case of big families which find it necessary to purchase large quantities of bread, they just cannot afford to do so, and have to cut down their consumption.  The price of tea was also increased.  The sky is the limit now for tea.  In our time, it was available to them at a fair price on the ration, with the economic price over and above that. All must now pay more than the economic price.</P>
      <P>That is so much for the cost of living and the rise in prices.  We also find that unemployment has risen rapidly since the change of Government. This was caused particularly by irresponsible ministerial speeches. These speeches involved hunger and hardship for the people.  They were made in order to gain political advantage as the Ministers thought they would.  These panic and scare-making speeches eventually caused a recession in trade and a slump in business.  The result is that we are now going up towards the Fianna Fáil figure of unemployment in 1939 which was 119,000.  The unemployment figure has gone up by nearly 20,000 since Fianna Fáil took office.  That does not take into account the fall in the income of wage earners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government was in office wage earners were working overtime.  They had their overtime pay in addition to their weekly wages. Now many of them are on short time and whether they like it or not they have to be glad of it.  Similarly, the <Col N="588" /> round-the-clock shift work, which was in operation in many factories during the time of the inter-Party Government, has been abandoned.  The result is that industrial production is down. The figures show a decline of 15 per cent.  That is mainly due to the fact that there are less people on overtime and more people on short time, with the result that less is being produced by our industrial undertakings.  The gross earnings of those engaged in industries have, consequently, been reduced. The jobs of many of those people are now in danger.  People who had been in employment for nearly a generation, now find themselves in the position that any day, as a result of the policy pursued by the present Government, they may be without a job.</P>
    <P>In 1950, the unemployment figure was the lowest ever since the establishment of this State 30 years ago.  We are beginning to move back now towards the high figure of unemployment which we had before the world war.  The inter-Party Government found it necessary to call workers home to take a hand in the building of this country, particularly in relation to housing.  The call was particularly directed to skilled tradesmen who could take part in the building of these houses.  Many of these workers are now making their way back to Britain from which we called them in 1949.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figure would be still higher were it not for the fact that many men were brought into the Army which has been increased by 5,000.  If these 5,000 had not joined the Army, the question is whether employment would be available for them here. The inter-Party Government were criticised because they kept the Army at what appeared to be an adequate figure but which, according to Fianna Fáil, was too low.  We kept it at that figure because we did not want the people to leave the fields and the factories where there was work for them.  It would not be fair to call them into the Army at a time when they were able to get employment in civil life.  Our idea has always been to allow the people to work on the land and in the factories.  We knew that if it were necessary to call them into <Col N="589" /> the Army and to give service to the nation they would always be available and would be well fitted for the Army if the necessity arose.</P>
    <P>In 1950, there were more people in insurable employment than at any time during the previous 30 years.  There were approximately 230,000 people engaged at that time in various kinds of insurable employment as compared with approximately 190,000 when the inter-Party Government took office in 1948.  The inter-Party Government put an extra 38,000 people into employment in the space of 38 months.  The number of people going into employment was increasing up to the change of Government. The number of unemployed began to increase about two months after the change of Government.</P>
    <P>As an example of that I may say that this week there are nearly 1,000 men unemployed in County Dublin.  It has been necessary for the Dublin County Council to make a sum of £4,000 available for relief work so that at least some of these who are married will have some money to purchase the food and other necessaries which go with the Christmas festivities.  The Dublin County Council have only been able to make relief work available for 350 out of these 1,000 men.  The point I want to make is that in 1949 and 1950 it was not necessary to have any relief schemes because there was nobody looking for work in County Dublin. We have not enough money this year to give even a couple of weeks' employment to all of these 1,000 men.</P>
    <P>Emigration, of course, has also increased. The emigration figure since the change of Government has gone up by 50 per cent.  These people have no alternative but to emigrate.  Many of them are men that were called back in 1949 to work on the housing programme of the inter-Party Government.  We do not see any photographs being published now of people queueing up for passports.  If photographs were published now we would see much longer queues than there were when these photographs were being published.  That is the type of Fianna Fáil propaganda which the inter-Party Government had to put up with.  Now that the inter-Party Government has been removed <Col N="590" /> the people can see for themselves that the tactics of the Fianna Fáil Party have been responsible to a great extent for bringing about a vast change in their household budget.  Industrial development is at a standstill.  When the inter-Party Government were in office, it was difficult for people desiring to establish factories to secure a site anywhere near Dublin because there was such a push on at that time for the establishment of factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>How many were established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 200 were established during that time.  If Deputy Cunningham wants to confirm that he can look up the answer to a parliamentary question which was put down about seven months ago.  There were something like 246 factories established during the régime of the inter-Party Government, and 46 of these were on the way before the inter-Party Government took office.  I hope that is clear to the Deputy.  That explains the reason why it was difficult for people desiring to establish factories near Dublin to get sites.  There was a very keen demand for sites at that time.  I understand that there are factory sites available now in or around the city, but that there are no people desiring to take them in order to establish factories.</P>
      <P>Balbriggan has changed from a busy town to a ghost town.  There are more unemployed in Balbriggan, I think, than in any other town of its size in Ireland.  One factory is, I think, completely closed down and the others are on half-time or short-time.  The result is that there is a very large number of people unemployed in Balbriggan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there are approximately 200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been able to give him information in reply to a few of his interjections.  In any event, Balbriggan is in a very bad way at <Col N="591" /> present.  Some of the unemployed there will be able to get a couple of weeks' work before Christmas under the relief scheme.  Some years ago, when a relief scheme was brought in for the County Dublin, some of the unemployed found that they could not take county council work because they were not accustomed to it.  They were accustomed to another type of work, and it was no great consolation to them to be told: &ldquo;We will give you a fortnight on county council work just to tide you over Christmas.&rdquo; They wanted the type of work in which they had always been engaged.</P>
      <P>Apparently no effort is being made by the Government to put things right in Balbriggan.  The factories are lying there idle or are on short-time because of lack of demand for the textiles which they were producing when the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention that these factories were working night and day. At that time they were working three shifts of eight hours, and now they are closed down altogether.  I observed too in connection with this Bill that the building Order has been revoked because there is a sufficiency now of building materials.  That is a happy development, but unfortunately the building slump has come now.  The recent increase in interest on the national loan has caused a slump in the building trade because money is too dear.  People desiring to avail of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act would be obliged to pay 5¾ per cent., which would really mean that on £1,000 borrowed they would have £1,000 interest to pay in 16 or 17 years, and they would still owe the £1,000 they had borrowed.  The rate of interest has become so heavy that these people cannot avail of that type of loan in future.  The result is that there is a building slump.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the fact that 5,000 tons of timber were sent from Dublin to Belfast for the purpose of building houses in Belfast, or perhaps in Great Britain.  I think it was very foolish of the Minister to give permission for that timber to be sent out to build houses in Belfast and elsewhere <Col N="592" /> when there are 20,000 houses needed in Dublin.  We were offered the consolation that timber in future can be bought cheaper.  I heard that there is bloodstained Russian timber at the docks, and that it was produced by slave labour and that it has been brought in here to replace the 5,000 tons of timber which were exported some weeks ago from Dublin to Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The timber in this case came from Canada.  I have not the cutting here but I think you can take that as being correct.  I saw either in the <i>Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> a photograph of a train loaded with this timber ready to leave Dublin for Belfast, and I think, underneath that photograph, I saw that it was Canadian timber.  Anyway, I suppose, when the building programme was stopped, the Government decided to abandon the idea of proceeding with the housing programme, particularly the 20,000 houses still needed for Dublin City, and that was why they gave permission for this timber to be sent from Dublin to Belfast.  Apparently their guess was fairly right as far as Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans are concerned and as far as people desiring to build their own houses are concerned, because that type of enterprise and speculative building has come to a standstill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that builders have been restricted in the matter of credit.  A large portion of the housing programme credit made available to the building contractors enabled them to build homes for the people.  That credit was destroyed, of <Col N="593" /> course, by the ministerial speeches, panic and scare created this time last year deliberately by the Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government, desiring, I expect, to place the blame on the inter-Party Government for their own inability to manage the affairs of the nation as you now know it to be.</P>
    <P>I have heard some reference made to the adverse trade balance.  Let us remember that the Fianna Fáil Party took office on 13th June, 1951.  Consequently, during more than six months of the year 1951 they were in control of the affairs of this country.  Let us look at the figures concerning the adverse trade balance.  I am not going to take the June figure because they can tell me their predecessors were responsible for that figure, if they wish, but I am going to take figures for each month from July to December, 1951.  I have added them together and I find that the total of the trade deficit for the last half year of 1951 amounted to £49,500,000.  The Fianna Fáil Party had control over our trade and over our activities for those six months.  With that control and applying it in whatever way they did, the adverse trade balance for the latter half of 1951 amounted to £49,500,000. Do not forget that when the change of Government came, the inter-Party Government handed over £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid money to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Therefore, it is possible that that £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid money was used in this £49,500,000 adverse trade balance.  The Fianna Fáil Party spent more of the Marshall Aid money in seven months than the inter-Party Government spent in three years.  They spent £26,000,000 and the inter-Party Government spent the remaining £18,000,000 before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>We know too that the Fianna Fáil Party have changed their attitude in regard to capital development, and particularly in regard to borrowing for capital development.  But last year they did not do any borrowing for capital development.  They went on with the inter-Party programme of capital development and made no effort to finance it.  Only this year they came along and raised a national <Col N="594" /> loan of £20,000,000 for which they gave the very generous interest of 5 per cent.  Over the period of 20 years in which that loan will be repaid the people who had money and made it available for this loan will have received £20,000,000 for their generosity in making the £20,000,000 available.</P>
    <P>Of course, in addition to the £20,000,000 that will be paid to those lenders, the £20,000,000 they gave us a couple of months ago will be given back to them.  In other words, we are going to give them £20,000,000 for the privilege of giving £20,000,000 and the payment will be made at the end of 20 years.</P>
    <P>This increase in the interest was unjustified. The argument was put forward by the Minister for Finance that his loan might not have succeeded if he offered any less than 5 per cent.  It was a very lame excuse considering that £39,000,000 was borrowed by Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government at rates of interest of 3¼ and 3½ per cent.  The inter-Party Government raised £39,000,000.  We now have on top of that a loan of £20,000,000 at 5 per cent., a loan for which the taxpayers must be the guarantors since it is they who will have to pay this fantastic rate of interest.  Such a rate of interest in respect of a national loan has never been heard of before.</P>
    <P>It has been said that business premises and shops are forsaken.  Certainly grocers' establishments are forsaken and so are the drapers'.  Never has there been such a slackness in trade.  Licensed premises are experiencing the same slackness.  The decontrolling of prices and the sanctioning of increased prices has left the ordinary people with very little money to spend.  They are so busy trying to pay the extra 1/- per lb. for butter, the extra 3d. per loaf for bread, the higher price for tea and the extra 2/1 per stone for flour that they have no money left for other essentials.</P>
    <P>I hoped the Minister would make some reference to the cost of living. I hoped he would tell us what he proposed to do in relation to it or whether this Bill was intended to maintain the present position.  I <Col N="595" /> hoped he might tell us if there was any intention of a change in relation to prices.  Unfortunately, the Minister has been content to hide behind the Prices Advisory Body.  He mentioned that body in a defensive way.  He was very opposed to its establishment and he said that it was being set up by the inter-Party Government so that they could shelve their responsibilities. The general public has found. however, that the Prices Advisory Body has operated very fairly, and to-day we find the Minister using it as a kind of defence weapon for himself.  It is a fantastic change of attitude.</P>
    <P>He did say that the whole structure of price control in relation to flour milling was bad.  I heard Deputy Keane give remarkable figures showing that it is not necessary for the Minister to be quite so anxious about the farthings and the halfpennies so far as the millers and bakers are concerned.  Dublin bakers to-day are selling bread down the country, 100 miles away from the capital, cheaper than they are selling the same bread in Dublin and its environs.  It is difficult to understand how they can transport bread that distance and sell it cheaper to the people in the rural areas than they can to the citizens of Dublin living beside the bakery. I presume that is why these millers were able to give such substantial subscriptions, as they are reputed to have given, to the Fianna Fáil Party in connection with the by-elections during the summer.  Judging by what Deputy Keane has said, the prices are in need of investigation.</P>
    <P>Bread is a very important commodity in every household.  It is remarkable that the Minister instead of sanctioning the increase of a farthing&mdash;which, of course, became a halfpenny and ultimately a penny to the consumer&mdash;decided not to put the matter to the Prices Advisory Body. Surely if the increase were justified, it could have been justified before that body.  The argument was advanced that there would be protracted dislocation in the bakery industry.  There was dislocation in <Col N="596" /> the industry early in 1948 but the difficulties were resolved at that time. If difficulties arose now they could equally well be resolved.</P>
    <P>In 1950 when the Minister was in opposition, he complained that the inter-Party Government had not seen fit to introduce a permanent measure. Last year he himself introduced a temporary measure.  We did not cavil at that because we felt that he might not have had sufficient time to introduce a permanent Bill.  This year he comes along again and introduces a temporary measure and says he does not propose to bring in permanent legislation and probably will not bring it in this time next year either. Surely we are entitled to some consistency.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more obvious every day that the Government is incapable. It does not seem to care what effect its activities have on the general community.  Food has been heartlessly increased in price.  So have many other commodities.  The recent by-election reflects the attitude of the people in general and particularly the attitude of the people in the cities and towns.  It was the cities and towns that added strength to Fianna Fáil in the last general election enabling them to become the Government with the aid of a few Independents. It was the people in the cities and towns annoyed at the rise of 2d. in the lb. of butter that brought about the change in 1951.  Butter has increased by 1/- a lb. since then.  Tea has increased.  So has bacon, meat and all the other items that are normally used in the ordinary household and I think it is only right that we should demand an immediate general election.  If we claim to be democratic and if we say the people are entitled to a Government elected from the people we should now give the people an opportunity of speaking. We should not have a Government that represents only 30 per cent. of the people.  In the recent by-election 70 per cent. of the people voted against the Government.  We should give the people a chance to speak and it is only right that we on the Opposition Benches should demand an immediate dissolution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> It is only right that Deputies on this side of the House should demand a dissolution and should demand the immediate resignation of the Government so that the people will be allowed to speak and so that they will be allowed to elect a Government that will appreciate the difficulties under which our people are labouring at the present time.</P>

I see nothing wrong with merchants or anybody else selling their commodities outside this country or with importing goods and then exporting them at a profit.  That is what was done in the case of timber.  That is especially so when we are in a position to buy and to secure cheaper timber to replace the timber which we export.</P>

      <P>The very same people insist on our buying tea from Britain. They are the same people who bought tea at the high prices and stockpiled it.  The result to-day is that the Irish <Col N="598" /> people are paying more for their tea than they would normally be paying for it.  That will be so while we have large stocks of the stockpiled tea on hands. There were suggestions that we should again throw ourselves on the mercy of the British and buy our tea from them. When another war would break out they would keep 2 oz. for themselves and give us ½ oz.  Everybody knows the hardship that the people of this country suffered when they got only ½ oz. of tea per head from the British Government during the emergency, while the British gave 2 oz. per head to their own people.  I am in entire agreement with the Minister when he said that he would leave the Government if that should happen.  I think that any man with any spark of Irish nationality in him would do the same.</P>

      <P>I think it would be folly to put ourselves at the mercy of the British for our supplies, so that when war or something else would break out they would look after themselves and leave us without it.  It is the same as when they imposed an extra levy of 25/- a ton on the coal that we were buying &mdash; an extra levy which their own people or the people in the Six Counties had not to pay.  When the people here make a little bit of profit by exporting timber to the Six Counties there is a terrible outcry. No Deputy on this side of the House need be ashamed of Fianna Fáil's housing programme.  The Fianna Fáil Government brought in the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1932.  They built more houses in a couple of years than the Coalition Government would build if they were there for 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.  I pass by them every evening on my way home from the Dáil.  We have built more <Col N="599" /> houses in Cork since this Government was returned to office than were built in the previous six years&mdash;and I have a question down to prove that.  The people on the Opposition Benches talk about housing and industry.  Do we not all remember when, in 1932, the people on the Opposition side of the House were satisfied to import every bit of the flour coming into this country from Liverpool and Birken-head? We have a picture of that situation below in Cork.  The little red-brick building that was there in 1932 is still there just the same as it was.  Alongside it, we can see the huge mills and silos which were built as a result of the efforts of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce. We know that the Coalition Government would hardly have been able to build a house if our present Minister for Industry and Commerce had not built cement factories for the production of cement here at a rate cheaper than it could be obtained from Britain, notwithstanding the fact that they were paying 25/- a ton more for the coal they were using in these cement factories.</P>
      <P>We know very well that there has been a slump.  One reason is that the slump has been world-wide.  A big factor, however, which caused the slump in the textile factories and other factories in this country was the stockpiling which was carried out by the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>So we did stockpile?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a well-known fact.  We have plenty of evidence now that the tide has turned.  The mills down in Cork are in full production. Dunlops are working three shifts a day for a full 24 hours.  They make tyres.  Sunbeam Wolsey have taken on more hands.  O'Brien's, Spinners, are working a couple of shifts a day. Deputy O'Gorman spoke about Youghal last week.  As far as I recollect, there was no industry in Youghal&mdash;except a small pottery which was there when I was very young&mdash; until Fianna Fáil encouraged the establishment of Seafield Fabrics and <Col N="600" /> Blackwater Cottons.  Nobody knows that better than Deputy O'Gorman. He was at the opening of Blackwater Cottons.  Although this industry has been started only a couple of months, they are already working on an extension to Blackwater Cottons.</P>
      <P>We know very well that there had to be taxation to pay the debts left by the Coalition Government.  We know that they made no provision for the subsidy to Córas Iompair Éireann and that £1,800,000 was due when Fianna Fáil came into office.  We know that no provision was made for the arbitration award to civil servants and that Fianna Fáil had to provide £3,500,000 for that purpose.  We know that one of the first acts of the Coalition Government was to close down the chassis factory at Inchicore&mdash;the one great chance we had to start the heavy engineering industry in this country.  They closed it down because it was a Fianna Fáil scheme and they sold the most up-to-date machinery and tools there as scrap.  We know that they had to send their orders over to Park Royal and that they had to send their men over there from Inchicore to carry out their orders and to do their work there.  They closed down Aer Linte because it was a Fianna Fáil scheme and they sold the Constellations for a couple of million pounds.  Every transatlantic airway in the world made huge profits last year. The Coalition Government sold everything that was of any value to this country.  As Deputy Corry said, they are like a woman who sold every stick of furniture in the house.</P>
      <P>Was it not Fianna Fáil who built the three extra sugar factories, and did we not hear Deputy Dillon say here in 1947 that it would be a good job for this country if the four sugar factories were bombed, that we would then be able to pay every child in the country an allowance of 5/-, and that after the war sugar could be landed on the quays of Dublin at 2d. per lb.?  That statement will be found in the records of the House.  If we listened to the advice of people of that kind, we can get an idea of what the position of the country would be at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that we are producing <Col N="601" /> sugar much more cheaply than we could import it at present and that, for the quantity of sugar we had to import, we were obliged to pay £1,000,000 more than the price at which we could have produced it in this country.  We know also that the present Minister started Irish Shipping and that he is increasing his activities in that regard.  We also know the attitude of the inter-Party Government to the Store Street building. Because it was a Fianna Fáil scheme, they wanted to hold it up and leave the people standing in snow and sleet on Aston's Quay, very often for an hour, waiting for country buses. That did not worry them; this was a Fianna Fáil scheme and it had to go. Thank God they went in time to have it restored.  Everybody in the country knows that that building was badly needed.</P>
    <P>We also know the position in regard to Irish Steel, that part of the plant for the rolling mills was there for three years, but money would not be advanced for it.  They now talk about increased interest rates, but did the inter-Party Government not increase the interest rates for housing?  Did they not increase the rate from 3 per cent. to 3¾ per cent.  One would think now that there never had been an increase before.</P>
    <P>I think that, in the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, we have the best man for that position that we possibly could.  I think that is admitted by every Party in the House when they are in the mood to talk honestly.  When Deputies stand up here and talk about depression they know in their hearts that the cause of the depression, the cause of the necessity for the loan and the cause of the Budget was their reckless spending. Deputy Dillon told us that his trouble on one occasion was that he did not know how he would spend £5,000,000 in one evening.  Everybody knows that we could make everyone happy for the time being if we kept on spending money and paid nobody.</P>

      <P>The inter-Party Government made no provision for a <Col N="602" /> subsidy for Córas Iompair Éireann and we hear a lot of moaning from Labour Deputies from time to time about dismissals from Córas Iompair Éireann. Were it not for this Government, there would be no one at all employed in Córas Iompair Éireann because there would be no subsidies for it.  People should face the position fairly and honestly, and admit, as everybody knows, that the position of the country has improved.  We can see that daily, at least around Cork.  There is no doubt that the position was bad, due to the policy of the people who were in power before Fianna Fáil regained office.  With the help of God, the position will come right and there is no reason in the world for all the moaning and lamentation that come from the other side of the House.  I think this is the most protracted discussion that we have ever had on this Bill. Deputies opposite talk about everything in the world on this Bill, the cost of living, etc.  The people over there promised us a reduction of 30 per cent in the cost of living.  Deputy Rooney mentioned something which he said was stated by Deputy Davin on one occasion, that while the inter-Party Government were in power the increase in wages counteracted the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, it is a remarkable fact that both the congresses had given notice that they were going to break the wage agreement reached in 1948 owing to the increase in the cost of living during the inter-Party régime.  It is rather interesting now to hear it suggested by some Labour Deputies that they were breaking that agreement dishonestly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must candidly confess that it is not easy for me as an ordinary Deputy to speak following the lengthy and very eloquent speech of Deputy J. A. Costello.  It is not easy because in the first instance there was so much in that speech of vital importance with which I am in complete agreement.  I would not attempt in any circumstances to follow the line he traversed while being in agreement with him in regard to the fundamental issue, namely the <Col N="603" /> question of whether the Parliament elected by the people should have more control over the financial and economic policy of the Government of the day. I think it is quite clear now, even to Deputies like Deputy McGrath, that the effect of the last revolutionary Budget has now found its way into the heads as well as into the pockets of the people.  The result of the North-West Dublin election is only one indication of the viewpoint of the people in regard to the injustice of that Budget.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that if the three by-elections previously held in Waterford, Limerick and Mayo had been postponed until the full effects of the increased prices brought about as a result of the Budget were generally felt, if they had been postponed until the women, particularly, felt their impact, the results of these three elections would be the same as the result of the recent by-election in North-West Dublin.  One vital matter that concerns the average citizen of the day is the high cost of living.  It is a terrible state of affairs, but I daresay it would not make any impression on the funny mind of the Minister for Finance &mdash; the Minister must be aware of it and, if he is not aware of it, his backbenchers must tell him&mdash;that there are tens of thousands of people, ordinary wage earners, people living on fixed low incomes, civil servants, members of the Army and Garda, tens of thousands of our best citizens giving good service to the country, who have not got one penny by way of compensation to meet the rapid increase in the cost of living which was brought about by the brutal Budget brought in by the Minister for Finance.  I can well understand, although I did not take any part in the contest, the reasons why the electors of North-West Dublin gave such a very decisive answer to the claims made by the Fianna Fáil candidate.  I am informed, and I believe it because I was informed by one of the leading Fianna Fáil spokesmen, that Senator Clarkin was the most popular man they could find to fight that by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In that election the Fianna Fáil people sent out many leaflets and appeals to the electors which are definitely related to matters that are pertinent to a discussion of this Bill.  &ldquo;How has the Budget affected the cost of living?&rdquo;  I have already said that the cost of living is the one matter which concerns the plain people at the moment, and concerns them to the extent of how, and in what way, it can be even stabilised if not brought down from the ridiculously high level it has reached since this Government came into office. Here is a claim which this document makes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When allowance is made for the revision of the payments made under the children's allowances scheme, the maximum increased cost to a family as a result of the reduction of subsidies is 3/6 per week.  In the case of any family that was in the habit of buying off the ration supplies, the weekly increase is less.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there any married woman in this city or in any part of the country who can be found to confirm the claim made in that statement?  It is no wonder that the people gave such a decisive answer in that election.  The document goes on to speak of &ldquo;what the Government is doing about prices&rdquo;. This portion of the document says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government is continuing the strictest possible control of prices wherever it seems necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;wherever it seems necessary&rdquo; seem to me to be the point in that.  From my observation of the Government's activities in regard to that particular aspect of their claim, they have never found it necessary, up to the present, to intervene so far as the prices of essential commodities are concerned.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to deal with cases where prices may be kept artificially high through the operation of trade rings, the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill is being introduced into the Dáil. This is the most important single step taken for many years to reduce excessive prices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> I have grave doubts myself as to whether that Bill will come into operation during the lifetime of this Dáil. If it ever does come into operation, then I hope that the people who believed that claim and voted for it will, in view of the present high prices which they have to pay for essential commodities, see to it that these prices are stabilised.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made that there has been an attempt to control prices. I could quote figures showing the prices of essential commodities before the Fianna Fáil Government came back into power.  I want to deal with the rise that has taken place in prices months after they came into office compared with the prices which came into operation as a result of this year's Budget.  Take bread, which has been under discussion.  The price of the two-lb. loaf went up from 6½d. to 9½d.  The figures that I am quoting are for the 22/9/51 and the 20/9/52 which are closely related dates.  The price of the sliced pan went up from 7¾d. to 10¾d.; butter from 2/8 to 3/10. I think it was Deputy Rooney who said, as I have said myself, not only in this House but to my own friends and at public meetings that, if there was one thing which helped to turn the women of Dublin and those living in the provincial towns and cities against the inter-Party Government at the last general election it was the 2d. per lb. which was put on butter. That was done in order to give a penny per gallon more to the farmers in the dairying counties.  It can hardly satisfy the enthusiasm of the women who normally support Fianna Fáil to know that, since Fianna Fáil came into office, notwithstanding their severe criticism and misrepresentation of the attitude of the previous Minister for Agriculture, they have increased the price of butter by 1/- per lb.</P>
    <P>Tea, which has been discussed at length, has gone up in price from 2/8 to 5/- and, in regard to certain qualities of tea to 5/10 per lb.  Deputy McGrath, a short time ago, was talking about the value of the activities of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He boasted that he is the outstanding man in this country <Col N="606" /> for his present job.  Apart from that, he boasted about the value of the sugar factories and of the work of the Minister in that regard.  Notwithstanding his boast, and the claims that he has made about the sugar factories and their production, the price of sugar has been jumped from 4d. to 6½d. per lb.  The price of flour has gone up from 3/- to 4/9; wheaten meal from 2/10 to 4/7; paraffin oil, an absolutely essential commodity for the people living in the homes of rural Ireland, from 1/7 to 1/11; cocoa, a commodity which is normally consumed by the poorer sections of our people, from 6d. to 10d.  The prices I am quoting have been checked with the official returns.  I am not pretending to quote from unreliable statistics. Condensed milk has gone up from 1/3 to 1/5¼; sardines from 1/- to 1/6 and at one period to 2/-; rice, which is another commodity normally consumed by the poorer sections of our people, has gone up from 10d. to 1/4; cheese from 2/3 to 2/6; lard 1/2 to 1/6; dripping, 1/- to 1/6; back rashers from 3/4 to 3/10 for those who can afford to buy them; sausages from 2/4 to 2/6 and 2/10, and puddings, from 1/2 to 1/6.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to remind Deputies about the increase that has taken place in the price of eggs since this Government came back to office.  I took a personal and Party interest in the rapid rise in the price of eggs.  I was associated with other people in the correspondence which took place with the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce over ten months of this year.  It was only under pressure of this House some time ago that an inquiry was ordered to be held into these prices.  We are still waiting for the result of that inquiry.  I hope we will not have to wait much longer for it on this very important matter.  This was an inquiry into the alleged excessive prices charged to consumers of eggs sold in this city and in provincial cities and towns.  I went into the matter personally.  I do not think any Deputy can contradict me and say that I am exaggerating.  I found that the price charged for eggs here over <Col N="607" /> a period of weeks was as high as 7/-per dozen.  That was the price charged in this city and in its suburban areas.  All that the producers in the rural areas got for those eggs was 3/6 per dozen and certainly not more than 3/9.</P>
    <P>There is certainly something to be explained there&mdash;between the price paid to the producer and the price charged to the consumer.  I am hopeful that the Minister, who, I suppose, gave his O.K. to the setting up of the inquiry into the price of eggs, will use his influence to see that whatever recommendations are made by that committee of inquiry&mdash;I hope that these recommendations will be published in the near future&mdash;will be put into operation.  There is no justification for the retailers charging consumers in this city and suburbs exactly double the price paid to the wives of farmers.  I am told that eggs were 7/6 per dozen yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be glad to hear that I quoted, in order that it might go on the records of this House, the increase in the price of essential commodities that has been brought about since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  I quoted it because of the brazen claims made by the Fianna Fáil Party, with the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, particularly their claim that they were taking, through the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, what they regard as effective steps to stabilise the cost of essential commodities.  The fact that they made this claim to such an intelligent body of people as the electors of North-West Dublin is an explanation of the answer which these electors gave them in a decisive way. The claims in the document were so outrageous that it is no wonder they outraged the intelligent electors of North-West Dublin.  That is the reason for it and not the reason given by Deputy McGrath.  The figures I have quoted from official statistics I think are sufficient evidence to prove that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government as a whole have done nothing to bring down the essential cost of commodities to a reasonable figure or even to <Col N="608" /> stabilise the prices of these essential commodities.</P>
    <P>What do they say in regard to unemployment? This section of the document is headed: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Workers.&rdquo;  It winds up with this claim: &ldquo;In recent months there has been a considerable improvement in the employment position.&rdquo;  I challenge the Minister to give us figures to substantiate that claim.</P>

The figures I am quoting were issued to Deputies on the 27th November and are the latest figures, I presume, available to the Minister as well as to Deputies.</P>

    <P>I welcome the statement on financial policy made by Deputy Costello.  I congratulate him as Leader of the Fine Gael Party on moving in the right direction.

I agree that the change in the conditions of the country and the change generally in international conditions fully justify the movement in the right direction indicated by Deputy Costello in his lengthy, eloquent and complicated speech this evening.  There is so much that I agree with that he has left me with very little to say on this matter.  With <Col N="609" /> others, I was a party to drafting and publishing a document about 12 years ago.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a policy document issued by the Labour Party&mdash;I think Deputy Cowan was a member of the Party at the time&mdash;in which we advocated the establishment of such a board as Deputy Costello now favours. Apart from that interesting aspect of Deputy Costello's speech, I sincerely hope that before I leave this House one of the things upon which all Parties in this House will agree is a progressive, nationally sound financial policy whereby the Parliament elected by the people and the Government elected by the Parliament will be the only people to control the financial and economic policy of the State.  I opposed some of the Governments we have had here, and I supported others.  I even supported the election of a Fianna Fáil Government in 1932, and cast my vote with other sinners, as we were called, to put the present Minister for Industry and Commerce into that position.  I personally have no regret for that from a purely personal point of view.  Everybody agrees that he works very hard.  I think he is a man who has a mind of his own.  The only thing I regret is that he should be in any way associated with the revolutionary policy enshrined in the last brutal Budget introduced by his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I have listened to both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, on more than one occasion advocating two quite distinct policies in regard to financial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister and his colleague will give sympathetic consideration to the suggestions this evening of Deputy Costello in the hope that there will be general agreement between all groups in this House on a more progressive and nationally-minded financial policy.  Some people suggested some time ago&mdash;and I agree with them&mdash;that this was so vital and <Col N="610" /> so serious that it would justify a secret session of the House.  There are many Deputies who fought to make it possible for us to sit in this House and who do not speak very often in debates who, if there were a secret session, and they were free to talk as we all should be free to do but, unfortunately, Party ties do not allow some of them to do that on all occasions&mdash;some of them sit behind the Minister&mdash;might be able to make a very valuable contribution to a discussion on financial policy in secret session.  Normally, I would not advocate the holding of a secret session, but you can do harm by talking in public on such vital and delicate matters.  That is why some people regarded this as sufficiently serious to justify their putting up such a proposal to the Acting-Taoiseach. I suppose there is no hope of having such a thing, but I hope sincerely that what Deputy Costello put to the Government and other Parties will be carefully considered and dealt with on its merits.  It probably does not go as far as the members of this group would wish, but it is definitely going in the right direction. If such fundamental proposals were adopted by the Government, I believe they would enable the Government to carry out the economic policy in which they say they believe.</P>
    <P>While the control of currency and credit is left in the hands of a small group of people unknown to the ordinary citizens of this country&mdash; some of them up to 90 years of age, although most of us would be kicked out of business life at the age of 65&mdash; very little progress will be made.  It is a terrible state of affairs that a small group of unknown people are the people who in the long run decide the financial policy of the Government of the day in this country.</P>
    <P>The average member of a trade union foolishly thinks, of course, that his trade union can protect him in every possible way.  The trade union undoubtedly protects the worker who is a member of a trade union regarding his right to continued employment and his right not to be dismissed from his employment without some very sound reason.  It helps him to deal with questions affecting his wages and <Col N="611" /> working conditions, but there is one thing with which the trade union, like everybody else, has got to put up, and that is, the Parliament and Government elected by the people who decide the purchasing power of the £ he carries in his pocket, whenever he has a £ to spare, and normally and naturally decides the way in which that £ should be spent.</P>
    <P>This Budget has had effects on the country, in my humble opinion, which the Minister for Finance possibly never foresaw when he was a party to its introduction.  I spoke quite recently to a personal friend of mine who carries on an ordinary business in the country.  He has about 300 farmer customers and everybody knows that the farmer customer does not pay on the nail, as they say, for what he gets in the way of commodities across the counter.</P>
    <P>This man asked me did I realise what additional capital he has to get from his bankers in order to enable him to carry on the same amount of business as he was trying to carry on previous to the coming into operation of this Budget with its evil effects.  I said I did not know.  He told me the number of his book customers, and he has a fairly good number of cash customers. He said it cost him £120 a week extra to finance his business since this Budget came into operation.  He had to pay so much for flour, for cigarettes, for beer and whiskey and every other commodity that is sold in that establishment in this fairly prosperous, small provincial town.  On top of that he had to provide for the interest charged upon the additional money that he got from the bankers for the purpose of trying to carry on his business in the same way as he carried it on prior to the introduction of the Budget.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister and the House to realise that this is not an exceptional case.  This man also told me it was far harder for him to carry on the ordinary business activities since this Budget came into operation because nearly every wholesaler who supplied him with commodities on credit terms previously is now demanding cash on the nail.  I assure the <Col N="612" /> Minister that that is not an exceptional case because I am fairly well acquainted with the conditions prevailing in my own constituency.  For many years &mdash; I suppose other Deputies do the very same thing &mdash; although I may be attending a political meeting of my own supporters, or might be in some portion of my constituency upon private or family matters, I always take advantage of the opportunity to meet a group of people, and they are not all confined to my own political supporters.  I would assume&mdash;and probably the same would apply to people sitting on the other side of this House&mdash;if I had gathered around me all my own political supporters for a conversazione after I had finished a political meeting I might not be getting the whole of the story, but when you have a Fianna Fáil supporter, a Fine Gael supporter and perhaps a Captain Cowan supporter, if there is any such thing in my area, one balances the other, and there is less fear of exaggeration or half-truths coming across to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>That is the general impression which, I assure the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has got through the country.  There is a sort of creeping paralysis through the country in regard to the conduct of ordinary business as the result, as Deputy Costello rightly says, of the activities of the bankers in restricting credit.  It is a most serious thing to restrict credit.  It is still going on, and no matter what the Minister says when he is replying, it is a fact.  All I can say to the Minister, if he says it is not, is that he is not well informed in regard to what is actually going on in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would not like to say I would not accept the Minister's word, but the Minister, being a Minister, is not easy to contact.  It is not as easy to get at the Minister for Industry and Commerce as it is to get to Deputy Davin in his own constituency.  You would have to pass through a squad to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he was in some of the towns where I know most of the people.  He would be surrounded by a guard of honour.  It is not as easy <Col N="613" /> to contact the Minister as it is to contact the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to have a friendly and frank interview, as a temporary measure, at any rate, with the people down in College Green who are responsible for this situation.  He will not have far to go to send for them.  In fact, it is their duty to come to the Minister, and I suppose they would come around in a taxi. They should be told that they are not treating this country fairly or properly or helping the Government to carry out the financial and economic policy because they are restricting credit which is having an adverse effect on business at the present time.  I can certify that as being correct, and if the Minister challenges me I will give the names of some of the people.  It is not the trader but the customer who is suffering in most of these cases.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what grounds he can give for the restriction of credit by wholesalers in their dealings with their old customers.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all main and trunk roads should be maintained from State funds, as local authorities find it impossible to maintain them with present State aid; and that, as turf producing counties have increased road traffic, and should have increased road grants for county roads, the Government should formulate a scheme for <Col N="615" /> the provision of special road grants to all county councils who are engaged in turf production&mdash;(Deputy O.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my disappointment and the disappointment of the ratepayers who were expecting some measure of relief in connection with those areas in which turf was produced during the emergency.  I think the object aimed at in the motion which has been under discussion here is one which merits the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  That motion was in two parts: It asked that all main and trunk roads should be maintained from State funds and that increased road grants should be given in those counties which were engaged on turf production.</P>
      <P>Main roads should be a national charge.  When I talk about main roads I mean roads like those linking Dublin with Cork, Dublin with Limerick, Dublin with Sligo and Dublin with Wexford; in other words, roads which link city to city or large provincial town to large provincial town.  Such roads should not be maintained solely from funds provided by the local authorities.  They should be a national charge.</P>
      <P>In Laois&mdash;Deputy Davin will agree with me in this&mdash;a good deal of the traffic coming from the south of Ireland passes through the county from a point just outside Roscrea to within a few miles of Monasterevan. The ratepayers of the county have to contribute heavily to the maintenance and repair of this road.  There are ratepayers contributing towards the upkeep and maintenance of that road who never use the road.  I think it is unfair and unjust that they should be obliged to foot the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not given some undertaking that special provision will be made by way of additional grants to the very limited number of counties which engaged extensively in turf production during the emergency.  Those counties are Roscommon, Laois-Offaly, Kildare, <Col N="616" /> Mayo and Kerry.  In our county during the emergency we were unable to maintain our roads due to the heavy haulage of turf and also due to the fact that we had not the staff to cope with maintenance work since every available man was engaged on the bogs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not held out any hope of relief so far as local authorities are concerned.  I am disappointed with the way in which the motion has been received.  I had hoped he would adopt a more generous attitude and give some measure of support.  The ratepayers are overburdened at the present time, and unless something is done to alleviate their position they will find their situation impossible. Perhaps when the Minister comes to allocate the grants next April he may, having reflected upon this motion, take some steps to comply with the terms of the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that steps should be taken immediately to have State grants to local authorities increased by at least 50 per cent. for housing; and that, as grave dissatisfaction is experienced in the fixing of reasonable rents for houses for working-class people, arrangements should be made for the extension of the period for loan repayment by local authorities for housing schemes completed by 1st January, 1951, so as to enable local authorities to let the houses at a rent which the tenants will be able to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this motion at the express wish of the Laois County Council. The Minister and Deputies must be aware of the very grave dissatisfaction that exists because of the rents being fixed by local authorities for houses for the working classes.  We are anxious to co-operate with the Government and to assist the Minister in the difficult task he has of providing houses for our people.  One of the best assets we can have, so far as the <Col N="617" /> health of our people is concerned, is good and proper housing.  Local authorities have done their job well so far as housing is concerned and the Government has certainly encouraged the erection of houses.  I am glad I have lived to see the day when the hovels and the mud-walled cabins have disappeared. I think we must all rejoice in the progress that has been made during the last 30 years of native government.  It is gratifying to notice that not only are the city boundaries extending but the towns are also extending.</P>
    <P>The provision of a house is one thing.  Paying the rent of that house is quite another thing.  A regrettable feature in connection with the houses erected recently, local authorities being anxious to bring schemes to maturity and provide houses, is the very high rents that have to be charged.</P>
    <P>It is true that, as each year rolls on, you have a greater demand for housing.  Encouragement must be given to the younger people who are anxious to marry.  Certainly, they have very poor hopes of progress in life unless they get a house to enable them to get married.  It is important that they should be guaranteed a roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>We find that while the local authorities are doing their part to comply with the housing requirements of our people, each local authority is faced with the extremely difficult task of fixing the rent for these houses.  In recent years we have had the graded system of renting.  We have found that system most unsatisfactory.  We see large housing schemes, all the houses from the same plan, and each house like unto the next.  We see one tenant paying 12/6 a week and we see his next-door neighbour, for exactly the same type of house, paying 29/6 a week.  In my opinion, such a system is likely to arouse a certain amount of ill-feeling, even amongst neighbours.  It is able to arouse ill-feeling amongst the members of the council.  One has experienced grave dissatisfaction as far as the grading system of rents is concerned.  I have in mind an important case which has occurred in my constituency, and <Col N="618" /> Deputy Davin is aware of it too.  A large scheme of houses was erected at Dr. Murphy Place, Portlaoighise. They are a very beautiful type of house, but the local authority has experienced great difficulty in respect of the fixing of the rent of these houses.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the matter of the administration by the Department of Defence of the special allowance for Old I.R.A. men.  I think that, in the case of graded rents, there should be a particular day each year on which the county manager will be enabled or permitted to reconsider the cases with a view to seeing whether or not circumstances have changed.  In my constituency I have seen people getting houses and having to pay as high as 25/- a week rent for them.  At the time those people were in employment they were getting between £6 and £7 per week.  After some time conditions changed and they found themselves unemployed.  Whilst, then, they were in receipt of 30/- unemployment benefit per week they were still expected to pay the same high rate of rent.  I think that when circumstances change the rent also should change.  As members of local authorities in the Midlands, we have found very great difficulty in impressing on the County Manager the necessity for surveys from time to time as to the circumstances surrounding the tenants of the houses.  The County Manager has not, so far, been able to extend his kindness to meet us in that respect.</P>

      <P>I do not think the principle of differential rents can be discussed on this motion.  The Deputy may discuss reasonable rents but not differential rents.  Differential renting opens up a far wider question than can be dealt with on this motion. The Deputy has not included anything about differential renting in the terms of his motion.  I think he should confine himself to reasonable rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling.  I appeal to the Minister to treat this matter sympathetically. Laoighis and Offaly County Councils are of opinion&mdash;and resolutions have been forwarded to the Minister's Department in this respect&mdash;that if the Minister could see fit to extend the period for the repayment of the loan it would put the local authority in the position of being able to set the houses to tenants at a reduced rate of rent. The Minister has told us time and time again that this is impossible.  The Laoighis County Council even asked the Minister for Local Government to receive a deputation in connection with the housing scheme at Borris Road, Portlaoighise.  I think Deputy Davin was one of the Deputies who forwarded a request at the time to the Minister to receive the deputation.  In his reply, the Minister expressed his amazement that the local authority should even seek an interview to discuss with him the rent of houses.  He said that it would be a waste of time on the part of the council and a waste of time on his part to discuss such an important matter as that with him.  When the Minister has treated the question of the fixing of reasonable rents for houses by a refusal to discuss the matter with the local authority it displays a very grave lack of co-operation between the Minister's Department and the local authorities.  It should be the duty of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister in charge of housing to encourage, as far as possible, local authorities in respect of housing, to discuss with them questions on housing and, more and more, to provide houses for the working-class people at a reasonable rent which they can pay.  I think local authorities have been doing all they possibly can in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the houses which are being erected throughout the State at present are too elaborate entirely <Col N="620" /> for the ordinary working man.  Any ordinary working man throughout the country &mdash; that is, a man whose salary is between £4, £4 10s. and £5 per week&mdash;will tell you that for himself, his wife and family he would prefer to have three rooms and a kitchen and none of the other additional facilities which are provided at the present time, because he cannot pay for them. It is all right if one is able to pay for hot and cold water, bathrooms and so forth.  We find that, at the present time, local authorities are letting houses to people throughout the Twenty-Six Counties and that no sooner have the tenants taken up possession than they are faced either with unemployment or sickness, when they have to go on national health benefit, or with some other misfortune. In a very short time they have to leave their houses because they cannot pay the rent and they go back to the houses which were condemned and from which they were ordered by the county medical officer of health.  It is cases such as that which I have in mind when I ask this House to consider this motion seriously.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to provide houses for the working-class people.  If we provide houses for the working-class people then the rents must be rents which working-class people are in a position to pay.  I saw working-class people in my constituency obliged to pay rents which would be equivalent almost to the rent of a castle at the present time.  Surely it is ridiculous that a man earning £3 10s. per week has to pay upwards of £1 per week for rent.  I think that is wrong.  I know one unemployed man in my constituency who is in receipt of 24/6 per week unemployment benefit and out of that sum he had to pay 17/6 per week rent. I think that Deputy Davin and Deputy O'Higgins are also aware of that case. It is the duty of the Department of Local Government, when they find that local authorities cannot set those houses at a rent which will enable the working man to remain in them, to make whatever grant facilities will be necessary in order to permit the local authorities to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will favourably consider the terms of this motion.  I <Col N="621" /> raise this matter for the purpose of letting him see the difficulties which local authorities have to contend with in order to comply with the wishes of the poorer sections of the community in the matter of the provision of houses for them.  These people find it impossible to pay the rents demanded of them, with the result that the types of people for whom the houses were designed are not occupying them.  We find that the poor people in Ferbane did not even go to the trouble of filling in the forms for a house, because they knew that they could not pay the rent.  In Tullamore very poor people who were living in mud-walled thatched cottages said: &ldquo;We have these cottages for 2/6 or 5/- per week. How could we afford to pay 12/6 or 15/-a week for the new houses?  With the times that are in it, it would be impossible for us to pay that rent&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I think Deputy Flanagan is to be congratulated on bringing it forward. He is asking that the Government grant should be increased by a substantial amount, namely 50 per cent. I am satisfied that such a substantial increase in the Government grant would enable the municipalities to build houses and let them at reasonable rents.  If the Government give this extra grant, the Dublin municipality can reduce the high rents that <Col N="622" /> they are at present forced to charge for new houses especially.  The new houses, of course, cost a good deal more than some of the older houses, which the corporation own.  Deputy Flanagan has pointed out that the fact that a reasonable rent is not charged, or at any rate what the new tenant would regard as a reasonable rent, has caused grave dissatisfaction amongst the people who are called upon to pay rents which they think are not in keeping with their incomes. In some cases, in order to pay these high rents, families have to go without some of the necessaries of life which they would ordinarily use.  Organisations especially in Dublin have put forward suggestions of what they consider fair rents based on so much per room &mdash; say 5/- per room or 15/-for a three-roomed cottage.  These organisations have a good following of people who think that 15/- for a three-roomed flat or a three-roomed cottage is a reasonable offer.  I too think it is a reasonable offer.  Deputy Flanagan also suggests that there should be an extension of the period for the repayment of the loan by local authorities.  I agree with him although it does mean that the ratepayers have to pay interest for a much longer period.  The motion is in every way worthy of the Minister's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of housing in Dublin City at present is a very serious one. It was mentioned last week that we have now 6,000 or 7,000 young married people, commonly called newly-weds, who are on our housing lists.  They have been waiting for the last five years and they are no nearer to getting a house now than they were five years ago.  I know cases in the City of Dublin where a mother occupying a working-class house, has made room in her three-roomed cottage for her married son or daughter.  Families are now coming along and these people are imploring us to take them out of the overcrowded conditions under which they have to live.  I have put it to the Minister that something should be done to increase further the output of houses especially in the City of Dublin.  We have an average output of about 2,500 houses per year.  I would say that that number of old houses are <Col N="623" /> going into disrepair annually so that the problem is not being eased in any way.  I would ask the Minister to give a greater proportion of Government money towards the solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the Dublin Corporation or the Dublin ratepayer is not under any compliment to the Minister or to anybody else.  The Dublin ratepayer has already by raising money through the corporation with the backing of the Government, made a fair contribution towards the solution of the housing difficulty.  We are only asking the Government now because it is the Government's job, to come along and give us the necessary encouragement. We have a five years' residence qualification in the City of Dublin before a family can be housed.  If a young couple are settled in Dublin for five years they can come to the corporation and ask for housing accommodation. We are anxious to facilitate them even though they originally came from the country.  They are citizens of the Republic and we are anxious to help them but we are not getting the encouragement we should get.</P>
    <P>If we could get a bigger grant from the Government we perhaps could increase the number of houses which are provided annually from 2,500 to, say, 5,000, and we would be able to give those young people who are living in overcrowded houses with their relatives a house for themselves.  I have been in this House since the Dáil was first set up, and I want to say that each Government in succession has done a fair share to solve this problem.  It is not their fault that people are still living under overcrowded conditions.  I know of cases where there are two families in one room.  I know cases where mothers have brought young married sons and daughters into their own single rooms and have given them a part of that room.  Since this State was established, all Governments have done reasonably well, but I think they have got to do more and so has the local authority, if this problem is to be ever solved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate, but <Col N="624" /> I think I can say that every 500 yards I go in the City of Dublin I am stopped by young people, who ask me what I can do to solve their housing problems.  Three times within the last hour I was called out of this House, and each time I met a young couple who asked me what I could do to get them a flat or a cottage.  They are all willing to pay a fair rent.  The Minister may recall that, about a week ago, I tried to enlist his assistance to get some information from the corporation in regard to three evictions that had taken place.  These three evictions took place from a building called the White House, in Finglas, in which three young married men were accommodated.  The house was apparently required for some other purpose.  It may be of interest to Deputy Flanagan to know that one of these young couples came from his constituency of Laois-Offaly.  The three families were evicted and for two or three nights had to sleep out in the open.  I do not know what has happened them since, but I failed to get anything done for them in the Dáil.  My object in questioning the Minister was to find out what the corporation proposed to do with the house.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Flanagan on putting down this motion.  If the Government grant were increased by 50 per cent., as the Deputy suggests, I think that considerable progress could be made by local authorities in providing more houses for people of the type to whom I refer.  He says that there is great dissatisfaction at the fixing of reasonable rent.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that organ-isations representing tenants have suggested that 5/- is a reasonable rent for a room, 10/- for a two-roomed flat and 15/- for a three-roomed flat or three-roomed cottage.  Deputy Flanagan has gone into that, and he asks for an extension of the period of loan repayment for local authorities for housing schemes completed by the 1st of January, 1951, so as to enable those authorities to let the houses at a rent which the tenants will be able to pay.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to know that people in their anxious desire to get <Col N="625" /> out of some of the hovels in which they are living at present are prepared to accept the tenancy of a house at a rent which they reasonably cannot afford to pay without inflicting some hardship on their families.  I would ask the Minister favourably to consider the special point so far as Dublin is concerned of giving increased grants, based upon the cost of house building at the present moment.  If the Government would do that, it would ease a little the burden which the Dublin ratepayers are carrying.  The Minister will reply that I want to ease the burden on the ratepayers and that I do not want to put it on the taxpayers.  My answer is that Dublin at the moment is composed of people from the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  When a person is resident for five years in Dublin, the corporation makes no distinction. We do all we can to provide decent housing accommodation for the people.</P>
    <P>The trouble, I fear, is that many members of the Dáil, I mean apart from the Dublin Deputies, have no idea of the extent of the housing activities of the Dublin Corporation.  They have never gone out to see the 4,000 or 5,000 houses that we have built in Ballyfermot, Finglas and other places where magnificient new towns are growing up. The houses that we are putting up would do credit to any country in the world and we are trying to let them at reasonable rents.  One of the results of that activity is that the tenants have heavy charges to bear in the way of bus fares.  They went out to those areas because they did not want to have their children in the tenement areas.  We are taking the people out of the old houses in the city and are sending them out to Coolock, Finglas and Ballyfermot.  That means an extra charge on each family of 1/- a day for bus fares, or 7/- a week.  It is equivalent to a rent in itself.  When the housing scheme at Coolock is completed the bus fare for the new tenants will be 6d. for a single journey.  That will be a very heavy charge for working-class people.  The schemes there and at St.  Ann's are expected to be completed in a year or two.  If a member of a family in one of those areas has to make a couple of journeys to the <Col N="626" /> city it will mean an extra charge of 2/- a day.  In view of that, I think we might change the words &ldquo;bus fare&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of our problems.  We would be very glad if the Government would assist us.  I am afraid the time will come when we will have to ask, so far as these new housing areas are concerned, to have a limit put on bus fares.  Otherwise, the people will not be able to pay them.  I met a woman this morning who told me that it was costing her 1/- per day to send her children by bus to George's Hill school. In that situation, and in order to meet these bus charges, those families have to do without something in their homes.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should do something to see that the rents are not extravagant.  He can do that by giving the municipality increased grants.  We are anxious to give some benefit to the people who are looking for houses. I congratulate Deputy Flanagan on bringing forward this motion.  It is one that is near the hearts of all of us who are members of a local authority.</P>

      <P>A motion such as this gives one an opportunity of considering a problem that is a serious problem.  It is a problem that I intend to deal with as a serious one. I asked the Deputy who proposed the motion for certain information about his own county with which, of course, he would be familiar, and I would not, nor would many other members of the House, and in a bad mannered way he was rude, insolent and offensive. Now, that may be considered the right way to start a motion advocating the consideration of a problem such as this, but I do not think it is.  However, this is not the place to teach manners, and I do not propose to dwell any longer on it. Deputy Alderman Byrne has referred to the problem, and to the fact that he asked the Minister to force the hand of the Dublin Corporation to provide houses for some families that were to be evicted.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to mention <Col N="627" /> it in more than a passing way.  In the Dublin Corporation there is a very strict rule, the originator of which was Deputy Alderman Byrne himself, that no person will get a house unless he has been residing in Dublin for a period of five years.  In dealing with this particular problem of the three families, which was raised at our housing committee, the housing officials had to say to Deputy Alderman Byrne: &ldquo;We cannot, under the rule that is in operation of which you are in favour, and in fact on which you always insist, provide houses for these three families.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the rule in the Dublin Corporation.  In fact, since I became a member, whether it was a house or a shop that was to be let, the Deputy has always said that there was the five-year limit, that a person must be five years resident in the city before he could get a house, because no Dublin person could be deprived of a house in order to facilitate some person coming up from the country.  That has always been Deputy Byrne's attitude. It was a consistent attitude until this particular case arose when, for some reason or another, he wanted the officials of the Dublin Corporation to break a rule.  He tried, as he said, to get the Minister to force the hand of the Dublin Corporation to break the rule that he himself was instrumental in making and in giving effect to.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne was present at a meeting of a housing committee at which he was told what I have said by the chairman.  He was told it by the officials and told it by everybody. He walked out of the meeting saying: &ldquo;I will raise this in the Dáil, and I will get the Minister to produce some document&rdquo;.  It is all right to get up in this House and take every side of the problem with you.  That is Deputy Byrne's method &mdash; be on every side.</P>

      <P>If you are on every side, you have the support of everybody. I do not think that is right. On vital problems there should be some element of consistency at least, and there is none on this.  Deputy Byrne's rent of 5/- a room for a three-roomed cottage would amount to 15/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that their organisation suggested it, and you have a copy of that in your pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne suggested that the rent should be 5/-a room.  To people paying a very high differential rent of 35/- or 36/- a week, that would be a substantial reduction. To the widow paying 5/6 a week, 5/-a room would mean a very big increase.  I am sorry that Deputy Flanagan did not give the information which I wanted.  I am sure that 5/-a room for a three-roomed cottage in Ferbane would not be considered a very fair rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the man was unemployed it would not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the unfortunate position that I do not know what the rents are in Ferbane.  I am certain, however, that 5/- per room would be considered a pretty high rent whether the husband was or was not working.  That is an aspect which is probably worth a good deal of consideration. I asked Deputy Flanagan <Col N="629" /> whether there were differential rents, and he said: &ldquo;Yes, a very bad form of rental like everything else I was connected with.&rdquo;  I think I can escape censure on that head, because I have always opposed the differential renting system.  I have opposed it in this House and in the Dublin Corporation.  It is a bad system.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious to know what exactly is the differential renting system in Offaly, what is the maximum and minimum rent and on what the rent was based.  That would have been helpful to me if I could have got it.  But I have opposed the differential renting system, and if there is anything unsatisfactory about it, it cannot be laid at my door.  At the moment there is in the Dublin Corporation a motion in my name which will be discussed at the next meeting that the differential renting system in Dublin be abolished.</P>
      <P>The next point I see in connection with house rents is this.  House rents are undoubtedly too high.  It will be agreed by everybody that the rents of houses being built at present are too high. and the rents are too high because we have to pay too much for the money we borrow to build the houses.  I would have liked to have that point made, not by me, but by the Deputy who was elected to this House on the policy of monetary reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Monetary reform was a popular tag and it required a certain amount of ability, concentration, study and hard work to understand. That is the trouble.  Of course, the tag has disappeared.  It is a pity that the tag has gone.  There is an appeal to the Minister to-night to do something, not about the interest rates on money but about extending the period or giving bigger grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Hickey says, that is no good.  That is what Deputy Flanagan advocates.  The one thing which is responsible for the <Col N="630" /> high rents is that we have to pay too much interest for the money we borrow for houses.  That is the only line on which a motion like this should be put forward in this House.  Owing to the high interest charges the rents are approximately double what they would be if the money was made available as it should be to the housing authorities at a nominal ½ per cent. or 1 per cent. None of these things which were suggested to the Minister, such as the extension of the period of repayment or increasing the amount advanced to the local authority would help very much.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan might have worked out the figures for us.  He might have worked out how a £100 grant in respect of each house would affect the rent.  Of course, it would require a little bit of work to do it.  He could have worked out how the rent would be affected if the period of repayment was extended by ten years, but that also would require some work.</P>
      <P>When a Deputy puts down a motion such as this he should treat the House with some consideration and give facts, figures and calculations to bear it out. It is much easier, however, to be gratuitously offensive or insulting than to work at the preparation of a motion such as this.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Byrne says that we are building 2,500 houses a year in Dublin he knows that we are not.  We have aimed at doing it, but we did not do it last year, we will not do it this year, and it will take all our efforts to do it next year.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach the target of 2,500.  I agree with him that we want more houses in Dublin.  In fact, I have a motion down for the next meeting of the Dublin Corporation that the city manager or the deputy manager, because I have not been able to find out who is responsible, will prepare plans whereby an effort will be made to construct at least 4,000 dwellings in the year.  In my opinion, that can be done provided there is a definite and determined effort made to do it.  But if we are to build these houses we will have to go out to Coolock and to the fringe of the city because we have not places for them in the centre of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> There are thousands of people in this city who would be delighted to go out to Coolock and pay the sixpenny bus fare.  What they want is a house; they will put up with all the other difficulties. In a short while schools will be built.  It is not our fault, or the Minister's fault, or the corporation's fault that children have to travel from Finglas to George's Street or to George's Hill or elsewhere to school. It was well known for a long period that this big corporation scheme was to be out there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was in the seconder of the motion's speech and that is why I am dealing with it. However, it is an important aspect of that.  I can get up in this House and I can say: &ldquo;Build more houses for the people of Dublin but do not build them in Coolock because the bus fares will have to come down if you build them there.&rdquo;  That is a good line of country because you take two sides, that of the people who want the houses and the people who do not want to go out to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would if I could. If we could erect some kind of roof over the city strong enough, we might build houses on it, and so long as the lift charges were not too high that might be accepted.  I want to say on the motion, I agree that rent charges are too high.  I think something will have to be done in regard to rent charges.  There are two solutions to it in my view.  One is to make sure that the wage earner gets more money so that he will be able to pay the rent charge.  The second solution is to see that money is made available to the Government and to the local authorities at a rate of interest of 1 per cent. or thereabouts.  It will enable these houses to be built and to be let at a <Col N="633" /> rent which will not be much more than half the maximum rents in operation at the moment.</P>
      <P>In the City of Dublin under the differential rents system we house widows and unemployed people at a rent of 5/6 a week, and then we have a maximum rent.  My objection to the differential rent system is that widows and the unemployed people who are unable to pay the ordinary rents are subsidised by their neighbours.  I feel they should be subsidised by the State. That is the defect I see in the differential rents system, that one section of the people have to pay an increased rent in order that others may get relief. Houses should be let at an economic rent to people able to pay that economic rent.</P>
      <P>Those who are unable to pay it because of illness, sickness, incapacity, unemployment or otherwise, should be financed so far as rent is concerned by the central authority.  There is a problem here to be met.  It is not going to be met by the terms of Deputy Flanagan's motion.  Deputy Flanagan's motion may appeal to a few people who cannot take houses in Ferbane, unemployed as they are or earning a very low wage, because the rent is too high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  There is a big problem, but it is only part of <Col N="636" /> a still bigger problem for which the Minister is not responsible.  That is the problem of seeing that our people get decent wages so that they can pay the rent and that the widows and the unemployed get sufficient to enable them to pay the rent.  Lastly, the rents can be reasonable if we provide the finances we need not at rates of interest of 5 and 6 per cent., but at rates of interest of ½ or 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to put down a motion such as the one we have before us on a subject of such vital importance, and it is very easy to make the motion a highly controversial one.  It is important, when one puts down a motion of this kind, that the problem with which it deals should be understood in all its aspects.  I can only speak of housing in so far as Dublin is concerned, because I have some experience there. It is in that connection that I approached the debate to-night.</P>
      <P>Our main concern is, firstly, to house our people as quickly as possible.  Secondly, it is our concern to house them as cheaply as possible. We cannot just stop building houses until we solve the problems that have been raised in this debate, because the welfare of our people is our immediate concern.  The motion suggests that the way out of the difficulty in Dublin would be to double the State grant. As Deputy Cowan has pointed out, the doubling of the State grant would make practically no difference in relation to the rents and in relation to the ability of the tenants to meet those rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago when housing first began in Dublin it was possible in relation to the then building costs and the price of money to build houses and rent them at something like 11/6 per week.  We must remember, however, that when houses were let at that rent the wage of the occupier was much smaller and the 11/6 then was relatively as difficult as is the rent of 30/- to-day. Some people are in favour of a distribution of the load fairly.  Others have considered in great detail the question of differential renting and the extent to which the rates can bear such a charge, <Col N="637" /> because it is only in connection with houses built after a certain date that differential renting applies in Dublin. It is, I think, to houses built since June, 1950.</P>
    <P>Now, we should not approach this subject in a manner which would suggest the wisdom of slowing down our building programme.  Our target is to provide as soon as possible something like 50,000 corporation houses.  We already have close on 30,000, and Dublin City, as a corporation, is in fact the biggest landlord in the country. It is all very well to say to the Government that it must spoon-feed here and it must spoon-feed there.  A Government has to govern and a city has to administer its affairs in a manner which is fair to all concerned. There are people in houses at rents of 11/6 per week.  The rents gradually rose as the cost of materials and labour increased.  It is nonsensical of Deputy Davin to pretend to think that he will be believed when he interjects and by implication suggests that if houses are built by direct labour they can be let at 5/- per week but that if they are built by contract they will cost three times that per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is utter nonsense. We in the Dublin Corporation have had the greatest experience and the greatest variety of experience in the building of houses and if there was this robbery, for that is what it is, as between building houses by direct labour and building by contract, there would have been some intervention long since.  There is, of course, the situation that the contractor is entitled to a margin of profit.  At the moment there is a Bill in this House concerned with restrictive trade practices and under that Bill, when it becomes an Act, rings&mdash;if there are rings&mdash;will be dealt with and to the extent to which they deserve to be dealt with.  But, ring or no ring, the situation which Deputy Davin suggests exists does not exist in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows nothing about my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not for one <Col N="638" /> moment pretended to know anything about the Deputy's constituency.  I do not even know how much the Deputy knows about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, for if the Deputy did not know a little more than I do about his constituency he would know very little about it because I know very little about it.  I said at the outset that I was concerned only with what is happening in Dublin. Over a long period of years we have had direct labour schemes in Dublin. I do not know whether or not the Deputy knows that.  We know, however, that certain elements have attempted to criticise these direct schemes adversely because those elements do not want direct labour schemes.  When the searchlight is put on and an examination made of the costings in our direct schemes we know that not only is the scheme cheaper but, more important still, we get a better house because the materials are better.  We know all that.  We are not against direct labour schemes in the Dublin Corporation, but unfortunately we cannot just launch out as a local authority into building 5,000 houses per year by direct labour.  We cannot do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come to the question of how best can we help.  As regards an attempt to bring housing costs down as far as possible from the point of view of the cost to the occupants, I do not think that this Government can be accused of being unfair.  I remember, and I am sure every member of the House remembers, that when the emergency ended and building could be resumed again, the Fianna Fáil Government introduced a scheme called the Transition Development Fund.  A sum of £5,000,000 was voted in this House to be set aside to give additional subsidies to the building of houses, so that the rents would be reduced accordingly. When that £5,000,000 was used up or, as was announced here the other day, when that money had been spent to the extent of £4,750,000, there came a change of Government, and there was no further addition of money to the <Col N="639" /> Transition Development Fund for the purpose of doing exactly what this motion now says should be done.  I wonder will Deputy Davin, when he gets up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  Will the Chair remind the Deputy, who came late into this House, that I have not yet spoken, and that he should relate his remarks to the speech made by Deputy O. Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is out of order for me to predict the line which Deputy Davin will take nor to suggest to him what he might bear in mind when he is addressing the House on this matter.  I would like him to confess to this House that he was very wrong when he was Minister for Finance, <i>de jure</i> but not <i>de facto</i>, in not having the Transition Development Fund made available again by more money being paid into it.  It is very important that we know what we are talking about, and that we do not just attempt to fool the people all the time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can make up his mind as between £1 per house and £1,000,000 per house.  He can figure out how many houses would be involved.  What Deputy Rooney does not appear to know is that £5,000,000 was a figure made available to cover a certain number of houses and there was an additional grant if there was an additional development fund.  We could argue here what, in present circumstances, should be the amount and how many houses there should be.</P>

In present circumstances we will not get money unless we pay interest.  I think that must be admitted.

      <P>He recognises that, notwithstanding the situation that surrounds us to-day, we have to build houses.  Sometimes we in the Dublin <Col N="642" /> Corporation consider where we are heading and what the burden on the rates will be as we continue our outpouring of money for the purpose of building these houses.  When you take a sensible point of view you have to recognise, first of all, that after a lapse of so many years and when money that was borrowed for the building of houses has, in fact, been fully repaid with all the interest charges, you have from then on, as these schemes pay for themselves, an inflow of money which costs you nothing and which is now a profit to the rates. Are you going to argue to-day, because money is dear, what you should do when that position is reached? Are you going to advocate that, because on a particular housing scheme there is now no longer any money due by way of sinking fund or repayment of any form, the occupants should now have those houses for nothing?  I could just as well argue logically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know whether Deputy Davin is a member of a local authority or how much time he devotes in the week or in the year to the elimination of slumdom in this country.  Is he going to get up and tell us that he is so far removed from this problem that he is concerned only with criticising the efforts of those who are trying to solve it?  I have every respect for those who give their time, day after day and week after week&mdash;the members of the Dublin Corporation, every one of them, who attends meetings of the housing committee and of the finance committee on three or four days a week for three or four hours each day as Deputy Cowan can testify&mdash;in an effort to hammer out this problem in a practical way.

      <P>I am concerned, first of all, with the housing of our people and the question of how we can ease the, burden of the rentpayer in a reasonable way.  That is the second matter, and we are trying to deal with it as quickly as we can.  We, in the Dublin Corporation, after a great deal of consideration and argument, and faced by a great deal of criticism and opposition, adopted a policy of differential rents.  We then heard people, members of the Labour Party or supposed members of the Labour <Col N="644" /> Party, calling public meetings opposing the principle of differential rents, without knowing, when they were questioned about it, what it meant. They did not know the meaning of the term.  They did not know how the principle was to apply.  We were held up quite recently to public odium when we sent around, or were supposed to send round, from the corporation a circular to be filled up, showing the earning capacity of certain households.  We were told that we were introducing police State measures.  We knew that the combined earnings of the occupants of some of our houses exceeded £30 per week.  Were such people entitled, in these circumstances, to the charity of the community to bring their rents down from 30/- per week to 25/- per week or from 25/- per week to 20/-per week?  There must be some reason and some fair play in these matters.</P>
      <P>When we started off, we were met with the organised opposition of certain parties and we had to drop that.  Then after a great deal of protracted negotiations and discussions and after receiving a number of deputations, we took another step and we said we would give to the occupants of those houses a reduction in their rents of 10d. per week in respect of every child after the first two.  Then we came to consider the case of the person whose circumstances might have changed through the loss of the breadwinner and we took the responsibility of introducing a scheme under which the occupants were not to be disturbed in any circumstances. They did not have to go to the poorhouse if their circumstances changed; they could remain in the same house at a reduced rent down to the minimum we could fix, 5/- or 6/- per week</P>

      <P>I think we have done very well.  But I think the time has come when there should be a reexamination of this question.

      <P>Is it suggested that we should allow such a scandal to continue? Is it not obvious that we have to take some action on behalf of the ratepayers whose money we are using? We have got to be careful, and if we are going to give assistance or subsidies, we want to know that the person who is getting the benefit of them deserves it.  We had built houses under what are known as the Artisans Dwellings Acts.  If we give a man who is a worker the tenancy of one of these houses and we find that, in a matter of two or three years, he has branched out as a butcher, as a bookmaker, as the owner of a fleet of taxis or a drapery house, are we still to regard that man as an artisan deserving of consideration in the shape of a reduced rent from the ratepayers?</P>

I am trying to point out the way we should begin to deal with this problem.  If we found that it would require more generous provision in order to ease the burden of the occupants, and we came in here for an annual grant which would vary according to the need of these people, I would say that possibly we might be able to consider such an approach, but the suggestion contained in this motion is not, I think, going to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>As I am about to conclude now I hope we shall hear from Deputy Rooney, to whom I shall leave the privilege of moving the Adjournment in order that he can resume the debate at a later stage.

      <P>Deputy Corish has given notice to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 41 which appeared on the Dáil Order Paper on the 19th November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 19th November I asked the Minister for Local Government if he had received an application from the Wexford Corporation to increase the rents of houses owned by them, and, if so, if he would state if he had yet communicated his decision.  I asked him what was the nature of his decision, and, if he had approved of the proposal, would he state his reason for giving it.  The Minister replied to me <Col N="647" /> to the effect that the proposal was received, and that it had been approved.  He said his reason for giving his approval was because he was satisfied that the increase proposed was fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity of asking the permission of the Chair to raise this matter on the Adjournment, because I did not think supplementary questions would elicit from the Minister the reasons why he did approve of this proposal by the Wexford Corporation.  In brief, the proposal of the corporation was to increase the rent of houses owned by them, the valuation of which was £5 and under.  The increase was to be a 50 per cent. one.  The number of houses subject to this increase of 50 per cent. is 583.  I suggest that this device by the corporation is neither just nor fair.  The increases range from 2/5 down to 10d. per week.  The average increase, in the case of these 583 houses, amounts to 1/9 per week.</P>
      <P>This act by the Wexford Corporation, and its subsequent approval by the Minister for Local Government, followed very quickly on the cruel blow which these people had received under the Budget introduced in April last.  It is interesting to recall the circumstances under which the county manager proposed that this increase be made effective.  This proposal was made by the county manager, and was submitted to the corporation when the estimate for the year 1952-53 had been considered, and when the actual rate had, I think, been struck. There was no real attempt made by the officials of the corporation, or by the county manager, or by those people who voted for the increase, to justify it.  It was a veritable bombshell. This is a practice which, I think, is not generally engaged in&mdash;it is certainly not engaged in on such a widespread scale by local authorities in the country, whether they be town, city or rural bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some vague references to the cost to the corporation of maintaining and repairing these houses of £5 valuation and under.  It was argued that their repairs cost more <Col N="648" /> than the amount of money received in rent by the corporation.  One interesting fact is this, that while the amount that will be received by way of increased rent will be in the region of £2,000 or slightly over it, the Wexford Corporation have never spent any more than approximately £1,650 in any year on repairs.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, this sum of £1,650 is the maximum sum of money that was spent last year on the repair, not of all the 583 houses, but on the repair of 700 corporation houses.  I suggest, therefore, that this proposal to increase the rents was a device by the county manager and by the six members of the corporation who voted for the increase, to reduce the rates for the current year.  I think it is something which the Minister should not have given his approval to.  What it means is that these people who would not be regarded as being in the middle class but rather in the poorer classes, will be required, in this year to contribute a sum of £2,000 for the purpose of reducing the rates in Wexford Town.  If that sort of practice is to be approved of in the same circumstances by the Minister for Local Government it will mean that every county and city manager when presenting their annual estimates will regard the tenants of local authority houses or cottages as a source of revenue for the purpose of relieving the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot do that without the authority of the elected representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I may say that this decision was approved of by the local representatives by a vote of six to five.  I am not accepting the majority decision. While asking that the Minister should have regard to the voice of local representatives, I am suggesting to him that he should not have lent his approval to this, inasmuch as his is the deciding voice in these cases.  I have said that these are houses of £5 valuation and under.  The tenants have been provided with this particular type of house at a particular rent because they could not afford to provide <Col N="649" /> houses for themselves, and because they could not afford to go into houses with a higher rent.</P>
      <P>I want to ask, further, what security, if any, have the tenants of corporation houses in Wexford for the future? Does it necessarily mean that next year or the year after, or at any time during the lifetime of their houses, they may be called upon to pay an additional rent, to pay a sum of money for the purpose of relieving the rates, and of relieving ratepayers who are better able to afford an additional burden than they are?</P>
      <P>There are many cases which can be quoted against this proposal.  There is the case of corporation-purchased houses in the town of Wexford, where, as is generally known, the repayment figure cannot be touched.  I happen to have been reared in a house which was a purchased house from the Wexford Corporation.  The rent of that house in 1923 was 9/9 per week, exclusive, of course, of rates.  At the present time, the repayment in respect of that house is 9/9 per week and I believe that the corporation have no power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as that house is concerned, the corporation have no maintenance costs to bear in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the houses which are the subject of this question are concerned, I have stated that the sum of money spent on the repair of them is not by any means adequate to do the urgent repairs that are required.  Despite the fact that there is this additional sum of £2,000 in rent now required from these tenants, the maximum that has been spent on their repair is £1,650, even though there was a half suggestion by the county manager and the officials that the reason for increasing the rent was due to the fact that repairs were so costly.  I am suggesting that this is merely a device to relieve the rates for the current year.  It is a mean device inasmuch as the people concerned are people who have been cleared from slums, people such as widows and orphans, people on the dole and in receipt of unemployment <Col N="650" /> assistance, men who are labourers, and casual labourers at that.</P>
      <P>These are people who can ill afford to come to the rescue of ratepayers who can easily afford what is demanded from these particular tenants.  It means that, while the ordinary rate this year is 36/- in the £, with the additional increase on these 583 tenants they will be paying, in effect, something like 50/- in the £. I do not think any of us would deny the obligation which is on the corporation or any similar local authority to provide houses for a certain type of people, usually called the working classes, at a reasonable rent.  There are three contributors to the cost of these houses&mdash;the local authority, the tenant who pays the rent, and the State.  I suggest that whatever contribution the local authority have made or are making towards the cost of these houses they are now taking it back from these particular people by way of increased rents.  The corporation, therefore, are not fulfilling their statutory obligation of subsidising, with the State, the cost of these particular houses.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting if the Minister would examine the actual returns of the corporation over a period of years to see if the loss in respect of these particular houses has been so great as to justify this increase.  I would remind the Minister that these people are a relatively poor type of tenants.  They are mainly people of the working classes who were cleared out of slums and it is neither just nor fair to increase their rent.  The usual practice when increasing rent is to effect the increase when there is a change in tenancy, even if the change in tenancy means a change from one member of the household to another by reason of death.  Therefore, I consider that the Minister should reconsider his decision and, if not, that he should ask the corporation to revoke their decision or to modify it substantially.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to understand the attitude of some Deputies, and it is specially difficult in regard to members <Col N="651" /> of the Labour Party.  I do not know how long it is now since I first heard attacks from the Labour Benches directed against a Minister for Local Government because of the increasing tendency of the Local Government Department to meddle in the affairs of local bodies and, at a later stage, because of the introduction of a system of local government which deprived local bodies of much of the power which they previously enjoyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's approach, as long as I have been in this House, has always been to attack Ministers for Local Government for the dictatorial manner in which they did their business with local bodies.  They were the first people, both in this House and on these local bodies, to resent a Minister for Local Government directing or suggesting what local bodies should do in relation to their own business.  Here is a proposition which came before the Wexford Corporation at the instance of the county manager, whose legal responsibility it was to determine this issue for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>That is better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was a matter of recognising the corporation's responsibility for the striking of a rate, he brought this proposition before the members of that body who were elected by the people of the town of Wexford and were dependent on the votes of the people of Wexford, and the county manager secured approval for the increase which he sugested in the rents of 583 houses, the rents of which were then to range from 1/2 to 4/5 per week, exclusive of rates.  The estimates were <Col N="652" /> prepared by the county manager and his officials on the basis of that approval and, as far as I can find out, this matter was discussed on three successive occasions and motions designed to upset the original decision were defeated by a majority vote of that body.  I am not disapproving of the attitude of the Labour Party.  I think they were right in being critical of any attempt to dictate the course of policy and the line of action which local bodies should take in matters of this kind.  I think the Labour Party were right in taking that course down the years, but I think the Deputy is wrong in his request and that I would be wrong in acceding to any request to interfere in a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seems to think that it is strange for the Minister for Local Government to sanction this proposal. The Deputy was a Parliamentary Secretary to my predecessor in the Department of Local Government when a proposal came before that Department in 1950 from the local council in Ardee, County Louth, designed to increase the rents of the tenants of a number of council houses to a higher figure than is now proposed for these tenants in Wexford.  The Minister rightly did as I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing new or strange about what has occurred in regard to this matter.  Proposals have since come to me from other local bodies who have to face up to their problems just as the corporation of Wexford, with their terrific housing problem, are facing it.  So far as I can remember, Wexford requires between 800 and 1,000 new houses and of these only 180 have been provided.  Is it suggested that I am trying to pass the responsibility over to them in the case I have made so far?  I see their problem.  I see, as they see, that the maintenance costs of those houses that were rented at between 1/2 and 4/5 per week have increased from £1,599 in the year 1945-46 to £2,394 in the year 1951-52. Do I not understand that when these corporators sat around that table they knew they would have to face the criticism of Deputy Corish and all the rest of those people who would try to make capital out of the difficulties that existed?  I recognise the problems <Col N="653" /> that the corporation had to face, the financial problem of housing people who had yet to be housed, the financial problem of getting houses under repair and of the maintenance of houses, built at a time when housing was cheap, at a time when costs were enormously high.</P>
    <P>Those men who took that stand in face of the opposition to which they were sure to be subjected, and the ridicule that would surely be poured upon them, are the types of men I admire in local bodies, so long as their propositions are reasonable, and they are trying to do what they regard as their duty, even though it may result in criticism of the kind that we have just heard being levelled to-night.</P>
    <P>It is the easiest thing in the world for Deputy Corish&mdash;I understand he is not a member of the Wexford Corporation&mdash;to come here and make that case. It may look grand to those tenants who naturally do not want to have to pay, as none of us wants to pay, increased <Col N="654" /> rates for anything.  But I can see this from the point of view of those who have taken the unpopular course because they were convinced that the case the manager made was a good one, and they supported and stood by him in the course which he recommended.</P>
    <P>I have given my approval to that course as my predecessor in office did, and as Deputy Corish, the Parliamentary Secretary to my predecessor, gave his approval to a similar proposition when it came from another town, but a town apparently in which Deputy Corish was not interested inasmuch as he was not concerned with the voting tendencies of the people who live there.</P>
