      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 1, line 13, to delete &ldquo;(Insurance)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as originally drafted, was almost completely an insurance Bill. With the additions made on the Committee Stage dealing with old age pensions and unemployment assistance it is no longer entirely an insurance Bill so that the proper title would be Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 2, before the definition of &ldquo;employed contributor&rdquo;, line 3, to insert the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;domestic service&rdquo; does not include service which is rendered otherwise than in relation to an employer's household and place of residence;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a definition of domestic service.  There appears to be a considerable amount of trouble over the definition which was in the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. The definition in that Act was: &ldquo;Employment in domestic service except <Col N="2026" /> where the employed person is employed in any trade or business carried on for the purposes of gain.&rdquo; There have been some rather peculiar anomalies in regard to that.  One case which was mentioned was that a charwoman who was in a solicitor's office before 9 a.m. was taken not to be insurable for unemployment benefit; if it were after 9 o'clock she was.  Then there are the cases of clubs for catering and so on where domestic people are employed and where it was decided that they were not insurable for unemployment benefit because the place was not run for gain.  The new definition, we think, will cover what we have in mind very much better: &ldquo;&lsquo;Domestic service&rsquo; does not include service which is rendered otherwise than in relation to an employer's household and place of residence&rdquo;.  In other words, we want, if possible, to make it really domestic service, that is, service in the house of the employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister's amendment includes a number of persons who would be excluded otherwise.  Does the Minister not consider, however, that some difficulties will arise from the amendment itself?  It does not very often occur that a man's place of business is also his private house, but take, for instance, the case of a solicitor in a country town.  His offices are very often situated in his house, and if there are domestic servants in the house they will look after the cleaning of the offices as well as the house.  I am not trying to raise difficulties for the Minister.  I am merely pointing out that difficulty.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty I see is that it will tend to create two different types of servants.  It may have an unforeseen repercussion.  A domestic servant who is employed, say, in a club or in some place which does not come within the exempted category may cease to be employed in that particular employment and take up domestic employment in a house.  It may have the effect of splitting up the domestic servants into two different classes.  I must say that I do not see the answer to the question.  am merely raising it for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> I think it is an awful pity that the Minister did not include all the domestic servants.  I realise that he must have considered the matter and that there is no use in appealing to him at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be determined largely by her principal employment.  Deputy MacBride spoke of the country solicitor.  A country doctor would be a better example.  If a doctor has a maid who answers the door, in addition to doing household jobs, she is principally a domestic.  But if her duties were more those of a receptionist then she would not be a domestic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Another case is the small shopkeeper in the country who has a domestic servant who works in the shop in addition to cleaning up the house.  I am afraid this will create an awful lot of difficulties.</P>

If she only comes out to relieve her mistress to go to answer the telephone or something <Col N="2028" /> like that for five minutes or so she would be regarded as a domestic.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 2, to insert before sub-section (7), line 36, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  Where a qualified child becomes adopted under any Act providing for the adoption of children (whether passed before or after the passing of this Act), for the purposes of this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the child shall thereafter be treated as if he were the child of the adopter or adopters born to him, her or them in lawful wedlock and were not the child of any other person and, if he were an orphan immediately before the adoption, as having ceased to be an orphan, and</P>
      <P>(b)  if there is one adopter only, in any application after the adoption with respect to the child of the definition of &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; contained in sub-section (1) of this section, &ldquo;the parents of whom is dead&rdquo; shall be substituted in paragraph (a) of that definition for &ldquo;both of whose parents are dead&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think there are three or four similar amendments.  It has the effect of bringing children adopted under the Adoption Act into the same position, for the purposes of this Act, as if they were legitimate children of the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 3, to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  Regulations (not being regulations of which a draft is required by this Act to be approved of by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas) shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made and, if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulations have been laid before it, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>I promised on the Committee Stage that I would bring in this amendment to have all the regulations laid on the Table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>In page 25, Section 40, lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;amount of the said expenses of the Minister or any other Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;part of the said expenses of the Minister or any other Minister which relates to the scheme of social insurance established by this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment which appears to be necessary.  I do not think it is a very substantial amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister promised that he would reconsider the matter which was raised on Section 5.  I do not see any reference here to dockers and other casual workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised the Deputy that I would have the matter considered. I said on the Committee Stage that it appeared to me to be a question that could hardly be covered in the ordinary insurance way.  It appeared to me to be a problem somewhat like that relating to builders' labourers and which was covered by <Col N="2030" /> the Wet Time Act or the Intermittent Employment Act.  If the problem of the dockers is as serious as the Deputy says it is&mdash;I am not saying that it is not, because I realise that it may be &mdash;it is a separate problem that will have to be dealt with by separate legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Hickey.  Men are laid off for two days a week all the year round, which means that they have only four days' work per week.  They get no benefit, although they are idle for a couple of months a year.  On the other hand, a man who is in continuous employment gets benefit if he is laid off for three days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it from the Minister that, while he feels it is impossible to cover the matter in this Bill, it will be considered with a view to making special provision for those classes of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think it was mentioned on the Committee Stage.  I think Deputy Cowan is aware that negotiations have been going on for a long time between the employers and the employees in the case of dockers, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not know whether they have a scheme for decasualising dockers.  We must wait for the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same problem.  They are dealing with the decasualisation of dockers.  This is a different problem altogether.  Men who get only a few days' employment per week are unemployed 17 weeks and two days in the year.  I submit that they are two different questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be for the Minister to play his part in this connection irrespective of the matter of decasualisation, which is one for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the man who falls ill?  He will have to be sick three days before he will get any benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been an improvement and that we cannot do any better than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that there may be something to be said for a lapse of three days before benefit is paid.  If a man is ill for six days is there any reason why, at the end of the week, he should not get benefit for the six days during which he was out ill?</P>
      <P>I have in mind casual workers such as builders' labourers, dockers and carters.  Is there any reason why, when such a man is six days ill, he should not be paid six days' rather than three days' benefit?</P>

      <P>In page 28, Section 47, to insert before paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  for enabling a person to whom benefit is payable to nominate another person to receive the benefit on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives me an opportunity of dealing with a matter raised by Deputy Norton in connection with civil servants. Probably it will also apply to employees of private employers where the employers agree to pay their employees, when they are sick, a certain sum of money less whatever comes from the national health insurance. The point made by Deputy Norton was that the amount of the national health insurance is deducted and may not arrive for many weeks afterwards. The Deputy pleaded that something might be done to pay them the full amount the employer had agreed to give them and that, when the national health insurance came along, it could be adjusted as between employer and employee.  We put in this amendment to deal with that matter and to see whether it is going to work or not on further examination.  We might be able to agree to let the Post Office, say, which pays, I think, two-thirds of the salary, pay out that two-thirds and notify the Department of Social Welfare afterwards, monthly or quarterly. The Department would then recoup them whatever was due from the Department of Social Welfare.  If that is feasible administratively, I do not see why it should not be applied to other employers besides the Post Office.  There are many private employers who have much the same type of scheme and they might agree to pay their employees half their salary less national health insurance for the first three or six months.  Again, as I say, if there are no administrative snags, which I have not seen so far, there is no reason why the Department could not authorise these employers to pay whatever amount is agreed upon between themselves and the employees, <Col N="2033" /> that is, if the Minister approves of the scheme, and then in a monthly or three-monthly period to recoup the employer whatever might be due by way of national health insurance.  It does give the power to deal with the point raised by Deputy Norton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a help, too, to devise an arrangement by which it would be possible in the future, both in respect of unestablished Civil Service staffs and, perhaps, staffs in public utilities and employed by outside employers, that whatever sum they receive in the form of sick payment from an employer may be paid by the employer at the time the person is sick, on an assurance from the Department of Social Welfare that whatever was due to the employee, which will have to be deducted from the sick pay in the first instance, will be paid over at a later date.  That would remove a hardship.  The present position is that if the employee goes sick on Monday he gets two-thirds of his pay at the end of the week less national health, it being assumed by the employer that he has got the national health insurance that week but, in fact, it may be ten days or a fortnight before he receives national health insurance benefit so a deduction is made from portion of his wages on an assumption which is entirely erroneous. It often happens that the employee has gone back to work before he gets the benefit.  If an arrangement of this kind were devised and made known and if the Department would take the lead in trying to operate it with employers, it would alleviate considerable difficulty in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I foresee certain difficulties. Medical certification, for instance, is a slight difficulty.  The employee will, of course, usually send a medical certificate to his employer. He does not always do so and the ordinary employer does not insist on the matter of a certificate but we will have to insist on a medical certificate if we work this.</P>

      <P>In page 40, to delete Section 75 (1), lines 41 to 52, and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Regulations may, with respect to cases in which two or more of the following, that is to say, any benefit, pension, allowance or assistance under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1952, the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1952, the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 to 1952, the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 to 1952, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1952, or the Children's Allowances Acts, 1944 to 1946, are payable to a person, provide for adjusting any benefit, pension, allowances or assistance such as aforesaid (including disallowing payment thereof wholly or partly) that may be payable to such person.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this sub-section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an increase of benefit may be regarded as a separate benefit, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  any benefit, pension, allowance or assistance payable in respect of a person may be regarded as benefit, pension, allowance or assistance payable to such person.</P>
      <P>The case of a person receiving double benefit will be dealt with when the permanent part of this legislation comes into operation on the 1st January next.  There was no such provision made to deal with any case between the 1st July and the 31st December and this amendment is put down to cover that.</P>

      <P>In page 43, before Section 81, line 13, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  For the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1952, a person shall be deemed not to have attained the age of 70 years until the commencement of the seventieth anniversary of the day of his birth, and similarly with respect to any other age.</P>
      <P>(2)  Section 1 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1911, is hereby repealed.</P>
      <P>(3)  Sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section shall come into operation on the 2nd day of January, 1953.</P>
      <P>There was a difference in social welfare legislation up to this with regard to the day on which a person attained a certain age.  In some of the Acts they attained that age on the day before their birthday and in other Acts on the birthday.  According to the Old Age Pensions Act, a man reached 70 on the day before his birthday.  We are bringing them on to the same basis. It is on the birthday that we will say a person attains a certain age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not promise to alter that because I think in all fairness that if a person contributes to a pension he should get more.  Deputy Hickey <Col N="2036" /> mentioned the hardship in connection with a woman whose last child reaches the age of 16 before that widow is 48. That woman goes out of insurance and therefore, gets no benefit until she reaches 48.  She may come back again after an interval of three or four years. On examination of that case, I found that there were very many difficulties, both financial and administrative.  I am not, however, dropping the idea. I am still examining it.  If I can see it is possible, both financially and administratively, I hope to deal with it in the Seanad but the matter is taking more time than I anticipated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 59, in Part I of the First Schedule, to add the following new paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>8.  Employment in a service, industry or vocation in which the employees of such service, industry or vocation are guaranteed by virtue of their contract of employment, security of tenure, payment of wages or salary during absence due to illness <Col N="2042" /> for a period not less than six months and payment of pension on reaching retiring age, provided that the employees of such service, industry or vocation, or a majority thereof, apply to be exempted.</P>
    <P>9.  Members of a trade union catering exclusively for employees who by virtue of their contract of employment are guaranteed security of tenure, payment of wages or salary during absence due to illness for a period not less than six months and payment of pensions on reaching the retiring age provided that such trade union files an application for the exemption of its members.</P>
    <P>The amendment is intended to cover the same class of persons, persons who are, by their contract of service, assured tenure of employment, assured sickness pay for a period not exceeding six months and payment of pension on retiring.  It is intended to cover a number of different types of persons; for instance, teachers will be covered.  The two paragraphs are intended to cover the same difficulty, but I put the two down to enable the Minister to indicate whether he will be in a position to accept either of them.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I would favour the second one, which provides that where the members of a trade union&mdash;and, of course, the term trade union covers many different types of employees&mdash; apply to be exempted, the Act should not apply to the members of that trade union.  That might be a more satisfactory way of dealing with the position, because a trade union is a well-defined body with a defined membership and it will make it easier for the Minister to ascertain positively and definitely whether the members of a particular group of employees should be exempted from the provisions of the Bill.  It will also enable any individual member of a particular class of employees to remain within the provisions of the Bill if he so wishes by ceasing to become a member of the union involved.</P>
    <P>I think the matter is one which affects teachers in particular.  The majority of them do not want to be included in the provisions of the Bill inasmuch as the benefits they would pay would be completely disproportionate <Col N="2043" /> to the advantages they would receive by reason of the fact that they already have security of tenure, are paid during sickness and have a pension scheme of their own.  I appeal to the Minister to accept a provision of the nature suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by me on Section 12 of the Bill on the Committee Stage.  I raised it then from the standpoint of excluding the classes in regular employment as set out in Part I of the First Schedule. The report of the discussion on Section 12 clearly indicates that the Minister intended to discuss with the Minister for Finance the question of the exclusion of these classes on the ground that, as the Bill stood, he did not think they were appropriate for inclusion.  I asked the Minister to have that discussion with the Finance people and let us know what the position was so that the matter could then be reviewed in the light of the Minister's promise, not only to have the matter looked into but to remedy the position.  In fact his statement in that debate constitutes an assurance that these classes would be excluded. Would the Minister now say what the position is in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to exclude certain classes&mdash;civil servants, local authority employees, national and secondary teachers and certain members of the Defence Forces.  I shall deal with these classes first.  Established civil servants are, of course, covered against unemployment.  They are also covered against sickness inasmuch as they are paid during sickness under their conditions of employment. They are, therefore, exempt from the insurance scheme.  The same applies to established servants of local authorities and to permanent national and secondary teachers.  With regard to unestablished employees, they must be fully covered both in the Civil Service and in the local authority service for the full range of insurance under this Bill; that is for sickness, unemployment, widows' and orphans' pensions and so on.  Now that is simple enough as far as we go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> The only point that presents any difficulty is in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions in relation to established civil servants.  Unless the Minister for Finance intends to look after that matter himself.  I think it will be necessary for established civil servants under £600 a year to come under the Bill for widows and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>As far as the Army is concerned, the officers will be treated in much the same way as civil servants because they are established in their particular posts.  They are covered for sickness and retiring pay.  When they do retire they are covered for any unemployment that may arise before they find other work.  Private soldiers will have to be covered for insurance because they may be up against unemployment or sickness when they leave the Army.  They must also be covered for widows' and orphans' pensions. So far as they are concerned the same arrangement will continue in the future as operated in the past. There is no sickness or unemployment while they are in the Army and they are, therefore, only insured against what may happen when they leave. Because of that there is a lower contribution asked for from members of the Army as compared with the contribution paid by the ordinary employee. What that contribution will be in the future has not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>The only other classes mentioned outside of those that I have just enumerated are those working on aircraft and on ships.  The arrangement in relation to these classes is that they are insured in whatever country the ships are registered.  The crews of any ships that are registered here will come under our scheme.</P>
    <P>Two other classes were mentioned &mdash;share fishermen and outworkers.  I am afraid it will be impossible to insure share fishermen against unemployment because they are their own employers.  I take it it would be possible to insure them for sickness and for widows' and orphans' pensions and the contribution would have to be adjusted accordingly to cover those two items.  As regards outworkers the same would apply.  Up to this out-casualisin <Col N="2045" /> workers were, I think, practically exempt, because they were not regraded as employees in the ordinary sense.  They were regarded more as contractors.  I think they will probably come in under the new Bill, but how far they will come in is a matter that must be decided.  Possibly they will come in for sickness and widows' and orphans' pensions.  I think that deals with all the exempted classes as visualised by me.</P>
    <P>With reference to Deputy MacBride's amendment, I think we are going far enough in the exempted classes as outlined. I did draw attention to a section of the Bill under which I thought it would be possible to approve of a scheme put up by an employer for his own employees, or even by a group of employers in consultation with some trade union, provided that the scheme was satisfactory.  The scheme will have to be satisfactory in relation to covering all the items with which we are dealing here.  It would not be sufficient to cover sickness for six months, as suggested by Deputy MacBride, because a person who will be insured under this Bill and who has 156 contributions will be covered for the duration of his illness, irrespective of how long it lasts.  We would not be satisfied, therefore, with Deputy MacBride's requirement of a scheme where six months' sickness benefit would be guaranteed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I took six months because it applies in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy to amend.  These would also have to be covered for unemployment, maternity and widows' and orphans' pensions. If there is a satisfactory scheme we can deal with it under the appropriate section.  I think there is a section under which the Minister has power to approve of a scheme put up by an employer or group of employers. When the scheme is approved the employees will then be exempt from the provisions of this measure.  The employer, or group of employers, may, if so desired, pay a certain subvention to the funds of the particular scheme. That is, perhaps, more vague than Deputy MacBride's amendment, but I <Col N="2046" /> think it is as well to have it vague until we see the type of schemes that are put up for approval.  I do not think we will have any schemes in the immediate future, although I would like to see such schemes.  By the time we get down to approval it may possibly be necessary to bring in further legislation because it is very difficult to visualise what exactly the schemes will be.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  One point that gave me a little trouble in that nice clean-cut arrangement of mine was that established civil servants under £600 a year are not covered as far as widows' and orphans' pensions are concerned although otherwise they are all right.  We must consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it, therefore, that the established civil servant who <Col N="2047" /> is excluded will nevertheless be covered for widows' and orphans' pension purposes under £600 as at present and that although he is excluded from the Bill when it operates on the 1st July anybody who enters the Civil Service after the 1st July will continue to be covered for widows' and orphans' pension purposes?  That is not only desirable but the Minister promised that it would happen.  He said so at column 1177 of the report of the Committee Stage.  If the Minister likes I will read it but I think that the Minister's mind is quite clear.  Take a young postman in Wexford who joins the postal service in October.  If he is excluded from the Bill as an established civil servant, as he would be, then he would not come in for widows' and orphans' pension unless you brought him in.  It would be desirable that a young postman with a wife and children should be included for widows' and orphans' pension.  He is willing to pay contributions and he should be covered.  May I take it that he will be definitely covered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention anyway.  I agree absolutely with that but I have not got agreement with the Minister for Finance on whether we should cover these people for widows' and orphans' pensions.  I think, however, that he will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about those who are in at present or those who pay voluntary contributions but you have to negotiate for the inclusion for widows' and orphans' pension purposes of those whom it is desirable to cover after the Bill becomes operative.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton has made it clear regarding civil servants and the <Col N="2048" /> same applies to local authorities.  They do not want another unemployment scheme because they are permanently employed; they have a satisfactory sickness scheme so the only thing they want is a widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  The great majority of civil servants under £600 a year will not welcome a widows' and orphans' pension scheme because nearly all of them are young people who are not thinking of widows.</P>

With regard to sickness and unemployment they are all right because they are in full employment.

      <P>The Minister has met the position fairly.  I would ask him to consider the general scheme which is suggested in the amendment I put down the details of which, I quite agree, may not be properly set out: where a trade union caters exclusively for a class of persons who have security of tenure in their employment, who have a scheme which grants them an adequate pension on retirement and who are also entitled under the conditions of their employment to receive sickness benefit for an adequate period of time, the Minister should accept the views of the trade union concerned as to whether or not that particular class should be included.  I put down six months merely taking the position which exists with regard to civil servants. I think that civil servants are entitled to full pay for six months and then there is an abatement if their illness lasts longer.  I will, therefore, withdraw and ask the Minister to consider providing for that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a civil servant or a teacher who has got £501 per annum.  The Minister is now going to exempt that person from the scope of this Bill, but he will otherwise be excluded from the provisions of it since his salary ceiling does not exceed £600.  In the case, therefore, of a person whose income is £501, that is £1 above the present salary ceiling of £500 but below the new salary ceiling of £600, can that person become a voluntary contributor in the same manner as he can become one if he were a new entrant under this Bill?  I am sorry that the matter is so complicated, but I suggest that the question is one that is likely to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea about a voluntary contributor is that he is a person who is insured and goes out of insurance for one reason or another.  I must say that I only look on a voluntary contributor as a person who volunteers to continue with the insurance that is already there.  I am not sure how that would meet the Deputy's case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

Under the section as it stands and the Minister's assurance which he has just given, he would be excluded because he is an established civil servant, but in the case of the other excluded established civil servants, that is those persons under £500 who are now covered, the Minister will cover them in the future for widows' and orphans' pension purposes. What I am anxious to ascertain is will the civil servant, the teacher or the Army officer whose pay is £501 per annum who is not in the present scheme, but who would be in the new scheme were it not for the fact that the Minister is going to exclude him, will he be entitled to coverage for widows' and orphans' pension purposes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will probably come across such cases. I have.  Take the case of a person who served in the British, the American or Canadian armies in the First World War.  He is now approaching the age of 70 years.  He has got a disability or a service pension perhaps from the Administration which he served.  God knows, he probably earned it hard enough, but because another country gives him a pension for his services, or a pension for wounds which he suffered, we say to him: &ldquo;We will take that into consideration against you in assessing your means for an old age pension.&rdquo;  The only way he could get an old age pension from us is by exempting what the foreign Administration gives him&mdash;so much of his disability or service pension.  Up to the <Col N="2054" /> present that was so even with a member of our own Defence Forces.  Now, we are making a change by which we exempt the first £80 of his wound or service pension for the purpose of ascertaining his entitlement to an old age pension.  I am merely asking the Minister to travel a little further along the road, as I had intended to do under the previous Social Welfare Bill, and to exclude the sum of £80, if a person is getting £80 from the American, the Canadian or the British Government.</P>
      <P>In other words, I am asking that the State here ought not to make a profit out of the fact that these other Administrations have recognised their obligations to Irishmen who served in their forces.  I do not think that the cost of doing that can be very much. As a matter of fact, I took the trouble to ascertain the number of persons who are likely to be a claim on our funds here, having regard to their old age pensions.  The figures are relatively small.  I think they are probably in the Department and can be easily made available to the Minister.  As the cost is not much, I think the Minister ought to undertake to meet the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support that plea.  I did support it on the Committee Stage and I was pleased to hear the Minister say here to-day that the door is not closed and that the matter is still open for consideration. Now, undoubtedly, there is a special case to be made for men who served in the First World War, men who went out at the request of the then leaders of the Irish people.  Quite a number of them went out and served, and they are now approaching, or perhaps have passed, the 70 years mark.  Those people who have come back from the First World War, if they had a service pension they worked here; if they had a small disability or wound pension they worked here.  They have reared their families here and they have given service to the country at home since that, which entitles them to an old age pension. That being so, I think there is a very special case to be made for them to the extent of allowing them £80, as <Col N="2055" /> we have done with our own forces, as not counting as means for the purposes of the Act.  The Minister has met the views of all the members sympathetically and the fact that he states that the door has not been closed indicates, to me anyway, that he sees the force of the argument but that he has some difficulty in dealing with it.  I think that once we know that the Minister has that approach to it we could leave it to him between this and the Final Stage in the Seanad to insert an amendment that would make provision for those people for whom we have advocated both on the Committee Stage and on the present stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem will have to be approached in a certain way.  What we have done so far is that we have given certain consideration to members of the Army who fought for independence. We gave them special consideration because we wanted to pay a tribute to those men.  When you go beyond that, to men who have fought for other armies&mdash;I have nothing against them, of course&mdash;such as the British or the Canadian Army, or any other army, we have to consider where we are going to stop.  There will be other classes who will come along and say that they deserve consideration, too.  I would say that is a big problem as far as I am concerned, if we are going to depart from the Old I.R.A. and consider the whole field, because we can defend the position of giving special privileges to the Old I.R.A. Apart from them, there may be many classes to be considered, and being a very big problem it is not likely to be decided before this Bill goes through the Seanad.  As I said before, the door is not closed; I have nothing whatever in the way of prejudice against those people and if they deserve special consideration I will be sympathetic.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given any convincing reasons for not accepting the suggestion which has been made to him in respect of Irishmen who served in foreign defence forces.  It is not a difficult problem to meet from the financial point of view. I intended to meet it on the previous Bill and told those who were interested I would meet the problem.  There is no administrative difficulty involved.  If the Minister wants to mark out the members of the Old I.R.A. for special treatment he can make the exemption higher in their case by allowing £80 exemption to those who served in foreign defence forces and doubling it in respect of those who served in the I.R.A.  There is no difficulty from that point of view.  There is no real difficulty from a financial point of view.</P>

      <P>I cannot for the life of me see why, when a Bill has been reported, with the amendments the Minister has finally accepted and when the Bill has reached the Final Stage, which is the decision as to whether or not the Bill will pass, we should defer that in view of the fact that the Bill has received a general welcome from the House.</P>
      <P>There has undoubtedly been some criticism of it but there is no issue as to whether it should or should not pass.  The only issue now on this stage is that any Deputy who wants to is entitled to talk about it.  I feel that Deputy Norton is well able to say anything he has to say about the Bill now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was referring to the debate of 10th June, 1948, in which certain Deputies <Col N="2062" /> had certain interesting things to say about the present Minister for Finance as regards his attitude to certain things.  That may be interesting to people nowadays.  At column 812, Volume 111 of the Official Reports of 10th June, 1948, the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, I know that if our proposal to stabilise the cost of living by subsidising the essential foodstuffs of the people had been adopted, it would have been necessary for us to increase in this year the standard rate of tax to 7/- in the £ just as it would have been necessary to maintain the additional duties on beer, spirits, tobacco and entertainments imposed under the Supplementary Budget. But these additional taxes were being imposed for a definite purpose, let me repeat it again, to subsidise the essential foodstuffs of the people, and in order to stabilise the cost of living and enable the people to provide the necessaries of life for themselves and their families.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now we have left all those moorings. The present Minister is no longer keen on subsidising essential foodstuffs for the family.  He has come to the conclusion that they mostly represented an unearned addition to income.</P>
      <P>At column 813 of the same debate the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the policy of maintaining the cost of living steady has gone by the board, and it is undeniable that it has, then there is no justification for increasing the standard rate of tax in this year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At column 816 the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has abandoned food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That comes well considering the atmosphere of this debate.</P>
      <P>At column 814, he gives a tearful glance at certain people.  The speech runs:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These people, if they have any regard for their family responsibilities, must naturally live within a very narrow and restricted budget. Many of them have to live within a <Col N="2063" /> budget so narrow and so restricted that they cannot afford either to drink or smoke.  Many of them, the heads of families and fathers of families, are in the position that they must stint themselves in order to provide for their children even the same sort of meagre opportunity in life as they themselves got.  Even many of those of them who are not married have to live thriftily also and, because they want to contribute adequately to the family income and perhaps to maintain aged parents and other dependents, cannot frequent the public-house and cannot smoke extensively or expensively, as do many of the people who do not come within the income class at all.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to have that comparison made at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan said last night that he was glad to be in touch with a Government that is doing the things he wants done.  The things he wants provided are social welfare and old age pensions.  He did mention the mother and child scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was put away from it by the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did and could not go on to say how these things are being financed.</P>
      <P>That is what I call the bread snitching. Then they get after the tea and they take away the sugar, or at least they are making it too costly for people to buy.  Deputy MacEntee then said that the people with meagre incomes could not afford these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan was interested, at least I am told he was interested, in raising a private army.  He was to be the chief of it I understand.  He is now a very minor private in a new army, the army of the Government bailiffs who are to insinuate themselves into the houses of the poor.  These are the new harriers we are to have operating around.  If we are to take the tone that new Deputies create for themselves in the country, they are to call themselves the &ldquo;courage squad&rdquo;. Deputy Cowan when he is at that task will probably, if he remembers his own <Col N="2064" /> story last night, as he looks at the bread and the butter say, &ldquo;This is merely pig food.&rdquo;  Obviously, when he takes something off the sugar and tea, they will be then hog-wash.  May I remind him of what he said in this House, that there will be a gap in our lives and that that gap would be made wider?  Deputy Cowan is supporting this Government in doing that.  No doubt the people will question him about the gap they feel they have to fill, and he will say, &ldquo;Did you ever hear about the gap that we have to fill, the gap in the balance of payments?&rdquo; That is the slogan.  The Deputy is now to go down to help to fleece the people. To parody the Walrus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I weep for you, the captain said,</P>
    <P>My heart for you has bled.</P>
    <P>With tears and sobs he sorted out</P>
    <P>The bread and tea and spread</P>
    <P>Holding his pocket handkerchief before his aching head.</P>
    <P>That is what the Deputy is facing.  He was bold enough to put in words last night what everybody is saying, that he and the other three ex-Independents who are now supporting the Government are afraid to face the electors.</P>

When Deputy Dr. Browne walks the plank I am sure he will be saying what he said in a letter in a newspaper recently: &ldquo;I am utterly opposed to the degradation and humiliation of any section of the community,&rdquo; but he is voting nevertheless for the removal of the subsidies on bread, butter, tea and sugar. The parliamentary baby sitter will probably say of his attitude that he was always for bigger and better subsidies. Then there is Deputy Cogan who can say that he has been getting places&mdash;in the Guards, a farmer, a Farmers' Party man, and an Independent Deputy who thought he would become a Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;he is now to be a private gentleman.

      <P>I should like to have the reference.  I suggest that it should be forgotten unless it is looked up as I do not believe it is right.  One <Col N="2067" /> wonders could a private recording be made of the conversations that went on between Fianna Fáil and those four Independent Deputies with the object of avoiding an election.  I am afraid I misquoted last night when speaking with regard to Deputy Cogan.  I used a phrase about flotsam and jetsam. That was wrong.  It was the present Minister for Finance who said that about Deputy Dr. Browne, on whom he commented in this way :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has been very busy, very busy indeed, in touring the country, showing himself off to his political friends as the strangest piece of flotsam the stormy sea of Irish politics has thrown up in three generations.  As a politician, he has endeavoured to make a political monopoly of tuberculosis.  He is, in fact, I think, a very dangerous influence, a very malign influence in regard to that serious problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance spoke of Deputy Cowan &ldquo;as being in this House but not of it&rdquo;.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He does not sit in this House as a representative of democracy.  He sits in this House as a believer in a system which is the antithesis of democracy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not backing that phrase.  It is what the Minister for Finance thought of Deputy Cowan at that time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan was not short for a reply.  I quote from the Official Report of the 5th April, 1951.  Deputy Cowan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now the Deputy (Dr. J. Ryan) has somersaulted... what does that show to me?  It shows a Party that is dishonest.  It shows a Party which knows, which must know, that it will not assume the responsibility of office again.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it was left to Deputy Cogan to make the best remarks about the people with whom he now associates. He spoke of the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera.  He said he had eaten enough of his own words to choke an elephant and that it would not do him any harm if he were to eat his words again and <Col N="2068" /> agree to come into a Government under the leadership of Deputy John Costello.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister for Finance is not here because Deputy Cogan went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I tried to instil into the mind of that senile delinquent, the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Seán MacEntee)&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and lest there be any doubt about it the name of Mr. Seán MacEntee is inserted in brackets&mdash;</P>

      <P>The introduction of a quotation from a speech by Patrick Pearse might be a bit incongruous in a speech about subsidies.  The Minister's speech on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill is a strange document to read.  I did not hear it but, reading through it, I find that out of a speech consisting of 23 columns he devoted seven columns to the matter of the remission of the dance tax.  In a Finance Bill, dealing with millions of money, the Minister devoted seven columns out of 23 columns to a remission of, I understand, about £140,000 to less than 140 dance hall proprietors &mdash;a gift of about £1,000 a year to each of these people.  The greater part of the rest of the Minister's speech was <Col N="2069" /> taken up with his reasoning for not reimposing the excess profits tax and for not increasing surtax.  I think the main argument could be put into two or three lines.  He said it had been discovered in Britain that the excess profits tax was unequal and unfair in its incidence and was, therefore, a bad tax.  But that cannot be said about bread and butter taxes: they are fair.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan can explain to the people at the Five Lamps how the taking away of a subsidy is not a tax.  It will take more than a funny story about bread being fed to pigs to convince the people that the removal of the subsidy will not mean an increase in the price of these commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there is no tax on bread or tea.  The Deputy should speak with precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is welcome to make that explanation to the people at the Five Lamps.  The Minister devoted a column or so of his speech to the fact that at one time I reduced the excess profits tax in respect of foreign-owned companies doing business in this country.  He said that the members of the Labour Party had sat as mute as mice when that proposal was made.  I would remind Deputy Cowan that he himself was supporting the then Government and also sat as mute as a mouse.  However, they were not the only people who sat as mute as mice.  The Fianna Fáil Party sat as mute as mice.  Only one person made a harmless query with regard to the whole thing and elicited the information that the full extent of the remission amounted to £8,000 a year and would cost nothing in the first year it was given.  That was the extent of the preference which was given&mdash;a sum of £8,000 a year. The reason why it was taken off was that we were making agreements with different foreign Governments at the time.  The point was raised that this was discriminatory taxation.  While one might make a move for a big sum of money there was no point, in the <Col N="2070" /> circumstances, in making it for about £8,000.</P>
      <P>The rest of the Minister's speech was a distortion of the speech which I made.  I referred very particularly to excerpts from a memorandum given to me by advisers in the Department of Finance last year when the Budget was being framed.  The whole reason of the introduction of that memorandum was that people were asking why the Government were so foolish or so cruel as to impose taxes if they were not necessary.  That question was asked last night by Deputy Cowan.  The answer is that there was a definite scheme.  A course had been laid out and one had to find the reason for the adoption of that plan and the plotting of that particular course.  The reason was clear in the memorandum from which I quoted.  It was that it was necessary, if we accepted the view that our people were too well off and had too much money to spend and were spending it too freely, to reduce purchasing power.</P>
      <P>One way of reducing that purchasing power was to budget for a surplus. They tried to persuade me to adopt that course.  They did not succeed because I did not accept the standard on which that memorandum was written. I suggested, and I think the suggestion has not yet been answered, that the reason why those savage impositions have been brought in is that the present Government have been swayed by that reasoning&mdash;that they have budgeted for a surplus in order to draw the purchasing power from the hands of the people because if the people have it they will spend it and imports will increase and in that way the gap in the balance of payments will be increased or will remain as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think there will be a surplus of revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Distinctly so.  The argument was that it was based on a surplus.  The Minister's reply distorts that speech and talks about my advisers advising me about a deficit. They never did so.  The Minister must have the memorandum: it is dated the <Col N="2071" /> 12th April of last year.  The whole memorandum was framed in terms of budgeting for a surplus.  But, in order to make a point, the Minister had to come and say that I was faced with a deficit and that I was warned that I was faced with it.  That is not so. The point made was to remove the purchasing power from the hands of the people&mdash;to soak it in by way of taxation or to induce them to save.  The memorandum stated that they were not very optimistic that savings would achieve the amount of money which it was necessary to drain off.  They said it must be done by force through taxation and that therefore they must budget for a surplus.  That was the suggestion that was made to me last year at a time when the balance of payments was not as bad as it has been represented to be since.  That was the policy which was proposed to me at a time when the balance of payments difficulties were not so bad.  Is it not more likely that the same proposal was made this year?  The only difference is that I refused to accept it last year while it has been accepted this year. That is the only reason I can see why more revenue is being looked for than is required to balance the accounts.</P>

I am not saying that there was not ability behind them nor am I saying it was not founded on a system.  I did not take it, nor did my colleagues.  We had a different plan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an annual thing.  It is a point of view that people have carried through in the circumstances over the last three or four years purporting to show that the circumstances have been deteriorating each year.  I believe this, which was pressed with great vigour and strength and with persuasion, was accepted.  That is the reason the Budget was framed as it was.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank in its reports backwards through the years have always held out flashing red signals. I did not mind the red signal.  It is a great thing to have a person with a different point of view but with the red signal showing all the time I think the Central Bank loses its force and vigour particularly when it cannot change.  One cannot get a green light or an even moderate amber.  No matter how strong were the admonitions of the Central Bank the view I had was that they were not going to mould our policy.  As far as my colleagues are concerned we paid no heed to them because we were able to convince ourselves that the standards they set might be all right 50 or 100 years ago but they were not all right in our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I got an illuminating comment proceeding from a member of the board of the Central Bank.  I was asked to have an interview with this particular individual on a matter that was very important.  He told me that when the particular files would be disclosed it would bowl me out.  That was a very dismaying <Col N="2073" /> approach to an interview.  At the end of the interview I felt a little bit exhilarated because I was told that for 15 years this particular individual had reported that each successive year was worse than the one before.  He wound up by saying: &ldquo;For 15 years my view was that this country should have gone bankrupt and the surprising thing is that it has not.&rdquo;  I was not going to be so impressed by the things he said afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the speech by the Minister for Finance another attempt was made by repetition to establish what is the most outrageous untruth in connection with the finances of this State in the last 18 months.  The phrase is: &ldquo;It is no longer possible to continue borrowing to meet current expenditure.&rdquo;  There is the Minister for Finance's speech on this Second Reading of the Finance Bill which deals with a Budget of £97,000,000.</P>
    <P>The main point is the dance halls remissions&mdash;£1,000 each.  There is complete distortion of the speech I made and in connection with this outrageous untruth of borrowing to meet current expenditure the fact is that the Minister and his Party do feel, I think, ashamed of this matter in reference to the dance halls.  The letter was read and I propose to quote part of it again. It was an open piece of nasty corruption. It smells and it will continue to smell until the mess is finished in some other way.  The Minister spoke about social conditions and how remissions had to be made.</P>
    <P>All that is just trying to create some sort of a fog in order to prevent people properly surveying this odious piece of political corruption.  Nobody can answer me on that.  Nobody can raise a cheer in the House for it.  Even back-benchers made no attempt to argue for it.  Let it be buried.  Let it be buried with the Party.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that it is recognised and Deputies must admit that the only thing wrong about the dance hall tax was that the letter got circulated.  Everybody knows there was a definite bribe given at the time of the last election but, dirty as it was, <Col N="2074" /> odious as it is, there is at least to be said for it that Fianna Fáil stood by their promises in this way.</P>
    <P>With regard to E.C.P. tax&mdash;and I do not want to go into this at any great length at the moment&mdash;the British have this year reintroduced a tax called the excess profits levy.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who did not want to hog the subsidies over there to the extent to which he was expected to hog them, nevertheless did try to hold the balance even as between the people in the upper income groups and those in the lower groups by introducing something in the nature of excess profits tax under the new name of excess profits levy.  The excuse given here about that tax was that an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was an unequal tax and one that worked hardship; we did not want to do that and our excuse is that the British tried it and found it was an unequal tax which involved hardship. On the other hand, we get people to back taxes on bread, butter, tea and sugar on the grounds presumably that they are equal taxes and even if a man is having <i>caviare</i> or <i>foie gras</i> he will have a bit of toast with it.  There is a bit of bread in the background and the man who has luxurious tastes therefore will have to pay a little bit extra for the small amount of bread which he takes.</P>
    <P>Can it be argued that the tax on bread is one that falls with equal incidence on every section of the community? It is a well-known social fact that the people in the lower income groups spend the greater percentage of their household income on bread.  The tax on bread through the removal of the subsidy on bread is a tax that hits the poorest sections of our community and leaves them without any resort to any substitutes that might be available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked a good deal about the excess corporation profits tax.  He might at least have asked himself what would have been the result of reimposing even the old form of excess profits tax.  I had that examined in my time.  It was not that I wanted to impose it because I could see very definite objections to it and I <Col N="2075" /> think it is always a good thing to have a reserve of taxing capacity left to meet other circumstances that may arise.  I was advised that the reimposition of the old tax would bring in £7,000,000.  It would not bring in that amount in the first year, but in a full year it would bring in an additional £7,000,000.  The old excess corporation profits tax that was in operation was full of loopholes and let out any amount of money that should have been taxed on the higher level.  Could not the Minister have balanced his speech and said: &ldquo;It might admittedly have brought so much&rdquo;?  Let us see the effect and force of his argument against the amount of money likely to be covered in that way.  He could have done one other thing.  I do not know what the latest issue of the Revenue Commissioners' report for the year is, but there is one due.  I know it is generally delayed a bit.  There must have been one within the last 12 months.  Deputies can turn to that and find out for themselves the tot of the assessable incomes in a year and see at the same time how much they have increased over the last five years.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say that I was not in favour of such a tax device during the three years I was in office and I refrained from putting it on for various reasons.  Sometimes I put some of those reasons forward here when I was asked about it.  I am not sure that I gave all the reasons.  But Deputies will see in that report the taxable capacity that exists.  One can also see how trade and industry profits have increased over the past five years.  One would expect a Minister, when painting the picture here, to say: &ldquo;My mood is against the putting on of these taxes for the following reasons,&rdquo; and give the reasons.  Of course, the Minister's excuses are so very weak that he dare not fill in the picture properly by stating the amount such a tax as the one to which I referred earlier would bring in even if it were reimposed in the old way.  It would, of course, be a scandal to bring back the old tax in the old way.  It should be brought up to date.  There is a vast <Col N="2076" /> field of inquiry in relation to the profits made in trade and industry.  There is a great deal of taxing capacity left there if any Government is ever driven to the point that it must get money to pay the nation's expenditure and does not want to interfere with such things as bread, butter, tea and sugar.</P>
    <P>With regard to the speech I made here on another occasion, I say that I was advised to budget for a surplus. I think the first quotation I gave from that memorandum was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is difficult to rationalise the Budget if it stops short at balancing the current account....  The Budget is not simply an exposition of how we propose to make ends meet.  In modern times it is recognised as the most effective instrument a Government has for shaping economic policy.  That is why we have in the Budget statement an analysis of current and prospective economic conditions.  This survey would be the merest padding unless the budgetary proposals were consistent with the conclusion about economic policy to which the analysis led. In Britain, the United States of America, and elsewhere the proposals are devised to correct whatever is shown to be amiss in the economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to stress that phrase since it can lead to only one conclusion: the Budget proposals are devised to correct whatever is shown to be amiss in the economy.  What was amiss, and seriously amiss, in the minds of the people advising me along those lines was an economy distorted in such a way as shown by the great gap in the balance of payments.  Our trading accounts were out of gear.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The British Chancellor yesterday introduced proposals directed towards achieving a surplus over current expenditure of £39,000,000, and this because his interpretation of conditions forced him to the conclusion that if resources were to be directed to the proper uses without inflation, the public must be made yield up more purchasing power than is required to cover all current Government outlay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> Now that is the mood behind the present Budget here.  The public are being made to yield up more purchasing power than is required to cover all Government current expenditure. Another excerpt I gave was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the public and the Government between them are spending more than the nation can afford. What is the remedy?  It is either to curtail spending&mdash;by both the public and the Government&mdash;or to induce or force the public to yield up more purchasing power to provide what the Government needs to maintain its spending on capital and current account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the objective?  It is to induce or force the public to yield up more purchasing power.  For what purpose? To provide what the Government needs to maintain its spending on capital as well as on current account.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance is putting the same capital services as we did in the Book of Estimates; there is a sum of £9,000,000.  We do observe, however, that he intends to finance capital expenditure out of revenue.  He intends the Budget to yield so much to the revenue this year that capital development will be financed out of that.  That is why we say that there is overtaxation to a minimum of £10,000,000 in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The last excerpt is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The 1951-52 capital programme will be at least as big as last year; the Estimates point to its being bigger.  Can we hope to get much more money in savings even with a vigorous campaign?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Doubts were then expressed on that matter but the opinion was stated that it was a thing that ought to be tried.</P>
    <P>The only correct way of meeting the difference is from taxation in the light of the interpretation to be put on current economic conditions.  Taxation in order to produce a surplus on the current account towards financing the capital Budget, is a necessary gesture towards orthodoxy, the memorandum says, although the Budget as a whole was criticised as being far from wise <Col N="2078" /> and failing to face facts.  If at that time, when the balance of payments was not the same as it is now or at the time when the present Budget was prepared, that was written with all that persuasive force behind it, its whole aim being to budget for a surplus and either to induce or to force the people to yield up more purchasing power so as to produce a surplus over the amount required to meet the ordinary expenditure of the State, if that persuasion was used in April, 1951, the circumstances warrant the preparation of a much more aggressive memorandum on the same lines this year.  I have no doubt that it was prepared and accepted and that is the reason why we say that the present Budget includes unnecessary taxation and imposes unnecessary hardships on the people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fourth item of the memorandum in his Second Reading Finance Bill speech the Minister referred to the money borrowed.  I want again to say that no borrowing was done by us to meet current expenditure.  No necessity was imposed upon any successor of ours to meet what we had to borrow for current expenses.  If anybody questions me on that I want to know what was the current expenditure, properly classified as such, for which we borrowed money or what necessity we imposed on the present group to borrow for ordinary current expenditure.</P>
    <P>I noticed that speaking of the debts we left the present Minister for Health said that the extra taxes were to cover the expenditure incurred by the last Government which now had to be met &mdash;expenditure incurred by us&mdash;that the inter-Party Government had awarded increased salaries to civil servants, the Army and teachers and that there was also the nationalisation of transport. So these are the things.  There is an echo there of what the present Minister for Justice said as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> 17th January, 1949:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The increase in Civil Service salaries is to cost about £700,000 in a full year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was before the final award:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Army, Gardaí and teachers <Col N="2079" /> are also entitled to increases but the full amount is not yet disclosed. Local Government officials will naturally expect increases also as will workers all over the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a good sweep: civil servants, Guards, the Army, teachers, local government employees and workers all over the country.  Having put that as the deplorable picture Deputy Boland then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This was the situation which Fianna Fáil was determined to prevent, and would have prevented if three of the six lost Dublin seats had been held.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They would have prevented it if three of the six lost Dublin seats had been held.  Now those seats are held by Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, and Fianna Fáil is unable to prevent it. That is the Minister for Justice in January, 1949; here is Deputy Dr. Ryan now Minister for Health on the 12th May in Tullamore on the extra taxes imposed by the Budget:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They were due to the heavy expenditure incurred by the last Government which now had to be met and the inter-Party Government had awarded increased salaries to the Civil Service, the Army and the teachers and there was also the nationalisation of transport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was also the nationalisation of transport.&rdquo;  I do not mind having certain things laid to my door but the defects of Córas Iompair Éireann as something to be put to the discredit of the inter-Party Government are an amazing charge.  The present Tánaiste used to alternate between recurrent crises, avoiding disasters by a hair's breadth, escaping economic disasters and the sun breaking through, coming to the end of a long lane, the clouds lifting, a little break coming.  Then there was the period when a new era dawned.  The best period in his life was one of six months in which a new era dawned twice.  Two eras dawned for Córas Iompair Éireann.  First there was one, then there was a general election and he got back and we had two <Col N="2080" /> Transport Acts.  We were going to have an efficient system of transport cheaply serving the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He left us with the burden of trying to reorganise transport but the Minister for Health says that the nationalisation of transport was one of the debts we left behind us.</P>
      <P>This may not be quite relevant but I would like to let the House know what the Minister said in Tullamore on the 12th of this month:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government, after examining every item, felt they must meet the problem with increased taxation. The subsidies on bread, tea and sugar were introduced in 1947 when the prices of these commodities were high and when it was thought that in a year or two they would be reduced. Instead the prices of wheat, tea and sugar had increased and were not going to go back to the 1947 price, so the Government did away with the subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This reasoning beats me.  In order to meet the prices we had increased the Government did away with the subsidies. If that is logic I have not been taught in the school in which the doctor was educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know more about this borrowing to meet current expenditure. We know that when the Fianna Fáil Government were in before they were determined to prevent increases being given to various classes of workers but more notably to those who were under their thumb, the servants of the State.  They went out, we came in and an arbitration scheme was developed.  Civil servants were at that point on one footing with other workers in the country.  They had some court, some arbitrary body, to which to resort to have their claims considered and their salaries adjusted. Then we had people who wanted to prevent that type of thing and were determined to do so.  Since the present Government took over arbitration was abolished, there will be no arbitration. Again we will have the position where civil servants are to be made suffer <Col N="2081" /> because they are nearest to Government control.  They are under the thumb of the Government and hardships can be imposed on them without any thought of morality or of the attitude of the people who are going to suffer or the results on the people. They will soak them because they are so close to the hand of the Government that they can be immediately gripped.  If there is no arbitration for civil servants there will be repercussions elsewhere.  The salaries of teachers and Guards bore a very distinct relationship to the salaries of civil servants.  The men of the Army are associated with the same matter although on a different scale.  If there is no arbitration for civil servants&mdash;and that is the situation which has developed&mdash;no court to which these people can resort, that will tie up for a long time in spite of a rise in the cost of living the emoluments of all people who are servants of the State.  There will be no standard to have a relation to.  It will also tie up the salaries of Guards, the Army and teachers and no doubt when the good example has been given we will be able to put into force the idea of the Minister for Justice; we will be able to tie up also local government employees and possibly workers all over the country.</P>
    <P>On this matter of the borrowing we were doing to meet current expenditure or if not that of borrowing nevertheless, a question has been asked here over and over again and it has never had a proper answer: who spent the greater part of the American loan counterpart moneys?  I want to give an answer which cannot be contradicted. We had a scheme for the use of those moneys.  I suggest that it was a good scheme.  We had a far bigger scheme of capital development than the funds in our hands would meet. As they would not go far enough in any year to finance the projects we had in mind we thought of the trustee savings, the savings bank, post office savings and savings certificates and we had the funds of the National Health Society called the social security funds which could be taken out of British sterling securities and put in <Col N="2082" /> our own loans.  In addition we appealed to the people three times in three years.  We kept the Marshall Aid moneys as a reserve to siphon off a certain amount of the millions of money each year to make up for the deficit in what we were able to collect directly from the people or through these particular funds.</P>
    <P>It was a useful reserve to have. During the three years, we had used about £16,000,000 of this reserve, feeding it in to make up for the deficiencies or what we were left short of in these appeals to the people.  The present Government were left with £26,000,000 worth of money.  They have splashed that inside a year.  There is no money now to fall back on, and the very good scheme that we had for the financing of these projects was completely destroyed. It may be the worst harm that the present interregnum of the last 12 months may have caused to the reserves of the community.  But that has been spent.  It has been thrown to the winds while we had husbanded it, and husbanded it very carefully indeed, and for very good purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy what did the present Government spend this £26,000,000 on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a variety of things.  They had to get money.  I do not object to their spending £26,000,000. What I do object to is that they spent the £26,000,000 in one year from that fund instead of holding it as a reserve. They could have gone for loans to the people, as I had announced my intention of doing, and then they would have the same scheme that we had, the three things that I have already mentioned&mdash;something from the small savings fund, something by way of investment from the social security funds and something from the people.  I do not believe that they rate themselves so low as to believe that they could not get £5,000,000, £6,000,000, £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 from the people.  They did not try that, and had to get on with the schemes that were there.  They were faced with either of two difficulties, either to close down on the <Col N="2083" /> schemes, which would have caused fierce unemployment and more misery, or find some way to keep them going, and not being able to get the money from the people, because they would not face the people, they had then to raid this fund.  I cannot understand how people who rage as they do in an academic way about inflation, could have brought themselves to scatter this £26,000,000, to pump it out for full inflation in one year&mdash;to spend all that last year without drawing off any bit by way of an appeal to the people for a national loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, there is the situation that there is not 1/- left in the reserve. That is all gone.  We are told it is because the Government did not like to go for a loan last year, that the conditions were not favourable.  They were not favourable because of all their wailings which had gone on through the country.  But at an early period they could have gone for a loan. They say it was an inappropriate moment because there was a big conversion loan.  There was, and it was successful.  That was done before their ululations had their effect on the country.  It is a strange thing that the present Government should think it incongruous to have a conversion loan within the same six months as an ordinary loan.  I remember before the Korean War that I had conversations with the bankers when I was deciding to have a loan.  I remember being asked by the bankers would I not consider having both the conversion loan and an ordinary loan running with a very little time lag between them.  The view expressed to me by some of the bankers was that one would help the other.  Of course, there is no incongruity between running the two at the same time.  The conversion loan would involve a vast amount of money.  The previous loans have been cashed, and the people would have that money.  It was old money looking for a new home, and it could get that new home.  Was not that the time to draw some of that money off instead of the cowardly policy that was adopted?  The people opposite sat back and wailed, and said: &ldquo;We have beaten ourselves; we <Col N="2084" /> cannot ask the people to subscribe in a situation which we have described in such moving terms&rdquo;.  As I have said, we left them £26,000,000 of good money and that was taken and splashed in one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not read it, but let us hear about the debts. The debts were the schemes that are now going to be financed this year in the Book of Estimates.  We covered our current expenditure by ordinary means.  It was met out of ordinary revenue.  Our capital projects have now been accepted by Fianna Fáil. Even though they have accepted them, I doubt their sincerity, but they are accepted and they are doing that rather than cause public commotion. All our capital schemes are in the Book of Estimates, some reduced in value.  But they are accepted as proper for borrowing, so that that argument is gone for ever.</P>
      <P>As regards any money we got we had two objectives.  One was to raise the standard of living in this country and particularly to raise the standard and volume of our exports.  We succeeded in that.  The second thing was, that we so financed things that the national income increased in such a way that the yield from old-time taxes brought in so much more money that out of the surplus you could finance and pay the cost of the money that we had invested in the country.  That has been an actuality as I will show later by the figures.  We provided the cost of borrowing without having to increase taxes.  In the main we reduced taxes with the people here getting a bigger yield because the country was progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told about the deficit that is supposed to have been left by me last year, and about things that were not <Col N="2085" /> mine.  As regards this so-called deficit, there is the £3,000,000 on the turf produced. I say that turf losses are to be considered as something apart although they are in the deficit.  I have asked the Minister about the sum of £2,000,000 that I left him as a carry-over from the previous year.  I have not got any answer to that.  We have the Exchequer returns in this morning's newspapers.  They are made up to the 17th of this month.  The revenue is given at £12,346,000.  For the corresponding period of last year the return from revenue was £12,136,000.  Therefore the revenue is a couple of hundred thousand pounds better, but that is not the point.  In the figure of £12,136,000 there had been siphoned away £2,000,000 of a carry-over.  It is either there again in this year's revenue, and I believe it is, or if it is not, there is the more interesting situation facing the Minister that his revenue has increased by £2,000,000 over last year in the period between the 1st April and the 17th May&mdash;call it six weeks. Either he has that £2,000,000 of a carry-over, or else the revenue is showing the buoyancy that we always said it would show if there was not this defeatist spirit in the country.</P>
    <P>I have said that the aim of this Budget is clear.  The Budget itself can only be explained or recognised from the background and the philosophy of it.  The people are to be pledged to these impositions, and they are asked: do you think we would be so sadistic as to impose these taxes if they were not required or that we would risk our popularity in doing so?  They had become obsessed with one idea&mdash;the gap in the balance of payments.  One may accept that there is a gap in the balance of payments; that it is going to continue; that it will bring about bankruptcy and insolvency, and that something must be done about it. That is the view the present Government has adopted, and it is on those lines that the present Budget has been prepared.</P>
    <P>There are two types of inflation that can be thought of in this connection and that were mentioned last year. <Col N="2086" /> There is the inflation that is spoken of when an increase in prices is caused by too much spending chasing too few goods.  We had not got that in this country.  The only inflation we had got was an inflation of a price type. It was an import inflation, necessarily imported here because of our junction with the currency position in Britain. The other type of inflation which we had in some degree was the inflation that was caused by the blowing up in the form of our imports.  Some people may have got terrified of that.  The present Government did, but we did not.  We thought of it as an abnormal circumstance which was wearing out, and we felt that it would right itself. We felt that efforts were being made in this country both to prevent inflation and to weaken inflation.  Let us say that we had inflation of the type that is shown by our imports being very heavy&mdash;far more than we are paying for by our exports.  The problem was to get rid of that situation, and to get rid of it without turning over to inflation of a price type.  The problem could be immediately faced by having a physical control of the ports and the Border, thereby stopping imports coming in.  In that way, imports could be reduced and the balance of payments rectified.  If that were the case then all the money that was in the country partly expended on the goods that are imported would be focussed on the small quantity of goods that would be produced here.  In those circumstances we would have swung over from the inflation of the import type to the fierce inflation of the price type.  There is only one answer to that, we cannot stop imports by physical control. Otherwise you would have prices inflated.  What you can do is to leave people without the wherewithal to buy goods and thus have the whole situation rectified.  Look at the measures that were suggested by the Central Bank and, in the main, adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank suggested that bank credit should be restricted and that businesses and private enterprises should not be given the finance that would be required before they begin to earn a little money in order to establish <Col N="2087" /> new projects.  The difficulty is that, while the factory is being built and machinery installed, the workers are getting wages.  While workers are getting wages they will spend them, thus calling for more imports and creating a gap in the balance of payments. Similarly, State schemes could be restricted.  However, the difficulty is that wages will be pouring out before the schemes are finished, and the workers will spend their wages.  The only thing to do is to restrict schemes so that there will be no money and, in such a way, reduce purchasing power generally.  The best solution will be to lift £10,000,000, £12,000,000 or £14,000,000 from the people by pretending that you are looking for a balance for your ordinary revenue account, whereas, in reality, you are looking for a surplus&mdash;the surplus that was left behind by me, and the surplus that is put across by the present Minister for Finance, who has accepted this terrifying aspect of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance to-day could he inform us with regard to this £3,000,000 which he says he has to get to provide for the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951.  I asked him could he divide the £2,000,000 amongst the different types of benefits to be given.  We wanted to get the proper amount phrased.  The amount can only be partially phrased.  The Government are making £3,818,000 over and above the compensatory welfare benefits according to their own figures, which we do not accept; £918,000 of this £3,818,000 is sheer profit from the subsidies.  Of the other £3,000,000, £1,000,000 is proposed to go to certain undisclosed schemes added to the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, but there is a sum of £2,000,000 to be given towards sickness, unemployment and old age.</P>
    <P>I am told that these are the main causes of expense under social insurance. I want to get those figures.  I want them to be divided under special headings, and I want to get the picture clear that the bread and flour <Col N="2088" /> tax will pay for, say, unemployment and that the butter tax will pay for sickness.  The other taxes, between them, will pay for old age pensions. After that is provided for there is £1,000,000 over for undisclosed benefits.  Also taken out of these taxes and over and above that the Government have £918,000 sheer profit on the subsidies.  That is what Deputies are voting for.  Deputies are trying to put across the people of this country a Social Insurance Bill, but they are not saying to the people: &ldquo;We are getting it back on the food. We are taking a bit off the loaf and something off the spread.  We are giving you less sugar in your tea and we are making you drink less and smoke less.  That is the way in which we are going to provide you with this scheme of insurance proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from that there is the beer, the tobacco and the spirits tax&mdash; £3,800,000.  The Government's idea is that they are going to get that money. Between that and their net gain on the subsidies there is a sum of £12,750,000, and where is that going to come from.  Do not let anybody, as I said before, think that these taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco are intended to get people off drinking or smoking. If they do that, to any great extent, the Budget is burst.  The truth is that it is hoped that people will still drink and smoke as they did before, because that £12,000,000 has to be found somewhere. £8,800,000 has be found somewhere. The housewife is going to be forced to save something out of the worker's pay packet; she will have to economise on the children's food, education or clothes; she will have to make rigid economies in the matter of domestic appliances.  That £12,750,000 has got to be found by means of the extra cost of food and by other economies which the housewife will be forced to make in order that her husband can smoke and drink nearly as much as before and, in addition, pay more for them.</P>
    <P>I am amused when I hear questions put down by Deputies as to the number of unemployed in the country at the moment, and asking by how much the number has gone up since a special <Col N="2089" /> date.  We are told that the number is 12,000 more than it was this time last year.  The Minister says the same is happening in England, and that they have a big rearmament programme. The Minister should say: &ldquo;If we have not another 24,000 unemployed before the end of the year, the Budget needs unemployment, short time and a bit of emigration.  The Budget hopes for a business depression.  There are businesses at the moment that are not making the wages they are paying to the employees.  However, they are keeping on the employees in the hope there will be an improvement in the situation.  The Budget requires unemployment and depression in business, because that is the only way in which they can prevent people buying at the rate at which they have been buying before and causing this terrifying gap in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>On the other side the British Budget was criticised on the grounds that it was an attempt, as the phrase was used, to purge out the national economy by deflation, bankruptcy and unemployment.  That is the phrase used in the British Commons, &ldquo;purging out the national economy by deflation, unemployment and bankruptcy&rdquo; yet the Budget there was nothing like as harsh as the Budget here.  One of the last books on monetary matters that has been produced, a book called <i>International Economic Co-operation</i>, written by a man called Tew, says in the earlier pages: &ldquo;Even a mild local depression in itself is an appreciable corrective to any cash outflow&rdquo;&mdash;that is a gap in the balance of payments&mdash;&ldquo;because unemployed workers or impoverished businessmen are poor customers.&rdquo;  Of course, that is what we want here under this Budget scheme.  We want poor customers and if there is a business slump, in its early stages called a recession, and if there is unemployment and if there are people on short time they will have no money to play around with and they will not cause any strain and we will get our economy purged out in this way.</P>
    <P>I said recently that anybody who caught the mood in which this present <Col N="2090" /> Budget had been framed realises that the remedial measures are simple. They have been calculated by the Central Bank and checked by all other bankers in the country.  The remedial measures are simple but they are savage in their severity.  It is deplorable that this savagery should be tried in this country at a time when it is completely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Then we have the contrast of the dance hall proprietors.  The dance hall proprietors are going to get this £140,000 on the grounds that it was a bad tax to collect.  It cost an awful lot to collect and the revenue officials who had the odious job of collecting it were subjected to a certain amount of abuse and had to interrupt the enjoyment.  It also was a very bad tax because it encouraged people to be rogues.  They did not declare the true return, as if every income-tax payer did.  In addition to that we were told it was a failure and the final plea was made that the poor proprietors could hardly live.</P>
    <P>All these excuses were to hide the fact that Miss Kathleen Morris, the secretary of the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association, wrote a letter to which she attached a letter from Mr. Seán Lemass of 10th May, 1951.  Having referred to this letter she went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Following the receipt of this reply from Mr. Lemass, a further executive meeting was held to-day, the 15th instant, when the meeting confirmed their pledge of support to Fianna Fáil.  It will be appreciated&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is ironic&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the association is entirely nonpolitical, and that having failed utterly to impress the previous Government or Minister for Finance, though it pointed out the hardships&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;It was at this point that the handkerchiefs were taken out&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;caused to the ballroom business, to clubs hiring the ballrooms, musicians, staffs, etc., the association has no alternative but to support the Party who has indicated that they are prepared to repeal this tax as soon as it is practicable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> The association has decided that the support to Fianna Fáil should take the form of substantial financial help and also that all members both city and country should lend a hand in every possible direction to secure the return to power of the one Party who has given the association an indication that they, as a Party, are opposed to this undesirable entertainment tax on dances.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that in order to have the desired effect our financial aid must of necessity be generous. I may mention that one leading commercial ballroom in Dublin has headed the list of subscribers to this fund, with the generous sum of £250, and other members of the executive have also indicated their willingness to subscribe very generously.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the reason why the dance tax was removed and not any nonsense about a philosophy on entertainment. These people supported Fianna Fáil.  I do not know what the subscription amounted to but £250 was not a bad start off if it was not a decoy.  However, I understand the fund did amount to a respectable sum.  So, in this year of austerity £140,000 is remitted to the dance hall proprietors.</P>
    <P>Let me briefly deal with the so-called objection in regard to the cost of collection of the tax.  I was informed and it was stated in this House that the cost of collection did not amount to 2 per cent. and that bore favourable comparison with the collection expenses of other taxes that are still being imposed.  With regard to the question of abuse to which the revenue officials were subjected, when I made certain remissions which excluded the operation of the tax in certain areas the revenue officials were quite happy about the matter.  With regard to the tax failing so far as the amount returned was concerned, far from that being the case, the amount in the early stages was £100,000.  Last year it was £120,000.  This year it is £140,000.  The tax was yielding everything that was expected of it and it was easy to collect.  When I met the dance hall proprietors&mdash;it was one of <Col N="2092" /> the last meetings I had before the last Budget I introduced&mdash;they wept about their own private fortunes.  I suggested that there was an answer for them.  If they would let me consult the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps the matter could be settled.  The returns of the group in which the dance hall proprietors were included showed a remarkable buoyancy during the last two or three years.  The dance hall proprietors then made the point that it might be the people running cinemas and other entertainments.  I told them there was an easy way out of that because we could get, with their leave, but only with their leave, the returns of the dance hall proprietors segregated.  After a very short huddled conversation they decided it would not be possible to go into that.  That is the situation about the dance tax.  It was a good tax.  It was easy to collect and when it is now remitted it is not going to mean cheaper dances.  It is going to mean more profits to the proprietors and that is the clear intention of such remission.  As I said before it is an open scandal, it smells badly and nobody wants to be associated with it except those who are going to be driven into the Lobbies to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of the tobacco manufacturers I made a wrong calculation in regard to that.  I understood the Budget was only going to give them the equivalent of 1d. a packet which we used to count as yielding £1? million in a full year. I understand they have got the 1d. already and they are going to get another 1d.  That means they are going to get £2.6 million.  This is a tidy sum to pass over to one group without an explanation beyond a phrase in the Budget that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was convinced that the tobacco manufacturers required this sum as against increased costs.  In this connection I would like to point to this contrast.  One of those groups benefiting in this way belongs to the Imperial Tobacco Company.  The last dividend they declared was 32 per cent. <Col N="2093" /> They apologised to their shareholders that they did not get back to the 35 per cent. which was their usual; but the tendency was good, the prospects were bright and they hoped one of these days to be able to declare a 35 per cent. dividend.  These are the miserable people, like the dance hall proprietors, to whom it has been decided to hand over huge sums of money while the ordinary people must endure heavy taxes on their foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>Another matter which caused a great deal of hysteria was the suggestion I made that if money was required&mdash;it might not be necessary to go to this point&mdash;there is one great volume of money which should be driven out and made face the Revenue Commissioners, and that was the money that has been held on deposit in banks not having paid tax, money in the main which has been illegally got and money which certainly, whether it was illegal or not, has evaded the law because tax has not been paid on the amount of it. That was a device adopted by the last Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer before the Conservative Government took office.  Mr. Gaitskell introduced it and although he did not mention it in the Budget speech he introduced it in a phrase in the Finance Act and the bankers in England raged over it. Apropos my proposals about asking the banks to give information as to money held on deposit on which tax had not been paid Mr. MacEntee had said that Mr. MacBride, who was according to Mr. MacEntee in touch with Moscow, had wired to Joseph Stalin to say: &ldquo;It is all right, McGilligan is with us&rdquo;&mdash; because I had proposed this simple tax which the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer in England had implemented and which a Conservative Chancellor has carried on.</P>
      <P>I quote from the <i>Economist</i> of the 5th May of last year under the heading of &ldquo;Breach of Bank Secrecy.&rdquo;  The Minister ought to take notice of this. There are a few phrases he might wish to copy:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Much concern has been aroused in banking circles at the proposal in the Finance Bill to empower the tax <Col N="2094" /> authorities to demand from the banks the returns of all interest payments made or credited, without deduction of tax, for amounts of £15 or more in any specified year, and the names and addresses of the individual recipients.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they went into this fume as the Minister did here last week:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The traditional principle that a banker's dealings with his customers should be strictly confidential has always been guarded as jealously as though it were one of the essential freedoms&mdash;and, indeed, it can well be argued that it is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did you ever hear the like of that? The secrecy of bankers is as sacred as the secrecy of the private house or the freedom from arrest of the individual. It is one of the essential freedoms.  I hope we will write it into the next conference that sits at Geneva.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If bank accounts were open to scrutiny by Government officials at will, the door to the police State would be opened very wide indeed. In the past, Governments have respected this principle; in particular, it was carefully and deliberately preserved in the Bank of England nationalisation Act, in the course of the debates upon which Dr. Dalton was constrained to accept an appropriate delimitation of the new power given to the Treasury to &lsquo;request&rsquo; information from the banks.  Desirable though it is to take all reasonable steps to check tax evasion, this is not a sufficient ground for breaching a principle of such significance. Any breach at all would be bound to ease the way for possible future intrusion for less desirable purposes. Mr. Gaitskell should think again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Gaitskell did not think again.  Mr. Gaitskell was eventually removed from office and Mr. Butler followed him and Mr. Butler has not thought again about it.  The tax is still maintained.  The Conservative Government is backing it and the Northern Ireland Government is backing it.  They both had the same reason for it, that they found it so valuable.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners in England had not very <Col N="2095" /> often to exercise their power requesting information.  The mere fact that there was power that these accounts should be disclosed drove everybody out to make voluntary disclosures in the hope of avoiding what are called Revenue Commissioners' penalties.  The scheme is still in operation in England and Northern Ireland.  Does any body of economists keep writing about that as a breach of banking secrecy?  In fact, it was discovered that there was so much money to be got from those who had not paid the tax that nobody had any sympathy with the rogues who were really the people affected by this tax and it eased the burden on the honest taxpayer.  I suggested that there might be some device of that sort and the retort I drew from the Minister was a two column one winding up with the statement that Deputy MacBride was in touch with the Bolshies, that things were happy, and that I was with him on this matter about banking secrecy.  I wanted to emphasise that.</P>

      <P>I suppose there will be a Red Chancellor one of these days. I am glad to get the Minister's reaction to it.  It shows that he has the mood of all those stodgy economists last year.  They have thought better of it, however.  They are now glad to accept the benefits of the tax and nobody has any sympathy with the people who have been made to disgorge their secret means and pay their taxes on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there has been so much talk about the Central Bank directors it is better that something should be said in their favour.  Various colleagues of mine have been blamed for the establishment of that bank as we left it. We did not get many opportunities of making changes, but we did not avail of such opportunities as we got to make many changes.  I think I made only one change in the personnel of the Central Bank.  I want it to be clear in regard to my colleagues, in case there is blame to be imputed, <Col N="2096" /> that it was mainly my proposal that the Central Bank should be kept constituted as it was.  In so far as there were objections to individuals, I believe it was my own personal interposition which, very much against their will, overcame their objections and got them to agree to the reappointment of certain people.  If there is any blame to be attached to it, I will take it.  I put them back and I did it for the reasons stated.  I see no horror in the Central Bank.  There is a group of men there who are very experienced.  They have experience in different lines.  They are taken from different areas.  They are men of the greatest possible experience in the respective lines which they are supposed to represent.  They are people of experience who have given great service to the State.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of work has to be done through the Central Bank other than writing the report and you must have a body to do it.  There is highly technical work to be done and there were highly technical expert people doing it.  I personally had no trouble about it, except in one point that I mentioned before the Minister came in.  I had no horror of the Central Bank directors.  We had tested them out for a certain number of years.  We were accustomed to that type of report. Incidentally, I do not think they have authority to issue a report.  We were accustomed to the type of thing put up.  If I thought there was any weakness in myself to succumb to their persuasion, I know that my colleagues would not let me succumb to it.  In these circumstances, I could not see any horror accruing from the people who were there for so many years being allowed to carry on their expert work as before.</P>
    <P>I never envisaged a change of Government.  I never envisaged that there would be a weak person like we have at present in the Department of Finance who would yield to what these people said, break a tradition of about 15 years, and pay any attention to the reports of the Central Bank.  That is what happened.  So far as that did happen and so far as I am responsible at least for putting this country in the <Col N="2097" /> danger that the Central Bank report might be accepted, I suppose I am to blame.  But think of the other side.</P>
    <P>Supposing a change had been made in regard to the Central Bank, the whole institution and its personnel. First of all, one would be missing a certain help that should be got from certain people expert in certain lines. There would be public anxiety and confusion caused by changes, particularly when a new financial policy was adopted.  I thought it was much better to allow those people who did not like that policy to write themselves out once a year, always subject to this, that if they wrote too aggressively, I would not let them have the last word. I would take the public platform in order to give my view of what they had written as they had an opportunity of giving their view on what I was saying.  If there had been changes, there might have been great public clamour and anxiety caused and I think people would have suspected that there was a weakness in the financial policy which we were adopting, something which could not bear examination and, therefore, that we had decided to get rid of those people.  It was properly decided to allow the institution to stay and, in the main, to make no change. The &ldquo;cheap-jack&rdquo; suggestion has been made that if I thought so strongly as I expressed myself about the Central Bank, why did I not change it?  I say that you cannot change the banking situation suddenly, more particularly in its relationship with English banking. It can only be done openly before the public and with the public being enlightened at every turn on the proposed changes and the reasons for the changes.  Otherwise, very great harm could be done to the whole structure of credit on which banking is done in this country.  To try and change the Central Bank Act&mdash;which should be changed and which will be changed, I hope, over a period of years&mdash;will take years and, in addition, it will take many years to disentangle the situation which has grown up under that.</P>
    <P>Just think of the position which would be created if we prohibited the circulation of English bank notes in <Col N="2098" /> this country at the moment and if the whole investment portfolio of the banks had to be re-made.  It cannot be done speedily.  It has to be done over a number of years to enable the people to change over&mdash;to liquidate one type of security and convert it to another.  I should like it to be done openly, with a good deal of public enlightenment, over a period of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The kicks which I have aimed at Deputy MacBride draw groans from the Minister.  Either I have a bad aim or a long reach.  There is this, however, to be said about the Central Bank and the joint stock banks of this country.  They have an investment policy which certainly is open to a very serious criticism.  I discussed this matter with some of the people of the Central Bank but so far I have not got an answer.  I think that, some year, the Central Bank could use the occasion of their annual report to do so.  They used the opportunity one year to explain why they think it necessary to get 100 per cent. liquidity in regard to the resources they have for the backing of the note&mdash;all in British securities.  What prudence requires that extent of caution?  They know that that matter has been agitating <Col N="2099" /> the mind of the public for years and yet they prefer to write a lot of things about Government policy instead of defending their own policy.</P>
      <P>For some reason, I do not know whether it is a matter of suspicion, the Central Bank has ceased to send me, as a Deputy, what they used to send me, namely, the quarterly bulletin.  I understand that colleagues of mine have also failed to get it.  It may be that they think they are giving us too much information.  When we met the bankers in 1949, one of our points was that they had an investment portfolio which in those days amounted to £183,000,000, £13,000,000 of which was invested in this country, less than £8,000,000 in Government securities and about £5,000,000 in other securities.  Surely it is unparalleled in the world that the banks of a State, with something like £200,000,000 to invest, had only £8,000,000 plus £5,000,000&mdash;£13,000,000 in all&mdash;invested in the whole country from which they were drawing all their resources and profits.  Even the mention of it has created some improvement.  In the past few years the £13,000,000 has gone up by £3,000,000, £4,000,000 or £5,000,000. That is a very small improvement. That is a situation that ought not be allowed to last.</P>
      <P>I want to contrast the situation in this country as it was affected by inter-Party policy for three years and the situation which has been effected in this country by less than 12 months of Fianna Fáil government.  It is difficult to get phrases but if I use the expressions misery, unemployment, fear of unemployment, lack of confidence, slump in business, thoughts turning to reliefs and the provision of unemployment money, does it not give a general picture of the country's situation as it is now?  There is fear of unemployment where there is no actual unemployment. There is fear of a great business slump where there is a mild recession at the moment and the Budget indicates that we are paying more attention to reliefs and unemployment moneys than to production and investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only difficulty we would have in <Col N="2100" /> resuming Government in this country would be with regard to the capital side.  The present Government have certainly done very serious harm to this country by spending in one go £26,000,000 of their counterpart moneys which we had, on a programme, arranged to help to pay out year by year to supply whatever deficiency there was between the moneys we required for capital development and what we could secure from small loans invested in the Government Departments' funds and from appeals to the people.  The counterpart money is gone and it cannot be built up again. There are other resources and these will have to be tapped.  What they are will be revealed in good time.  But that, undoubtedly, will be a handicap to any Government that will take over from the present Government.</P>
    <P>In our time we had full employment as far as that could be achieved in this country.  People enjoyed good wages. We had gone on a policy of trying to develop the productivity of this country to get an outcropping particularly on the export side.  In 1947, exports and re-exports from this country had not touched the £40,000,000 mark.  In 1951 they were at £81,000,000. In the first three months of 1951, they were £16,000,000, being one-fifth of the total for the year.  In the first three months of this year, they were £22,500,000.  If that proportion of one-fifth is maintained during the year it seems that exports will be at the total of £112,500,000 this year.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me to throw off the £12,500,000 to make the calculation more exact.  The exports will have touched the £100,000,000 mark. If that situation is achieved I think that, mainly, the trouble about the balance of payments will have been satisfied and ought to disappear.  That was a situation we aimed at bringing about and we had not very much time in which to achieve it.  It did not sink.  The policy was obviously going to fructify so speedily that it was to get exports from something less than £40,000,000 to a promised £112,500,000 this year&mdash;call it £100,000,000.  In addition, we wanted high levels of exports.  Only if you have a high <Col N="2101" /> level of export can you get a high level of imports and only on a combination of both can you get a high standard of living which we thought it was possible for our people to achieve and which we wanted to make them achieve.  In addition, we hoped to achieve, in the investment of moneys at home, such an increase in the national income and the wealth of the country that taxes at a certain level would yield more revenue.  They would at least yield such revenue as would pay for the cost of the borrowed moneys.  We entered upon that policy in 1948.  At that time we could only estimate, forecast and hope.  It is now possible to look back.</P>
    <P>The general tax revenue in 1948-49 was £62,000,000 odd.  In 1951-52 it was £73,000,000.  I am leaving out the nontax revenue.  Tax revenue was up £11,000,000 in four years.  It is undeniable that during that period the inter-Party Government was occupied in reducing the rates of tax. Yet we were getting that increased revenue.  Let me take a more significant thing.  I gave many alleviations to income-tax payers and reduced the tax by 6d.  Income-tax yielded £14,664,000 in 1948-49.  Last year it yielded £18,750,000.  The income-tax yield was up by £3,000,000.  The estimate given was that 6d. off would result in a loss of £1,000,000 but instead of losing the yield went up from £14,500,000 to £18,750,000.</P>
    <P>The estimate for next year, on the old level of taxes, is that income-tax will yield £19,300,000.  It has gone up by some £1,500,000.  The national debt charges in the year 1948-49 in interest and sinking fund amounted to £3,500,000.  In 1951-52, interest and sinking fund amounted to £6,100,000, the difference being something less than £2,500,000.  The yield in income-tax was more than enough to give that increase in the cost of the service for the national debt.</P>
    <P>These people talk about borrowing and extravagance.  They tell us that the national debt service next year will be £8,179,000.  They are going to jump £2,000,000 in one year.  We only succeeded in jumping £2,500,000 in four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" /> I suggest that those figures bear out what we contended and what we hoped would happen.  We felt if the old rates of tax would yield sufficient revenue that the surplus would provide the cost of paying the moneys we borrowed. If we take the cost of the national debt as equivalent to that it is up by £2,500,000.  The national revenue is up by £11,000,000 odd.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we achieved success in the two aims we had.  Imports and exports rose.  We have stabilised revenue at a high point because there is so much wealth and so much productivity in the country.  That, in four years, was no mean achievement.  It is something we will have to bring home to the people and put it in opposition to this picture of misery, unemployment and slump.</P>
    <P>A notice appeared in the papers recently to the effect that the day of reckoning was near and that on the 4th July rationing would end and that at that time the new prices would come into operation.  It is worth while recording what the new prices are. The price of the 2-lb. loaf will be increased from 6½d. to 9½d.; flour will be increased from 2/8 to 4/9½d. a stone; tea will go up from 2/8 to 5/- per lb.; sugar will be increased from 4½d. to 6½d. and butter will be increased from 3/- to 3/10 per lb.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the Minister for Social Welfare was anxious to-day to get the Social Security Bill through as quickly as possible to have something to play off against these increases when they come into operation on the 4th July.  I would like, through the papers and this House, to utter this one word of advice to the people of the country.  They are told that on the 4th July next rationing will cease. I hope nobody will be foolish enough to dispose of a ration book because when these subsidies come to be given again, if there are no ration books in existence, there will be a great delay in getting the subsidies properly resumed and people would put upon themselves a burden.  If the ration books were destroyed the ration could not be determined.  I would appeal to the community that the 4th July <Col N="2103" /> is not such a vital determining day. There will be a change and for the change they must keep their ration books.  If they do not do that there will be a great deal of difficulty in resuming the subsidies as we intend to resume them.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a Budget of despair. It is even worse than that.  It is a Budget that has been framed in ignorance of what the true circumstances of the country are.  It is framed without any belief in the resiliency of the people of the country and the strength of the economy of the country which was built up during the past four years.  It is a Budget that cannot bear examination.  That will be shown by the way in which the Deputies opposite have been taking a hiding.  Since the Budget came along they dare not appear before their constituents.  The only hope they have is to postpone the election long enough for the people to forget what this Government had in store for them and what the previous Government had in store for them.</P>

      <P>I recall the day upon which this Budget was introduced.  I happened to be walking along the corridor of the House when I met, emerging from the House, an ashen faced Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I said to him: &ldquo;What do you think of this production of your Minister?&rdquo;  He said to me: &ldquo;The spree is over.&rdquo;  Those were the words of wisdom that he had to offer upon this Budget the financial motion in connection with which we are discussing here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this debate I have noticed that you have got to keep a <Col N="2104" /> very close watch upon the meaning of words when you are listening to Fianna Fáil Deputies because words tend to lose their meaning when coming from the mouths of Fianna Fáil supporters. Everybody except the most virulently injected of the Fianna Fáil Party in this country agrees that this is a brutal Budget, but so far as the Fianna Fáil henchmen are concerned it becomes an honest Budget.  Brutality becomes honesty in the mouths and in the minds of Fianna Fáil.  As I say, we have, in the course of listening to this debate, to keep in mind the true meaning of words.</P>
    <P>Certainly this debate has provided us with examples of the most spectacular political cart-wheeling that has ever been indulged in here.  Those of us who listened with interest last night to Deputy Captain Cowan cannot but be astounded and at a complete loss to understand just how he can justify himself to himself, let alone to his constituents.  Deputy Captain Cowan in my view is personally a very decent man, but he appears to have developed in the last 12 or 18 months a form of political schizophrenia&mdash;it cannot be described as anything else&mdash;and that malady is fast driving him to his own political destruction.</P>
    <P>It is an amazing thing that anybody who professes to be interested in the position of the ordinary people here could get up here and try to prove that in voting for the Budget and for this Finance Bill which makes the Budget possible he is doing a favour to the working people and is, in fact, following through the policy of James Connolly. That is something that is quite beyond my comprehension and surely beyond the comprehension of any person who has ever even glanced through any of the writings of James Connolly. When Deputy Captain Cowan is presumptuous enough to deliver lectures to all the Parties here as to what their conduct should be in certain circumstances it is something that becomes merely a ridiculous performance and something that can never be taken seriously.  He is listened to for the sake of the laughs he will provide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan spent a great deal of time talking about the obligations which, in his view, lie upon the <Col N="2105" /> trade union movement to discharge its obligations by demanding higher wages for the workers who, according to him, are underpaid.  Does that not come strangely from the man who walked into the Lobby with the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party and voted against the simple proposition that agricultural workers should receive £4 per week?  There is there all the difference between the spoken word and the action that we come across so often within the confines of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan, Deputy Corry and some other Deputies tried to justify in their own weak fashion the removal of the bread subsidy. Deputy Captain Cowan stated that when he was going around canvassing during the last election he and his helper came across&mdash;presumably outside the flats down in Ballybough or some other parts of his constituency&mdash; a cart upon which there was a load of bread which was being brought to feed pigs.  Deputy Corry was on a similar mission down in Cork.  He said that he saw a neighbour of his regularly carrying bread from Cork City to feed greyhounds.  These are the reasons they are now advancing in support of their proposal to remove the subsidy on bread and make bread for the workers half as dear again as it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man yesterday who has a family of nine children.  He told me he earns about £6 10s. per week.  He told me his wife at the moment spends almost 30/- per week on bread alone. The increase after the 4th July will add almost a further 15/- to that man's bread bill.  He, like every other family with whom I have discussed the question both in the urban and in the rural areas, calculates that the so-called compensations in the nature of increased children's allowances will do no more than meet about 50 per cent. of the extra cost that will accrue in respect of the removal of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>No matter what may be said by Fianna Fáil apologists and no matter how they may try to justify it, the Budget will result and is already resulting <Col N="2106" /> in a reduction of the standard of living of the entire community, more particularly a reduction in the standard of living of the people in the lower income brackets, the only people who give a real contribution towards the welfare and progress of the nation. The Budget does not matter to those who are well to do and blessed with plenty of this world's goods.  It does not matter to them what the price is of bread, butter, tea or sugar.  It does not matter to them if the price of the ordinary pint goes up.  They do not drink pints.  They do not have to.  It does not matter if whiskey is increased in price, or cigarettes.  They can well afford the increase.  The ordinary agricultural worker and the city worker who are already feeling the pinch in relation to their simple pint and already being forced to reduce their consumption of cigarettes and tobacco are facing the prospect and the problem of how in the name of providence they will provide for their families after 4th July.</P>
    <P>It is a problem that many Deputies would not like to have to solve.  I am quite certain the Minister for Finance, even if he had the advice of all the experts of his Department, would not be able to tell us how the ordinary worker in the city, earning from £6 to £6 10s. per week, with a family of from four to ten children, and the agricultural worker, earning from £3 to £3 15s. per week, with a family of six or seven children, or even more, will live.  It does not seem to worry the Minister.  In his opinion, the important thing is to get figures into certain columns, and it does not matter what happens to the people in the process.  The lack of humanity displayed by the farmers of this Budget is something that can only be marvelled at, for it is something that cannot be understood.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking on this Bill he had the rapt attention of the Minister for External Affairs. Practically all of his speech was devoted to an attempted justification of the removal of the dance tax.  He made a couple of puerile jokes in an effort to kill time and pad out his speech.  He referred to jazz on one occasion, but <Col N="2107" /> I was looking at the adoring glance of the Minister for External Affairs fastened on the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Finance talking about a jazz tune at the time, and it struck me that nothing could be more appropriate than the recital of the old jazz classic, &ldquo;Frankie and Johnnie were Lovers.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan has revealed and exposed something that needed to be exposed regarding the removal of the dance tax, that it was part of a disreputable bargain, and no excuse made by Fianna Fáil will conceal that.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is becoming a very obvious feature of our economic condition. The trend towards widespread unemployment started around the middle of last year and in certain rural areas now men are finding it impossible to get work whereas previously under the administration of the inter-Party Government they had little or no difficulty in finding work.  In County Meath alone 1,400 men were employed on one Works Act operation by the county council up to last year.  There are 500 now and 900 men are finding it impossible to get any alternative employment. They cannot even obtain employment with farmers, so the only thing they can do is to get travel permits for themselves and go to Britain.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in the City of Dublin.  The building trade is travelling fast down the hill for a slump.  A number of houses had been planned some years ago but Dublin Corporation do not visualise building the required number this year.  Men who found adequate employment on building schemes during the lifetime of the inter-Party Government are now signing at the labour exchange.  Any Deputy, whether he be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Clann na Poblachta, in the City of Dublin knows these facts well.  Every day we get representations from workers&mdash;skilled, unskilled, semi-skilled, workers of all kinds who have been laid off from some form of employment&mdash;asking us to find them some other employment. You cannot get it for them; it is not <Col N="2108" /> there; no attempt has been made by the Government to provide it.</P>
    <P>What will the condition of unemployed workers be when the food subsidies are removed on 4th July? What chance will they have in the coming months of supporting themselves and their families when they cannot get a job?  It has been truly said here this morning&mdash;and those of us who have been observing the policy of Fianna Fáil over the years, and particularly the influence of the mind of the Minister for Finance over the years know it&mdash;that they believe in that condition of things.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Finance believes that, to have a healthy economy, you must have unemployment.  The answer given to me by an obscure Fianna Fáil Deputy on the day of the Budget sums up very crudely the entire attitude of Fianna Fáil towards unemployment. When the inter-Party Government was in power there was comparatively full employment, but that was a spree according to Fianna Fáil; it should not be done; it was wrong; the people were not entitled to live well or to be in full employment.  With that mentality now in control of the country's affairs, with that condition of mind, the outlook for the country is indeed a pitiable one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy, Parliamentary Secretary, referred to the problem of the big group of unemployed in the textile industry.  That industry is one in which part of my constituency has a vital interest.  The town of Balbriggan is in a condition of absolute chaos through this textile slump.  No steps apparently are being taken by the Government to bring back into employment the boys and girls, men and women, of Balbriggan town, which depends entirely on the textile industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan, in the course of some interruption when other speakers were contributing to the debate, said in effect that to criticise this Government was letting the nation down.  Letting the nation down to criticise the impositions of the Budget and the removal of the subsidies!  Of course, as I said at the outset, this is part of the political schizophrenia to which Deputy Cowan now seems to have become subject over the past 12 months. Twelve months ago he would have said the direct opposite.  There were no two more bitter political adversaries than himself and the Minister for Finance. There was nothing low enough, nothing bad enough, they could say about each other, but now we have the unnatural alliance of these two members of the House.</P>

The Budget has been discussed from every possible angle.  I do not think there is anything new that I could say on it.  I do want to avail of this opportunity, however, to say that we in the Labour Party do not believe that there was any need for this Budget.  We pledge ourselves to this, if returned to this House and if we have the power, to restore in their entirety the food subsidies.  We <Col N="2112" /> shall endeavour, as far as lies in our power, to resume the progress which was being made up to the time of the return of Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies know very well that the people are longing for the opportunity to go to the polls.  It is not just a matter of political bravado to say that we want an election.  No politician, I suppose, looks upon an election with any degree of pleasure.  There is no question, however, but that the people want it.</P>

That duty is to go to the people and ask them for their verdict as to whether we are doing right or wrong. (<i>Interruptions</i>).  No matter what may be said by Deputies across the House, it must be quite obvious to Fianna Fáil Deputies that the people seriously want an election.  If the Government, knowing that situation, would give the people an opportunity of expressing their views, I have no doubt in the world what the result of an election would be.  We have Fianna Fáil hanging on tenuously to power, helped by a few Independents.  That may go on for the rest of this year.  It will end, anyway, and it will be the end of the Government.  We are now moving into a new condition of affairs.  The old catch-cries will no longer fool the people as they used to do over the last 20 years.  That is a healthy thing.</P>

      <P>We had a very touching spectacle exhibited here this morning.  We had Deputy McGilligan returning good for evil.  It was a rather unexpected rôle for that Deputy to figure in, and he must have done so only under the most extreme compulsion.  We had him getting up and taking upon his shoulders the responsibility which Deputy MacBride, as a member of the late unlamented Coalition, was afraid to carry.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the touching spectacle and perhaps pathetic appearance of Deputy MacBride when he was being defended by Deputy McGilligan in regard to the actions of the late Government towards the Central Bank and the personnel of the board.  We know that Deputy MacBride has been having rather a rough time recently, because when he has been attacking the bank people have reminded him that, in so far as the governor of the bank is concerned and, I think, the majority of the members of the board, the Coalition bears a special responsibility. It reappoints the governor; it replaced at least one member of the board and reappointed others.  I am not citing that fact by way of criticism. If I had a criticism to make of the Coalition in so far as the personnel of the bank is concerned, I would have said it was regrettable that, out of political, partisan spleen, they displaced a leading industrialist from the West of Ireland and replaced him by another person.  I do not want what <Col N="2114" /> I say to reflect upon the competency of the Coalition's appointee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely say that it is the only criticism I have had.  But as I said before, Deputy MacBride has been having a rough time recently. Deputies in this House who were formerly members of his own Party had placed him in the pillory in regard to these appointments, and they have pointed out what is the obvious fact that Deputy MacBride's speeches are the speeches of a man who, in this matter as in many others, has no convictions. However, I suppose that Deputy McGilligan's somewhat backhanded defence of Deputy MacBride will give a great deal of pleasure to the governor and members of the Central Bank because he has justified the existence of the bank.  He has dilated upon the special qualifications of the governor and the members of the bank for the position which they hold.  He has told the country that they are highly expert in this business of public finance and the only thing he has said is that though they are experts and he is a lawyer he refuses to to take their advice, he refuses to hearken to it even though they speak without partisanship, even though they speak objectively in regard to the financial and economic position of this country and all the consequences as reflected in that position which have flowed from the policy of the late Coalition Government.  Deputy McGilligan, apparently, is a man who likes to consult the surgeon but treat himself or, as I think the more colloquial expression is, he likes to keep a dog and bark himself; though I would say in that regard during the past three years the loudest barker was the former Minister for External Affairs to whom Deputy McGilligan was only a pale little echo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the whole ground covered by Deputy McGilligan.  In the course of the speech which I wish to make dealing with perhaps the more important aspects of this debate, I may touch on <Col N="2115" /> some of the matters which he raised. There is one statement which he made last night to which I would like to give a complete rebuttal.  Deputy McGilligan, following the lead of Deputy Dillon, stated last night that this Government has lost £6,000,000 which was in the Grant Counterpart Fund, by reason of our failure to complete certain formalities in regard to that matter.  Both Deputies alleged in that connection that they had reached agreement, I think, in October, 1950, or in the autumn of 1950, with the E.C.A. administration as to how the moneys from this Grant Counterpart Fund were to be applied.  I wish to say that that statement is untrue. Tentative proposals in regard to the establishment of an agricultural institute and in relation to schemes for the more general utilisation of ground limestone were submitted by the Department of External Affairs before the change of Government to the E.C.A. mission in Dublin.  There is not a scintilla of fact in what we have in the statements which we have heard from those Deputies, but the E.C.A. mission said this: that it was no use expecting that mission (the mission to Washington) to deal with proposals piecemeal and that a comprehensive scheme would have to be submitted covering the whole of the Grant Counterpart Fund.  I can say categorically and, if necessary, the matter can be investigated by a committee of this House, that our predecessors did not submit the comprehensive proposals which the E.C.A. mission here informed them must be submitted before any question as to how this money was to be allocated between one scheme and another could be considered in Washington.</P>
    <P>It has been said also that because of this failure to complete a comprehensive scheme the money has been lost. There is not a word of truth in that either.  The whole of this sum is here in full in the Loan Counterpart Account.  We are submitting detailed, and carefully considered proposals for the allocation and utilisation of the whole sum and we are fulfilling what the E.C.A. told our predecessors they ought to do.  We are fulfilling the requirements <Col N="2116" /> which the E.C.A. told our predecessors were essential.  We are submitting comprehensive proposals to Washington, and I have no reason to doubt that those proposals will meet with the acceptance of the appropriate authority there.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the more fundamental issues in this debate, there are one or two announcements I should like to make so that the House may be aware of them when it comes to divide on the Bill.  The first is this: sub-section (5) of Section 13 of the Bill makes provision for deferment until 1st July next of payment of the duty on the tobacco stock held by tobacco manufacturers on 2nd April.  It was necessary to make this provision because the immediate effect of the increase in the excise duty might occasion hardship.  From representations which have been made, however, I am satisfied that the period allowed for payment is too short, particularly in the case of the smaller manufacturers.  I, accordingly, propose to extend the date by six months, to the 1st January, 1953.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, having made that announcement I may take occasion to contradict a statement which was made by Deputy McGilligan.  In this case Deputy McGilligan trotted after Deputy Corish, who alleged that provisions were included in this Finance Bill which would result in a substantial amount of money being handed over to the tobacco manufacturers. There is not a word of truth in that statement.  I shall deal with the matter later but I wish to put it on record straight away while Deputy McGilligan's statement is fresh in my memory.  The money being collected under Sections 12 and 13 of this Finance Bill will come into the Exchequer and will be used for the maintenance of the public services.  It is true that the tobacco manufacturers have received permission to increase the price of cigarettes.  The recommendation was, I think, originally made in the middle of last year that they should be permitted to increase the price of the cigarette by 2d. per packet of 20.  That recommendation was made by the Prices Advisory <Col N="2117" /> Body, the chairman of which was a former Fine Gael Deputy in this House, later a Fine Gael Senator, subsequently Attorney-General during Mr. Costello's Coalition Government, and translated from that post to the Bench of the Supreme Court.  I understand that he is a great personal friend of Deputy McGilligan's.  Seated side by side with him are two representatives of Labour&mdash;one from those unions which are affiliated with the Trade Union Congress, Deputy Larkin's association&mdash;and the other a representative of those unions which are associated in the Congress of Irish Unions.  There is also a businessman on the body and a person who was specially selected by Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, to deal with questions of flour and bread subsidy when those were under his control. This person was selected although he was an income-tax officer.  These five persons are the people who recommended that an increase of 2d. per packet of 20 cigarettes should be granted to the tobacco manufacturers. They made that recommendation, having examined the tobacco manufacturers' books and having heard evidence from the tobacco manufacturers and from other interested parties.</P>
    <P>Now the question is whether they were right or wrong in granting that increase.  That is the issue, and the only issue, that is raised by the statements of Deputy Corish and Deputy McGilligan.  Were these people right or wrong&mdash;this judge of the Supreme Court, this high civil servant who was specially chosen for the particular task by Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, this other person who might be a representative of the business community and the two persons representing the workers and the consumers generally?  Were they justified or were they not when they made that recommendation?  That is the net issue.  If they were wrong in making that recommendation and if it was improper to act on their recommendation, then it was improper for them to have made it.  What, in effect, is implied in the whole of these statements is that this justice of the Supreme Court and his colleagues in the Prices Advisory Body imposed an <Col N="2118" /> improper tax for some reason of their own.  Because they have had some personal axe to grind, as Deputy McGilligan has suggested, they decided to recommend increases in the price of cigarettes which, according to Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Corish, puts something of the order of £2.6 million into the coffers of the tobacco manufacturers.  Is that what the Opposition's friends have done; every member of the board, with one exception, was appointed by the previous Government on the special recommendation, among other things, of Deputy McGilligan and of Deputy Norton. Now that is the issue that is being raised in this House in this debate upon the Finance Bill, with which it has nothing to do; there is nothing in the Finance Bill that relates to that increase of 2d. per packet of 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that it is proposed to further extend the old age relief which is granted to persons who are existing on what is known as unearned or investment income.  The concession is a mild one, and it is proposed under it to raise the limit of £500 to a limit of £600.  That is so that the overriding income which will enable a person to get this concession in full must not exceed £600.  At the present moment it is £500.</P>
    <P>Having said all this, may I engage in a few brief reminiscences?  Twenty years ago, on May 11th, 1932, the then newly elected Fianna Fáil Government introduced its first Budget into this House.  That Budget initiated a social industrial and political revolution which gave to the people of this country the great housing schemes, the numerous industries, the wide range of social services which they enjoy to-day. Before that Budget was introduced&mdash;it is well for us to recall this, in view of some of the statements we have heard from the younger members of the Labour Party&mdash;old age pensions were payable at the rates to which they had been reduced by our predecessors, who then called themselves the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  That grave social injustice was ultimately redressed, and redressed with interest, by the Old Age Pensions Act of 1932, which Fianna Fáil introduced in <Col N="2119" /> Dáil Eireann on 21st April, 1932, within six weeks of taking office.  We almost paralleled that achievement last year when we brought in the Old Age Pensions Act, 1951, the Act which Deputy Norton could not get through this House when he was Minister for Social Welfare, but which Dr. Ryan had no difficulty in getting through when he became Minister for Social Welfare after the change of Government.</P>
    <P>That measure, the 1932 Old Age Pensions Act, was opposed by the present leader of the Fine Gael Party, who had been previously Minister for Local Government and Public Health in the old Cumann na nGaedheal Administration.  Old age pensions had been his particular charge.  I was about to say that he was the Minister responsible for bringing about the reduction in the old age pensions in 1923 or 1924, but I think I am wrong in that regard, and I let it pass.  However, I can say this, that our Bill of 1932 was opposed by the present leader of the Fine Gael Party, because I think Deputy Mulcahy is still leader of the Fine Gael Party, in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputies must get very clearly into their minds that when we have a condition of affairs where we are spending one-eighth of the whole taxable revenue upon old age pensions, that whatever margin of hardship there may be among the class looking for old age pensions, as a result of the legislation that exists at the present moment there cannot be very much hardship as regards old age pensions when we are spending one-eighth of our whole taxable revenue upon them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey is going into the Division Lobby side by side with the gentleman responsible for that statement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever hardship there is, certainly, in my opinion, does not warrant opening a door which is being opened by this particular measure here to bring in, on the old age pension list, every person over 70 years of age who can claim that he has no private income, no matter what his circumstances of living may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> We have been hearing a lot about the means test and about broken promises, but I remember reading Deputy Costello's address in the general election of 1951&mdash;I also read the address of 1948 where it also appeared&mdash;in which there was a categorical statement that Fine Gael, if elected to office, was going to remove the means test.  Here is a case where Deputy Mulcahy says that, even if a man has no private income, he should not be entitled to an old age pension, unless the circumstances of his home, the circumstances of his family are so penurious that he is entitled to claim public charity. Deputy Mulcahy said that and he is reported at column 36 of Volume 42 of the Official Debates.  I hope that Deputies of the Labour Party will appreciate these words.  In a little while, they will be jumping to Deputy Mulcahy's whip, obeying him as they have been obeying him ever since this Dáil. was elected, speaking when Deputy Sweetman gave them permission to speak and remaining, as Deputy Dillon told us, mute as mice when he bade them keep silent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say&mdash; if some Deputies will have the manners to listen&mdash;that the Budget of 1932, which I had the high privilege to introduce on behalf of the first Fianna Fáil Government, opened the way for providing our people with all these things. Without that Budget, this programme of social and economic development which was initiated and accomplished during the first 16 years in which Fianna Fáil held office could not have been attempted.</P>
      <P>Now I come to a pronouncement in regard to that Budget which I think is of particular relevance to this debate. How was that Budget received?  I am quoting again from Volume 42, column 1492, of the Official Debates. The Deputy whom I am quoting stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I said when this Budget was introduced that I thought, in respect of the principles on which it was founded, it was a good Budget.  I <Col N="2122" /> have heard nothing in the course of these debates to change my opinion. I repeat that I believe the principles upon which the Budget is founded are sound principles and principles which are calculated to promote the welfare of this State.  I do not think that any piece of legislation has encountered in the public Press a more extravagant barrage of misrepresentation than this Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He did not foresee 1952.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been trenchantly discussed by the Opposition but the criticism levelled against it here has been based upon its provisions. There is no doubt that, outside the House, it was deliberately sought to promote an atmosphere of panic.  It was deliberately sought to suggest that the considerable burdens which were laid upon the people by way of direct taxation in this Budget were calculated to have certain results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, who will say, having heard that passage, that history never repeats itself?  Here we are, just 20 years after, and in regard to another Fianna Fáil Budget brought in in similar circumstances to meet a similar situation it can truly be said that scarcely any piece of legislation has encountered &ldquo;in the public Press a more extravagant barrage of misrepresentation than this Budget.&rdquo;  Furthermore, &ldquo;there is no doubt that outside this House it was deliberately sought to suggest that the considerable burdens which were laid upon the people by way of direct taxation in this Budget were calculated to have certain results&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ask the Chair to forgive me.  I quoted the relevant volume and the column, but I have not given the speaker's name.  The speaker whom I have quoted is the Deputy who has crawled back, begging forgiveness from Deputy Mulcahy that he should ever have left his spiritual abode. He is the Deputy about whom many are asking whether he is the prodigal son or only the fatted calf, to be sacrificed&mdash;as he was during the emergency&mdash;as soon as Deputy Seán MacEoin elects once more to eject him. The speaker whom I have quoted was <Col N="2123" /> then an Independent member, elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time, and boasting that he served no Party but only the people.  The speaker, need I remind you, was no other than Deputy James Dillon.</P>
    <P>Mind you, that was not all that Deputy Dillon had to say in his virgin youth before evil associates had corrupted him.  He stated his reasons for supporting that Fianna Fáil Budget as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have, I think&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>speaking of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;realised their duty to the poor; they have, I think, realised their duty to Christian society by their housing policy; they have realised their duty to public health, and to the children of the poor in their resolve to provide milk under the scheme adumbrated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Local Government.  And to do that they had to raise extra revenue.  I went into the Lobby and endorsed their action in doing these things, and I would go into the Lobby again to make it possible to raise the revenue to do these things&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He is not going this time&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because there is not the least use coming here and telling the Government that they do right in spending an extra £270,000 on pensions, £100,000 on milk, £600,000 on housing and £250,000 on the relief of rates, and that it is wrong to raise the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we recall those words so aptly spoken in support of the Budget of 1932&mdash;and no less apt, I submit, when applied to this Budget of 1952&mdash;must we not deplore the great parliamentary talent since so misused and now so degraded that it has now no higher aim, no nobler purpose to serve and no better ambition than to outdo the contemptible buffoonery of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, the political love-child whom Deputy Dillon has foisted at last upon Fine Gael?</P>
    <P>Yet, despite the fact that the <Col N="2124" /> schizoid element in his personality has been responsible for weird divagations since that day when he supported the Fianna Fáil Government and voted for a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, posterity will be grateful to Deputy Dillon for his stout defence of the 1932 Budget.  We shall remember his words and it will be recorded on his political tombstone that once at least in this House he spoke for virtue and right.</P>
    <P>This earlier stand of Deputy Dillon side by side with Fianna Fáil for social progress and economic development must, I think, have been in the mind of Deputy Murphy from Clare when he spoke in this debate on Thursday last.  Perhaps it might not be out of place here to felicitate ourselves on the fact that in Deputy Dr. Hillery and Deputy Murphy, Clare has contributed to reinforce the debating power of Dáil Éireann.  Deputy Dr. Hillery's speech&mdash;which unfortunately was heard in a very thin House&mdash;in particular, manifested a freshness of outlook, a clarity of thought, and a power of expression which promises well for the future.  Deputy Murphy's speech&mdash;perhaps because he is an older man&mdash;was rather more in the old style of parliamentary oratory, but it was effectively delivered and pleasing to listen to.  It is quite true that he did not make the right points, and he may rather have depicted the picture as he would have liked it to be under Deputy Dillon than in fact it actually was.  When, however, the Deputy betrayed an admiration for Deputy Dillon, it was exceedingly difficult to reconcile that admiration with his own argument that &ldquo;money held abroad should be used to set up industries here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy, Deputy Dr. Hillery and the Taoiseach represent the people of Clare.  The latter two represent one section, while Deputy Murphy represents another section.  No doubt, the Fine Gael Deputy has also been in Ennis.  He must know, therefore, of an industry there which gives a considerable amount of employment.  He must know also how that industry was established under the aegis of Fianna Fáil, and how its establishment was opposed by the Fine Gael Party, which then, as now, headed the combined <Col N="2125" /> Opposition.  I wonder if Deputy Murphy knows that the spearhead of that attack upon this Clare industry, upon this Ennis concern, was his idol Deputy Dillon.  If Deputy Dillon had his way, the Braids Mill would not be working in Ennis to-day, and the 300 men and young women who are now earning a good living in that factory would have been driven abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that we might allow the proceedings on the Finance Bill to conclude without interrupting now for Questions.  I do not know what would be the view of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that Deputy Dillon had led the attack upon this industry, which had been newly established in Ennis.  Deputy Dillon made the attack upon it in the hope that it would be closed down.  That is what Deputy Dillon fought for and would have secured in 1937 if Fine Gael had defeated Fianna Fáil in the general election of that year.  I am perfectly certain that Deputy Murphy would not have wanted that at the time; that he would not wish Ennis to be without Braids to-day and that he would not want the 300 persons who are in good employment in that industry to be thrown out on the streets.  But that, I want to say, is what may happen in Ennis and in every other town in Ireland if we are unable to deal with this balance of payments problem.  If we cannot overcome our difficulties in that regard, factories may have to close down because we cannot get and will not be able to procure the dollars and hard currency to pay for the cotton and other raw materials which the Ennis factory, like other factories in this country, must have, if they are to keep going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, that is what we are fighting to prevent when we are facing up to this grave problem of the deficit on our balance of payments.  Let me repeat, if that problem is not solved, if we do not restore the balance between our exports and imports, visible and <Col N="2126" /> invisible, if we continue to realise our savings in order to balance our account for consumer imports, it will inevitably happen that we shall leave ourselves without the means to carry on and our industries will have to shut down for lack of raw materials, so that there will be widespread unemployment.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but we shall not even be able to pay for such wheat and other primary foodstuffs as we may have to import until Irish agricultural production is not merely restored to the 1938 level but, under this Government, raised far above it.</P>
    <P>If we do not solve this balance of payments problem, this will be our inevitable fate: we shall not be able to import raw materials which our industries require to keep them going; not only that, but we shall not be able to pay for the foreign foodstuffs which, after the disastrous Dillon régime, we must import in greater measure than since 1939 to feed our people.</P>
    <P>If we fail in our attack on this problem&mdash;I am repeating this statement so that everybody may know it and so that those who are criticising this Budget and criticising us because we are endeavouring in another sphere and another plane to deal with this balance of payments problem and so that every person in this House may know where he stands and what the country is facing&mdash;we shall have widespread unemployment, hardship and hunger.  Even in Ennis&mdash;I wish Deputy Murphy were here to listen to me&mdash;we shall have unemployment, hardship and hunger if Deputy Dillon has his way to-day, as we should have had unemployment and emigration if he had had it in 1937 when he did his utmost, as I have said, to close the door upon the newly-established concern of Braids.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Murphy would not stand for that but, if he does not, let him keep clear of Deputy Dillon who, even in this debate, has described Braids and other industrial undertakings, which were established under Fianna Fáil, as &ldquo;glorified relief works&rdquo;.  Well, relief works or not&mdash; and they are not relief works&mdash;glorified or not, they are providing the people of this country with employment and one of things that Labour Deputies <Col N="2127" /> will have to answer for to their constituents in certain towns and villages in Ireland is why did they support in the Division Lobbies in this House Deputy Dillon and other members of the Fine Gael Party who have been opposed to our whole idea of industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;certainly not&rdquo;.  I do not know whether it is worth while dealing with the Deputy, but I know a passage in a speech made in this House by Deputy Dillon in which he referred to Irish industrial development as a gangrene upon Irish economy, when he sneered at Arthur Griffith and Arthur Griffith's phrase that Ireland in the pre-Treaty days was like a man who had only one arm, and when Arthur Griffith outlined what should be the object of all Irish Governments&mdash;to provide the Irish people with two arms wherewith to feed themselves and to defend themselves, if necessary&mdash; Deputy Dillon took hold of that phrase of Arthur Griffith and referred to it here in this House in terms of contempt and said that, so far as he was concerned, he would regard the industrial arm, if it were ever developed, as a gangrene upon the Irish body politic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of industrial development, Deputy Murphy and other Deputies, I know, other honest Deputies, are poles apart from Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Murphy, in this debate, declared that Irish money should be used to set up industries here. Deputy Dillon does not profess to disagree with that to-day.  He dare not do that.  After the experience of 16 years of Fianna Fáil régime he dare not do that, but he did in the past disagree with that and, in his heart of hearts, he has never accepted that policy, the policy of bringing back moneys held abroad and using them to set up Irish industries here.  On Thursday, as I have reminded the House, he described as &ldquo;glorified relief works&rdquo; the Irish industries which were established in this country as a result of the incentives and inducements <Col N="2128" /> offered by the Fianna Fáil Government. Those industries, as we have them to-day, with all the employment which they are giving, represent in the main external assets which were realised by their owners and reinvested in the industries which Deputy Dillon, let me repeat again, regards merely as &ldquo;glorified relief schemes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Over the period from 1931, until war intervened, external assets were repatriated in a substantial way under Fianna Fáil and were reinvested in establishing industries in this country. The Opposition did not begin this policy of repatriation.  We repatriated the assets, but we repatriated them here in a capital form, in a form of plant and equipment and buildings. We did not repatriate those assets in a form of consumable goods, in the form of bread which has long been eaten, of tobacco which has long been smoked, of petrol which has long been used up.</P>
    <P>The individual owners of the assets which were repatriated under our programme did not realise them, nor did we compel the banks to realise them in order to pay for consumer goods like wheat, oats, maize, tobacco, petrol and petroleum products, goods on which, under the Coalition, most of the Marshall Aid loan was spent.</P>

      <P>Many of the people who had investments in foreign securities sold those securities and reinvested the proceeds in the newly-established cement factories, the newly-built beet-sugar factories, the new boot factories, clothing factories and the 100 or so other industries in which, over the period from the time Fine Gael left office until the outbreak of war in 1939, no less than 40,000 persons secured industrial employment for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> They did this because of the encouragement and incentives which, from the moment it took office, Fianna Fáil offered them to develop Irish industry.  Among those concessions was a very special one in respect of tax on investment income which was offered in the 1932 Budget to induce Irish investors to repatriate their external assets and reinvest their capital in new Irish industries.  When announcing this concession I said&mdash;the reference is Volume 41, column 1504:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With a view to encouraging our own citizens to invest their capital in Saorstát industry...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were then Saorstát Éireann before we established the new State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...we are, therefore, including in the Finance Bill a clause providing for an allowance for income-tax purposes of 20 per cent. in respect of dividends arising from subscriptions to any issue of capital made after the passing of the Bill by a Saorstát public company which satisfies certain conditions.  These will be, broadly, that the company's trade is carried on mainly in the Saorstát, that the company is managed and controlled in the Saorstát, and that the whole of the issue of the capital to which the concession applies is devoted either to the establishment of a new business or the extension of an existing business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Corish, in a demagogic attempt to mislead the people as to what is involved in the Finance Bill, alleged that under it a considerable sum would be given to tobacco manufacturers.  I have already explained to the House before Deputy Corish came in what body was responsible for this increase of 2d. on the standard packet of 20 cigarettes which is being given to the tobacco manufacturers.  Deputy Corish surely must have read the Finance Bill before he came to speak in this Second Reading debate.  He must have read Sections 12 and 13.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish is much too intelligent not to have understood the purport and intention of these sections. <Col N="2130" /> He is much too intelligent, therefore, not to know that there was not a scintilla of truth in the statement which he made here in so far as the Finance Bill is concerned.</P>

He must know that it will flow out of the Exchequer to defray the cost of the Social Welfare Bill, of the new increased children's allowances, of the increased old age pensions scheme, of the increases in the remuneration of the Civil Service, the Garda and the Army which were granted last year&mdash; but for which Deputy McGilligan and the Coalition made no provision.</P>

Deputy Corish must know all this but, instead of standing honestly on the facts, he prefers to mislead the public in regard to the position of the Irish tobacco manufacturers.  When, however, he is challenged on his own ground and he is compelled to admit that certain of these manufacturers, the Irish manufacturers, are in a grave position, he says he would help them in another way.  No doubt if we found some other way Deputy Corish would say he did not agree with that other way either, and still another would have to be found and so he would have us chasing our tails in an attempt to find some way of satisfying the purblind prejudice with which the Deputy and his Party regard all Irish industrialists.

      <P>Take, for instance, the Labour Party's attitude to the concession in regard to income derived from investment in new Irish industries, which was granted in the 1932 Budget, and to which I have referred.  One would have thought that the Party which protests that its first concern is to provide greater opportunities for employment in this country would have welcomed this concession with enthusiasm.  That was not their attitude, however.  If one could not say, in truth, that they were openly hostile to the proposal&mdash;they dared not be that&mdash;they certainly received it with coldness and covert hostility, which Deputy Norton, as reported in Volume 42, column 1427, expressed in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this section, dealing with preferential income-tax for Irish firms, there seems to be a belief implied that this will attract capital to Irish industries, and that that will result in an extension and development of our industries, and perhaps the employment of more people in them.  I am greatly afraid, like Deputy Blythe, that this is a step in the dark, and nobody can place any dependence that this development will take place.  I am greatly afraid that it is simply dissipating revenue which, if collected by the Exchequer and used on behalf of the community, would bring about much more tangible results to the community than the results which will accrue from a policy of that kind.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I am greatly afraid, like Deputy Blythe, that this is a step in the dark.&rdquo;  We all know the admiration with which Deputy Norton regards the British Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer.  He has not tried something like that.  That has not been tried in Great Britain and therefore it was, so far as we were concerned, a <Col N="2132" /> step in the dark, a novel step which had not been tried anywhere else.  We tried it here and it succeeded.  It did what we wanted.  It induced people who held investments in British industries and in British gilt-edge securities to realise those investments and bring them back and invest them in Irish industry in order to give employment to our people.</P>

      <P>I know, of course, that that concession did not appeal to Deputy Norton, but it was a very useful concession so far as the Irish investor was concerned.  It helped to overcome the doubts which were fostered in his mind by such statements as this &mdash;I quote from Volume 42 and column 1428, again from Deputy Norton&mdash; when we were just starting out to develop Irish industry here; when we were starting out to repatriate the Irish assets held abroad, to repatriate them in the form of capital goods that could be used to provide employment here and could be used reproductively to compensate this country for any loss of income derived from these foreign investments that had been realised.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the Deputy was telling us that these new industries we were initiating and which, in the course of years, were to provide employment for many thousands <Col N="2133" /> of our people, were back-room factories, kitchen factories and underground factories.  These were factories which, from the point of view of industrial development anywhere, were of a high level.  Here is what the Deputy had to say when we were taking this leap in the dark:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After all, when we come to examine the tariff policy, when we come to survey the whole industrial possibilities of the country, the plain fact remains that we are a small country, a sparsely populated country, and that so far we have not resident within the country the ingredients nor, so far as employers are concerned, the desire for any great industrial expansion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Faintheart!  If Deputy Norton had his way he would be like Deputy Dillon.  We would still be a one-armed man.  The policy of Arthur Griffith would still be very far from realisation and any industrial development would, in the mind of Deputy Norton, as in the mind of Deputy Dillon, be a gangrene in the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I know Deputy MacBride must show himself alive after the dressing-down Deputy McGilligan gave him this morning.  That quotation and a recollection of many other similar statements from the same sources leads me to say that if anyone believes Deputy Norton and certain other of his associates, such as Deputy Davin, were ever wholeheartedly in favour of repatriating external assets to establish industries in this country, they should read the debates between 1932 and 1939 and they will come to quite a different conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In questioning the proposals to offer incentives to Irish industries to risk their capital in Irish enterprise, Deputy Norton was supported in that debate, as he has been supported in this debate, by Deputy McGilligan, who declared that the new proposal introduced &ldquo;a very vicious principle&rdquo;: the statement will be found in column 1948.  Deputy McGilligan held that a <Col N="2134" /> rebate of 20 per cent. in income-tax derived from investments in Irish industry was a very vicious principle. That was the Deputy who declares that it would be a good thing for Irish industry and Irish economy generally if the officers of the Revenue Commissioners were permitted to go sniffing and snooping in a man's business and a man's till to find any money that might be lying about the house.  That was the statement that Deputy McGilligan made when we were speaking on the general Budget Resolution. However, it is all very well.  According to Deputy McGilligan, we can send our income-tax collectors into a man's house and compel him to open his safe and till.  But, in 1932, the proposal which I have mentioned of giving this inducement to people to bring back the money which they held abroad in order that they might invest it in Irish industries was virtually denounced by Deputy McGilligan as immoral on the grounds&mdash;I quote from columns 1984-5&mdash;that: &ldquo;It is seeking to draw into this country people whom one expects it would be impossible to draw into the country if they had a realisation of the true conditions or the conditions that are likely to operate here before the autumn is over.&rdquo;</P>

We had already decided that we were going to withhold from Great Britain the assets that were being expatriated by Deputy McGilligan's Government under the secret agreement of 1923 whereby £5,250,000 was being directed from this country and exported to Great Britain.

He was saying: &ldquo;Look out, boys.  Do not bring your money back.  There will be trouble in this country in the future.&rdquo; He said it was immoral to seek to draw into this country &ldquo;people whom one expects it would be impossible to draw into the country if they had a realisation of the true conditions or the conditions that are likely to operate here before the autumn is over&rdquo;.  He was telling the Irish person who had money invested abroad to keep his money abroad.  &ldquo;We are going to cause such a turmoil in this country that it would not be safe to bring it back home and reinvest it in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That was the purpose which Deputy McGilligan had in mind.  By his fearsome suggestions as to the future conditions in this country he was doing his utmost to defeat the aim of the concession.  As I have said, we were seeking to induce our citizens to bring back their liquid capital and invest it here.  Deputy McGilligan and his Party were doing their best to deter them.  Fortunately for this country they did not succeed in their aim.  The savings of the Irish people <Col N="2136" /> were increasingly invested in newly-established Irish industries&mdash;industries which were Irish in every sense of the word for they were Irish-owned and Irish-controlled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This tendency of investment continued over the years until not only were the annual savings of the people this invested but, in increasing measure from year to year, individuals who had capital invested abroad began to realise their foreign investments and to put their proceeds into the new Irish industries.  What were the consequences?  There were two consequences, one financial and the other political.  The financial consequence was that our net holdings of external assets began to decrease because our people were beginning to bring them back.  They were being repatriated in an orderly and sensible way, and invested in our industrial undertakings.  The foreign investments of individuals were being replaced by corresponding investments in Irish industry.  The assets were not being dissipated in the purchase of consumer goods.  Now, as I have said, that was the financial and economic consequence of our policy.  What was the political consequence?  As soon as this tendency began to manifest itself, how did Fine Gael react to this important economic development?  They have endeavoured in this debate and elsewhere to induce the people to believe that they have always been in favour of realising external assets and investing them here.</P>
      <P>The truth is that nothing could be further from the facts.  Let us hear Deputy Dillon who was then, as now, a Front Bench member of Fine Gael. Let us hear Deputy Dillon as he spoke a few years ago in June, 1939.  I am quoting from Volume 76, column 864, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the grimmest features of the present situation is that the banks' holdings and securities outside this country have been steadily <Col N="2137" /> dwindling.  The net external assets of the joint stock banks of this country began to dwindle three years ago and they have never stopped.  Up to last year they were dwindling slowly and steadily.  In the last six months they have begun to fall catastrophically, and the Minister for Finance knows it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I happened to be the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Dillon goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Remember this, that as they fall one of our most valuable invisible exports falls with them&mdash;the interest that we got on those investments from the countries where we had investments. Those external assets are to this country the same property as that which makes Great Britain wealthy in her own right.  What is it that makes Great Britain the greatest mercantile State in the world? What is it that gave her trade in all five Continents, and makes her to-day the only rival of the greatest military power in Europe?  It is the external assets of her citizens.  We were one of the only small countries in the world that had wealth comparable with that wealth of England, and we see it dwindling rapidly as it is dwindling to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us pause to consider, in the light of that statement, things which have been said in this debate in regard to the repatriation of our external assets. To the tune of £100,000,000 external assets have been realised.  To the tune of £46,000,000 external debt has been contracted which neutralises a corresponding value of sterling external assets.  £46,000,000 of Irish capital, they say, has been repatriated.  I say frittered away, wasted and squandered to the greater extent.  Not all of it for, damn it all, you cannot spend £146,000,000 in three years and have nothing to show for it.  In respect of the greater portion of it you have nothing to show for it&mdash;not a factory. Where is there one factory built out of that £146,000,000 of assets?  Where is the employment that £146,000,000 has given?</P>

      <P>We were told by Deputies that it did not matter whether we spent these assets, that we could fling them away in millions of dollars in an afternoon if we wished, and that we could borrow, borrow and borrow.  Deputy Dillon has been the great advocate of borrowing.  Let us see what Deputy Dillon had to say on that again in 1939.  At column 861 of Volume 76 of the Official Report for the year 1939, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputies often here speak quite cheerfully of borrowing to balance the Budget to meet services that they think very necessary and desirable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Have we not been told that we ought to borrow to balance this Budget even by Deputy Dillon?  Deputy Dillon goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Do they ever recall that every £ you borrow imposes an annual charge upon the Budget?  Do they realise that, in 1924, our annual debt charge was £120,000?  That is all the public debt of this country cost us in interest charges.  In 1937 the annual debt charge is £2,377,000, and will very shortly approach £3,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we left office in 1948 the charge for public debt upon the Central Fund was £3,600,000, and this year the charge upon the Central Fund will be £8,000,000.  Virtually all of the difference between this £3,600,000 and the £8,000,000 was to meet obligations and commitments which were entered into by our predecessors.  When you come to think not merely of the debt on the Central Fund but of the debt for which provision must be made in the voted services, the amount required, which was something like £4,000,000 in 1938, has risen to £10,000,000 in 1952.  As Deputy Dillon says: &ldquo;Let us not forget that every £1 you borrow imposes an annual charge upon the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is Deputy Dillon, whose opinion <Col N="2139" /> of our people and of their capacities we all know.  They could not, he said, develop Irish industries.  Irish industries would be a gangrene on the Irish economy.  Having declared&mdash;I quote his words&mdash;&ldquo;that democracy is but poorly qualified to deal with finance and financial matters&rdquo;, Deputy Dillon went on to describe to the House the consequences of pursuing an inflationary policy.  We have been hearing a great deal in this debate that what this country is suffering from is not inflation but deflation and that, therefore, the Minister for Finance ought to definitely budget on an inflationary basis.  Let us hear what the gentleman who has been pressing that course upon us had to say about it in 1939:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, there rests upon the public men of our country the responsibility to deal capably with these financial matters and not to bring the people into danger of seduction by the hare-brained inflator who is often an honest, decent fellow trying to deal with dynamite&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He must have had the former Minister for External Affairs in mind&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the nature of which he does not understand.  But once you get inflation going you reach a stage that no Government can control.  Do not imagine that if we had inflation in the morning its effects would be seen immediately and that the danger it would be and the injuries it would inflict on the country would be seen at once.  If we had inflation in the morning it would be a pleasant experience for many of us.  We would find that all our assets, all that we possess would have an increased money value.  More money would be spent and there would be at once a relaxation of the strain that at present exists.  It is only when we are hell-bent for disaster that we will begin to feel the real evil of it and then we can do nothing to check it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And thus he continued through several columns of the debate, painting to this House the dangers which were inherent in an inflationary policy, and the difficulties of arresting inflation once it <Col N="2140" /> had been induced.  He went on to dilate upon this theme, digressing only to say this&mdash;a much too precious a gem not to go on record&mdash;it will be found in the Official Report, where he dilated on the unwisdom of declaring a Republic in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Enemies, aye, and misguided friends, of his country have often said in public that they wished this country could be induced to declare a Republic.</P>
    <P>I have heard them say it.  The very individuals whom Deputies on the benches opposite think are clinging to this country and desirous of binding it with bonds of steel to Great Britain are, in fact, at the moment, clamouring to get this country to declare a Republic so that they could enjoy its subsequent humiliation.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;A responsible Government, in addition to financing the day-to-day <Col N="2142" /> requirements of our people, is under a heavy obligation to make provision for reserves against contingencies that they cannot control in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been alleged against me that I am over-budgeting. One of the grounds upon which that allegation is founded is that I have included a sum of £3,000,000 to cover the costs of the Social Welfare Bill, which the Opposition Deputies would not let the House pass to-day, and, in addition, other unforeseen contingencies which may arise in respect of other current services.  Deputy Dillon, speaking in 1939, stated that a responsible Government is under a heavy obligation to make provision for reserves against contingencies that they cannot control in the future.</P>
      <P>We are well aware, because of our experience of public life, because of our experience of public finance and because of our year-to-year experience in this House that before this financial year ends provision will have to be made for some expenditure which was not foreseen when the Budget was being prepared, and we have included in our Budget therefore not only the provision to cover the cost of the Social Welfare Bill, amounting to about £1,800,000, but also £1,200,000 for these unforeseen contingencies which may materialise in the course of the year.  We are attacked now because we have done that by the very man who, in 1939, was telling us that there was a heavy obligation upon us to make provision for reserves against contingencies which we could not control in the future.  He hammered that home in these words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I say that if a country finds itself in a position in which there are no resources left, and if it finds that, by the action of a third party, it can be launched into irretrievable disaster, we are, in effect, bankrupt, because we have not got the reserves that a solvent institution should have.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Four years ago&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>he plumed himself&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" />&ldquo;we foresaw that if we went on living on those savings&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>these were the external assets which we were repatriating&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;while you were earning nothing to add to your savings, your reserves one day would come to an end: and, four years ago, we said that if you continue until your reserves come to an end, that will mean bankruptcy&mdash; national bankruptcy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For once Deputy Dillon spoke the truth &mdash;if you continue until your reserves come to an end that will mean bankruptcy, national bankruptcy.  That is the policy which the Opposition are urging the Government of this country to pursue.  The Opposition are asking us to reduce the State and the people into a condition of national bankruptcy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have this statement of a national bankruptcy, then, coming from Deputy Dillon, who boasted a couple of weeks ago that he spent millions of dollars in one afternoon. He went on to describe how money could be raised by profligate politicians.  Let the Opposition listen now to what I am about to say.  Let them listen to what Deputy Dillon said in 1939 and see how Deputy Dillon mapped out the way that we now wish to go.  Here is what he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have three methods of getting it.  We can borrow it,&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> that is what you have been doing&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we can save it,&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is what you have not been doing,&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or we can print it&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is what Deputy MacBride is urging upon us.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Can we borrow it?&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>asked Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can borrow it only if we find someone to lend it.  Now it is important for this House to understand this, that those who have money to lend do not read the speeches that are made in this House.  They go to the Revenue Accounts, and they examine the economic state of the country from the official returns.  The economic statements or the economic arguments advanced in this House weigh little with them.  They are skilled financiers, and their job is the examination of national accounts with a view to determining the solvency of any State which seeks money on the public money market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Deputy Dillon's view it would be impossible for Fianna Fáil to borrow. That is what he was trying to say.  He was trying to imply that we were not in a position to borrow because, as he said, the skilled financiers would pay very little attention to what we say unless the economic facts back up our statements.  Of course Deputy Dillon was not right when he said we could not borrow.  The skilled financiers, whom he was praising then as he is condemning them now, did examine the revenue returns, did see how we were handling the public finances, and as a result they lent us, between 1932-33 and 1947-48 in public loans, all of them with one exception, the first public loan, fully subscribed, £51,316,000.  It was all spent on building up the capital equipment of the country with one exception.  In 1938 we floated the Financial Agreement Loan for £10,000,000 at an interest of 3¾ per cent., and we floated that loan in order to wind up whatever commitments we might have been morally bound to meet as a result of <Col N="2145" /> the 1923 secret agreement.  The rest of the money was borrowed for purposes of national development, for the development of the Erne and the Liffey and of bogs, for the building of houses, the establishment of the Industrial Credit Company and the Irish Sugar Company, and buying up the Belgian concern which had the sugar-making monopoly in this country before the Fianna Fáil Government took over.  That is what the skilled financiers who studied the economic position did for us.  It was not, however, how they viewed the record of our predecessors.  The last loan floated by the Coalition was a dismal failure.  I have been twitted for not floating a loan.  It has been alleged here that we would not be in these difficulties if we had floated a loan.</P>
    <P>I realise, everybody realises, that nobody will lend money to a disorderly concern whose finances are subject to disorganisation and dislocation.  We have been putting the public finances in order.  When the people realise that the country will be run properly and decently, then, I am perfectly certain, our citizens will be no less ready in the year 1952 to lend us money for national purposes than they were in the year 1938 when they lent us £10,000,000 at an interest of 3¾ per cent.  We want a great deal more from them this year but I have not any doubt that when this Budget goes through and the honest, industrious, thrifty people of the country know that the public finances are at last in safe responsible hands we will get the capital we require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Just let us assume that Deputy Norton's prognostications will be fulfilled and that we will not get the money.  Let me put it in this way which is perhaps a better way of putting it: suppose that the Finance Bill is not carried; suppose there is a change of Government and we have got to hand back under the Constitution to our successors of Fine Gael&mdash; mind, it will be a one-Party Government this time.  Make no mistake about that.  That is what is being <Col N="2146" /> manæuvred for now.  There will be no plums for Irish Labour or National Labour this time and we gather that the honest principled Deputies in the Labour Party do not want the plums &mdash;suppose we had a Fine Gael Government back in office and they could not borrow because they will not be able to borrow after the sort of speeches they made here in this House in this debate.  The dismal failure of their last loan shows that the people have not any confidence in their administration.  They have told us in this debate that they will not tax. Deputy Costello said that he was going to repeal the taxes in the Finance Bill. They cannot borrow.  If they do borrow, think about what Deputy Dillon said the consequences of that would be.</P>
      <P>Then where are they going to get the money to carry on the public services? Let me come back to Deputy Dillon and his three methods of raising money.  He said: &ldquo;We can borrow it, we can save it&rdquo;&mdash;they are not going to save it&mdash;&ldquo;or we can print it&rdquo;. They cannot borrow, they will not tax, so they are thrown back on the third device of printing.  Let us hear what Deputy Dillon had to say in that regard.  It is very relevant to the issue because if we cannot tax we must find some kind of currency, whatever validity it may have outside this country, to persuade the people to go on working.  Here is what Deputy Dillon said (column 367, Volume 176):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where can we hope to borrow? Does not the Minister know that if we do print, the first reaction of printing will be very acceptable to the bulk of the people?  It is only when the damage of uncontrollable inflation is well under way that the true consequences of that course of action will become manifest, and it will then be too late to stop it.  To bring any democracy within the reach of the strong temptation to inflate by printing currency &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what is behind all the attacks on the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash; is one of the greatest crimes that a Minister for Finance can commit, because he draws them into <Col N="2147" /> a temptation the dangers of which are absolutely impossible to explain in theory to the mass of the voting public&mdash;the full dangers of which the voting public can never learn except by experience.  It would destroy the entire economic fabric of this State and make it impossible for any combination afterwards to re-establish our position.  Is it not true that the longer you go on spending more than the national income permits, the harder it is to effect the savings that are necessary to restore stability?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Dillon's answer given in advance to the policy which Deputy MacBride has been advocating, not only as a private Deputy, as I suppose I may almost call him, in opposition, but also as Minister for External Affairs in the Coalition Government. He wanted to be free to print the money.  That is what Deputy Dillon in 1939 said would be the consequences of adopting Deputy MacBride's policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am using Deputy Dillon to show the absurdities into which the Opposition have led themselves. We have been hearing a great deal about the balance of payments problem.  We were hearing something about the balance of payments problem from Deputy Costello in 1948 when, as reported in the public Press:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Costello said that the adverse balance of payments has grown to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan who spoke here to-day, speaking, I was going to say, this time last year&mdash;of course, this time last year was the middle of May and the general election was on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better wait and listen to what Deputy McGilligan was saying last year.  It is much more relevant, and I assume that the Deputy has some faith in what Deputy McGilligan says. Of course, it is an innocent faith.  He has still to be disabused of his confidence in Deputy McGilligan, but he will not be long before he finds out as Deputy MacBride found him out this morning. As I was saying, speaking last year on the 2nd May, in the course of his Budget statement, Deputy McGilligan said this in regard to the balance of payments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Only if the gap in the balance of payments is narrowed so that external disinvestment is balanced by additional home investment&mdash;rather than by excessive consumption&mdash;can we be satisfied that as a nation we are making ends meet and not wasting our past accumulations.  One of the great benefits conferred by the possession of external assets is ability to ride out periods like the present of exceptional difficulty and stress, but this external mass of manæuvre is the mainstay of our economic independence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on, he went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining, it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious. We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Dillon's view was about this question of the balance of payments in 1939.  &ldquo;It is plain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the observant that, unless we correct the adverse trade balance, and correct it soon, we are going to have a crash.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are going to have a crash,&rdquo; thundered Deputy Dillon in 1939, when the decline in the value of Irish net external assets during the whole period from 1933 to 1938 was about £11,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me repeat that this <Col N="2149" /> £11,000,000 of net external assets over the period 1932 to 1938 has been invested in the sugar factories, the cement factories, in turf development, electrical development, boot factories, clothing factories and cotton weaving, and in the new industries which had sprung up over that five-year period. The plant and the equipment in which this £11,000,000 had been invested was there.  It was visible to the eye.  The industries were easy to see.  They were working and giving employment, unlike&mdash;this is the point I want to make&mdash;the mythical investments which the Coalition allege they made out of the Marshall Aid money.  The £11,000,000 of external assets which we repatriated had not gone up, as I have said, in smoke.  They are not spent on tobacco or on foreign wheat or on maize or petrol, as the bulk of the Marshall Aid millions were spent by the Coalition.  Nevertheless&mdash;this is the point, again, that I want to make&mdash;out of Deputy Dillon's own mouth, and there is nothing like convicting a man out of his own mouth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity but he will be more careful about what he says in the future.  He said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With the disappearance of every £1,000,000 (of external assets)&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>he declared&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;our problem with regard to the balance of trade becomes more complicated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is not that precisely the experience which we have had over the past four years?  First of all, the adverse trade balance of 1948 was, I think, £20,000,000.  In 1949 it went up again, and in 1950 it jumped to £30,000,000, and last year it was £61.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does not that prove&mdash;I always like to give credit to a Deputy where credit is due, even to Deputy Dillon&mdash;the truth of the statement which he made in 1939, that &ldquo;the disappearance of every £1,000,000 of external assets made our problem with regard to the balance of trade more complicated&rdquo;? It becomes more complicated unless <Col N="2150" /> you reinvest those assets in a form which will readily, and at an early date, replace the income which you lost when you repatriated those external assets, that is the income which you had previously used to balance your trade.  That is the only circumstance in which your position will not become more complicated with every £1,000,000 of external assets that you use, that is if you use them productively in this country to make the things which formerly you had to import, thereby giving employment to the people, then you will not be the loser but the gainer.</P>
    <P>Now, I have pointed out that the £11,000,000 which we had repatriated over this five-year period had all been invested reproductively.  As I have told the House, it was invested in sugar factories, cement factories, boot factories, in turf development and in electrical development and, quite frankly, in encouraging tillage so that we might be able to relieve ourselves of the necessity of relying utterly on imported wheat and foreign bread.</P>
    <P>In what terms did Deputy Dillon, who professed to see a crash unless the adverse trade balance were redressed, refer to the measures which I have told you the Fianna Fáil Government took to redress that balance by reinvesting Irish capital here at home, by employing Irish workers and using Irish skill to reduce the imports of those commodities which we could produce here for ourselves?  When Fianna Fáil was encouraging the Irish people to invest their liquid assets in the land of Ireland, in producing bread for themselves and sugar for themselves, and all the things which we are able to get from our own soil, what was Deputy Dillon's attitude towards us then?  Listen to this, and then you will understand why, during his period of office as Minister for Agriculture, agricultural production in this country failed even to reach the 1938 figures:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Beet, wheat and peat&rdquo; sneered Deputy Dillon&mdash;I quote from column 1821 of Volume 76:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Beet has gone up the spout, peat has gone up the spout and wheat has imposed on our people an annual burden of £2,500,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> Mark this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Beet has gone up the spout, peat has gone up the spout&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and we can visualise him jumping for joy as he rolled round the words like a sweet savour in his mouth&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and wheat has imposed on our people an annual burden of £2,500,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is what Deputy Dillon was saying in July, 1939.  That is how Deputy Dillon was chanting and ranting in July, 1939, less than two months before the Second World War broke out.  But during that war Deputy Dillon was damn glad to feed himself on Irish grown wheat and Irish made sugar and to warm himself with Irish peat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon thought that Irish food such as wheat and beet should not be grown from 1939 to 1945.  One fact I think he never forgot was that he owed his comfort, as he owed his safety, to the policy which Fianna Fáil had initiated and pursued against his vehement opposition from 1933 to 1939. He never forgot this, and when Deputies of the National Labour Party betrayed their trust and put Deputy Dillon into office, he used his power, as Minister for Agriculture, to discourage tillage, and to discourage the growing of wheat and beet and the development of our full resources, as the Deputies in the Fine Gael Party are doing to-day.</P>

    <P>I was saying that we have a serious balance of payments problem to face in this country, and it is largely of Deputy Dillon's creation.  We have heard from Deputy Hughes and other Deputies who follow in Deputy Dillon's footsteps and who are anxious to see him back in the office of Minister for Agriculture&mdash;Minister for Grass&mdash;that they are not prepared to help the Irish people, or the Irish Government to solve that balance of payments problem; that they are not prepared to cultivate <Col N="2154" /> beet so as to give sugar to our people.  I believe they had the same attitude in regard to wheat and barley and, yet, they expect us to guarantee them in the possession of their holdings.</P>

      <P>It does not matter what Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy MacEntee did in this year or in that year.  The real thing is what Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Hughes and the rest of the Party are going to do to help this country to solve its grave problem as regards the balance of payments and the deficit&mdash;the problem which Deputy McGilligan himself said, as quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, must be solved before the middle of 1951.  It was not solved then and it has not been solved yet.  I am asking the people opposite what they are going to do to help to solve it.  This problem is one of Deputy Dillon's creation.  Deputy Dillon's bulldozers, porous drainage pipes and day-old chicks have all got to be paid for now. We have got the unpleasant task of collecting money to pay for them through the taxes imposed by this Budget, just as we had also had to pay for the increased pay of the civil servants, the Gardaí, the teachers and the other public servants arising out of the award of the Coalition's arbitration board, and just as we will have <Col N="2155" /> to pay, through this Finance Bill, for the increase in old age pensions which we granted last year and for the new social welfare scheme and the improved children's allowances which we are providing.  I would ask the Labour Party not to forget that they are supposed to be concerned with the plight of the people.  I think, judging by their performances in this House, that they are more concerned with Party politics than with the plight of the people.  We know that, and we have had ample evidence of it as regards this Budget and as regards this Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I am saying we know that the Labour Party are more concerned with Party politics than they are with the plight of the people.  We know that in regard to the Finance Bill and the Budget they have embarked on a deliberate policy of obstruction in the hope that they will be able to delay the passage of the important measures to which I have referred, in order to delay the passage of the Social Welfare Bill to which we have pledged ourselves and which is now before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The real secret of it is that they do not want the new Social Welfare Bill and the Children's Allowances Bill to become law in time to come into operation on July 1st next. They do not want those measures for the same reason that Deputy Dillon did not want wheat, beet or peat in 1939 and does not want them to-day.  They do not want those measures because they have been introduced by Fianna Fáil.  They prefer to play the game for Fine Gael.  They showed that by their attitude on the means test a year ago. For years and years, so long as I can remember them in public life, Deputies Norton, Davin and the rest have been declaiming against the means test as a component in social welfare schemes, but when the Fine Gael Party cracked its whip, the boyos sank into silence&mdash; it is too much to say that they lapsed into silence because they actually defended and justified the principle of <Col N="2156" /> the means test.  For years Deputies Norton and Davin have been holding up Fianna Fáil to odium as the enemies of the workers.  The Social Welfare Bill and the Children's Allowances Bill which the Labour Party have been holding up by obstructing the Finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Though we co-operated to that extent, the Minister for Finance now deliberately disseminates a falsehood, that we are delaying the passage of a Bill which we have agreed unprecedentedly to take for its Fifth Stage on the same day as the Fourth Stage.

      <P>I want to give chapter and verse for what I have said about the obstructionist policy which was pursued by the Labour Party.  I said earlier that the Labour Party would go into the Division Lobby side by side with Deputy Mulcahy, who had opposed the Old Age Pensions Bill of 1932.  I said they obeyed the Whip, who is Deputy Sweetman, as everyone is aware.  I said they stood up to speak when he permitted them and they were as mute as mice when he bade them keep silence.  On Thursday last the debate here was taking its weary way and was coming to a close &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The real reason of course is that just as Deputy Davin, Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish played a Fine Gael game against Deputy Dr. Noel Browne in 1951, they are playing it again in 1952, but this time against Fianna Fáil.  That raises the question which a lot of people are asking in regard to some statements we have been hearing recently about new recruits for Fine Gael.  People are wondering when are Deputies Norton and Davin openly going to join Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand from that that Deputy Norton has applied to join Fine Gael?  Am I to understand from that that he is looking for a commission from General Mulcahy?  I was saying that like Deputies Dillon, Fagan and Flanagan, those Deputies, Deputies Norton and Davin, have been following Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Costello for years.  Their votes in this Dáil are being decided not by the administrative council of the Irish Labour Party in 21 Molesworth Street, but in the Fine Gael headquarters in Hume Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My desire is to help Deputy Norton out of an awkward situation.  I should hate to see him subjected to the humiliation of being expelled from the Labour Party.  It looked like that a fortnight or three <Col N="2160" /> weeks ago.  The reason I raise this question is that, if, by any chance, Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin were to go out of the Labour Party, there would be some very delicate adjustments to be made.  Deputy Norton would have to face up to this, as would Deputy Davin: to trying to adjust himself to the position of Deputy Dillon.  I have already told how Deputy Dillon has described the perils which would befall this country if the policy the Opposition are now trying to foist upon it were to be pursued.  Deputy Dillon at that time said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have seen Newfoundland travel that road, and end in London with a request for British Treasury officials to come and take from them their sovereign independence and run the country as delegates of the British Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us see what that means.  We see from these words of Deputy Dillon where the rash improvidence of the Coalition would have led this country, the plight in which it would have been placed by that policy, if Fianna Fáil, with the support of true Independents&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Fheórais is a very skilled parliamentary hand.  That quotation from Deputy Dillon is going to lead up to a very interesting query which Deputy Mac Fheórais is anxious to avoid, because Deputy Dillon did foresee what the Coalition policy, if pursued, was going to result in when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have seen Newfoundland travel that road, and end in London with a request for British Treasury officials to come and take from them their sovereign independence and run the country as delegates of the British Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2161" /> That is a very important statement. It was made by Deputy Dillon when Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton were trying to urge that the country should embark upon the policy which was pursued by the last Coalition Government, and I think that statement will certainly go far to strengthen the fears of those who have suggested that this policy of unbridled extravagance was decided upon by a small group, an inner circle within the Coalition Cabinet, who had an ulterior purpose to serve in wasting and dissipating our external assets&mdash;these external assets, let me remind the House, which Deputy McGilligan stated last May &ldquo;are the mainstay of our economic independence&rdquo;.  Do not let us forget that.  To use the words of my predecessor as Minister for Finance, these external assets &ldquo;are the mainstay of our economic independence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon himself, the man who has been squandering millions of dollars in an afternoon, admitted it many years before when, as reported at column 873 of Volume 76 of the Official Debates, he besought the Taoiseach &ldquo;to have the courage to restore to us that economic independence founded on solvency without which political independence can never be enjoyed in this country.&rdquo;  I pass over the impertinence of Deputy Dillon asking Éamon de Valera to have courage to stress again that Deputy Dillon is, as his words show, as aware as Deputy McGilligan is that the possession of these external assets is vital to the preservation not only of our economic but of our political independence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He asked us &ldquo;to have the courage to restore to us that economic independence founded on solvency without which political independence <Col N="2162" /> can never be enjoyed in this country&rdquo;.  Bearing this in mind, and remembering it always, must we not ask ourselves: Why did the Coalition Government deliberately set itself to fritter away these external assets which Deputy McGilligan himself admitted&mdash;I am going to repeat it in order that Deputies may be aware of it&mdash;are the mainstay of our economic independence? Why did Deputy Dillon, who told us in 1939 that we must have economic independence founded on solvency without which political independence can never be enjoyed, who warned Deputy Davin that the extravagant courses he was urging upon us would inevitably mean the loss of this country's independence, embark on a policy under which, as he admitted, he flung away millions of borrowed dollars in an afternoon?</P>
      <P>These dollars have to be paid back one day.  They are now beginning to carry interest and one of the purposes of this Finance Bill is to help us to raise the £600,000 which we have to find in order to pay a half year's interest on these dollars.  Next year, it will be twice that&mdash;£1,200,000&mdash;and four years from now we shall have to start repaying the principal.  All that is going to be a heavy burden, a heavy unproductive burden, a burden on the future of our people, a burden on their bread and butter, on their sweat and toil, and that burden is being imposed on them in order to repay the dollars which Deputy Dillon squandered and flung around in tens of millions in an afternoon.</P>
      <P>What is the position?  We are now in this position, that Deputy Dillon is on record as having pointed out how serious it is for this or any other country to have a continuous deficit in its balance of payments.  Secondly, he has shown how this must result in a general reduction of our external assets which Deputy McGilligan has told us categorically are the mainstay of our economic independence.  Thirdly, Deputy Dillon has professed to be alarmed because our external assets declined from £72,000,000 in 1934 to £61,000,000 in 1938&mdash;a decline of over £11,000,000 in five years.  These figures are Deputy Dillon's and I am taking no responsibility for them.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what purpose have they been seeking to serve, what end have they been trying to achieve? That is the question which all thinking people are putting to themselves.  Why have the Coalition so deliberately mishandled our finances that we were tending to that condition of vassalage that Deputy Dillon had in mind when, as reported in Volume 76, column 1831 of the Official Debates, he denounced Deputy Davin's policy, the present Opposition policy, and declared:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will mean inevitably the loss of this country's independence.  We have object lessons of that before us.  We have seen Newfoundland travel that road, and end in London with a request for British Treasury officials to come and take from them their sovereign independence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the opinion which Deputy Dillon held 13 years ago as to the disastrous consequences which would follow such a policy as the Coalition adopted and pursued during the last two and a half years of their administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why again&mdash;and let them answer it&mdash; did they adopt that policy?  Why did they put this country in pawn?  Why have they prejudiced its economy and its political independence, and why have they done all this deliberately, with their eyes wide open, and fully aware of what was involved?  These are questions which all thoughtful men and women are asking themselves <Col N="2165" /> to-day.  What was behind this great sell out?  What was the background for this great sell out&mdash;which Deputy Dillon warned us so long ago would &ldquo;inevitably mean the loss of this country's independence.&rdquo;</P>

You will notice that I have not included the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan.  I have refrained from mentioning him, as I know that he was not in the inner ring in the Cabinet. Even in financial matters, it was the ex-Minister for External Affairs who carried all the weight, whose word was <Col N="2167" /> the one that went with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, this must be said for Deputy McGilligan, that he did utter a faint warning.  He came into the House bleating against the wilful misusage of our external assets, the &ldquo;mainstay of our economic independence.&rdquo;  Apologists for the Coalition may equivocate and dissemble and misrepresent, but the undeniable fact is that they have compromised seriously and dangerously the economy&mdash;and, therefore, the political independence&mdash;of the State that was committed to their case.</P>
      <P>When it was driven from power last year, the Coalition had brought this country to that extremity which Deputy Dillon had in mind when he said&mdash;I quote from column 1816 of Volume 76:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If you come to the verge of the <Col N="2168" /> precipice, no democratic Party can pull the nation back.  The only chance of saving the nation then was to get them to open their eyes to the consequences of a certain policy before they were brought to the edge of the precipice&mdash;while one's hand might still be mended, although very near to the edge of the precipice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, in fact, was where we found this country's finances when we took over from the Coalition last June&mdash;on the edge of a precipice.  Naturally, the men who left the State in that parlous position will not admit it.  They take refuge in the most blatant misrepresentation of the true position, but the fact remains&mdash;we are on the edge of a precipice.  Our people can come back; they can recover their economic independence; they can secure and safeguard their political independence, and they will do that if they stand behind us in the financial measures which we are now putting before them.</P>

      <P>It is made clear in the table to which the Deputy refers that the £40,671,086 is the &ldquo;equivalent of the proceeds&rdquo; of the dollar borrowings under the United States Loan Agreements.  This, owing to the devaluation of September, 1949, is a lesser sum than the present equivalent in Irish currency of the dollar liability.  At the present exchange rate with the United States dollar, $2.80 to the £, the amount of Irish currency required to discharge the dollar liability is £45,756,144, i.e., £5,085,058 more than the Irish currency proceeds of the borrowed dollars.

If reference is to be had to the factor which he now employs to raise that figure to £46,000,000, must reference not also be had to the earning capacity of the £40,000,000 over the period over which the liability to repay is spread and the surplus of the one shown against the increased liability on the other side?</P>

Our present sterling liability in respect of Marshall Aid loan amounts to £45,756,144.  The proceeds of the loan, as they have been received here and converted into the sterling account, were valued for £40,671,086.  There is a difference of £5,085,058.

      <P>Is it not so that in employing the figure of £46,000,000 the Minister is looking forward over the entire period of redemption and proceeding on the assumption (1) that the <Col N="2186" /> fund earns no increment over the 27-year period on which payment is scheduled and (2) that there is no alteration in the relative values of sterling and dollars over that 27-year period? If he is looking forward to the end of the redemption period and describing as a liability what may have to be paid in sterling over that period, surely he must make a corresponding allowance for the interest payable on the investments in that fund, to wit, the mortgage debenture stock of the Agricultural Credit Corporation which pays, I think, 4½ per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what quantity of dollars has been allocated for the purchase of raisins from the United States of America in each of the years 1948 to 1952, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that the reply to this question may be understood in its correct perspective it is necessary for me to give some background information.</P>
      <P>Before the war 45 per cent. of this country's total imports of dried fruit and 75 per cent. of its imports of raisins came from the dollar area. During the war shipping, supply and foreign exchange difficulties virtually terminated that trade.  In 1945 $831,000, and in 1946 $1,300,000, were expended on dried fruit.  In 1947 and 1948, except for a limited amount in respect of prunes for manufacturing purposes, dollars were not made available for dried fruit.  Supplies of dried fruit, although not of such good quality and often much dearer, were available for payment in soft currencies.</P>
      <P>At the inception of Marshall Aid it was the intention, on the assumption that sufficient Aid would be available, to resume imports of American raisins and prunes, and in respect of 1948-49 the previous Government approved an import programme which included $1,350,000 for these commodities.  The amount of Aid for that year was lower than requested and actual expenditure on dried fruit was $468,000.  In 1949-50 the dollar import programme approved by the Government included $720,000 for dried fruit and procurment authorisations for $540,000 were received from E.C.A.  Subsequently the Government decided that this allocation should not be used but should be diverted to other commodities owing to practical administrative difficulties involved, and to the availability of dried fruit from other sources without expenditure of dollars or other hard currency.</P>
      <P>For 1950-51 and 1951-52 Marshall Aid was to be progressively reduced and dried fruit was not included in the dollar import programmes approved for these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> A determining factor in decisions to restrict dollar expenditure was the availability of dried fruit from non-dollar sources for payment in soft currencies.  That is not now the position.  The f.o.b. cost of Turkish or Greek sultanas would be at least 40 per cent. greater than the f.o.b. cost of the Californian product and, unfortunately, there is every reason to anticipate that the settlement for the former, through the E.P.U., would have to be, as to 100 per cent., in gold. So far as currency considerations are necessarily relevant to our import policies, there is now a clear advantage to be gained in buying in California instead of in the Middle East.  Taking the respective costs landed at Dublin Quay, the Middle East fruit would still be 25 per cent. dearer.</P>
    <P>To import the cheaper American dried fruit, so far as we can allocate dollars to that trade from the limited amount available to us, also benefits our balance of payments, mitigates the cost of living of our people and helps our important exports of cake and confectionery to maintain their markets.</P>
    <P>It was for these reasons that I decided to include in the estimates of dollar expenditure for the year 1952, when these were drawn up last January, a provision of $1,000,000 for raisins and prunes.  A sum of approximately $900,000 has recently been allocated to importers, who, in the past, have imported these commodities both for domestic consumption and manufacturing purposes.  It is expected that this allocation, together with the existing stocks of raisins in the country, will suffice to cover requirements until the end of the year. Having regard to the other calls upon the available dollar resources and to the over-all objective, in present circumstances, of reducing dollar expenditure wherever possible, it is still essential to restrict allocations of dollars for dried fruit, as, indeed, for any other commodity, to minimum requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking does the $1,000,000, which the Minister proposes to spend on prunes and seedless raisins, correspond exactly to the amortisation requirements of the Marshall Aid loan in this calendar year and, if so, why does he send out his dupes to stump the country saying we are short of dollars wherewith to meet the Marshall Aid commitments when, in fact, we are spending the dollars to buy raisins and prunes?  Does the $1,000,000 equate amortisation?</P>

      <P>The letter of the 3rd February, 1951, bearing the reference numbers H.185 and H.1501 was not a circular <Col N="2197" /> letter, but was issued to the South Cork Board of Public Assistance in response to a proposal by that board that a temporary allowance at the rate of 12½ per cent. of salaries should be granted to the superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers employed by the board.  At that time the Minister considered that such officers should not be granted an increase on the revised salaries which came into operation from the 1st June, 1948, and accordingly the letter rejected the board's application.</P>
      <P>The Minister subsequently decided that a temporary allowance of 12½ per cent. should be authorised for these officers in cases where the local authorities decided to grant it, and the circular letter No. HA.8/51 was accordingly issued on the 7th May, 1951.</P>

      <P>The number of applicants who appeared to comply with the age and minimum physical requirements was 1,126.  Of these 790 were 5 feet 10 inches and over.  Only 300 recruits are required, and the commissioner selected 393 applicants to sit for the qualifying educational examination, the additional 93 being to allow for a number failing in the educational or medical test.  All those selected are 5 feet 10 inches and over.  The commissioner selected the applicants who, in his opinion, are likely to make the best policemen, giving preference to suitable applicants with a good knowledge of Irish and ruling out applicants under 5 feet 10 inches.  In assessing the merits of the candidates, he had regard to such matters as their character, standard of education and physique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that <Col N="2201" /> the educational examination has always been a qualifying and not a competitive test, and that it has never been the practice to call for the examination all applicants who appear suitable for appointment.  There are always far more eligible applicants than vacancies&mdash;this time there were nearly three times as many&mdash;and unless the selection was to be made in accordance with the markings in the examination, nothing would be gained by calling them all.</P>

      <P>No such thing.  The commissioner did his best.  Only 300 could be recruited.  This is not a competitive examination, and I think that Deputies who consider the thing calmly will admit that it would not be satisfactory to have an educational test on a competitive basis.</P>

      <P>The number of applicants was 1,126.  That was a lot more than he wanted.  He thought that if he called 90 more than were required, about 390, he would probably get what he wanted.  He called 393 out of the 700 who were over 5 feet 10 inches.  I had a long talk with him because I know of the feeling on all sides of the House on this matter.  I am satisfied that he has done the best he could. He went through every one of the forms himself with an assistant, and examined them as carefully as he could.  He gave those who had Irish preference.  He said that there were certain parts of the country which have always given a large number of entrants to the Guards, and he picked more men from those counties than from others.  He admits that some who were turned down might be as good as those who were called, but that as far as he could he picked the men most likely to make the best Guards.  I myself thought that there might be something in the idea of a competitive examination, but having discussed the matter with him and thought it over myself, I am satisfied that it would not be satisfactory.  If you called 790 most of them might qualify, and you would have the same trouble of rejecting people who had been brought for examination and had qualified, as you only wanted half that number.  Your last condition would be at least as bad as the first.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's previous statement that he is satisfied that the applicants who were turned down are as eligible as the others, would he not now consider that the procedure adopted was most irregular and unfair to the young men of the country who are entitled to apply for membership to the Garda Síochána?  In view of that very definite <Col N="2205" /> fact would he now consider giving every candidate who was deemed eligible an opportunity of placing himself before some selection board or another and so afford the commissioner an opportunity of seeing them and of determining which of these candidates are most eligible?  Surely the judgment as regards selection should not be made in, apparently, the way it is being made by some microscopic measurement and thus judging candidates who live 200 and 300 miles away from Dublin.  There is no justice in that type of procedure and I want to make a protest on behalf of the eligible candidates who were turned down.</P>

      <P>Statistics collected by my Department indicate that of the total quantity of milk supplied to all creameries in the country in the year 1951, 14.5 per cent or about one-seventh, was supplied to all creameries in County Kerry and 11.3 per cent or about one-ninth to creameries in County Kerry operated by the Dairy Disposal Company Limited.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, the position is that each step in the procedure for testing milk for butter-fat content at creameries and cream-separating stations is strictly regulated by Statutory Order which is rigidly enforced by my Department. I see no reason, therefore, to alter the system which has proved satisfactory over a long number of years and in which milk suppliers also have full confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) and (b), it is not the practice to supply information relating to the trading of any individual concern and I am sure that the Deputy will fully appreciate the desirability of this general line of policy.  As regards (c) creameries which sell milk for use in the manufacture of chocolate crumb do not purchase the milk from particular milk suppliers specifically for that purpose. Each creamery group purchases milk on the basis of its butterfat content only and in fact they are obliged to do so under the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  The actual price which the creamery can pay for the milk depends on the various uses to which the milk supply generally is put, including buttermaking, cream, liquid milk, chocolate crumb, etc., and on returns from other trading activities. Where, however, the creamery requires to use whole milk, such as for sale for chocolate crumb, the suppliers who do not receive back their skim milk are paid for the skim on a gallonage basis.</P>

In my opinion, both Bills&mdash;the Norton Bill and this Bill&mdash;have two major defects.  I understand that before I can call a division I must have at least five Deputies to stand up in support of it.  I intend to ask the Chair for a division, and, if I can get the necessary five, to call for a vote on this stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one point which may negative to a certain extent the benefits of the Bill&mdash;if the increases in benefits under the Bill are to be taken into consideration by local authorities when assessing differential rents.  It is no harm to bring that point to the Minister's notice.  In Cork, children's allowances are not taken into consideration, but old age and blind pensions are.  I think that it would destroy a lot of the good that has been done by those benefits if local authorities <Col N="2226" /> are allowed to take those matters into consideration as increased means.</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Social Welfare had been here when the Minister for Finance replied on the Finance Bill, I do not think he would support the allegation that was made.  I refer to the bitter, vindictive allegation the Minister for Finance made that, during the course of the passage of this Bill through the House, the Labour Party did everything they could to obstruct its passage.  Both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister must readily agree that, as far as co-operation was concerned, the utmost was given by the members of the Labour Party, not alone as far as the times for taking the different stages were concerned, but in the actual debate on the different stages.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party co-operated to the extent of agreeing to sit&mdash;and it was not usual to do so&mdash;during Holy Week. I do not want the Minister to make any acknowledgments for the co-operation of this Party, but it would be just as well on this stage&mdash;the first opportunity that presents itself to us&mdash;to refute entirely the allegation made by the Minister for Finance, which I am sure would not be subscribed to by the Minister for Social Welfare or by any of the other members who sit in the Government Benches.</P>
      <P>As far as the Labour Party is concerned, this Bill does a certain amount to popularise the idea of social security, a type of idea that was not popular in this country&mdash;I will not say in this House&mdash;a short two or three years ago.  If the last Government and the last Minister for Social Welfare fought bitter opposition at that time, to make the idea of social security popular, then I think the former Minister for Social Welfare should have acknowledged to him a certain amount of credit.  I do not want to detract or take away credit from any others who have been interested or who have been strong adherents of the idea of social security, but it must be recorded on this, the Fifth Stage of a Social Security Bill, that the idea of and the necessity for social security in this country is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we have so many ills and evils in our system and in the country at the present time.  If people are not in a position to provide for themselves, it is the duty of the State through the Government to come to their assistance. That is good Catholic social teaching.  This Bill goes a certain way in doing that.  We make no secret of the fact that we are disappointed in the Bill because it does not go far enough.  Motives may be attributed to us as to why we consider that this is not an adequate Bill.  Other motives may be attributed to us as to why it was not brought in in three and a half years.  That might have been important 12 months ago, it may be considered important now; but the important thing so far as I am concerned now is that we have the beginning of a social security scheme.  Our idea as a Labour Party will be to try to press the present Minister for Social Welfare, to press the next Government or the Government after that, to provide the maximum social security for the people who may happen to want it.</P>
      <P>No one could take the Labour Party to task for the attitude they have always adopted on social security.  The least that would be expected of us would be to press the present Minister. He has promised to reconsider certain things which were in what was described as the Norton welfare scheme, in the future.  I may assure him and his colleagues in the Government that from this onwards, whether the life of this Government be long or short, we will try to induce them to improve this Bill vastly, to provide for the death gratuity, for maternity allowances and for retirement pensions for men at 65 and women at 60.  We will try to get them to provide a scheme that will give social security to all the people of the country who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that if the Norton Bill had not been carried through this House last year by a majority of four votes, opposed at that time by the present Minister, we would not have this Bill to-day and it would not be <Col N="2228" /> going through this House unanimously. The proof of that is the attitude of the Minister in 1947 towards the proposal by Deputies Costello and O'Higgins to have the means test eased&mdash;which would cost the country an extra £500,000.  The Minister dug his heels in the ground then and said the country could not afford it.  We were then approaching a general election in 1948 and he indicated that he was examining the question of providing some kind of scheme of social security here.</P>
      <P>This Bill and its principal benefits are those which were contained in the Norton Bill last year but the real benefits being provided by this Bill will be offset to a considerable extent by the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  The Bill is designed to assist the needy sections of the community, those in sickness and in unemployment, but those are the very people who will find it necessary now to pay increased prices for food and to meet these extra costs.  Therefore, the main provisions in this Bill are not as good and not so liberal as the provisions in the Norton Bill.  The Norton Bill last year, for which the Fine Gael Party voted solidly, was a bigger and better Bill. It embraced a larger number of people and its benefits would apply to a greater number also.</P>
      <P>The minor sections of this Bill are, if you like, introduced by the Minister in order to make it look somewhat different from the Norton Bill that was carried through last year but, as far as the people are concerned, the main provisions of this Bill are those which were carried in this House last year and introduced in this House by Deputy Norton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that we are reaching the final stages of this Bill in this House.  I look forward to this Bill being an Act within the next week or so, so that the benefits which it provides may be available for the people in the beginning of the month of July.  As Deputy Corish has said, there has had to be a long fight over a great number of years to get the idea of social welfare adopted, and even yet, although there has been substantial <Col N="2229" /> conversion as far as the House is concerned, there are certain elements and sections in the country who do not take kindly to or do not accept social welfare.  I was very keen that this Bill would go on the Statute Book, that it would be put into operation.  When we have it on the Statute Book and in operation there is no doubt whatever that it will be improved as time goes on.  There will be amendments to it.  There will be pressure for amendments in the House and from outside as the Bill operates.  The main thing was to get the Social Welfare Bill as a sort of sheet anchor, and I think the Minister is to be complimented on having the Bill at this stage within a year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The Government side of the House and the Labour Party have both contributed and co-operated to make this Bill as good as it was possible to have it at the present moment, but it is a matter for regret, certainly a matter of significance, that for some reason, which perhaps they can explain, the Fine Gael Party has boycotted this Bill at every stage in its passage through the House.  It is right that that should be said.  It is right that it should be put on record that, with the exception of the Minister, the Fianna Fáil Party, a couple of Independents and the Labour Party, there has been no help given in the House to this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is piloting the Bill on behalf of Fianna Fáil and on behalf of the Government. It is only right that that should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that is not in the Bill, and perhaps I should not refer to it, but I do make this suggestion to the Minister as something that he may be able to do in the Seanad, that is, to insert a section dealing with the interpretation.  It is something that has been adopted in England in regard to Pensions Acts generally, that is, that, in the interpretation of the Act, there should be a bias in favour of the applicant, that <Col N="2230" /> the applicant should get the maximum benefit that the Bill provides.  In other words, if there is a possibility of doubt, if a man's claim can be interpreted in two ways, one in the man's favour and one against him, the interpretation should always be in the applicant's favour.</P>
    <P>If a section to that effect, such as is in British pension legislation, were introduced into this Bill, it would create a much better spirit in the interpretation of the Bill, and it would give the officials who have to interpret the Act and who will do their best to interpret it strictly in accordance with law, the right, where there were two possible interpretations, to say that the interpretation that was more favourable to the applicant was the legal and proper interpretation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will very soon be law, and that it is only the beginning of substantial improvements in social welfare legislation here.  Speaking on another matter last night I said that the standard of wages and salaries in this country is deplorably low.  With co-operation and help all round, with a growing understanding on the part of the general public, the time is not far distant when the allowances provided in this Bill will be substantially increased.  I hope that that will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this stage of this Bill as one who has been agitating for years for a social welfare scheme.  We are all pleased that we will have it on the Statute Book at last, even though the Bill has its drawbacks from our point of view.</P>
      <P>There is one matter that I would like to stress again, that is, the discrepancy between non-contributory widows' pensions and contributory widows' pensions.  It is contrary to reason and justice that, because a man was out of employment and was not in benefit at the time of his death, punishment should be inflicted on his widow or children.  There is a difference of 4/- per week between the non-contributory pension and a contributory pension in the case of a widow, and a difference of 5/- a week in the case of a woman and her child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2231" /> Take the case of a man who goes to England and spends three or four years there, becomes ill there, and returns to this country and dies after six or seven months.  His stamps are not credited here, and therefore his widow is entitled only to a non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Apart from that particular case, I am concerned about the woman whose husband never left the country but who was out of benefit at the time of his death.  In that case the widow is entitled only to a non-contributory pension, which means that punishment and suffering are passed on to her and her children.</P>
    <P>As people who claim to be Christian and to have a certain conception of justice we should not tolerate for one minute such a position.  This is not a question of scoring a point.  It is most touching that a woman and her children should be punished in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Recently I put down a question about workmen's compensation.  Deputy McGrath also put down a question on that matter.  The Minister gave us to understand that he would not do anything about it until the social welfare scheme was in its final stages or after that.  I want to know from the Minister if he has in mind doing anything in the matter of workmen's compensation? During Deputy Norton's time, the compensation was raised from 35/-to 50/-.  The average weekly wage of the ordinary worker is £6 5s.  If he meets with an accident and sustains a broken arm or leg, his weekly income is immediately reduced to 50/-. Although that man may have a dependent relative or a family all he gets is 50/- a week.  So far as I know, premiums have been steadily increasing for a number of years but the compensation still remains at 50/-.  I would ask the Minister to consider these important aspects.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the necessity for some reciprocal arrangement between our Government and the British Government and between our Government and the Six County Government. I can show the Minister <Col N="2232" /> some correspondence which I had with the Department in the Six Counties concerning the case of a man who was getting 10/- a week in Northern Ireland and who is now living in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Since 1946 the pensions in Northern Ireland have been increased but people who live outside the Six Counties will not get the benefit of that increase.  The same thing applies to persons who have been living in England.</P>
    <P>I have a case in mind of a woman from County Cork, who had been living in England for some time when her husband died.  She came home to live with her daughter with the result that she was deprived of a pension.  There are many other improvements that might be embodied in this Bill.  Certainly I hope I shall live to see the day when mortality benefits and the other increased benefits provided in Deputy Norton's Bill will be embodied in an amending Bill to this Bill after it becomes an Act.  We do not demand social security as such.  It is because of the defects of the system that we are trying to operate that we have to come before Parliament and ask the people to provide by legislation for the victims of that system.  I should like to see industry being made responsible for its employees rather than that it should be allowed to throw them on the scrap heap when they become disabled, and leaving the community to provide for them.  I hope that the Minister will give consideration to the matters to which I have called his attention with a view to providing for them in future legislation.</P>

      <P>I merely want to make one point, and that is in regard to the assessment of unemployment assistance for part-time fishermen.  We have had considerable difficulty over a long number of years with regard to the allowances paid to these workers when they become unemployed.  A number of these workers, who are only part-time workers, are assessed as owners of fishing craft.  I would appeal to the Minister when considering this question of the unemployment assistance rates, which is referred to, I think, in <Col N="2233" /> the Third Schedule, to make some attempt to clarify the position, as the present means of assessing the means of these men leads to friction as between the local investigation officers and the part-time fishermen.  When assessing his means, the man is returned as owner of a craft, even though there are four other men who also have shares in that particular craft.  Each of these members is assessed as owner.</P>

      <P>It might be well at this stage to restate the Labour Party's view in regard to this Bill.  In the first place, the Party has always supported social legislation designed to provide the maximum possible security for those exposed to hazards against which they are unable to insulate themselves. In this House, for the last 30 years, the Labour Party has supported all measures calculated to improve our code of social legislation.  In fact, in many respects the Labour Party has been the pioneer in advocating new forms of social legislation designed to give our people here at home the same kind of security as other progressive countries have provided for their workers.  If one is inclined to indulge in research, one will find that the Labour Party has been the pioneering Party in advocating improvements in our code of social legislation, just as the Labour movement and the trade union movement long before 1910 pioneered the agitation which originally brought the Old Age Pensions Act and which in 1911 and 1913 <Col N="2234" /> brought the National Health Insurance Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act.  We stand to-day in precisely the same position in which we stood then, namely, that we believe in social legislation. We believe that the provision of social legislation by the State is imperative, so long as society within the State is not constituted in such a way as to enable the people to provide from their own resources against the hazards and risks which are inseparable from the life we see around us.  It is in that spirit that we welcome this Bill.  We welcome it because it is an improvement on the existing position.</P>
      <P>The three main provisions of this Bill are similar to&mdash;in fact, they are absolutely identical with&mdash;the provisions in the Bill which I introduced last year and which was passed through its Second Stage.  The widows' and orphans' contributory pension in this Bill is indentical with that provided in the previous Bill.  The section dealing with it is copied word for word, letter by letter, from the section in the previous Bill.</P>
      <P>The same applies in respect to disability benefit and to unemployment benefit.  These three sections are exact copies, as similar as peas in a pod, of the sections of the Bill that I introduced last year.  The real weakness and the deficiency in the Bill is that it drops four of the useful provisions which were contained in the Bill for which I was responsible.  In this Bill we have killed the provision for retirement pensions at 65 for men and at 60 for women.  We have killed the provision for death benefits, varying from £20 for men over 18 years of age to £6 for a child over three years of age.  We have killed the proposal to raise the maternity allowance from £2 to £5.  We have killed the provision for paying a £4 maternity allowance to women in childbirth.  I say without the slightest hesitation that the Bill has been robbed of its best provisions by reason of the killing of these four vital provisions which are commonplace provisions of social legislation in progressive countries all over the world to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let this be a sobering thought and <Col N="2235" /> reflection for Deputies whenever they feel like expanding their chests in regard to what they are doing in the field of social legislation.  Even when this Bill passes, our code of social legislation, because of the deficiencies to which I have adverted, will still be the poorest code of social legislation in Western Europe.  We will still be failing to provide for our workers here benefits which are being provided for workers in free Europe to-day.  Our code of social legislation will still be below the standards which are accepted as reasonable tests in the International Labour Office in Geneva. We still have a good way to go to keep up to the level of progressiveminded countries in Europe and throughout the world in the field of social legislation.</P>
    <P>Let this be underlined.  We are still substantially behind the code of social legislation in operation in Britain and in the Six Counties.  In Britain and in the Six Counties benefits are in operation which are not provided in this Bill, which are being killed under this Bill.  So long as the position is that in the Six Counties, tied up as they are to British expenditure, to British rearmament, and to the financial and other risks associated with British economy to-day, they can provide for their people retirement pensions and other benefits which are not in this Bill.  There will always be hard pioneering work to be done in this House to lift up the standard of social legislation so as to enable it to keep abreast with some of the best schemes in Europe and to come near to what is in operation in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we have departed from the old scheme by which our codes of social legislation were financed.  In the past, the method of financing schemes of social welfare was by a contribution from the worker, a contribution from the employer and a speaking, these were equal contributions. That was the normal balance in the past.  I do not say that it was necessarily the most virtuous method of financing our schemes of social legislation, but at least it was a pattern <Col N="2236" /> to which our people were accustomed and it involved the minimum of dislocation administratively if there was to be an extension of our code of social legislation because we could still continue a pattern of finance with which our people were thoroughly familiar.</P>
    <P>That balance is being broken in this Bill.  That balance, which has endured so long, will go under this Bill.  I do not mind that in the slightest, because in the course of time the administrative difficulties will be surmounted, and I suppose people will get familiar with the new pattern of financing social legislation.  That being so, I would say that the Labour Party would not regard itself as being bound to go back to the old method of tripartite financing in respect of social welfare schemes.  It might well prove to be that the best scheme for the future, from the point of view of the masses of the workers, would be to put the full responsibility, or 80 per cent. of the responsibility, on the State on the one hand and on the employers on the other.  So long as the tripartite method of financing continued, it was understandable to follow that pattern. Now that it does not continue any longer, we would not feel bound to go back to it in any future scheme.  In future schemes it might well be that the burden of the contributions will fall on broader backs than in the past.</P>
    <P>We discussed the Social Welfare Bill last year against an entirely different background from that which operates to-day.  We are discussing a Social Welfare Bill now, not only against a background in which the cost of living has increased in the last 12 months, bringing about a shrinkage in the purchasing power of money, but against the still bleaker background that in the next six weeks the people will experience a very substantial rise in prices of such staple commodities as tea, sugar, bread, butter and flour. Even their simple luxuries in the way of cigarettes, tobacco and beer are taxed under a Budget for which this Government are responsible.  Therefore, whatever social benefits, attenuated as they may be, are being provided in this Bill, they are being <Col N="2237" /> provided in circumstances in which they are of much less value to the potential beneficiaries than the similar benefits or the extended benefits were in the context in which we were providing these benefits last year.</P>
    <P>This scheme is not only substantially less valuable to the workers than the one for which we are responsible, but it is being given to them at a time when the value of whatever benefits they get will be substantially lower because of the rise in prices which has taken place since this time last year and the further rise in prices which will take place at the end of next month. We were told in March, 1951, that the present Government would produce a better social security scheme.  Now, in the broad light of day, we can compare what is in this Bill with what was then offered to the people.  This Bill is not nearly as good as the Bill which got its Second Reading last year.  This Bill is a substantially diminished Bill from the point of view of the benefits which it provides.  The workers were told last year that they would get a better Bill and that they would not have to pay any additional contributions for it. even though they were told they would not have to pay additional contributions.</P>
    <P>But, worse than all that, they now see that this Social Welfare Bill is being financed by contributions out of the workers' pockets, on the one hand, and that they are being made to pay the legitimate contribution which the employers should pay and which the Government should pay out of the increased prices which the workers will have to pay for five staple articles of food, thereby saving money for the Exchequer.  The workers, because they have to pay the higher prices, will be paying their own share, the Government's share and the employers' share of the additional cost of administering this attenuated scheme.</P>
    <P>The workers are being deliberately and frankly spoofed under this Bill.  It is not the better Bill they were promised.  It increases their contributions. <Col N="2238" /> Not only that, but, by raiding and taking from their pockets higher prices for food and for other commodities, the Government are making the workers, who will be covered by this Bill and others who will get no benefit under this Bill, pay the entire cost of financing the scheme.  We can discuss that elsewhere after this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that I regret that the Minister departed from the original Bill by dropping the four main benefits which I have outlined. If he had been responsible for a Bill of that kind, I think it would have brought to him and to the Government and to all those interested in promoting social welfare a very great sense of satisfaction.  But these valuable provisions have been killed.  However, judging by the small majority on the Finance Bill to-day, and the Government's reluctance to test the feelings of the country, it is obvious that it will not be too long until the Government is forced into a general election. The moment that event takes place we need not count upon the continuance in office of a Fianna Fáil Government. That memory will evaporate like the dew.  Any new Government for which the Labour Party will be responsible or with which we will be associated will make provision for retirement pensions, increased maternity benefits, death grants and any other kind of benefit which we think will give to the toiling masses of our people a better standard of living and a reasonable return for the services which they render to the nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane has expressed his intention of dividing the House on this Bill because, he said, no provision is made for the self-employed.  He mentioned such people as the fruitseller in Moore Street and the newspaper seller.  I do not think Deputy Lehane has studied the provisions of this Bill very closely.  As the Bill now stands, it contains quite a number of provisions for the self-employed.  If Deputy Lehane will study the matter very closely he will agree that he cannot provide unemployment insurance for the self-employed.  It is administratively impossible.  It is difficult, indeed, to provide sickness benefit although I think that these selfemployed&mdash;especially the classes mentioned by Deputy Lehane&mdash;will have to be looked after somehow or other when they are sick.  However, it is not a matter for a Social Insurance Bill.  On the other hand, in this Bill and the Bill to follow immediately after this, the case of the self-employed will be considerably improved in respect of old age pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions, unemployment assistance, to which they will be entitled under certain sections at least, and also for children's allowances.  I do not know if Deputy Lehane can suggest anything that could be done for the self-employed.  He did not suggest what could be done and I do not know what could be suggested. However, Deputy Lehane has a perfect right to call for a division against the Bill if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>I must confess that Deputy McGrath raised a point about which I know nothing.  He asked whether the increased benefits will be taken into account when fixing differential rents.

      <P>I should be surprised if he said anything wrong.  Deputy Rooney said that this would be a very insignificant Bill were it not for Deputy Norton's move, which had the full approval of the Fine Gael Party. He attacked my attitude on the famous 1947 motion.  I am beginning to feel rather complimented when I am attacked in that connection because it is entirely unjustifiable and without foundation, and evidently it is the only attack which the Opposition can make on me.  They must have searched the debates and the newspapers to see what they can get to say against me on social welfare, but the only thing <Col N="2241" /> they can get is something that cannot be sustained.  Therefore, I have no complaint with regard to that attack.</P>
      <P>It is rather difficult for a person on this side of the House to keep his temper when he is attacked by a member of the Fine Gael Party in regard to social welfare.

      <P>Deputy Cowan spoke about an interpretation section.  I must say that it is new to me.  I think Deputy Norton will bear me out when I say that the order to the officers dealing with cases in the Department has always been to give the benefit of the doubt to the applicant, whoever the applicant may be.  I am not sure if the section can be improved very much.  However, we can consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey also asked a question in relation to contributory and non-contributory <Col N="2242" /> widows.  As I have said already, I feel that a contributory widow should get more because, after all, she or her husband contributed to that pension and deserves something more than the person who had not contributed directly.  I suppose the other person contributed indirectly through taxes.  If Deputy Hickey has in mind a person who was insured, I think that many of the cases he has in mind will be all right.  Remember we will not be in the same position as we are at the moment when this Bill goes through.  At the moment, if the husband is ill for a long time before dying it may be that he has gone out of benefit and the widow gets no pension. The same thing applies if the husband has been a long time idle.  If the present Bill goes through, if he is credited with contributions and if he is still drawing sickness benefit he will be still in benefit.  If he is unemployed he will still be in benefit.  I think that many of the cases the Deputy has in mind will be all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to workmen's compensation it is a question whether we should consider nationalising workmen's compensation by bringing it into the code or consider whether it is necessary to increase the benefits.  I think it must be one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest nationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we nationalise it the benefits will have to fall into line. These two matters will be considered when this Bill goes through.  Deputy Hickey also mentioned a matter with regard to the widow who comes from England or Northern Ireland.  He stated that such a widow did not get an increase although an increase was given to those resident in Great <Col N="2243" /> Britain and Northern Ireland.  That is a case for the British authority, but I need hardly assure the Deputy that, in any discussions we may have with the British with regard to reciprocity, we shall certainly press that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn raised a question about part-time fishermen.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware that for a person to get unemployment assistance he must first qualify and get a card to show he is qualified.  In order to qualify his yearly means are taken into account.  It is quite true that he may be idle for six months of the year but, on the other hand, he may be earning fairly substantial money for the other six months of the year.  His yearly income may be sufficient to disqualify him from being eligible for unemployment assistance at all.  On that account he does not come in.  That provision was in the code from the beginning.  I do not know whether it will be possible to consider changing that.  It certainly is not possible at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong is that the fisherman's earnings for three months are averaged to cover the 12 months.  That is Deputy Flynn's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton said that even when this Bill was passed our code of social welfare would still be the poorest in Western Europe.  I have gone into the matter to some extent <Col N="2244" /> but it is a very difficult matter to compare. It is very difficult to compare what £2 10s. 0d. a week here would mean for a man, his wife and two children compared with the wage and the cost of living.  It is difficult to make a comparison but I do not think I could agree with the Deputy that our code of social security is the poorest in Western Europe.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said that we promised a better scheme than his in 1951.  Again, we can have a difference of opinion.  Leaving aside the additions that were put on when the Budget came and the benefits resulting therefrom, we had in our Bill a very big improvement in the non-contributory widows' pensions and in the orphans' pensions as well.  We also had an improvement as regards the old age pensioners from the point of view of the means test. The old age pensioners were dealt with in a special way during the last year.</P>
      <P>When I was bringing in my Bill in the first instance, I did mention that we also intended to deal with children's allowances.  As a matter of fact, in the calculation of the finances that I gave I included a certain amount for children's allowances.  I know it is rather confused by what was added on afterwards.  Without the additions put on after the Budget, I think that the position of the self-employed, at any rate, was very much improved.  As the Deputy said, matters remained the same as far as unemployment and sickness were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the four items mentioned by Deputy Norton&mdash;retirement allowances, death benefits and the two items in connection with maternity. As far as the retirement allowances and death benefits were concerned, I was of the opinion&mdash;it is still my opinion&mdash;that the workers themselves would not welcome a scheme where they had to pay for it or pay their share.  In winding up the Second Reading of this Bill, I said I was quite prepared, as soon as we had this over and had settled down to administer under this Bill, by some method to find out from the workers whether they wanted a scheme of that kind knowing <Col N="2245" /> what the benefits were and the cost so far as they were concerned.  I am quite prepared to get down to that matter as soon as we get a little time to settle down under this present legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards maternity benefits, I have held from the beginning that they were like treatment benefits and were really matters which should be dealt with under the health scheme because I do not see what claim an insured man's wife can make for maternity benefit any more than the self-employed man's wife.  They are both equally in need of that particular benefit.  If they are, then it appears to be a matter for the health side and should be dealt with in our health scheme.  I hope to have it included in the health scheme when it comes along.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also said that this was being financed out of the worker's pocket.  I suppose that, in a general way, you can say that everything is financed out of the worker's pocket. He pays his taxes.  It is financed out of the worker's pocket the same as everything else is financed out of his pocket but in our Budget we brought in an increase on income tax which is going to be levied on 18,000 people who are in receipt of comparatively big salaries.  I am sure these would not be claimed as workers by Deputy Norton when he talks about the cost of living.  Some of them may be his supporters but he is not speaking of those people when he is speaking about the cost of living.  At any rate, we can say that far from the whole cost going on the worker there is a bias in favour of the worker and against the better-off sections and these sections will have to pay more taxes under the Budget, including what will be necessary for this legislation than the worker or the person who is not so wealthy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton ended up with a slight prophecy.  I suppose I am entitled to do likewise.  He referred to our small majority on the Finance Bill. That majority is better than the one we got when we were forming a Government, as a matter of fact.  On that <Col N="2246" /> occasion we got a majority of two.  Now we have four.  If we go on like this increasing our majority every few months we will end up with a very big majority indeed in four years' time.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill implements the increases in children's allowances announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget <Col N="2247" /> statement.  Whilst the increases then announced have not been altered in amount, a change has, however, been made in the basis of payment.  Instead of being paid weekly the allowances will on and after the 1st July next be paid on the basis of the calendar month.  The new rates will be 11/- a month for the second qualified child in a family and 17/6 a month for each third and subsequent child.  As compared with the present rates the payment for the second child is new whilst the payment for the third and subsequent children represents a weekly increase of 1/6 for each of those children. The cost of the new proposals in a complete year will be around £2,800,000.</P>
      <P>Apart from the rate changes, this Bill, as Deputies will have realised, is an administrative measure.  I do not now propose to go over the details of the changes proposed in this respect; they have already been fully explained in the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Bill.  I think it well, however, to give the House the reasons which weighed with the Government in agreeing to change the method of payment from the weekly to the calendar month basis.</P>
      <P>Children's allowances are in a different position from other payments made under the social welfare schemes. They stand by themselves, not being coupled with any other payment.  They are relatively small in amount.  It is felt that beneficiaries should be given the opportunity of devoting the allowances to what in the family budget may be ranked as long-term expenditure, such as the purchase of clothes and foot gear rather than to maintenance from day to day.  As the allowances are relatively small in amount, it is only by changing the basis of payment and making a larger amount available in one sum that people can be expected to carry out this idea.  There is little doubt that on the monthly basis the children stand a better chance of having their special needs provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is found that, at present, many persons refrain from cashing their orders until they can collect something <Col N="2248" /> substantial.  In fact, this is probably the most frequent cause of orders going out of date and becoming uncashable. Probably most of the people who do this do so as a means of saving either as an end in itself without any particular object of expenditure in view or to make up the price of something like a Confirmation outfit.  I think myself that this tendency to save should be encouraged and that any change tending in that direction is all to the good. Incidentally, I am taking power in the Bill to extend the period during which orders may be cashed to six months.</P>
    <P>While the decision to make the change has been taken for the social reasons which I have given, the change as it happens will also have administrative advantages.  It should help to relieve congestion in post offices, and the expenses of payment and auditing should be reduced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to add with regard to the abolition of the present system of qualifying dates and fixed payment periods that the change here will bring about a shortening of the delay that, at present, occurs before payment commences.  This delay is a necessary, if unwelcome, feature of the present system.  In the future it is hoped to begin payment on the first day of the month following the month during which the person becomes qualified by having two qualified children normally residing with him, if the claim is made within three months of his becoming qualified.  I want to emphasise the point that children born during the month of May, say, will commence to qualify on the 1st June if a claim is made within three months of the date of their birth.  It is intended that the allowances will be payable on the first Tuesday of each month; for example, the payment for July will be made on the first day of that month.  The Bill is a very simple one as far as understanding it is concerned and with the Explanatory Memorandum I feel that it is not necessary for me to say any more.</P>

      <P>We welcome the Bill but it seems like welcoming friends to a funeral.  We are glad to see them but are sad because of the circumstances in which we meet them.  The friend in this case is the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Bill and the corpse is the Budget which put a damper on the whole business. We are very glad to see the Bill but under the circumstances of the Budget proposals these benefits are a mere crust to the hungry worker who looked forward to an increase in children's allowances.  A simple calculation will show that this Bill in respect of the normal sized family goes only about 50 per cent. of the way to compensate for the increase in price of four or five foodstuffs from which the subsidies were withdrawn in the Budget.  So much has been said, however, about subsidies on the Finance Bill and the Budget that I do not intend to develop the point any further.  It is a good Bill inasmuch as there are increases and that there is now an allowance in respect of the second child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be enthusiastic about some of the administrative changes proposed by the Minister.  It is true that there are many who do not draw the allowances weekly but prefer to let them go on for a month or anything up to three months, but I know of a big number of families who have been in the habit of devoting the children's allowance, whether it be 5/- or 7/6, to the payment of the rent of their house. They looked forward to that as local authorities especially in towns have laid down the regulation that the rent must be collected weekly.  I would humbly suggest to the Minister to accept an amendment which I propose <Col N="2250" /> to table for the Committee Stage which will allow people the option of monthly or weekly payments.  The Minister did say there were quite a number who let the payments go and drew them after a month or two, but I think they would be in the minority and generally I think that if they had the option people would elect to receive children's allowances weekly.</P>
    <P>A very welcome feature is the abolition of the system of qualifying dates. That has been responsible through its intricacy for losing the children's allowance for a six months' period to people who were not conversant with the filling in of forms and who encountered difficulties regarding the business of the qualifying dates.</P>
    <P>That is a very welcome feature because now the regulation as regards applying for and receiving the children's allowance is very much simplified.</P>
    <P>I would merely advocate, in conclusion, another change which would, in effect, be a charge on the Exchequer. Despite that, however, I would ask the Minister to consider it.  The children's allowances are now paid in respect of children who continue at school up to the age of 16.  In other cases, I think, the age is 14.  I would ask the Minister to consider the continuance of these payments to all children who are still going to school. There are a number who continue at the secondary schools, whether Christian Brothers' schools or schools under the direction of other religious orders, up to the age of 18.  From the age of 16, to the time they leave school, represents a period of unusual expense for their parents.  At that age they like to be a little bit better dressed and they demand things that they did not demand when they were slightly younger.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to consider allowing the recipients to opt for a weekly or a monthly payment, and to consider seriously the continuance of children's allowances until the children have ceased going to a secondary school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that, obviously, we must all welcome this <Col N="2251" /> Bill.  I do not, however, understand the approach made to it by the last speaker if, say, he was speaking on behalf of his Party.  As I understand it, the idea behind the introduction of children's allowances was for a specific purpose.  The time had been reached when persons in employment were paid wages irrespective of their home conditions. You had, maybe, a single man and a married man with a large family working side by side on the same kind of work and getting the same wage. Obviously, the man with the family could not have the same standard of living as the single man or a married man with no children.  Consequently, as I understand it, the idea behind the introduction of children's allowances was to try and raise the standard of living in the home of the man with a family so that it would be nearer to the level of his neighbour who had no family.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken did not approach this measure in that way.  His attitude was that this was a measure to relieve poverty.  I have never heard the subject approached in that manner before, and I was surprised to hear him speak in that way.  Does he believe that was the reason why children's allowances were introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of the Deputy's speech is that he related this Bill to the poor and the hungry.  I am just pointing out that that was never the idea underlying children's allowances. All of us, I hope, stand for a reasonably decent wage for our workers so that they will be able to maintain a decent standard of living. We all know that where the circumstances in the homes of workers are different, due to extra charges as the result of one man having a family and his neighbour not having any family, the same standard of living could not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2252" /> It is a good thing that the Government finds itself able to make an advance on the sum provided in the original Act of 2/6, with an allowance for the third child and those over.  I hope that, as time goes on, this Government or some Government of the future&mdash;I hope this Government&mdash;will be able to bring in a proposal for a minimum payment in respect of children's allowances of 5/-.  I hope, too, that there will be a full appreciation of this social service and of this social outlook, and that it will be properly felt when the cost of commodities falls and scarcities will be forgotten.  When there will be a fall in the cost of living, I hope that this particular contribution from the State to even up, mainly amongst the working people, their standards of living by putting them on the same level will be fully appreciated.</P>
    <P>The last Deputy in the course of his speech, referred to the removal of the food subsidies.  I think he might have left that out of this discussion.  All that was discussed on the Budget. This is an item which should be discussed on its own merits.  I suggest that it was a dangerous thing to suggest that it has any relation to the subsidies, because if that were to be accepted, then if the cost of foodstuffs and of the essentials of life were to fall further, you might have it suggested: &ldquo;Remove now the children's allowances because they are not necessary.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to intervene for a moment.  Did not the Minister for Finance in his introduction of the Budget relate the new proposals in respect of children's allowances to the withdrawal of the food subsidies and describe them as partial compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that he could have done that in the words the Deputy has used.  I have already said that the idea behind the introduction of children's allowances was for a specific purpose.  This is a payment that has no means test applied to it. It is not taken into consideration by the income-tax authorities or by any <Col N="2253" /> local authority in fixing the income of a home.  It is an item which is specifically meant for the benefit of the children.  Consequently, I welcome it.  I express the hope that in the not distant future the Minister for Finance will be able to bring the payment up to the figure of 5/- for all children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure. I cannot agree with the view put forward by Deputy Briscoe that this should be some kind of an untouchable gift.  This money which goes into the house of a worker is a very different type of gift from the money which goes into the house of a rich family.  Both families are entitled to it if they have the requisite number of children. Surely, Deputy Briscoe is not going to argue that the children's allowance will be applied to the same purposes in the household of a rich family as it will in the household of a poor family. This is money and not just an unusable gift, something to be admired.  It is, in fact, something to be applied.  The well-to-do family will apply the money in a different way from that in which a poorer family will apply it.</P>
      <P>The benefit which this allowance appears to bring to people has been overshadowed by the Budget proposals. The figure of 1/6, I think, has been mentioned by the Minister. Strangely enough 1/6 is the figure which it was calculated would be the extra charge as regards old age pensioners and other classes who would want one kind of benefit or another.</P>
      <P>We cannot tie up this 1/6 with the calculation that the Budget is going to impose, on the average, burdens of 1/6 per head on the people.  We know ourselves that any child in his health could eat a loaf of bread while waiting for his breakfast.</P>

      <P>I have not reached that age yet, so I cannot say.  This is a relief rather than a benefit and we must approach it in that respect.

It is, in effect, a compensation for the higher prices which will result from the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, and I feel it is a very important advance in our social legislation.  I remember, and most Deputies in this House remember, the long campaign that was carried on for the purpose of getting the principle of children's allowances adopted.  As Deputy Keane reminds me, there is no doubt about the fact that when I was in the Labour Party, children's allowances were one of our fundamental objectives.  I feel that the Government who introduced that deserved congratulation at the time on two grounds, firstly for introducing it and secondly for taking the important step of providing that it would be paid without any means test.</P>
      <P>In my view those were the two most important considerations in regard to the Bill providing children's allowances. Children's allowances have been a wonderful benefit to families in every part of the country.  I have come across instances time after time in the city where calculations were being made in regard to this, that or the other and where the importance of the payment of children's allowances was clearly demonstrated by the parents who were receiving them.  A very big step has been taken&mdash;a step making provision, at a very substantial financial cost, for including the second child in a family under the scheme and for increasing the payments in respect of the other children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill were introduced at another time, a time which one might <Col N="2255" /> term a quieter period in legislation, the Minister would be justified, instead of bringing it in in this quiet and modest way, in bringing it in with a clamour of brass bands and propaganda of all kinds.  It is a very important measure&mdash;a measure that is going to do untold good all over the country. I agree with Deputy Briscoe that it is wrong for Deputies to say: &ldquo;This Bill is being provided as an offset to increases in family costings due to the removal of subsidies under the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the Minister for Finance but about the argument.  After all, these costs may be reduced in time.  I believe that after July, when there is competition as between the flour millers and the bakers, there will be a reduction in the price of bread.  I have no doubt about that.  I believe also that it is likely there will be some reduction in the cost of tea, although it is not a very big item in the family budget.  I do believe that there will be a reduction in its price and that the brands and qualities of tea will be as good as those available at the moment. I firmly believe that other essential items will be reduced in price as time goes on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot look sufficiently far into the future, but whether there is or there is not a decrease in prices, the fact is that, as a result of this Bill, a substantial sum of money will go into the homes of the people in which there are children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill was introduced in different circumstances, every Party in the House would be represented here. The Front Benches of every Party would be here to deal with such a wonderful advance in our social legislation. However, nobody seems to bother about it.  The Minister brings in his Bill, and he explains it.  It is set out in the explanatory memorandum. One is entitled to expect <Col N="2256" /> that all the Parties in opposition would be present in this House and would be welcoming this measure with open arms instead of giving it this half-hearted expression of welcome.</P>
    <P>How is this Bill going to affect the families?  A family having two children who were getting nothing by way of children's allowances up to the present will now receive £6 12s. every year.  Such a sum of money will be welcome in houses in the rural areas, and it will be fully appreciated.</P>

      <P>As I say, this Bill is a Bill that will be welcomed in every house in the country.  It is a Bill that will bestow inestimable benefits; it ought, in my opinion, to be accepted by this House as what it is, a substantial advance in social legislation and it ought to be accepted without any discussion.  The Minister has made the suggestion or does so in the Bill that the payments should be made monthly instead of weekly.  Undoubtedly, monthly payments would lead to expedition or, rather, more efficiency perhaps in the administration.  It may lead to a reduction of staff, in administration, and if it does that it will also help in its own little way to reduce the cost of government.  I do not know whether there is any great objection or whether there could possibly be any great objection to paying these amounts monthly as long as a family <Col N="2259" /> is sure of getting this money and so long as the family spend it well, as they do.  There are many instances of which I have personal knowledge in the City of Dublin and outside in which this money is generally received by the mother of the family and is expended properly in the interests of the family. Perhaps it is just a matter of opinion; it may be that the monthly payments may be of more benefit than the weekly ones.  Anyway, I think it would be well to give that a trial.  We would know after a period whether the monthly payments idea was or was not the better idea, and if it was not we could revert to the weekly payments. This is a Bill which should, unless there is some objection that I am not aware of, pass all stages this evening and we should finish this day's work by completing the Bill as far as this House is concerned.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Cowan saying that this Bill should go through without discussion and yet he discussed it for over 20 minutes himself.  As Deputy Corish said we all welcome the Bill and we hope it will be improved.  I found it difficult to follow the reasoning of Deputy Briscoe as regards his criticism of Deputy Corish.  There is no difference between what Deputy Corish said and what Deputy Briscoe said as to what is the principle behind family allowances.  It is, as both Deputies said, that men with equal incomes, one having five, six or seven children and the other having none, would have their incomes more or less equated as a result of the family allowances.  It is a question of giving the family man a similar standard of living by helping him to rear his children.  There is nothing to gain by questioning Deputy Corish's reference to this Bill.  We were advocating this Bill years ago in the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>For goodness' sake let us not be always boasting of what has been done by either side.  There is a lot more to be done and we should be doing it.  Deputy Corish was not saying anything contrary to what is in our minds about the family allowances Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister that he should continue the family allowances to the children while they are going to school because anybody who is a parent knows that the children are doing their leaving certificate in the secondary schools up to 18 and 18½ years of age.  By stopping the allowances at 16 years of age you are cutting them off at the most expensive period when the family requires the money.  We should continue paying it while the children are going to school&mdash;that is, up to the time they get their leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>On this question of monthly payments, my own view is that it might be a good thing to pay it monthly and it might be better and it might suit a lot of people if the payments were made monthly or quarterly, as the case might be.  But we must not forget this fact: that there are thousands of families whose parents find it very difficult to meet the weekly budget, and I have especially in mind people who are unemployed and who are forced to seek the dole at the labour exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they saw in the papers that the allowances were to be paid monthly, some people came to me and pointed out that it was unfair to ask them to wait for them for a month. They were very well able to tell me, in their own simple and sincere way, how advantageous it was to them to have it paid weekly.  I put forward something similar to what the Minister says, that they could perhaps make better use of it by drawing it at the end of a month or at the end of a quarter, but I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the parents I have in mind can make as good use of 1/- as anyone in this nation or any member of this House.  It does not mean very much to the man with two or three children, but there are a number of other parents with families of seven and eight.  Take the case of a mill worker or a man employed in <Col N="2261" /> a warehouse.  His wages are about £6 5s. a week.  The purchasing power of that must be calculated on the basis of the value of the £ being 9/-, and, where the weekly amount of allowances comes to a sum like 24/-per week, we can appreciate how badly that man and woman will need the weekly payment to make ends meet. I suggest that that aspect be considered.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to follow Deputy Cowan's reasoning that we should accept all these things without discussion. I do not know what his object is, but I will leave it to himself. There is no good in telling us about the big amount we are paying, because it all depends on what you can get for the £ and the standard of living of any individual must be related to what he can get for his money, whether it be £1, £10 or £20.  There is no good in trying to convince ourselves that we are paying a big allowance, because we are paying 2/6 for the second child and 4/- for the subsequent children, because the purchasing power of the £, as the Taoiseach told us last week, is only 9/- and we know then the purchasing power of 4/-.</P>
    <P>I am trying to discuss this matter on its merits, as we should discuss every problem, without any makebelieve or wishful thinking, and I am asking the Minister to reconsider the question of providing for a continuance of the allowance until the children have left school, because, as Deputy Mac Fheórais rightly said, to cut off, at the age of 16, the boy or girl going to a secondary school who will not get the leaving certificate until he or she has reached the age of 17 is a very grave hardship.</P>

      <P>In common with other Deputies, I want to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I was not too well impressed by the attitude of the chief Opposition Party in putting up their youngest child to speak on the Bill.  He was not very enthusiastic in his support.  While the cost of living is high and although the benefits may not appear so formidable, the fact must be recognised that this Bill is a permanent Bill, and the increased allowances given are of a permanent and lasting nature.  Whatever changes may come, the family can look forward to 4/- in respect of each child, with the new provision of 2/6 for the second child.  The provision for the second child is a very far-reaching provision, and it must be remembered that the cost of making that provision is very considerable.  It is important to remember that a very substantial sum of money is being made available under the Bill and that it is being made available mainly for those who are most in need of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many who say, as Deputy Cowan said, that children's allowances in their broad principles are not subject to a means test, but it must be understood that those who come within the income-tax code do not derive the same benefit proportionately from these allowances as those in the smaller income group.  For that reason, I would say that the main benefit of the Bill goes to the ordinary wage earners and people in the lower income class, and I think that is right.  The principle of the Bill is good and the principle of the original Bill is good.  It is a good thing to try to even up the standard of living as between the married man with the family and the single man.  In a society such as ours, <Col N="2263" /> and particularly in a nation such as ours, with its limited resources it is not possible to pay to every worker a wage sufficient to meet all the demands of a large family and, therefore, there is much to be said for the principle of providing an additional allowance out of State funds for the man with the family.  We can look forward with confidence to a time, though perhaps not in the immediate future, when money will be worth more.  I cannot see any great prospect of food prices coming down, but there is a possibility and a probability that other essential items will be reduced, that clothing, boots and fuel may become cheaper. Then the standard of living of our working people will be considerably raised by reason of these family allowances.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with those who favour the payment of children's allowances weekly in certain cases. There are many families who prefer to draw it on a monthly basis, but I happen to know quite a number of agricultural workers with large families who find it difficult to arrange their budget so as to make their accounts square over a week.</P>
    <P>There are many mothers who, after receiving the husband's wages on a Saturday night and purchasing the necessary requirements for the family, find that, by Wednesday, when the children's allowances are due, it is a very welcome addition.  It means that there are two pay-days in the week, though the amount may be small in the second case.  A case could be made for weekly payment in such circumstances, but the change might involve considerable administrative difficulties. I know it may be reasoned, as the Parliamentary Secretary reasoned, that the fact that the amount is due each week may be taken as good security for the provision of necessary foodstuffs. I am not pressing the point very strongly on the Minister, but I am sure he will recognise that there are certain families who welcome the second pay-day, if one may so describe it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it was right for Deputy Rooney to speak so disparagingly of the allowance.  The raising of it means, <Col N="2264" /> in the case of a large family of ten, an increase from £52 to £90 18s. in a year.</P>

      <P>There used to be a time when members of the Fianna Fáil Party, as soon as Deputy Cogan rose to speak, would troop one after another out of the House.  Now they are inclined to stay, and I wonder whether it is to see if his speech is sufficiently sycophantic as to qualify for admission to the Fianna Fáil Party. Apart from that aside, which I could not resist, I want to ask the Minister a couple of serious questions.  If we assume, for the purpose of discussion, that the amount which will be available for the payment of these allowances is £2,800,000, can the Minister give us any figures as to the way in which that amount could have been divided, if, instead of paying an allowance for the second child, there had been increased allowances for subsequent children after the third on some ascending scale?</P>
      <P>I agree with the approach to these allowances that has been made by Deputy Briscoe.  I think they are paid for the purpose of evening up the fact that a worker in industry with large family responsibilities is working side by side with a worker in industry who has not got the same amount of responsibility. That is the correct approach and if Deputy Briscoe sits down when the volume of the debate comes out and reads Deputy Corish's speech he will see that Deputy's Corish's objection to it was that the Minister for Finance looked at the problem in an entirely different way and related it to the Budget.  I think the other method is the right one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Without arguing about the amounts, I would like to know if the Minister has considered, instead of making an allowance payable for the second child, leaving the third as it is and increasing the amounts payable for the fourth, fifth, sixth and subsequent children on an ascending scale, dividing up the total he has available in such a way that the people with really big responsibilities would get proportionately the larger share.</P>
      <P>The other question I want to put to him is on the subject of income-tax. In the Finance Act of 1944 it is provided that children's allowances are exempt from income-tax and are not to be treated as part of means for assessment to tax.  That exemption refers to the children's allowances payable under the Children's Allowances Act of 1944.  I assume that the effect of Section 1 (2) of this Bill, by which this Bill is construed with the 1944 Children's Allowances Act, automatically brings the scope of the allowances paid under this Bill into the exemption that is included in subsection (4) of the Finance Act, 1944, and that automatically without specific reference the allowances are exempt from taxation and are not accountable as means.</P>
      <P>I want to go further in this respect. In the Finance Act, 1944, alterations were made in the rate of allowances given to income-tax payers with children, computed to offset the fact that the children's allowance was universally payable.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, in this Bill or in the Finance Bill that is before the Dáil there is no similar provision.  Can the Minister tell us therefore whether the allowances that will be paid under this Bill will be paid to income-tax payers without alteration in the rate of allowances that is granted for children under the relevant Finance Acts?  In one way, it is not an amendment perhaps for this Bill, but it is obviously relevant to the discussion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the administrative changes <Col N="2266" /> adduced here are good changes, but I would ask the Minister one further question.  When the Minister was considering administrative changes in this Bill did he consider the case that was put to his predecessor, Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who handled the Principal Act, that the allowances should be paid to the mother rather than to the father, or has it been found satisfactory in practice to pay the allowances to the father?  At that time there was a fairly considerable volume of opinion that the allowances would be better paid to the mother rather than to the father.  When I was in the rarefied atmosphere of another Chamber not so very far away from here, there was a discussion in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, said he would like to see how it worked this way before coming to a final conclusion as to whether it might be desirable to transfer it to the mother, as being the person normally responsible for looking after the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish and, I think, other Deputies were rather critical of the system of monthly payments rather than weekly payments. I would earnestly appeal to Deputies not to make it as it were a Party question.  It is well worth a trial.  It is quite possible and indeed probable that many families will be enabled to make some saving by the introduction of the monthly payment system.  As far as the improvident families are concerned, I do not see that they will be any worse off.  I admit that they will get the first monthly cheque in advance and, if they spend it rather improvidently, by the time the next cheque comes along, they will owe it to somebody and will have to pay some debt with it.  On the whole, seeing that we are not going to do any injury to the improvident and may encourage some people to be provident, we should give it every chance.  It can, of course, be changed again.  As some Deputy said, on account of the administration being made easier, it will probably be to the benefit of those who are drawing the allowances because it will mean that everything will be done more promptly and more efficiently. I do not make any great plea on the ground of the saving in administration. There will be some saving, I suppose, but it will not be very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish, and I think also Deputy Hickey, referred to the child who continues at school beyond the age of 16.  There was a provision of that kind up to now for orphans, especially for the children of widows.  Up to the moment, a widow could draw benefit for herself and also for her children up to 14, or, if they were going to school, up to 16.  We have changed that as far as the children of widows are concerned.  We have made it 16 in all cases.  One of the big reasons why we changed it was that it was very difficult to administer, and we felt that there was a fair amount of deception in it, that certain widows were deceiving us.  We were in a position, of course, to check up on it completely, but I think it is wrong that there should be any system where deception is practised, because it is bad for the person who practises it as well as <Col N="2268" /> everyone else.  We changed it in that case and, of course, we had to make it 16 all round, because we would be putting some people in a worse position than they had been.  I do not want, therefore, to lapse into that practice again in the case of children's allowances. I do not want to bring any amendment here that will enable me to pay children's allowances to children over 16 when they continue to go to school.  It is better to leave it as it is, at the age of 16.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Rooney's remarks about the child who eats a loaf of bread before his breakfast, it is only natural to expect that he will eat another loaf before the day is over and he will be much better off because, at present, he has to pay a very high price for the second loaf; he has to buy white bread off the ration.  Under the new system, he will be able to get two loaves of bread at the ordinary price and he will be better off.</P>
    <P>This whole matter of children's allowances is a very costly business. We would all like to do more.  Some of the Deputies who spoke said they would like to see the thing improved and expressed the hope that they would see the matter improved in time. Deputy Briscoe said he would like to see an allowance of 5/- for all children. That would be a very costly business. As a matter of fact, when this Bill is passed, children's allowances will cost £5,000,000 a year.  That is a very big item in a country like this.  It amounts to 5 per cent. of our expenditure.</P>
    <P>Some question arose about a family of ten children.  I think it was Deputy Sweetman who asked if there were such families in receipt of benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to families of 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was ten. There are 692 families where ten children are in benefit; only one family where 14 are in benefit but there is one. I do not know how long that may last because the eldest will naturally pass out of benefit and I have no doubt whether he will be replaced.  There are eight families where there are 13 in benefit.  It gets less, of course, as the <Col N="2269" /> numbers go up.  Deputy Sweetman asked, also, if we left out the second child and spent the same amount of money, what would be the allowance that we could give to each other child. I could make only a rough estimate so I would ask the Deputy not to hold me to it.  Roughly, if we left out the second child, we could have given 5/6 to each other child&mdash;a little more&mdash;5/8 or 5/9.</P>
      <P>We could have given about 5/6 to each child from the third child upwards. If we had left the third child as he was with 2/6, going on beyond the third child, I think it would amount to something about 7/-.  I made a rough calculation as the Deputy was speaking which could not be absolutely correct, but roughly that is how the thing goes.  In this case, where children's allowances were admittedly related to the increase in the price of food, it was thought better to bring in the second child because that means, in fact, that no family will suffer, as a result of the increased price of foods through the withdrawal of subsidies except a family consisting of three&mdash; that is to say, of a father, mother and one child.  If anybody speaks of the increased cost of living as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, the biggest burden that he can claim it will impose on a family will, therefore, be 4/6 a week.</P>
      <P>With regard to income-tax, this Bill does not in any way amend the Finance Act, so that whatever increased allowances are paid will not be subject to income-tax.  As Deputies are aware, there was a provision in one Finance Act, which came after the children's allowances became payable, under which a parent does not benefit to the same extent from other allowances when he is drawing the children's allowance.  Whatever extra amount he is going to draw now will not make any difference if or until some Minister for Finance tries to alter the Finance Act again.</P>

      <P>It will not be taxed as income.  Another question raised by Deputy Sweetman was whether we would reconsider the matter which arose on the introduction of the principal Act as to whether the allowance should be paid to the father or the mother.  I do not think the present system has worked badly.  In fact about half of the fathers have voluntarily nominated the mothers as the recipients and the mothers receive the allowance.  In the other cases, the fathers receive the allowance, but we have got no complaints or at least there have been no general complaints in regard to the system of payment. Deputy Hickey stated an economic fact, that a pound does not matter, that what does matter is what we can get for a pound.  That is an economic fact but the person who has no pound has no interest in the economic fact.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy made an observation which led me to make a note that a nutritional survey was carried out in this country in 1947.  The results of that survey have been published for the last three or four years.  I am sure Deputies have read the reports and I do think they should take a certain pride in the very satisfactory condition of nutrition they disclose in this country.  We compare very favourably with most countries in the world.  I think it was thought at the time that there were only three or four countries that should claim a higher level of nutrition than this country.  That was certainly a great tribute to such a small country as this.  There was, however, one class where nutrition was not up to the average standard.  That was in the case of the large family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to deal with that is to increase children's allowances, so that although this particular increase is related to the increase in the price of food owing to the withdrawal of food <Col N="2271" /> subsidies, we hope, like Deputies Cowan and Cogan, this being a permanent measure, for an improvement in the price of food and in that way there will be a definite gain to the family.  If not, of course, whenever the country can afford to do better in regard to children's allowances, I hope there will be further improvement.  I do not think any other point was raised that would call for any comment from me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see the Minister looking fit and well and I regret that I have to put this problem before him to-night.  It is a problem which confronts country bakeries particularly. The Minister knows that up to the present there has been a system of bread rationing.  He knows also that from time to time complaints have been made in this House to the effect that the bread ration in the rural areas was not sufficient to meet the demands of rural workers.  The problem has never presented itself in the same way in the city.  It has been conceded that in rural areas people need and consume more bread at harvest time and at other times due to the special efforts called for from rural dwellers.  I want to tell the Minister that most country bakers will find themselves in a difficulty when rationing ends.  This is a problem that will confront country bakers as from an early date in June.  Apart from the fact that people living in the cities got far more coupons than they needed, the difficulty in collecting coupons in the rural areas has been greater than in the city.  The result was that country bakers were obliged to facilitate customers who had been on their books for generations, by giving them bread without being able to get coupons from them or on the promise that coupons would be forthcoming later.  It was all very well while the rationing system was in force because the country baker who had fallen back or who had failed to get as many coupons in relation to the unit of bread issued as he should have got, could retrieve his position later.  Now with the end of rationing, he is faced with the position in which, from about the 5th June, he will not have any of the flour left that would be available to him to supply his customers for the whole month of June, if rationing were continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that he will be obliged to seek from the flour millers an allowance from the month of July, if they are prepared to do that.  The difficulty will be only in respect of the month of July, because after July the position in the matter of price will be uniform.  But, if he must purchase his requirements from the 5th June, say, to the 30th June, he will be obliged to <Col N="2273" /> pay the price which will apply in the month of July, which, of course, is the price after the withdrawal of the subsidy on flour.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to carry out some kind of adjustment which will ensure that the country baker will not have to go out of business for the last three weeks of June.  If the country baker goes out of business because he cannot supply his customers in the normal way with bread, another baker from one of the cities or towns will be able to swoop in and take his place, and supply the needs of his customers. It is well known that large bakers in the City of Dublin are able to travel out into the country a distance of 100 miles and deliver bread to people in the rural areas.  They are able to do that because they have an abundance of coupons, which enables them not alone to supply the full requirements of bread to people residing in Dublin City, but to bake a large surplus and go down the country with it in competition with those country bakers who are so short of coupons that they can only give the ration of bread.  It amounts to unfair competition.  The result is that the city bakers are swooping down on the rural areas like vultures, taking advantage of the position, as the number of coupons available to city bakers is more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the city and the immediate vicinity of the city.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that he might be able to carry out some adjustment in relation to the coupons which would enable quantities of flour to be issued to the country bakers to keep them in business.  I am putting the problem to the Minister.  There is no point in going into figures but many small country bakers would be able to tide over the difficulty if they got five or ten tons of flour.  What they are asking for is five or ten tons of flour at the subsidised price in relation to the coupons, otherwise they will be obliged to pay the higher price for flour.  They will have to pay that in order to remain in business, because they cannot go out of business for a few weeks until the 4th July arrives, when every baker will be on an equal basis.  The position <Col N="2274" /> at present is that the larger bakers in the big cities and towns have a sufficiency of coupons to enable them to supply the full requirements of their own customers as well as the people whom these small bakers will not be able to supply.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister understands the problem.  I know that it is a problem which has come upon the country bakers in a gradual way.  It has been coming on the country bakers ever since rationing was introduced.  They have had this difficulty all along, but the biggest fence they have to meet will be in the first week of June and I am asking the Minister to carry out some kind of adjustment which will ensure that these bakers will be able to carry on the production of bread until early July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Minister's reply this evening.  He is quite right in stating that the country bakers were issued with sufficient flour to cover their coupons.  That is all right as far as it goes, but I heard the Minister say some time ago in this House that there was a surplus of bread in Dublin and a shortage of bread in the country.  I think the Minister will remember that himself. The result of that surplus of bread in Dublin was that the Dublin bakers were able to draw so much flour each month that they were not able to sell that large supply of flour in Dublin. Rather than leave the flour in the mills they went down the country and gave out the flour <i>ad lib.</i>  That is well known.  The Minister received several deputations which dealt with that. Provincial bakers had to meet that competition in some way.</P>
      <P>Some of them went so far as to purchase bread from bakers in Dublin in order to be able to give a little extra bread to their customers.  As well as that, they got a small quantity of extra flour in advance in order not to tie their customers down to the bare ration and to be able to give a supply of bread without any coupons.  Some wholesalers were able to get bread from people who could give them unlimited supplies.  Provincial bakers tried to oblige the customers and hold them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2275" /> There will be a crisis in June throughout the country, for the provincial bakers.  They have already overdrawn ten or 14 days' supply when the mills allowed them to do it.  These people, at the end of the period, will either have to buy white flour or to close down.  A lot of them may not be able to afford the difference between £2 and £6, or £4 per sack or £32 per ton.  Ten tons at £32 would amount to £320.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter sympathetically and to try to evolve some way out of the difficulty for these provincial bakers.  He has already stated that there was a surplus in Dublin and that surplus was being sold down the country.  I, therefore, ask him not to give the big city bakers a big advantage over the provincial bakers.  We are all out to keep industry spread throughout the country as far as we can.  If these people cannot supply their customers with bread, they will lose the goodwill which they have built up over years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the rural bakers have been working under a very serious disadvantage for a number of years.  A lot of them have lost one-half or three-quarters of their customers owing to the city bakers having plenty of bread and coming down and selling it in the country. Now that rationing is about to finish, we had an admission from the Minister that it would militate against the rural bakers.  I appeal to him not to victimise them now.  He and his Department are aware that an advance of two or three weeks' supply had to be made to rural bakers.</P>
      <P>They were a fortnight ahead of their quota, and sometimes three weeks ahead of their quota.  If they are to finish out their period it will now cost them, as Deputy Crotty says, anything from £200 to £500.  I know one man who will be mulcted for £500.  I appeal to the Minister, now that rationing is ending, to let it end without victimisation of the rural bakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Crotty realises, the question which Deputy Rooney raised on the Adjournment is <Col N="2276" /> not quite the same as that which he raised earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>So far as the country bakers are concerned, those who kept their sales within the regulations and sold the proper supplies to their rationed customers will have no difficulty at all in respect of flour supplies.  When considering the point to which Deputies refer, I ask the House to bear in mind that a large number of bakers adhered strictly to the regulations and confined their sales to rationed customers. Other bakers did not.  They sold more than they were legally entitled to sell. They got the flour to effect these sales by overdrawing on next month's supply.  Every one of these bakers must have realised that rationing would end some time, and that there would come a last month in which they would be in difficulties.  In fact, at any time in the past few years, when this practice began to develop, it would have been open to the Department of Industry and Commerce to have checked that system of overdrawing, and to require those bakers who had overdrawn to replace the overdrawn flour with flour of 75 per cent, extraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we going to do now with those bakers who have overdrawn and who are not legally entitled in the month of June to the quantity of flour they need to supply their rationed customers in that month?  In point of fact, it would be possible to leave matters as they stand in the knowledge that they would have no option but to replace that flour with dear flour of 75 per cent. extraction.  It is to be assumed that, with rationing ending, no baker would risk an interruption of his supplies because he is going into free competition now and such interruption would be bad for his trade.  In that connection, may I say, apropos of Deputy Corry's remarks, that I did not contend that rationing was detrimental to the country bakers?  My recollection is that I said the reverse and that there was considerable controversy in this House arising out of my remarks.  In fact, I think the rationing system protected a number of the country bakers at a time when they might have been subjected to far more <Col N="2277" /> intense competition from the larger urban bakers.</P>
    <P>The only question that arises here is the question of finance.  So far as those overdrawn bakers are concerned, they will be able to get flour.  I have instructed my Department to arrange that they will get the ordinary 85 per cent. flour that will be in general use this month.  However, I do not think it would be justifiable to give them that flour at the subsidised price.  I think they will have to pay the economic price for it.  What is involved in the suggestion that they should get the flour at the subsidised price is that the taxpayers as a whole would come to the aid of those people who sold bread in excess of the quantity which they were legally entitled to sell and who, by so doing, got an advantage over neighbouring bakers.  I do not think it would be fair to ask the taxpayer to give them a financial advantage by subsidising the supplies of flour they must now buy to offset their overdrawings. As has been pointed out, they will get flour of 85 per cent. extraction at the economic price of that flour.  I do not think it is practical to do more than that to help them in the situation in which they have put themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the point the Deputy is endeavouring to make is that the ration was not sufficient in many rural areas.  That is the case for abolishing rationing in those areas.  I have no doubt that upon these bakers very considerable pressure was brought to bear by their customers to give them at the subsidised prices bread or flour in excess of their legal ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going a bit too far to ask the House to condone these irregularities when one keeps in mind the fact that the regulations were enforced on all bakers and that a number were prosecuted for failing to observe them.  A large number of bakers observed the regulations, and by so doing may have lost the goodwill of some of their customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These could not be classified as irregularities because the conditions obtaining in the rural areas were quite different from those obtaining in urban areas.  The Department did not allow for that difference of demand by the customer for the making of home-made bread.  In other words, the quota was not sufficient to meet the demand.</P>
