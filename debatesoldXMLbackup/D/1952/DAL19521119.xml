      <P>It is not possible to furnish separately the expenditure by tourists in this country in 1951 under the headings specified. Though firm figures cannot be given, it is believed that about one-half of the gross tourist expenditure was on food, drink, tobacco, hotel and restaurant services.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is <Col N="1654" /> aware that broken and damaged machine parts, etc., being sent to Britain for repairs or as patterns for replacement, are being detained at Irish ports for export licences and that this in many cases causes hardship to the exporters, retarding production and possibly causing unemployment; and, if so, if he will ensure that in future the minimum of delay is caused by the customs or other officials concerned and that the matter of export licences will be waived where it is obvious that the items being exported are merely being sent for repairs or replacement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
      <P>Licences are not required in the case of machinery or parts being exported for repair and return to this country. In cases where the export is being effected with a view to replacement, licences are required but I am satisfied that, where the regulations are complied with, there is no delay in clearance at the ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if a consignment of approximately 5,000 tons of timber for building which was imported by a Dublin firm recently was transferred to Belfast; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1655" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the end of 1950 timber merchants were encouraged, by the Government of the day, to lay in stocks of timber, against a possible emergency.  It was considered that stocks should be maintained at six months' requirements, or approximately 80,000 tons, and the timber trade was exhorted to try to reach this target.  In 1951 heavy purchases were made by these firms.</P>
      <P>During the early part of 1952 timber prices on world markets began to fall and by the middle of the year prices had dropped by about a quarter as compared with the 1951 level.</P>
      <P>Last July representatives of the timber trade informed me that the fall in world prices had placed them in an extremely serious position as they were carrying very heavy stocks of high-priced timber.  They stated that timber in stock and purchased represented almost one year's requirements and that the drop in prices had thrown a serious strain on their financial resources, especially as certain firms which had not previously imported timber were availing of the current lower prices to bring in timber thus rendering the high-priced timber more or less unsaleable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timber trade representatives asked that they should be helped to liquidate without loss the stocks which had been built up in keeping with Government policy and proposed that imports should be controlled.  This proposal did not commend itself to me because, among other reasons, import control would tend to keep up building costs.  As an alternative I indicated that the grant of export facilities would be considered to help them to reduce surplus stocks and facilitate the earlier importation of lower priced timber.  The timber trade representatives did not consider that it would be possible for them to avail of that facility to any extent, and up to the present licences have been issued only for the export of 5,745 tons, a quantity which represents less than 4 per cent. of our normal yearly requirements of timber.  I am satisfied that the timber stocks in the country, which represent over six months' supplies, are more <Col N="1656" /> than ample, and that there are no grounds for any anxiety in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the 5,000 tons of timber transhipped to Belfast were sold at a profit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that the reason for the surplus stocks was that building had completely closed down and that the banks had closed down and they had to get permission to tranship surplus timber at an increased price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>How then can the Minister say that the price of timber is down or cheaper in view of the fact that the firm which imported this timber in 1950, on Government orders, for stockpiling&mdash;the Minister denied there was any&mdash;got an increased price the other day in Belfast?</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the timber which has been exported is being sold at a lesser price than the current price for timber here?  If that is so, would it not be obviously desirable that timber merchants here should be required to give first preference of purchase to customers here at the reduced price or to local authorities in order to help them to reduce the cost of timber and, consequently, the rents of houses?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Limerick Bread Price Increase.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Limerick master bakers have recently increased the price of bread to consumers, although no increase in wages has been paid to bakery operatives to justify such increased prices; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent recommendation made by the Labour Court for increased wages in the bakery industry covered bakery operatives in Limerick. The court's recommendation was that wages should be increased from the first pay day in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the operatives in Limerick have not yet accepted the recommendation of the Labour Court. <Col N="1658" /> I assume that the decision of the Limerick master bakers to increase bread prices under the recent Order was based on the expectation that whatever settlement may eventually be made will involve the payment of wages at rates not less than those recommended by the Labour Court and retrospectively to September.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that action to reduce the price of bread in Limerick, pending the settlement of future wage rates in the bakery trade there, would prejudice the prospect of a settlement on those lines.  I intend, however, to keep the position under review and to take such action as the situation may require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Cork bakers took similar action and increased the price of bread for one day?  Then, recognising that their employees were not accepting the proposed increase, like the Limerick employees, the Cork bakers reverted to the lower price.  The Limerick bakers still charge the consuming public an increased price for bread without any justification because they have not paid&mdash;and it is a matter for prophecy when they will&mdash;an increase to their workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection to making an Order reducing the price of bread in Limerick, if I did not lay myself open to the accusation that thereby I was prejudicing a settlement of the dispute along the lines the bakery operatives would desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a first condition of a bread price increase that a wage increase is being paid, and in view of the fact that no such increase has been paid, I should like to know if the Minister will take steps to prevent the Limerick master bakers from continuing to overcharge the consumers there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy assure me that whatever settlement is ultimately reached will not involve a retrospective payment to the date of the Labour Court award?  I think it is a reasonable assumption having regard to the Labour Court's recommendation <Col N="1659" /> that these new rates should operate from the first pay-day in September that whatever settlement is made will be equally retrospective.  If I were to intervene now, I would obviously be making it impossible to negotiate a settlement on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish the Minister to prejudice the proceedings in any way, but when there are conditions in the settlement announced by the Labour Court which are not acceptable to the Limerick and the Cork workers, and which they will not accept, the point is that there is no wages increase being paid.  In those circumstances, the Cork master bakers went back to the old price after one day.  Why should the Limerick bakers not do the same thing and let the matter be settled eventually?  They have no right to charge the Limerick public an increased price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the Deputy, I am keeping the position under review and if the ultimate settlement should not involve retrospective payment at the rates recommended by the Labour Court to September, I will take action to deal with it.</P>

I have not previously received any representation as to the inadequacy of the space provided, but I will look into the matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state when, at the present rate of progress, the current scheme of rural electrification will be completed, and if he will further state the estimated number of homes that on such completion will still be without an electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that, at the present rate of progress, the scheme <Col N="1661" /> for rural electrification would be completed in approximately 12 years from now.  Progress has been hampered by shortages of certain classes of materials and of skilled technicians.  I am hopeful, however, that with a continuing improvement in the supply of materials, and with the availability of an increased number of trained engineers, the rate of development will be accelerated.  It is anticipated that, due to refusal of supply on the terms offered, about 100,000 of all rural dwellings out of a total estimated at 400,000 will be without supply when the scheme is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that the 100,000 include both those who were offered and those who were not offered supply, or is it merely those who were offered and refused?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present arrangement, supply is available to everybody.  In accordance with the original scheme, it is estimated that approximately 70 per cent. of rural dwellings will get a supply at the normal rate of charge.  In the case of the balance, it will be available at a somewhat higher charge.  Every rural dweller will be offered supply but it is estimated that approximately 25 per cent. will not accept supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect that under the original scheme it was decided that supply should be offered where the cost of connection did not exceed 12 times the annual fixed revenue and on that basis it was assumed that approximately 70 per cent. of the rural dwellers would be offered supply.  Since then, the scheme has been modified to permit of the offer of supply to the other 30 per cent. of people, but at a somewhat higher charge, so that supply can be offered to everybody, although in some cases <Col N="1662" /> the charge may be higher than the normal charge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> The direction referred to was issued in the normal course of his duties by the secretary of my Department under practice of long standing concerning the use of official premises for purposes other than official business without the express permission of the head of the Department or his responsible deputy. There is an established procedure by which an appeal may be made to the Minister for the reconsideration of any decision taken at official level on matters of this kind but no appeal has been made to me.  I became aware of the position when my attention was directed to the newspaper article mentioned in Deputy Norton's question.</P>
    <P>I must deprecate the action of those who were concerned to seek newspaper publicity instead of availing of the normal official procedure.</P>
    <P>Permission to use departmental premises for purposes other than official business has occasionally been conceded by an officer responsible when the requirements of the public service so permitted.  If permission is not allowed in any case for reasons which appear adequate to the responsible officer an appeal may be made to the Minister but, as I have stated, I have not been approached in this instance. If and when the officers who desire to be allowed to use departmental premises for the purpose indicated in the questions bring their request before me by the normal method it will be my duty to deal with the matter having regard to the considerations by which the question of the use of State buildings for other than official purposes is determined.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to payments made by my Department by way of hospital benefit for insured persons who were patients in hospitals provided and maintained by public assistance authorities.  As the information is not available for the year ended 31st March, 1952, I am giving, instead, details for the year ended 31st December, 1951.  Being in the form of a tabular statement I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have the statement included in the Official Report.  It should be noted that the payments by my Department are made directly to the hospitals in which the insured persons were maintained and treated.  The amount shown in the statement in respect of each authority is, therefore, the aggregate of the amounts paid in the period to the hospitals under the control of that authority.</P>
      <P>PAYMENTS in the year ended 31st December, 1951 in respect of insured persons in hospitals provided and maintained by public assistance authorities.</P>

      <P>The fluctuations shown in the numbers of dairy and young cattle in the preliminary census statement for June, 1952, as compared with June, 1951, are not of a magnitude to give ground for alarm.  The total number of cattle in 1952 was the third highest in the last 30 years.</P>
      <P>Amongst the measures being taken to promote increased live-stock production are arrangements to secure the best possible prices for live stock and meat exports, improved breeding practices, including the development of artificial insemination with high-class bulls, and extension of the use of veterinary remedies to combat live-stock diseases, such as contagious abortion, parasitic infection, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

Does the Minister seriously suggest to the House that a decrease <Col N="1685" /> of 97,100 in the number of live stock in the country, which includes 24,000 cows, that you might say are the foundation of the industry, is not a serious matter?

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) (No. 2) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House is aware of the fact that under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, Orders made imposing or amending customs duties have to be confirmed by legislation.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm 22 Orders made by the Government in recent months.  The Orders are those scheduled to the Bill.  Of these, the duties, imposed on crystal glassware, venetian blinds, adhesive gums, and iron and steel wheelbarrows, handcarts, <Col N="1689" /> etc. are new protective duties. The Orders relating to razor blades, drinking glasses, knitted woollen fabric, glue, gelatine and size, tanks and cisterns, leather and malt extract and fish liver oil increased the existing customs duties on these commodities. The Orders relating to lampshades, artificial silk piece-goods, brace elastic, woven labels, dolls' clothing and component parts of dolls, hack-saw blades, statues and cotton-wool either extended the scope of the original duties or amended the definitions in regard to them for the purpose of making them effective.</P>
      <P>I presume the House will wish me to give a brief indication of the considerations which led to the making of each Order.  The first relates to the duty on razor blades.  It was previously at the rate of 75 per cent. with a minimum rate of 12/- per gross.  The minimum was increased from 12/- to 24/- per gross.  The original duty was, of course, imposed before the war and changes in values since reduced the measure of protection which it had given.  There are two firms engaged in the production of safety razor blades in this country.  They are selling blades at a variety of prices from a penny each upwards, and their prices have not been increased in consequence of the imposition of the higher duty. Incidental to the development of the manufacture of razor blades in the country increased business is also made available for the manufacture of waxed paper wrappers and similar commodities used in connection with their sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty upon drinking glasses and crystal glassware is a more complicated business.  As the House is aware, the development of the manufacture of glassware in this country was resumed recently.  The company engaged in that industry in Waterford is aiming at the development of an export trade in hand-cut crystal glassware, and to enable it to train staffs in that highly skilled work it was necessary for it to engage first in the production of ordinary soda glass domestic ware.  Approximately, 300 people are employed there at the moment.  The ordinary glassware produced during the training period <Col N="1690" /> was accumulating and it was desired to increase the sales of it.  It is in competition with machine-made glassware imported from abroad which is very much inferior in quality and cheaper in price.</P>
    <P>It is, I understand, the intention of this firm in Waterford to undertake the manufacture of this machine-made glassware at a later stage of its development, but it cannot do that until it has fulfilled its plans for the development of an export trade in crystal glassware when it hopes to be able to shift its workers producing ordinary glassware into that end of its business, leaving scope for the development of the machine-made glass end. The expectation is that when full machine manufacture of ordinary glassware is possible, the costs of production here will not be higher than elsewhere, but in order to get the industry established we have for a period to create a situation in which the ordinary glassware available here will be hand-made glass from Waterford, superior in quality, but also somewhat dearer in price than the imported machine-made glassware.</P>
    <P>The Government took the decision to encourage the development of this industry, recognising that we would have to regard it as a long-term project, and that full-scale development, including the export of crystal glassware, could not be expected for two or three years.</P>
    <P>The industry, as the House is aware, in so far as the crystal glassware end is concerned, depends entirely on the skill of the operatives.  The technique, so far as the manufacture of hand-cut glassware is concerned, has not changed over the centuries.  It still rests entirely on the individual skill achieved by the operatives.  During the period in which the training process is going on, it is not possible to have the complete development ultimately contemplated. In order to assist the industry, and to speed up the stage at which the full development contemplated will be reached, a minimum specific duty of 6d. per article under a preferential rate, increased subsequently to 8d. per article, was imposed on drinking glasses.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  The position, as I explained, is that at this stage they are producing a very considerable quantity of ordinary drinking glasses of the cheaper type by hand. The market for these glasses must be available in this country and it would not be available to the extent necessary if the inferior machine-made glasses were coming in at the same time.  It is only at a subsequent stage that this firm will be able to undertake the manufacture of machine-made glasses.  In the meantime it must dispose of the products of its workers during their training period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  It will not be necessary at this rate once the full-scale development contemplated takes place.</P>
      <P>The next Order relates to knitted woollen fabric.  The effect of the Order is to increase the rate of customs duty on knitted woollen fabric from 37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> to 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  Before the war the duty was at the rate of 60 per cent. and 40 per cent.  It was suspended entirely in 1943 and restored last year at the lower rate.  The decision to increase the rate of duty was consequential on the measures taken to rectify the whole position in the woollen industry, including the spinning end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware from a statement I made last week in relation to <Col N="1692" /> a motion regarding a quota Order, the liquidation of losses arising from emergency stocks of wool tops imported at the request of the Government of the day, involves the maintenance here of wool yarn prices slightly above the prices of imported yarns.  The slump which hit our woollen textile and hosiery industries was of course repeated in other countries and for a time manufacturers abroad were willing to dispose of their production often at cost price and sometimes even below cost.  By permitting that importation, we could have had the benefit of the fall in wool prices earlier but only at the cost of putting our own woollen and hosiery industries out of action.  It was considered preferable to maintain our own industries and to restore employment in them and for that reason the various protective measures to which I referred were taken.  This is one of the measures.</P>

      <P>I agree that if stockpiling is necessary it should be in the <Col N="1693" /> form of raw materials.  But where one private firm is asked to fulfil a national policy in that regard, it creates complications if by doing so it was involved in losses which other firms in the same business had not encountered because the request was not addressed to them. My experience in disposing of this situation confirms me in my belief that, if at any future time national stockpiling is required, the Government will have to take some responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one possibility, but the Deputy will realise the complications which would arise.  The next Order relates to venetian blinds.  This is a small Order of not very great importance.  There is one firm engaged in the manufacture of venetian blinds. It is able to produce blinds of all types and it is doing it with reasonable efficiency.  My feeling is that we should be able to make venetian blinds in this country and that if we are not we can do without them.  The normal market here is not worth more than roughly £15,000 per year, apart from the occasional special order which comes along, such as the one for the Store Street building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order relates to woven labels.  We had a duty of long standing on printed labels used in connection with garment manufacture.  For some time past, the trend of fashion has been going from the printed to the woven label and the firms manufacturing <Col N="1694" /> the printed labels under the original inducement given to them were being affected by that position. I would not have regarded that by itself as a sufficient argument to justify the imposition of the duty on woven labels, but when I was informed that there were arrangements for the production of woven labels and that both would be available from home sources, I recommended an extension of the scope of the duty to include woven as well as printed labels.</P>
    <P>The next is another Order of minor importance and relates to plastic lampshades.  The production of plastic lampshades for our market will not involve very much employment, but there seems to be no reason why we should import them when there are firms able to produce them here efficiently and they are being encouraged by this Order to do so.</P>
    <P>The next Order is of more importance and relates to certain artificial silk piece-goods.  The effect of the Order which was made was to bring within the scope of the existing customs duty upon artificial silk goods all spun rayon cloths, and cloths which are less than two and a half ounces in weight per square yard, and also cloths which are patterned in colour and which are 60 inches or over in width.  I mentioned here last week in connection with a motion regarding a quota Order the problem that was created by reason of this development in the production of spun rayon cloths which did not come under the scope of existing quota Orders.  The manufacture of linings, shirtings, sheetings and tickens has been proceeding here for a considerable time and we had in fact reached the stage at which our own mills were capable of meeting requirements.  It was only, however, when the trend of demand switched over from cotton and union cloths to spun rayon cloth that they entered into the business of producing spun rayon cloth themselves.  That is now being done.  New plant has also been installed by a number of concerns for the manufacture of these lightweight artificial silk fabrics.  It is a very desirable tendency which we are anxious to encourage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> The third qualification to which I referred&mdash;cloth patterned in colour over 60 inches in width&mdash;was imposed to catch artificial silk bedspreads.  There was a duty on these goods before when they were imported separately but the practice had developed of importing them in the piece, that is, with only the warp threads holding one bedspread to another, and in that category they were held by the Revenue Commissioners to be exempt from duty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although the only thing needed was to cut the threads. The effect of this Order is to prevent evasion in this way.</P>
      <P>The next Order deals with dolls' clothing and the component parts of dolls other than rubber dolls and is being imposed at the request of Gaeltarra Éireann.  They are, as the House is aware, manufacturing these goods at Spiddal in County Galway and Crolly in County Donegal.  They have urged that they have reached a stage of development at which protection to some degree would be necessary to enable them to extend their production. The surprising thing is that the protection appeared to be necessary judging by the imports even though the prices at which Gaeltarra Éireann were selling these goods were lower than the average prices of similar imported goods.  There are approximately 87 people employed at present by Gaeltarra Éireann in these factories and it is obviously desirable that we should try to maintain and, if possible, extend that employment in the areas concerned, Spiddal, County Galway, and Crolly, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order relates to glue, gelatine and size and has the effect of increasing the rate of duty from 45 per cent. to 75 per cent. full and from 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. preferential rate.  The position regarding this industry has been causing me some concern because it was difficult to understand why the cost of production here should be higher than in other countries, having regard to certain advantages which <Col N="1696" /> it seemed to me manufacturers here enjoyed.  The volume of imports was not merely heavy but tended to increase and I had received some complaints&mdash; not very many but some&mdash;regarding the quality of the gelatine produced which is, as the House may know, the raw material used by manufacturers of jelly.  Some of our firms have an export trade in jellies and those with an export trade were tending to import gelatine under the drawback arrangement permitted by the Revenue Commissioners when export is involved.</P>
    <P>Having examined the position very carefully I thought it justifiable to recommend to the Government and to the Dáil an increase in the rate of duty provided that satisfactory measures were taken by the firm concerned to improve their manufacturing technique and increase the resources available to them for the development of their business.  These steps have now been taken.  The services of a very wellknown and technically competent French firm have been associated with this undertaking and a complete reorganisation is now in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disposed to agree with Deputy Morrissey in that remark, but it is in progress now and I am hopeful that it will produce the position, which I think we can reasonably expect to reach, where the cost of production of these commodities in this country certainly should not exceed the cost of production anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order, surprisingly enough, decreases a duty.  Under the terms of the trade agreement with Great Britain the British Board of Trade may require the re-examination of a duty by the authorised body in this country which is at present the Industrial Development Authority.  Some time ago they requested a re-examination of the rate of duty on abrasives and following an examination of the matter the Industrial Development Authority recommended that the preferential rate of duty should be decreased from 30 per cent. to 20 per cent.  In accordance with our obligations under the trade agreement we are required to make that change.  I have received some <Col N="1697" /> representations from the firm concerned that the reduction in the duty will adversely affect their output.  Import statistics to-date do not suggest that it will, but if the situation should develop in which it is clear that the reduction in the rate of duty is having too serious an effect on home manufacture then the matter can be remedied only by consultation and agreement with the British Board of Trade.</P>
    <P>The next Order relates to hacksaw blades and was made for the purpose of amending the definition of blades in the original Order.  That Order applied to blades which were 1/2 inch wide or more.  Information conveyed to me, supported by trade and shipping statistics, indicated that blades 3/8 inch wide were being imported instead of the 1/2 inch blade so that the duty could be avoided.  The purpose of the amending Order is to bring blades 3/8 inch wide within its scope.</P>
    <P>The next Order applies to leather. Some time ago I received representations from the Federation of Tanners and Curriers regarding the serious situation with which their industry was faced.  When the trade slump developed last year it particularly affected for a time the footwear industry, and in due course repercussions of that slump came back upon the tanners. The similar slump in other countries created a situation in which, despite certain advantages held here, there was a danger of substantial imports of leather to the detriment of our tanners &mdash;not that leather could be produced better or cheaper than at home but because of accumulated stocks abroad and a desire to dispose of them.  In an effort to get over the slump and to get trade moving again it was decided to impose a customs duty upon leather. The duty now operates at the rate of 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential.  Since then, of course, the situation has changed completely and the demand for leather is now so strong that many of our tanneries are working overtime.  In fact, it looks as if that situation is likely to develop in other countries as well, so that the firms which had ventured into the export business in leather are reporting <Col N="1698" /> substantial orders.  It should be possible to have another look at the rate of duty in this case at a later stage if the present improvement in the industry should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The next Order amended the duty on tanks and cisterns.  The existing duty applied to tanks which were cylindrical or elliptical and it was extended to cover tanks of all shapes, including square tanks.  It was also framed so as to amend another Order applying to tanks of a capacity exceeding 50 gallons by increasing the rate of duty on them.  We have had considerable difficulty in deciding the line of policy to take in regard to a number of our industries using steel.  As the House is aware the price at which steel is charged to this country by British manufacturers is substantially higher than the price charged to British manufacturers. It has not been possible up to the present to procure steel in Belgium or Germany on more advantageous terms.  The position, therefore, frequently arose where it was possible to import from Britain, subject to duty, articles made of steel at a cheaper price than the steel to make the articles could be imported by the manufacturers here.</P>
    <P>That situation is easing now but when it developed we had this very considerable decision to take whether to increase the rate of duty upon articles of steel even though we recognised it would mean that the higher cost steel used in the manufactured product would involve higher prices, or allow our existing steel fabricating firms to go out of business until normal conditions had been restored in the steel industry.  The view that it would be very unwise to allow those firms to suspend operations, the probability that their trained staffs would emigrate and might not be easily replaced, and the general desire to maintain employment in the country, led us to the decision that it was better to try to carry over this temporary but difficult situation and to increase the rate of duty in each case in which it was required. The effect, we recognise, will be to establish for many of these industries a higher rate of protection than was originally considered necessary <Col N="1699" /> or would normally be required. Therefore, I endeavoured to make it clear to the firms concerned that the raising of the rate of duty now is not to be regarded as a commitment to maintain the higher rate of duty indefinitely, that, if and when normal conditions return to the steel industry, when it is possible for our manufacturers to import steel, whether from Britain, Germany or Belgium, at prices comparable to those prevailing in Britain, all these customs duties will be reconsidered. In a number of cases we felt it was necessary in order to keep production going here to increase the rate of duty and this is one of the cases.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also has his contacts.  The next Order applies to statues and statuettes, and again it is only for the purpose of adjusting the definition.  The duty applied to statues of 12 inches in height or higher, and latterly there has been quite a substantial import of plaster statues ten inches in height.  We are therefore amending the Order to apply to statues ten inches in height.</P>
      <P>The next Order is an amending Order dealing with adhesive gums.  It is reasonable to expect that we can produce adhesive gum in this country. It is not possible to give any indication of the number of people employed in its manufacture because the firms that make it are engaged in a number of other lines, but the value of the market has been estimated at over £10,000 per year.  One of the consequences of undertaking the manufacture of these commodities in this country is that there are indirect benefits secured for the manufacturers of packages, bottles, labels and other articles of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order deals with malt extract and preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil.  This is another industry about which I was <Col N="1701" /> very much concerned because there did not seem to be any reason why it did not develop with greater speed as was contemplated when the duty was originally imposed at the rate of 50 per cent. full and 33? per cent. preferential. Having regard to the circumstances under which the commodity is marketed it did not seem likely that adjusting the rate of duty would help very much, but the two firms that are concerned in the production of this commodity considered otherwise.  They felt that the handicap they suffered by reason of the better-known names under which imported products are marketed would be overcome if there was an adjustment of the duty.  The Government accordingly agreed to make it.</P>
    <P>The estimated annual demand here is around 250 to 300 tons per annum valued at between £40,000 and £50,000. The home firms, despite the customs duty, had only about half that market. Various tests which I had made regarding the quality of their products appeared to indicate that they were first-class and that there was no reason to think that the failure of those firms to get the whole of the market was due to any defects of quality.  Neither did it appear to be due to any excessive cost of production.  In fact the situation appeared to exist that, irrespective of the cost of production here or the import duty that we imposed, in pharmaceutical stores selling these goods both the home product and the imported product were sold at the same price.  Whether that is a restrictive trade practice or not is something that we may investigate later.  In any event, it was regarded as a type of industry that we should seek to develop as the basic material is one we produce in the country and, as a further effort towards that end, it was decided to recommend this higher rate of duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include cod liver oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes preparations of malt extract with fish liver oil.  It does not include cod liver oil by itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order was also designed to amend a definition so as to make a duty previously established effective, <Col N="1702" /> that is, the duty upon cotton-wool and wadding and manufactures thereof. That duty was expressed to apply to cotton-wool and wadding made wholly or mainly of cotton.  Latterly, imports have been taking place of a mixture of cotton-wool and cellulose material which the Revenue Commissioners held was outside the scope of the Order and the purpose of this Order is to amend the definition of the duty so as to make it apply to cotton-wool whether or not it contains a proportion of cellulose material.</P>
    <P>The next Order is also a small Order. We had a duty on braces but apparently the cut parts of braces were held not to be within the scope of the duty, that is, cut parts of braces of an elastic character, and the purpose of this amending Order was to apply the duty to brace elastic so prepared as to require nothing except stitching to make it into a pair of braces.</P>
    <P>The final Order deals with iron and steel wheelbarrows and hand-propelled cars, trucks and trolleys.  This is a new Order.  There are three firms which have commenced the manufacture of these iron and steel wheelbarrows and while, until recently, they have been developing and developing quite satisfactorily without the aid of any duty, fluctuations in steel prices tended to affect their position as in the case of other firms using imported steel, and they applied for the imposition of a protective duty.  Having regard to the quality of their products, the satisfactory prices at which they are being sold and the capacity of the three firms concerned, it was considered reasonable to give them protection at this juncture and a duty at the rate of 37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. preferential was imposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>These are all the Orders to which this Bill relates.  If any Deputy wishes to single out any particular Order for discussion or desires to secure the repeal of any of these Orders, it would be more appropriate to attempt to do so by amendment on Committee Stage rather than at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to oppose this measure but it is a very <Col N="1703" /> important measure and it presents an opportunity to the House for what I hope would be an important discussion. I am sure that, so far as the majority of the Orders are concerned, the Minister was satisfied that he had to make those Orders amending existing duties either up or down, whatever way it was necessary, because of changing circumstances.  I am equally satisfied, of course, that the Minister made some of the Orders with a certain amount of reluctance.  I do not think there is a shadow of doubt about that.  Unless there has been a very substantial improvement in the position since my time in relation to some of them, I would be very reluctant to make the Orders.</P>
      <P>This is a measure which should be, and I hope will be, discussed here, in so far as there will be a discussion on it this afternoon, in an entirely non-Party manner.  All of us are interested in safeguarding our industries and helping them to expand and to meet in an ever-increasing degree our own requirements at least, apart altogether from an export market.  We ought not to forget that there are at least three parties concerned.  Generally we concern ourselves with and talk about the manufacturer and employees and are inclined to forget, or to give less attention to, the people who have to purchase the products of the factories and use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us some very useful information and a fair review of each Order and the reasons for it. But there is an aspect of this matter that should be brought under review. I am inclined to think the Minister would agree with me on this.  We have in this measure, and in other duties that are not covered by this measure, a range of duties that have applied to particular industries over a great number of years, industries that received a very considerable measure of protection in their earlier years in order to give them what they were entitled to get&mdash;an opportunity of getting on their feet and trying in a reasonable way to meet competition. The House and the country are entitled to know to what extent these industries which got protection, some <Col N="1704" /> of which costs the community very considerable sums, have progressed.  To what extent have they increased their capacity to meet the requirements of the home market?  To what extent has their management improved? To what extent has the skill of their operatives improved?  We are entitled to know whether production and quality have been stepped up.  Or are we to take it that because a particular industry was protected, protection must be maintained for all time irrespective of lack of effort on the part of those engaged in the industry?</P>
    <P>We must remember that the purchasing public are entitled to a fair break just as the manufacturer, the management and the employees are entitled to a fair break.  It behoves us, particularly in present-day circumstances when the cost of everything is tending so high, to examine each proposal very carefully indeed and see that only the minimum amount of duty that is required to safeguard the industry is given.  Making full allowance for the abnormal conditions, particularly of the last two years and more particularly of the last 12 months, in relation to certain industries, we would require a good deal of satisfying that it is necessary to double the duty as some of these Orders propose to do.</P>
    <P>It would not be right, in the absence of the fullest information, to single out any particular industry covered by these Orders, but I think the time has arrived to review the effectiveness or otherwise of the protection we have given to various industries over a long number of years, to see whether those industries are doing all they can to put themselves on a footing to meet outside competition.  I know that many of our industries have made very considerable progress and have brought themselves to the stage where they are able to put on the market here articles that can compare more than favourably in price and quality with anything from outside. I know also that you can have an Irish article of equal if not better quality than a British article, selling at the same price or slightly less, and still the British article will get preference from those engaged in the wholesale or retail trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> It is our duty to deal with the situation such as the Minister has outlined in relation to steel.  That did not arise for the first time in the last 12 months or two years.  On more than one occasion over the last five or six years British manufacturers could put fabricated steel on the market here at a price equal to or even lower than that at which our people here could buy the raw steel.  One has to take very special steps to deal with a case like that.</P>
    <P>I am handicapped in this discussion, as it would not be right or desirable to go into details.  Probably it would be misunderstood and misrepresented outside and used to the detriment of the particular firms.  There are one or two of those Orders I would like to criticise in some detail, but it probably would not be fair to do so.  At the same time, one must have very conclusive evidence when one agrees to double an existing duty.  We do not want to find that, in order to preserve a particular industry and keep a certain number employed, we are inflicting on the consumer a far heavier load than he should be expected to carry.  It has happened&mdash;I do not know if it is still happening&mdash;that in relation to certain products here the cost to the community was far in excess of the whole amount that was paid in salaries and wages to all the employees of that particular industry. There were certain products where it would have paid the State, acting on behalf of the community, to tell those engaged in that particular product: &ldquo;Close the door and go home and sit at the fire and we will send your wages and salaries every week.&rdquo; The State would have saved money by doing that.  It might be desirable to keep certain industries going, even at some cost to the community in excess of what we would pay by way of keeping the people in employment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of woollens and worsteds and wool fabric.  There is a good deal which might be said one way or another about that.  I have to satisfy myself that the Minister has gone very fully into it and has given only what he felt was due in justice to those who did stockpile.  I <Col N="1706" /> would suggest to him that he might keep a pretty close eye on the situation there and keep a very close eye also on the situation in relation to tanners and leather.  I do not want to see any manufacturer victimised or unfairly treated, but on the other hand I do not want to see them getting more from the community than that to which they are justly entitled.  I know it is easy to say that and that it is not so easy for the Minister to devise measures to bring about that exact balance we all would wish to have.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about the Waterford glass factory.  I agree entirely with what the Minister proposes to do in relation to this factory, even though for a considerable time our people may be deprived of the opportunity of buying a cheap type of glass that might suit them.  I think there is something in that Waterford glass factory we can be proud of, that there is something to be built there, that what they have placed on the market already, certainly in the crystal glassware I have seen, is very creditable indeed to them.  I can only hope that it will be possible for them to bring that hand-made, hand-cut glass within the reach of a greater number of our own people.  I think it is a very fine industry and I fully appreciate that an industry of its kind that has to train its operative must get a reasonable chance to make progress.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am rather handicapped because I cannot particularise or deal with particular industries. Perhaps this is not the time to widen the scope of this debate, but may I respectfully suggest to the House that, if the Minister provides the opportunity, the House should take the opportunity to discuss fairly fully this while question of protection?  There is very little difference, if any, between us here on this matter.  Our obligation is to give what protection is necessary to enable people to start and maintain an industry for the production of goods which otherwise we would be importing. The great majority of our manufacturers have played the game.  A number of them have not&mdash;quite a considerable number.  Some of them, when a certain situation was reached <Col N="1707" /> for which they were largely responsible themselves, came to the Department looking for assistance, demanding assistance, almost dictating to the Department, with the threat in the back of their minds of using the workers' employment&mdash;that if they did not get what they required from the Department they would dismiss employees&mdash;and they used that as a big stick to beat the Minister.  I want to say this for the Minister if he will not say it himself.  Unfortunately some of these people have been supported on many occasions by Deputies and trade union leaders in that attitude.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Dunne that the ordinary person can get the information.  While saying that, I want to say in all fairness and for no other reason that the majority of our manufacturers have made a good job of their business.  We ought not forget that in many cases they have had to establish and try to build and expand their industries over a period that has been at no time, I could safely say, within the last 15 or 16 years, in this country normal.  I do not think you could say that we had one normal year from the point of view of business, industry and agriculture during the last 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it appeared that the market was open to them, then our industries <Col N="1708" /> were handicapped because they could not get the raw materials or get them at a price that made it possible for them to produce articles economically.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not opposing this measure.  I think it is a necessary measure.  I may have and, indeed, I have certain doubts in relation to a couple of Orders, but I suppose one should not do anything drastic until one is perfectly satisfied that one has done everything that one could be reasonably expected to do and that a person who is seeking and enjoying this particular protection will do his part.</P>

      <P>I was very interested listening to the Minister going through the various Orders and I must compliment him because of his anxiety to encourage Irish industry.  Irish industry has a great deal to be thankful for to the Minister.  I hope that the people who have benefited by his encouragement will act accordingly.</P>
      <P>What I mean by that is that we as a Party have always been anxious to encourage Irish industry. To encourage Irish industry the Minister and his Department have put on tariffs.  I hope that the people who are getting the benefits of those tariffs will be as honourable with the Minister and his Department as they have been with them.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal in what Deputy Morrissey said a few minutes ago.  He was honest enough in certain criticisms and to that extent I can go some of the way with him.</P>

      <P>Instead of being critical of either our Party or the Minister, industries which have enjoyed protection over a long period should now give a lead to the country.  A number have done so and have done well.  The Minister is trying to create employment for the worker and in order to do so he has to give reasonable protection since our industries are up against competitors who have been in the field of industry for generations. It is very hard for such industries to carry on here and it is very hard to encourage people to invest money in <Col N="1709" /> Irish industries unless they are assured of some return.</P>
      <P>The present Minister succeeded in encouraging a number of them to put money into Irish industry.  A number of the tariffs introduced by the Minister affects factories in my own constituency and I welcome them because it is good to create more employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when speaking, mentioned that a number of our manufacturers, when selling a particular line, were up against prejudices with wholesalers and importers who say: &ldquo;We have been buying from the old firm for ever so long.  My grandfather, my father, my relatives, directors and co-directors bought from this particular firm and we have long associations with them and they gave us satisfaction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No matter how you look at it people are conservative and it takes a long time for them to change.  I hope the action the Minister has taken to-day will be appreciated by all concerned. I hope it will be appreciated that anything he has done was done in the interests of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>As I told the House already, the Minister has a grave responsibility towards the country and to everybody in it.  He is endeavouring to see that an even keel is maintained and that the burden of any increased tariffs is fairly distributed and is in the interests of creating Irish industry. A Minister who takes a decision of that kind has a grave responsibility to the country as a whole and to everybody else concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nice to see the historic Waterford glass factory going strongly again. I hope it will continue to do so.  The outlook seems bright in regard to the other small industries that were started <Col N="1710" /> here.  The manufacturers have a grave responsibility to this nation and I hope that each and every one of them will give the same amount of goodwill to the Minister as he is giving them in affording them this encouragement and protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey said, the Minister has undoubtedly gone a long way to help home industry in a very substantial measure and I feel that the greatest indication of appreciation that could be shown to the Minister and his Department would be a reciprocal gesture by the manufacturers towards the Minister.  It will be gratifying to the Minister to know that, by the imposition of these duties, he has assisted Irish industrialists to produce and put on the market stuff which is well able to compete with material manufactured in any part of the world.  I am afraid, however, that, at times, these industries which have been safeguarded by tariffs and quotas more or less exploit the advantages afforded to them by the Minister.</P>
      <P>There was a case quite recently in my constituency of a small company which started in a modest way.  I do not propose to mention the line of goods they produced, but, like Deputy Morrissey, will confine myself to generalities rather than pinpointing.  A certain home-made product was required for that industry and the difference in the quotations by two Irish manufacturers was such as to appeal anybody.  If the Minister would like to know the details, I can let him have them, but I do not propose to mention them here because the particular line of goods I am speaking about would be known.  That is not fair to the Minister, to his Department, to the Government or to the House, where every Deputy, irrespective of Party, will be wholeheartedly in favour of the imposition of these Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Burke, whom I may describe as the panacea for all evils&mdash; he proved that quite recently&mdash;says, there must be, even on the part of labour, a fair return given for the advantages which are put in the way of both labour and employers by these Orders.  We must try to provide the <Col N="1711" /> best article at the best price, and by that I mean the best price to the purchasing public who will have to pay when these impositions are put into operation.  The honest industrialist, I agree, will make his goods available at the very minimum cost.  Other industrialists may think that, by handling the minimum amount of stuff, they will make the maximum amount of profit by charging maximum prices, but I am sure that the Minister under another Bill will keep his eyes open, so far as those people are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have experience of old established manufacturers in this country who put articles on the market that compared very favourably with any article manufactured outside and these manufacturers, let it be said, have very little trouble with their employees.  Any amenities to which the employees are entitled they get.  They get a fair wage for a fair day's work and, in addition, these people are progressive.  If there is any modern machinery to be got, they will get it in and will keep abreast of the times, and they will not go to the Minister every second day, hats in hand, asking for assistance.  The Minister has undoubtedly gone a long way to give very substantial relief and assistance to Irish manufacturers and I hope that, as a gesture of appreciation, the Irish manufacturers will pass it on to the purchasing public.  That will be the best token of appreciation that can be paid by them to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general policy of the present Government and of past Governments so far as they have made provision for protective tariffs as a means of developing our industries, and I will continue to give support to that policy, whether operated by the present Government or a future Government.  We have to be very careful, however, and Deputy Burke will realise what I mean, not to allow the protection we are now giving to various firms to be used as part of a machine for fleecing the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to deal with any particular industry&mdash;I could if I wished, but I will refrain from doing <Col N="1712" /> so at the present&mdash;but I want to remind Deputy Burke that if he wants any proof that such a thing has been and is being done, or is being attempted, he can find the justification for my statement in that regard in the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.  That Bill is not being brought in, I assure him, without genuine reason and justification. It is brought in for the purpose, amongst other things, of preventing firms who have got the benefit of protection through this House from fleecing the public through trade rings and other such methods.</P>
    <P>We had a statement made in public quite recently by one of the biggest traders in this country that were it not for the activities of rings, including manufacturers who got the protection of Orders of this kind, the prices of certain essential commodities could be brought down by 20 per cent.  That man knows what he is talking about because he speaks from experience. Over a year ago I reported a certain manufacturing firm to the Minister for taking orders, confirming orders and subsequently refusing to fill those orders.  I do not know what action was taken by the Minister at the time in relation to that particular Donegal firm&mdash;that is the nearest I will go to identification&mdash;but recently I received some correspondence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be widening the scope of the debate.  His remarks would be more relevant on the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect, and I have good grounds for suspecting, that one of the Orders we are now discussing confers a benefit on the firm concerned, otherwise I would not raise the matter. If I am wrong, I am sorry.  I do not think I am far out, though.  I would ask the Minister to say, and I am sure he will have no hesitation in saying it, that any firm that gets the benefit of Orders of this kind to help it to build up an industry to supply our people with essential commodities should be established on some rule or standard of honour and that when such a firm takes an order from a reputable firm it will not be allowed later on to refuse to fill <Col N="1713" /> that order thereby leaving the wholesale firm and its 3,000 customers without essential commodities.  I doubt if the Minister would give such a firm the benefit of an Order of this kind and it is with some reluctance, because I support the general policy, that I would vote for an Order amongst the many we have before us now that would confer such a benefit.  Something should be done to bring a firm of that kind to some sense of its responsibilities because the firm is responsible to the community as a whole which is indirectly taxed to keep the particular firm in operation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general policy of developing industry, I was led to believe&mdash;I may have been misled or I may have misunderstood&mdash;that when we give the benefit of protection and trade loans and all the other assistance that can be given to our own citizens, plus the aid of technical advisers from outside, we do so on condition that the financial structure of our major industrial concerns will be reviewed at the end of a reasonable period, say, at the end of ten years.  I know reputable firms which have made an honest attempt to comply with that policy.  I know others that have made no attempt to do so.  I know some that are trying to evade their responsibilities in that particular regard.</P>
      <P>I read the balance sheets of some of these industrial concerns.  Naturally enough I take an interest in the ones that are situated in my own constituency. I can read and understand a balance sheet fairly well.  Half my business experience over 40 years was confined to the preparation and examination of balance sheets.  I am not a certified chartered accountant but I can assure the Minister that I know the meaning of a reserve fund, the meaning of a 12 per cent. dividend plus bonus and the meaning of a huge amount set aside for reserve.  If a firm can set aside more than the subscribed capital inside a period of ten years for reserve purposes, somebody must pay for that, plus paying for a dividend of 10 or 12 per cent. and a bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that it is an easy way of hiding reserves and hiding profits in so <Col N="1714" /> far as those who do not understand balance sheets are concerned.  The shareholders understand perfectly well because they get the scrip and they are able to cash it.  It is the community who must provide the excessive profits.  I hope I am not wrong in thinking that the Minister will deal with many of these firms under the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill when it comes into operation.  I do not want to develop this discussion on a line that might be misunderstood and would certainly be misrepresented.</P>
    <P>Anybody who says anything here or is any way questions the activities of any of our manufacturing industries is supposed to be opposed to protection and opposed to the development of our industries, but I know what that protection means to some people.  It means that manufacturing concerns which have no regard for their responsibilities to the Minister or to the public, who provide these tariffs and have to pay for them, want to cover up excessive profits and cases of the kind that I have briefly mentioned here to-day.</P>
    <P>It is with considerable reluctance that I would vote for one of these many Orders giving further protection to an industry that would regard it as decent in trading circles to accept orders from reputable firms and subsequently refuse to fill them because of a desire to get a higher price for the commodity for which they originally accepted the order and make a higher profit.  I hope the Minister, through the ordinary administrative and supervisory methods of his Department, will deal with glaring cases of this kind and apply to them the full force of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill when it becomes law.  The public should not be fleeced by manufacturing concerns of that kind and wholesalers should not be at the mercy of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin has expressed the anxiety many people feel because of the manner in which tariffs are granted and because of the manner in which they are maintained. While realising that this may not be the appropriate occasion for a general discussion on the tariff policy <Col N="1715" /> of the present Government, I would like to make one suggestion at this stage.  I believe the existing method of granting tariffs should be altered.  Some independent body such as the Industrial Development Authority, should have control over the recommendation and issue of tariffs and over the review of tariffs.  An annual report giving information to the House and to the country generally of the operations of industries subject to tariffs should be available.  The matters which have to be taken into consideration when the granting of tariffs, or their maintenance is under review are frequently not at the disposal of Deputies when they are presented with a Bill of this kind. Details of a number of matters which we have to decide are not at our disposal. For instance, we cannot know what the proposed exportable capacity will be of the industry which is to obtain the tariff.  We may not know&mdash; the Minister himself may not know&mdash; what the retail cost of the goods will be.  We should like to have an estimate of the employment which the industry will maintain.  These are matters of vital importance in deciding whether a tariff should be given or maintained.</P>
      <P>It is well known to every Deputy that there are industries in this country which have been carrying on business for many years behind the protective tariffs while, at the same time, the goods which they produce and the employment which they give do not warrant the high cost of the goods which the public have to pay.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with the Minister that it is right, in principle, to give a tariff to a new industry which is starting, as, for example, the Waterford glass industry, it seems to me to be proper that an independent body such as the Industrial Development Authority should be there to watch over the manner in which this particular industry and other industries with a tariff works and should be in a position to report to this House and to the public on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, the figures of the proposed employment in <Col N="1716" /> the Waterford glass industry and the existing employment in the two factories which he mentioned and which at present manufacture razor blades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Costello, the number employed in the manufacture of drinking glasses and crystal glassware is at present slightly under 300.  In the case of razor blades, my information is that approximately 90 persons are employed at the present time.</P>
      <P>I want to say, in connection with Deputy Morrissey's observations&mdash;particularly with regard to the Orders scheduled to this Bill which provide for increased rates of duty&mdash;that I would not regard these higher rates as permanent.  In the majority of the cases, the duty was increased to offset difficulties arising from a temporary situation and provides protection at a higher rate than I would regard as justifiable or necessary in normal circumstances. I agree that at some time we shall have to have a review of all our protective duties to satisfy ourselves that the developments which were anticipated when they were imposed have in fact been secured and that the maintenance of protection at the rate originally deemed necessary is still required.  One would naturally prefer to undertake a review of that kind at a time when material costs and wage rates were more or less stable so that a fair comparison between productive efficiency here and elsewhere could be made.</P>
      <P>I have said already and I repeat now that in my view any industry in this country which is producing goods at a higher cost than similar industries in Great Britain is under an obligation all the time to justify that higher cost. I do not say that it may not be justifiable in some cases either because of higher material costs, adverse factors arising out of local conditions, or the scale of operations here.  The onus of justification is on the firm which is unable, in normal times, to get down to the level of the prices operating in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this to Deputy Davin, because I think it is important.  The <Col N="1717" /> existence of a higher level of production costs here is not necessarily due to the avarice of industrialists or the inefficiency of their equipment.  Other factors can operate also.  If we find that some industrialist is taking too much profit or that he is not keeping his machinery at the proper level of efficiency, it is comparatively easy to deal with him.  It is much more difficult when, behind the protective tariff, a level of labour costs is established&mdash; either because of the elevation of wage rates or the institution of labour utilisation practices&mdash;which is substantially higher than in Great Britain.  That cannot be so easily dealt with.  In any review of our industries, in any investigation of their production costs, in any inquiry which might lead to a revision of protective rates, that is a factor to which account would also have to be given.</P>
    <P>I am personally perturbed to see that in some industries a tendency is developing to establish not so much wage rates as labour utilisation practices which put the labour costs of production here permanently higher than those in Great Britain&mdash;and in some cases at the instance of trade unions which operate also in Great Britain and which seek a different type of agreement here.  It is clear that at some stage, if that operates&mdash;it may not necessarily so operate&mdash;but if it operates here to put our costs on a basis permanently higher than in Great Britain we may have to take a look at the level of protection afforded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is already operating to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In some industries I am afraid it is operating already.  I was very glad that Deputy Morrissey found it possible to approve of what we have done in regard to the glass industry in Waterford and of his acceptance of the fact that it involves the maintenance of that policy over a period of time.  I am the last to forecast the possibility of any political changes but it is satisfactory to know that, if the worst should happen, the present policy will still be maintained in relation to that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> I am not quite clear what Deputy Davin had in mind when he referred to a reconstruction of the financial structure of industrial undertakings after ten years.  I think he must have misunderstood some provision of the Control of Manufactures Act in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean is this. Outsiders&mdash;people who are not natives of this country&mdash;were allowed to come in here on the basis of the 1949-1951 period.  It was generally understood that the particular industries would have developed here inside a period of nine or ten years so as to relieve those people and let them pass out, thereby getting complete financial control of the particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreements may have been made between the partners in a particular enterprise to that effect but there is no such statutory obligation in regard to time limitation set out in the Control of Manufactures Act.  It is to be remarked that many of the companies which started here under a licence under that Act&mdash;companies with a predominance of external capital&mdash;have since been transformed into Irish companies which can operate without that licence.  There is no time limit for such change in the Act itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not fixed in the statute but is it not desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, but it is difficult to lay down a general rule in a case of that kind.  I think it is true to say that the majority of our industries have substantially increased in efficiency since they started.  No doubt, there is always the temptation. where protection is afforded and comparatively easy marketing conditions prevail, to fail to modernise production technique or to install new equipment as it becomes available.  I think we can, however, by various devices keep up pressure which will ensure that these improvements will come about. The Department of Industry and Commerce is at present engaged in a systematic review of all industries.  On the basis of these reviews, decisions are being taken as to the action which <Col N="1719" /> the industries concerned should be required to take in order to secure better results than they appear to be getting at the present time.  While at the moment these reviews are being undertaken by departmental officers, and the action following on them is administrative, I agree that at some stage, when conditions are more suitable than at the moment, greater publicity can be given to the situation in each industry and public attention directed, not merely to the progress made or the progress possible but to the immediate changes which are desirable and which, if applied, would either increase output or reduce production costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to continue in operation the existing Rent Restrictions Acts for a further period of one year, that is to say, up to the 31st December, 1953.  The present Acts give protection to a large number of tenants against arbitrary increases of rent or arbitrary demands for possession, and I think that all sides of the House will agree that there can be no question of allowing these restrictions to lapse at the end of this year.  In fact, I think it most unlikely that the necessity for maintaining the present controls will cease for some years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill proposes to prolong the operation of the Acts for a further year.  The reason for not specifying a longer period is that it may be necessary to enact a substantial number of amendments to these Acts, or perhaps to enact a new statute of a comprehensive character, when the recommendations of the Rents and Leaseholds Commission, whose report I have received, have been studied and decisions taken upon them by the Government.  This commission, Deputies <Col N="1720" /> will recall, was set up in October, 1950, to inquire into the working of rent control, and the Rent Restrictions Acts were continued for a period of two years in the hope that the commission would report in time to permit of the preparation and enactment of any necessary legislation before the Acts expired at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The commission presented their report on rent control on the 24th June last.  It is now being printed and will be published shortly.  Without revealing the contents of the report, which are confidential until it has been published, I can say that the commission have made a large number of recommendations, many of which are of a complex character.  Obviously it would not be possible to give these recommendations the thorough examination which they require and to draft and pass into law before December next whatever legislation may prove necessary.  This Bill provides the necessary &ldquo;breathing-space&rdquo;.  Examination of the commission's proposals is proceeding and during the course of the coming year the House will, I hope, have an opportunity of considering the Government's proposals in the matter.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I think I should say a word about the significance of Section 2 of the Bill.  The present Rent Restrictions Acts contain special provisions which enable landlords who incur, or have incurred, expenditure in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent on exceptional repair work during the pairs of years 1945/46 to 1951/52 to add a graduated percentage of the excess expenditure to the controlled rent.  As the Bill proposes to continue the Acts in force for a further year, it is necessary to provide for the application of these special provisions to any work carried out in the two-year period 1952/53.  This is done in Section 2, which follows the precedent of the 1950 Continuation Act.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has been very unfair to the House in his introduction of this measure.  Let me say, of course, that as the Minister failed to bring in a <Col N="1721" /> new Bill since June last, it is essential that power be given to continue the present Act in operation but that fact does not exonerate the Government or the Minister from the responsibility they have and does not relieve them of condemnation for their actions in delaying, first of all, the publication of the report and secondly, for their failure to come to a decision on the report.  When I as Minister for Justice introduced a Continuation Bill in 1950 I was jeered at, scorned, and held up to ridicule by the Minister, Deputy Boland as he then was, and Deputies sitting behind him on these benches. They charged me with shirking responsibility when I set up a commission to inquire into the matter.  The Minister has been kind enough to say this evening that the commission has made recommendations of a very comprehensive and complex nature.  Therefore I presume that when the Minister and his back-benchers, Deputy Moran in particular, said that any Government or any Minister could solve the matter in 24 hours in 1950&mdash;the Minister has found it impossible to solve it himself since the 24th June last and that is considerably more than 24 hours&mdash;they were not then aware of the length of time it would take to deal with the problems that have to be considered. What I particularly complain about is that the Minister has not published the report of the commission since June last and, secondly, that he now comes in with this Continuation Bill. When the Minister was in opposition, he said that I could proceed with a new Bill without the slightest trouble and that I had made a very bad case for the continuation of the existing Act.  If I made a bad case for the continuation of the Act at that time, it was certainly better than the case the Minister has made for it now, because he made none at all.  It is agreed however that we must have this Bill because a permanent amending Bill is not ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My defence for not allowing the Bill to lapse two years ago was that it would be unfair to let it lapse at such short notice, that people should get an opportunity of making their case, and that, for the purpose of finding out what the case for and against the <Col N="1722" /> continuance of rent restrictions was, a commission should be set up.  I was jeered at and told that I should set up a commission to inquire into all the commissions and the House was held up for a considerable time.  It is very hard to listen with patience to the Minister's explanation now of the action of the present Government when one considers their attitude when they were in opposition.  While I do admit that a Party in opposition, if they are anyway unscrupulous, can sometimes play a game that they do not play when they are in Government, I think it is a bad practice and it is a principle that should be rejected at the earliest possible moment.  The problems that are presented in this House should be faced in a factual way and an attempt should be made to solve the problem, whatever it is, in the interests of the country as a whole without trying to make any political capital out of it.  I cannot refrain from drawing the attention of the House through you, Sir, to what the Minister, then Deputy Boland said on the Rent Restrictions Bill which I introduced in 1950.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, who was then in opposition, said that the introduction of my Bill and the fact that I was extending it for two years and was referring the problem to a commission was a bit thick.  Surely to goodness it is a bit thick to extend this Bill for another 12 months.  Why should the House be asked to do that? When I was Minister for Justice I said that I hoped to have the commission's report with the recommendations it contained implemented within two years. I said I hoped to do that provided I was Minister.  Fortunes, however, have reversed the position.  I feel that the Department generally, and the Minister in particular, should have as much anxiety as I had to see that justice is done to all parties.  I am sorry the Minister has not given us any indication whatever of his intentions.  He is just asking us to renew the Bill for another 12 months.  He has not told us anything of the complex nature of the recommendations which the commission have made.  He has not given us any indication of what we may expect in the future, nor has he said <Col N="1723" /> that the commission have yet finished their report on the other aspects of the question referred to them.</P>
    <P>The position, at any rate, is that we are being left completely in the dark. I suggest, therefore, that this Bill should not get a Second Reading until the Minister either places the commission's report in the Library or publishes it forthwith.  He should do either, or else give the House an indication of the difficult and complex matters which he, as Minister, and the Government have to consider before he can bring in a comprehensive measure, or, as he has said himself, amending legislation in some respects. If I were bringing in this measure now, I think I would be more positive than the Minister and his associates were in 1950.  I suggest to him that he could now bring in a measure for the setting up of a fair rent court so that under it the question of rents of houses could be settled if unfair rents are being charged or if hardships are being imposed on our people.</P>
    <P>It is an astounding situation that property owners&mdash;and mind you they are guaranteed their rights under the Constitution&mdash;are being controlled at the 1914 level.  I do not think there is any fair play in that.  I should like to know what the commission have to say on it.  I think the Minister should have given us some indication of what the report says on that particular aspect of the question.  It is a well-known fact that both the speculative builder and those who are putting older houses in repair want to sell their houses.  They do not want any more lettings, especially if any of them would come under the Rent Restrictions Acts prior to 1947.  I do not like the term &ldquo;landlord,&rdquo; and so I prefer to describe those people as property owners.  They fulfil a very beneficial and important role in the community by providing houses for the people at a reasonable rent.  I know, of course, that there are property owners who are unreasonable and, in some cases, unjust.  It is equally true to say that there are tenants who are every bit as bad, if not worse.  We all know that there are tenants who have fine substantial houses rented to them, and <Col N="1724" /> then proceed to sub-let them.  They get from the sub-letting of rooms and flats an income that is three or four times, if not five times, the rent which they themselves pay for the whole house. That is an aspect of the question on which the Minister has not said anything. Neither has he told us what are the views of the commission on it.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill which I introduced, Deputy Moran said that any school boy could bring in a Bill to solve that problem.  I have the quotations here, and if anybody challenges what I say I can give the reference.  I think we are all agreed that that was said.  I just refer to that to show the unfairness of the then Opposition to my Bill, and to my proposal to set up what, I think, has proved to be one of the best commissions that has ever been set up.  To my knowledge, the members of that commission have worked hard in order to have their report ready in the period specified.  I want, from this side of the House, to thank the members of that commission for the work they have done.  I do not know what the result of their labours has been, or anything about the nature of the report they have sent in.  I do feel that the Minister and the Government should have had the courtesy to let some of us on this side know what that report is like.  I set up the commission, and I think that, so far as parliamentary procedure is concerned, a good practice would have been established if, in a case like this, its report were made available to this side of the House as well as to the Government. If that had been done we would have knowledge of the actual facts as ascertained by the commission, both from the property owners' side and the tenants' side.</P>
    <P>Necessity, as I say, compels this side of the House to allow the Minister to continue this Act.  I think that a period of 12 months is too long.  What I fear is that another 12 months will have elapsed before a Bill is introduced. Therefore we may then be faced with another continuing Bill in December, 1953.  In order to force the Minister and the Government to do something, I am proposing that the Act be extended for six months only.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> I am glad that the Minister has continued the sections of the 1949 Act. As he is aware, the Act of 1947 slipped up on these two particular points and when the matter was brought to the notice of the Government they agreed to amend and did amend that particular Act.  I am glad the Minister is now continuing these sections, but, as I say, six months is sufficient to enable the Government to bring in the amending legislation.  They should let us have the report right away, because there is no reason why a report which has been in the hands of the Government since last June cannot be published to-day.  It is not necessary for the Government to wait until they have come to certain decisions upon it before the rest of the Parliament is allowed to get even one look at what is contained in the report.  Therefore, I submit that the Bill should not now be given a Second Reading.  The Minister would be well advised and would be treating the House better if he decided to withdraw the Bill until the report was published.  Then, when we see the complex nature of the recommendations, if we feel he wants 12 months for the continuance of this measure we could give it to him.  When we see the nature of the report we will know whether or not 12 months is too long and whether six months will be sufficient to allow the Government to come to a decision and bring in a Bill to make the necessary alterations and amendments in the Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEoin alleged unreasonableness against the Government Party when they were in opposition.  I think the Deputy is being a little unreasonable when he expects the Government to make the report available and introduce legislation within the period before the present legislation lapses or else come back again with this Bill and have it passed through the Dáil before the end of the term, as the Deputy knows it must.  With his long experience of parliamentary procedure, I think the Deputy cannot allege undue delay in regard to the report which was made available in June to the Government.  He should <Col N="1726" /> remember that the long vacation intervened and the complicated nature of the legislation which would be necessary in connection with the rent restriction code.</P>

      <P>It is not an easy thing to do.  I will not attempt to challenge what the Deputy has said with reference to some remarks that were made when he was Minister.  I will take his word for it.  If some of these remarks were made by one of the Deputies he referred to, perhaps the Deputy had in mind some particular aspect of rent restriction legislation.  I do not think I was in the House at the time.  At any rate, I would not subscribe to it, because it is a complex matter.  I compliment Deputy MacEoin on the commission which he appointed.  I think the remarks he made in reference to it will be endorsed not only in this House but throughout the country generally, particularly in any place where the commission sat to hear complaints and suggestions with regard to rents, lettings and other matters pertaining to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is not being quite fair when he asks that the Bill should be refused a Second Reading.  He knows that rent restriction must be maintained for the present at least.  Assuming the report of the commission came into the hands of the Government in June last, I do not think he could reasonably expect that a comprehensive Bill based on the recommendations in that report could be introduced and passed by the end of this Dáil term. He knows also that as soon as the Dáil reassembles after the Christmas recess regard must be had to the financial business and there will be very little opportunity for new legislation from that up to the summer recess, particularly legislation such as must be based on the report of the commission.  I have not seen that report and I have not the faintest idea of any one recommendation made in it.  But, having regard to the number of sittings the commission held and the many difficult matters that I know must be attended to, I do not think it would <Col N="1727" /> be unreasonable if we gave at least one more year within which this legislation could be introduced and passed by the House.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the position of landlords is becoming more difficult under this legislation, particularly landlords of old property, which is liable to go into disrepair very easily. The tendency is, if they can help it at all, not to carry out proper repairs. That not only imposes a hardship on the tenants, but eventually a hardship on the landlords if they are ultimately forced to carry out repairs which they find are uneconomic, having regard to the amount of rent they can claim in return even with the permitted increases under existing legislation.  In some cases, also, the permitted increases have worked adversely against the tenants, because the different percentages that the landlord can charge for the amount of money he spends on repairs often impose such a burden on the tenant as to render it more economic for him to abandon the house altogether.  The sad part of it is that the landlord, instead of taking the chance of re-letting the house, puts it immediately on the market for sale. The net position is that there are fewer and fewer privately-owned houses available for letting to people who would prefer to live in a rented house rather than in a house which they could purchase even under the various means designed to promote house purchase amongst the community.</P>
    <P>If house rents are not protected, it is easy for a landlord to get a fairly good rent.  But, until such time as there is an overall code, without limitation as to the houses built from 1941 onwards or in the course of being built, and comprehensive legislation introduced to deal with the whole problem of house property and lettings and rent restrictions, such legislation as is now being introduced will be necessary. For that reason I suggest to Deputy MacEoin that it would be better in the interests of the community generally, in the interests of the judiciary and the legal practitioners who have to have regard to rent legislation every day, that time <Col N="1728" /> should be given for the proper preparation and introduction of a comprehensive Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's contribution would have come far better from him if he were still on this side of the House, because he appreciates, as every Deputy does, the urgency for a complete overhaul of legislation in relation to rent restriction.  The complaint which has been made by Deputy MacEoin is a reasonable one, that now, five months after the commission's report reached the hands of the Government, neither property owners, tenants nor Deputies of this House are aware of any particular recommendation of that report.  I think that that is wrong.  This is a reasonable complaint to make.  I cannot see why it should take five months to bring the collective wisdom of the Government to bear on these recommendations and then to publish the report.  The position now is that the Minister comes into the House with an unanswerable case.  With only four or five weeks left before the expiration of the present Act no one can suggest that a completely new Bill could be drafted.  Therefore, the Minister is entitled to his extension but considerable delay has taken place and I think that is regrettable.  This House is asked to extend the Rent Restrictions Act for another 12 months and there is no Deputy who does not realise that that will mean 12 months' further delay.  We will not see a Bill extending the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act one minute sooner than the Minister is compelled to introduce it. The passage of this continuing Bill will place another 12 months' delay on very necessary and urgent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister appreciates the urgency of the matter but the Parliamentary Secretary I am sure does.  There are thousands of houses in the city, in the City of Cork and throughout the country generally that are not controlled at all by any provision of the Rent Restrictions Act. Every house built after 1941 is on the free letting market.  Any rent that can be obtained by avaricious landlords <Col N="1729" /> and landladies is being obtained by them.  Cases have been cited&mdash;and were cited in the debate two years ago&mdash;of very exorbitant rents which are charged for new houses built by speculative builders and let to the needy or to those anxious to get married and it was urged by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary as Deputies in opposition and by other Fianna Fáil Deputies at that time that the seriousness of this problem made the case for the extension of rent restrictions one of top priority.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, urge on the Minister the fact that the large and increasing number of uncontrolled houses makes some extensions of the rent restrictions code a matter of very intense urgency. Apart from the newer houses, those houses built since 1941 which are not at present controlled, there is the very serious problem of furnished lettings. To deal with the problem of furnished lettings which are outside the Rent Restrictions Act was one of the main purposes for which this Rents Commission was established.  Again, I to urge on the Minister the fact that injustice is done every day by lettings, ostensibly furnished lettings, which are accepted by those in need of housing accommodation and which are outside the scope of the Rent Restrictions Act. I do not think it is necessary to emphasise the importance of this matter.</P>
    <P>I was particularly astonished to hear either the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;referring to a new code or a new Bill dealing with rent restrictions. I suggest to the Minister not to have that.  We have a most complicated and detailed Act at the moment dealing with rent restrictions, and the only part of it which needs to be extended is Section 3, nothing else. Whatever the report of the commission may be, I hope that the country, property owners and tenants will not be faced with a new, detailed Rent Restrictions Act.  All the necessary provisions exist at the moment, indeed provisions which are so complicated as to defeat their own purpose.  The only thing to be considered is the application of this very complete code which <Col N="1730" /> already exists.  All that must be considered by the Government is to what extent it should apply to new houses and to furnished lettings and what restrictions should be made in relation to what are called 1923 Act premises&mdash;premises previously controlled by the 1923 Rent Act&mdash;and premises which have a basic rent fixed on 1914 standards.  Undoubtedly, some modification is necessary in these cases because of the passage of time and the change in values, but it seems to me that those are the only things that need to be considered by any Minister seeking to bring rents under control in accordance with the needs of the moment.</P>
    <P>I cannot see for the life of me why that could not have been done in the five months that have elapsed since the report of this commission went into the hands of the Government.  I trust that, in the early spring, in the next two or three months, the Minister will find himself in a position to introduce the necessary proposals for legislation into this House.  If it has not been done before the Dáil rises for the summer, then, when it reassembles next autumn, the Minister, whoever he may be, will again be making the case: &ldquo;Well, it is so near now to the expiration of the Rent Restrictions Act that it would not be reasonable to expect me to rush a Bill through in a matter of weeks.  You had better extend the Act for another 12 months.&rdquo; I think the delay was unfortunate, I believe that it was avoidable, and I hope that the Minister, in view of the opinions given on both sides of the House, will appreciate the intense urgency of the entire problem.</P>

This Rent Restrictions Act is very important. From my experience in my own area, I feel that it does not go far enough in certain cases.  The Rent Restrictions Act may not be fully known to most people throughout the country and it is their own fault if they do not take advantage of it.</P>

      <P>We must treat the matter fairly and see that no injustice is done to one side or the other.  In reviewing the report of the commission the Minister is wise to consider it from every aspect and get all the advice possible.  Hasty legislation for this very important matter would not serve the country.  The people who acted on that commission under the last Government were very honourable people and it is above political Party concerns.  For that reason we want some machinery which will be fair to all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>There is another point which I would like the Minister to consider.  I and other Deputies have been up against a problem where a man has a caretaker's agreement in a house; he falls out with his employer and he is thrown out on the roadside with his wife and family.  I have met with many cases of that kind during my years in public life and I would like to see some action taken to ensure that families will be saved from the shocking position of being thrown on the roadside with their chattels.</P>
      <P>It is possible for people to come into court and make a case that they want to take possession of a house.  I have known cases where they have got people out of a house and knocked it down.  Some co-operation should exist between the local authorities and the courts so that people would not be thrown out of their homes in this manner.  I have been appealing to the local authority in County Dublin and to the Dublin Corporation to house people of that kind.  It is even a greater hardship on people than having to pay increased rent because you cannot inflict any greater hardship on people than to degrade them by taking away their homes and leaving them on the roadside.  I would like the Minister to introduce legislation to eliminate that hardship.  Last week I came across a case where three families were evicted and thrown on the roadside. This is a disgraceful state of affairs which I want to see remedied.  I would appeal to the Minister to frame legislation which will prevent that situation from arising.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister made some reference to the fact that this commission had been over two years in operation and I took that to be criticism to the effect that this commission had taken so long.  I do, as I say, believe that the Minister has been guilty of very great delay in giving to the House the recommendations of this commission.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the discussion that has taken place here this evening, and it must be obvious to the Minister from the reports that he has had from his advisers and from his own experience that the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, as it operates at the present time, operates in such a fashion as to bring grave hardships on landlords and tenants, and is in need of very careful amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Davin misrepresented the Parliamentary Secretary or not, but the point I wish to make is that the Rent Restrictions Act works hardship on both landlords and tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Landlords and tenants suffer hardship because of the financial inability of landlords to carry out repairs as a result of the restrictions imposed by this Act.  There is the case given by Deputy O'Higgins of numerous tenants who reside in premises erected since 7th May, 1941. The present provisions operate to set up a privileged class of landlords. There is a privileged class of landlords who are lucky to have houses which were erected before 7th May, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> There is also the question of hardship resulting from at least two recent decisions which have come to my notice, as a result of which the family of a deceased tenant who had not taken out administration of the deceased tenant's estate are no longer able to avail of the protection given by the Act to the tenant.  It must be obvious to the Minister that these are matters which require to be remedied, that they are matters which inflict injustices, the remedying of which should not be delayed.</P>
    <P>I was rather appalled to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that it was a difficult matter and had to be considered, and, as everybody knew, that financial business would take precedence after Christmas and that it might well be after the summer that we would get these matters remedied. Our main criticism of the Bill to-day is that the Minister has had this report in his possession for five months. Either he has not shown it to the Government or the Parliamentary Secretary was not present at the meeting of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad to hear from the Minister, when replying, if this matter has been presented to the Government and if a decision has been taken by the Government on it, because I would consider it an appalling state of affairs that this report should have been in the hands of the Minister for over five months if the Government have not <Col N="1737" /> taken a decision on it.  This House and the public would be very anxious to learn if the Government have taken a decision on it.</P>
      <P>Our criticism at this stage is that the Minister has allowed the situation to slide and has not taken any steps to remedy the matter.  We feel that by introducing this legislation, which we all admit is necessary, he is merely postponing taking a decision on these very difficult problems.  I consider it necessary that rent restriction should be maintained&mdash;we have to maintain rent restriction of some sort&mdash;but our present legislation should be amended. I would ask the Minister to deal with this matter expeditiously and to bring in amending legislation at the earliest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Every idle word that man shall speak, he shall render an account of it.  I have been looking over what I said when my predecessor had a Bill in 1950 to continue the Act for two years.  I do not think that anything I said was very wrong.  I would say the same to-day in the same circumstances because, like Deputy O'Higgins, I thought there were two problems urgently requiring to be dealt with.  There was one in particular about which I was being pestered.  As I pointed out on that occasion, when I was Minister before that, regularly every two months I was asked about furnished lettings.  I said, when the last continuing Bill was being discussed, that I did not believe our Government could have delayed legislation about furnished lettings much longer.  We did not put any questions down to the Minister about it because we knew the difficulties.  That is one question that was considered to be urgent then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other was whether houses built since 1941 ought to be controlled. When I was putting the 1946 Rent Restrictions Bill to the House I gave a warning to all those who were building houses from then on that if evidence came before the Government that they were over-charging, that they were charging excessive rents, they would be controlled.  I thought that it was the general feeling of both Houses <Col N="1738" /> at the time that it would be unwise to control them then because, if we did control them, there was very little likelihood of houses being built for letting, except by local authorities. For that reason, they were given a certain period in which to let their house at reasonable rents and, if unreasonable rents were charged, it was a matter that would have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>These were the two questions that Deputy O'Higgins said could have been dealt with by me in the five months and I said that my attitude in 1950 was that if the then Minister wished to do it, he could have done it.  He knows as well as I do that a draft Bill was presented to the Government shortly before we left office.  He is well aware of that.  He is aware that it was brought before him on more than one occasion and that it was shelved. Therefore I did feel justified in saying that it was only a question of shelving the whole problem to set up a commission. That does not mean for one moment that I do not believe that the commission has done very valuable work and has been very painstaking. I am not denying that.  There were urgent problems to be dealt with.  I am asked: &ldquo;Why did not you deal with them?&rdquo;  Out of courtesy to the commission I had to wait to get their report, to see what they would recommend and to see what action they proposed to take.  Deputy Davin knew very well that it was an obviously good excuse that I had for its not being circulated. Undoubtedly, it was the printers' strike.  I will give him the time-schedule and will ask Deputies to say whether it was reasonable or not. The report was presented to the Government on June 24th, 1952; the Government approved printing of it on 15th July; it was sent to the Stationery Office for printing on 24th July; the Stationery Office sent it to the printer on 2nd August&mdash;that is not undue delay.  The complete set of proofs was received from the printers on 11th October; it was sent to the Stationery Office for final proof on 18th October; final proof was received in my Department on 1st November and final proof was passed for printing and sent by my Department to the Stationery Office <Col N="1739" /> on 10th November, 1952.  I do not think that any fair-minded man could say that there was undue delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello wants to know if the Government has come to a decision on this report.  They have not&mdash;for a very good reason.  When a commission like this has concluded its sittings and has made its report, it is only right and proper that everybody in the country should know what is contained in that report.  It always takes some time to get that public reaction.  The people concerned, both tenants and property owners, are entitled to know what has been proposed by this commission. Then they can send their observations into the Department or publish them by letters to the Press. As I have said, it will take some time to get that public reaction.  That is why the Government has not taken a decision and I have not asked them to do so.  The final proof was passed on the 10th of November and this is only the 19th.  When the copies are ready they will be circulated.  We have had to check the proofs to see that everything was right and I submit that there has been no undue delay.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, six months would be insufficient time in which to prepare a Bill based on this report.  No one knows that better than Deputy MacEoin.  It might be all right to do as Deputy O'Higgins said&mdash;but that should have been done two years ago when Deputy MacEoin set up the commission.</P>

      <P>When he promised to have it before the elections, I said: &ldquo;Do not make us laugh&rdquo;.  I think I was entitled to say that, as the election was over 18 months ago, and the Bill has not been produced yet.  I was a bit of a prophet on that occasion.  Again I say that six months will not do.  It will probably be the autumn session before we have it finished.

If I am here, I will do my best to have the Bill, based on the report of this commission, passed before this time 12 months; but I say that at least it will be the autumn session&mdash;I cannot say anything else. There is a lot of other legislation and also the financial business.  Deputy Costello is a young Deputy, and whatever he may think he will find that the spring and summer are always taken up with financial business, and we cannot avoid that.  I will not be able to have a Bill ready for the session coming after Christmas, before the financial business.  Therefore, it will be the beginning of the autumn session.  For that reason, the minimum time is 12 months.  The report will be circulated as soon as we get it printed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people have a very big responsibility.  Instead of criticising destructively the position that the Minister was forced into, they should constructively criticise the people who were responsible for forcing the Minister and the Government to bring in this measure.  I was delighted to see an end to rationing and to see the inspectors going.  Everyone wants to see free trading and people left alone. It is implied in this criticism I speak of that the Minister created this, that and the other.  The Minister has helped all those people who are in industry now, as also have other Ministers for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people who have a stake in this country should come out into the open and say: &ldquo;This country is ours, we are trying to make the best we can of it, and we are going to assist the Minister for Industry and Commerce in doing a difficult job.&rdquo; They accused the Minister here in their <Col N="1742" /> article of prying into their business and doing things of that kind.  May I ask these people, through the House, if it is a popular thing for any Minister to do?  The answer definitely is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the whole lot&mdash;he can sit in bed at home and read it.  I am only referring to it because, in my opinion, the people expect that industrialists in this young State of ours would make every effort, as responsible decent people, to co-operate with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If they came out into the open, even at the last moment, they might make it possible for the Minister to avoid implementing the various sections of this Bill.  The obligation is on them to do it.  Whether it be the case of manufacturers or wholesalers, public opinion was crying out for some measure of this kind.  These people need not start shifting the blame to others, the responsibility is theirs, and if they are big enough they will organise and say to the Minister: &ldquo;We will co-operate with you and see that these trade rings are broken down; it is as much our country as yours, and we are not going to make it impossible for you to carry on.&rdquo; Instead of that, we have the usual destructive criticism that we have had from time to time, from people who should know better, people who have been encouraged and helped in every way possible.  Why should any group try to corner the market for their selfish ends?</P>
      <P>Why should anybody come along and take advantage of any protection they are getting for their own selfish ends? Why do they not play the game?  We are a young State struggling to see that everybody living in it gets a fair deal.  These people should not come along and blame a responsible Minister for doing something for which the public are crying out.  Every Deputy has received complaints and I am sure that the Minister himself received complaints, not only since he resumed office in 1951 but prior to that.  I am also sure that Deputy Morrissey, the Minister's predecessor, received similar complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> We have to face a very difficult task and those people who are in a position should not make our job harder than it is.  They should come out into the open and say: &ldquo;Minister for Industry and Commerce, we are going to give you our whole-hearted co-operation to see that these rings will not exist.  We are going to see that manufacturers, wholesalers and everyone else will give their co-operation. This would prevent the Minister from sending inspectors round to ask them to do their duty and act in an honourable way as citizens.  They should co-operate with the Minister and his Department, who deserve it from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister explained it, is directed at associations of traders and others who are engaged in practices of different types, some of which were enumerated by the Minister in his opening remarks, which amount to restrictive trade practices of one sort or another and retail price maintenance practices.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out here and, indeed, elsewhere by those groups of traders and associations that many of the objects of these associations of traders may, indeed, be laudable.  I have no doubt that many associations which exist in this State do, indeed, fulfil a very real need and we cannot impute any restrictive practices to them.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged, I think quite correctly, that these trade associations do preserve certain minimum standards and do see that the public are well served by the members of the various associations.  They also maintain, by retail price maintenance, the avoidance of the system of sale known as &ldquo;loss, leader&rdquo; selling which undoubtedly, if carried out on a large scale, could upset the market and seriously affect the distribution of certain goods.  I think that by guaranteeing prices sometimes these trade associations bring about a set of circumstances in which a good quality type of goods is produced by manufacturers when guaranteed prices are given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> While admitting that trade associations can bring about beneficial results to the community by retail prices of one sort or another, I think it must be appreciated&mdash;I think this House does appreciate it&mdash;that these trade associations can and, in fact, do act in a way that is very immical and harmful to the interests of the community. While these excuses can be made and, as I say, justifiably be made, none the less I think the general results of the type of practices which have been enumerated here are that by retail price maintenance competition is eliminated and the cost structure of the distributive trades becomes rigid, that the costs are determined by the highest cost member of the trade so that any lowering of the cost of some individual traders is not passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Probably the worst result of the practices carried on by trade associations, apart from the fact that they make the level of prices higher than it should be and distributive costs so rigid, is the fact that the sanctions which they apply to their individual members do, in fact, amount to a policing of the industries by an association which is outside the control of the Government or any other body in the State.</P>
    <P>For those reasons it does appear vitally necessary that legislation of some sort directed towards retail practices and retail price maintenance be put into operation at the earliest possible moment.  It has not been estimated by the Minister or by anybody else so far as I know to what extent retail price maintenance exists in this country.  I know it was estimated in 1939 in England that in respect of at least 30 per cent. of the consumer goods on which money was spent by the British public, there was in fact, some sort of retail price maintenance or another.  That figure of 30 per cent. existed in 1939, but I would imagine that the figure is much higher in England at the present time.  I would say it would be appreciably higher in this country.</P>
    <P>I think there is little doubt that our economy is one which is to a very large degree subject to retail price maintenance <Col N="1745" /> on the one hand and restrictive practices which go hand in hand with the associations which maintain retail prices.</P>
    <P>The big question which we have to decide is whether the Bill which the Minister now brings in is going to deal with the problem which everybody knows confronts the Government at the present time.  Before dealing with this aspect I would like to point out one matter of detail which it might be more proper to bring up on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  It is a matter upon which I would like an answer from the Minister, and it is the omission which may or may not be intended, or which may or may not be significant, in certain paragraphs in this Bill of the word &ldquo;manufacturers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We all know that retail price maintenance is not only carried on by distributors, but also by manufacturers, and that in this State, as in other States, the manufacturers, just as much as the wholesalers and retailers, are in the associations or &ldquo;rings&rdquo;, as they are sometimes called, and have a part, sometimes a very important role, in maintaining prices.  It does seem to me extraordinary that the word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; is left out in Sections 3 and 6 and in one or two other places in the Bill, where the Bill refers to persons &ldquo;engaged in the supply or distribution of any kind of goods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I could visualise a manufacturer who may be aggrieved by an Order made under this Act applying to the courts for a declaration that such an Order would be <i>ultra vires</i> on the basis that the Act applies to persons who are engaged in the supply and distribution of goods.  While I do not intend to give any decision on the matter I wish to point out that there is an ambiguity there and whether it is an omission or whether it is significant that the word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; is not in the Bill, I should like to see it inserted in the Committee.  If there is any reason for not inserting it, I should like to hear the Minister on it at this stage, because it does appear to me to be an omission which may very well give rise to real difficulty later on when Orders are made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The big problem which this House <Col N="1746" /> has to decide on is not whether we are against restrictive trade practices or whether such practices exist, because we are all against them in principle and we know that they exist in fact. What we have to decide on here is whether this Bill is going to deal effectively with these practices and my opinion is that it is not.  The arguments have been put forward here already, but I feel that the experience of the Monopolies Commission set up under the British Act of 1948 can be a guide to us in this House as to the slow and cumbersome work which a commission such as this must, of necessity, perform.  I have not seen the recent figures in regard to that commission, but I understand that, in over two years, it brought in only two reports and these dealing of necessity with only a very limited range of goods.  We all know that the number of goods which are subject to retail price maintenance and to control by associations of one sort or another are very many indeed and if the commission reports on only two in two and a half years, I consider that such a commission is not worth setting up.</P>
    <P>My first criticism of the Bill would be that it is setting up a commission which is going to work in a very slow and cumbersome fashion and which is not going to deal effectively with the very real problems which exist in the economy at present.  My second criticism is the criticism made here already, that this Bill is setting up a commission which is purely a creature of the Minister for the time being, and it is quite clear that it would have been possible for the Minister to have set up a commission, as commissions have been set up by previous legislation passed through the House, which would be semi-independent, at any rate, outside the control of the Minister for the time being; but by this Bill we are setting up a commission which is under the direct control of the Minister, the members of which can be removed at will by the Minister and the inquiries which that commission can indulge in are to be directed and controlled by the Minister for the time being.</P>
    <P>If this fair trading commission <Col N="1747" /> decides from its experience and the information it obtains that a given trade or association requires examination, its efforts can be vitiated before hand by the Minister of the day directing the extent the inquiry is to take, and a further example of the manner in which this commission as it is proposed will work is the fact that the Minister can appoint an individual to look into a particular trade or association.  It is that one individual appointed by the Minister for the day who will be responsible for bringing in whatever sort of report the Minister for the day may require to be brought in, if, for any reason, he does not wish stringent action to be taken against any particular trade.  The Minister had various precedents for setting up an independent or quasi-independent statutory body.  If the principle of setting up a commission to deal with restrictive trade practices is accepted &mdash;and I do not accept it as a proper principle&mdash;the Minister should have set up a commission which would be independent of the Minister in power and one which would not, in fact, be his creature as the commission which it is proposed to set up will be.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious aspects, however, of the commission which it has been proposed to establish is the extent of the powers which this Bill proposes to give.  I believe that the State has the right and the duty to intervene in the affairs of associations which are set up to protect legitimate trading activities of their members.  I believe that no section of the community can set itself apart from the State and complain if the Government for the time being inquires into the manner in which its affairs are being administered; but while the State has the right, the duty and the responsibility to inquire into trade associations and their affairs and the manner in which they are carried on, I feel that that right should not be used in a tyrannical fashion, and whereas there can be little doubt that trade associations to-day do work tyranny on persons or firms not in the trade and against whom they can apply sanctions, it is wrong merely to superimpose one tyranny on another, to try <Col N="1748" /> to do away with the tyranny of a trade association by setting up a new one in the form of this commission.</P>
    <P>I am referring in particular to Clause 8 of the Schedule which, in my opinion, should go out completely and should not be permitted to remain in the Bill.  Clause 6 of the Schedule gives ample power to the commission to obtain all the information and all the documents it requires, to obtain information from associations, either through individuals whom they may wish to subpoena before them or from the books or accounts of these associations or firms.  Clause 8 goes beyond the powers and duties which this Legislature should give to the commission and, in my opinion, is an unjustifiable interference with rights which are going to be properly regulated, in any event, by Clause 6.  If Clause 8 remains in the Bill, very great injustices, practices which could amount in certain circumstances to tyrannous action by an authorised person of this commission, may occur.</P>
    <P>I read with some care the Minister's opening remarks when introducing the Bill.  He laid down certain principles which he said he was asking the House to accept.  It has been suggested by the Opposition that the proper way to deal with restrictive trade practices is to lay down certain principles, no matter how difficult it may be to frame them, and then leave it to an independent body or to the Attorney-General to find out if these principles are being broken and lay the matter before the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  There is very little new in this Bill.  Most of it has already appeared in the recent Financial Resolutions which were debated so thoroughly by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 imposes the increased duty on driving licences, and corresponds <Col N="1749" /> very closely to Financial Resolution No. 1.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 5 correspond to Resolution No. 2, and impose the new rates of duty on the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, while the Schedule which gives details of the new rates is exactly the same as the Schedule attached to Resolution No. 2.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill deals also with exemptions.  First there is a list of types of vehicle which because of their nature are exempt from duty.  The only new addition to this list is the type of vehicle which is used exclusively for the transport of road construction machinery built into it.  Such a vehicle will be exempt from duty only so long as it is used exclusively for work on public roads.  The growth in the use of modern types of road machinery has made it essential to extend to other types of road construction vehicles the exemption which has already been granted to road rollers.  In addition to these specific exemptions there is provision for exempting for a limited period vehicles brought into the State by visitors making a temporary stay. A similar exemption has been in force for a considerable time, and it is intended to continue the existing regulations for the present.</P>
    <P>A further matter dealt with in Section 1 is the fixing of rates of duty for periods less than a year.  The duty is an annual duty, and the general principle is that it is paid in respect of a year.  Special provision is made, however, for the licensing of vehicles for periods less than a year at rates to be fixed by regulations.  The Bill fixes lower and upper limits on the rates which may be determined for such periods.  The lower limit is that a rate must bear to the full annual duty at least the proportion which the period of the licence bears to a year. The upper limit is that the rate fixed for one quarter of a year shall not exceed 30 per cent. of the annual duty. Under the existing law there is no upper limit on the quarterly rate of duty on a cycle, and in fact the quarterly rates on cycles are at present slightly higher than 30 per cent.  Cycles will now be given the same protection <Col N="1750" /> as other classes of vehicles.  The existing law makes provision for a special rate of duty for a tramcar licensed for the last quarter of the year; this is no longer considered necessary, and does not appear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is necessary to deal with the case of a vehicle used for a number of purposes during a licensing period, or the construction of which is altered during the licensing period.  It merely repeats the existing law.</P>
    <P>Save for the alteration in the rates of duty, and for the very minor changes which I have mentioned, the Bill effects no changes in the existing law. Because of the comprehensive changes in rates of duty, it was found necessary to re-enact a considerable amount of the legislation on the subject.  It was not possible to deal with the Roads Act, 1920, which was amended by Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1922, in regard to the rates of duty on trade licences.  All the other important statutes dealing with motor taxation are, however, replaced by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>As most Deputies know, it is the practice of local taxation offices to start the collection of motor taxation for a particular calendar year early in the preceding December.  It is only in this way that they are able to deal with the great rush of business which takes place at the beginning of the calendar year.  The intervention of Christmas makes it desirable to start the collection as early as possible in December. For this reason it is very desirable to have the necessary legislation enacted and the appropriate regulations made without delay.  The principles embodied in this Bill have already been very fully debated, and I would accordingly ask the House to signify their early approval to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister deal with a point that we raised on the Resolution; that is the division by 125 as against the division by 160 in the 1926 Act of the capacity of the cylinder, which is really the change from the old-fashioned cylinder to the square edge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very technical matter, and I admit that I may not be <Col N="1751" /> able to give as lucid an explanation of the reason for the change as one should give.  I had a brief on the way in which the new computation was arrived at.  I regret I cannot give it offhand.  All I know is that in arriving at this new method it seems as if most people, outside the motoring world altogether or the people who are not associated with the motor business except in so far as they may be the possessors of motor cars, agree that the new method is much more equitable.  It was in order to produce that situation that the new method was devised.  I am sorry I cannot deal with the intricacies of the method as clearly as I would like to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could obtain the information for us between this and the time when he comes to reply.  According to our information under the 1926 Act the capacity was divided by 160.  The diameter of the cylinder was ascertained and the unit of horse-power having been found rose thereafter with the diameter of the cylinder.  As we understand the position, instead of dividing by 160 the capacity is now being divided by 125 and that division, as the Minister very properly said, is being carried right through.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to understand me clearly.  I agree that it is better to assess what is called technically the square edge in this way, but there must have been some reason for arriving at the divisor of 125.  My information is that if a divisor of 127 was arrived at a good many of the common makes of motor car would come in the lower category.  The Minister will recollect that I suggested to him on either the Report Stage or the Committee Stage of the Resolutions that there was a feeling abroad that he had fixed the figure at 125 in order to bring these cars into the higher category. When I did make that suggestion the Minister, if I may say so, very crossly told me that was not so.  Now that we are here in a nice calm, cool atmosphere this evening perhaps the Minister could give me more information.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gives that impression.  I am glad to hear that he was not cross.  There must have been some basis for arriving at that computation whether it was extra taxation or something else.  I think the House is entitled to some explanation. I fully appreciate the Minister is not an engineer and I can quite see that the explanation might only be intelligible to an engineer.  If it gets on the records, however, we will be in a position to consult expert opinion on it. As it is, we are completely in the dark.</P>
      <P>It would possibly facilitate further discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill if the information&mdash;if it is available to the Minister this evening&mdash; were made available.  Apart from that, so far as the Bill itself is concerned, I agree with the Minister that it has been discussed at some length.  Therefore, so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we shall reserve our more detailed discussion of the Bill until the Committee Stage.  The principles that underlie the measure that has been introduced have, as the Minister fairly enough said, already been debated.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to go into them at any too great length.  I must, however, again stress that our main reason for opposing this measure is because we believe that it is not going about the job in the proper way.  We believe that it will impose additional hardships on people without really getting at the root of the matter and without making sure that the sacrifices that people will have to bear&mdash;as undoubtedly they will have to bear sacrifices under this Bill&mdash;will be utilised in the proper way towards ensuring that there will be an adequate road system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when he was introducing the measure a few minutes ago, referred rather strongly to a matter to which we, on this side of the House, referred on the earlier discussion, <Col N="1753" /> namely, the necessity for having new and modern machinery of a much wider and more varied type than has heretofore been in use.  Going through the country, one can see the very greatest differences between the machinery that is used by one road authority in one county and another road authority in another county. Some road authorities may have progressed and introduced substantial improvements by way of modern machinery.  You go into the next county and you see that they are still trying to do the job with a bucket and a shovel.  That day has gone. Until a clearer and more careful reorganisation of our road-making administration is undertaken we shall not really get results.</P>
    <P>I saw somewhere a reference by one of the Deputies on the Government side of the House to the effect that this measure will make more funds available for the relief of unemployment. I think that is a wrong approach to the making of our roads.  What we want to do in regard to our roads is to effect a radical change in administration. We must ensure that, by Government policy or otherwise, we progress towards full employment and, in regard to our roads, our primary aim should be to provide for our island an efficient system of road network. This Bill will not achieve that object. So long as the existing machinery of road administration is continued, all that will happen is that this Minister or some future Minister will come back to this House with the same type of approach in another few years.  We must get away from the existing methods and we must make sure that new and modern methods that are available will be utilised to meet the demands of modern traffic.</P>
    <P>As I have said, one Deputy referred to the fact that this measure will provide moneys for the relief of unemployment. I do not think it is right that money for the relief of unemployment should be provided by motor-car or motor lorry users.  I do not think, also, that it is fair that, even in respect of those big lorries that undoubtedly do severe damage, this provision should be brought in all at once. For some years past there has been a <Col N="1754" /> legal limit on the weight which a lorry can carry on the roads.  So long as that legal limit existed those people were entitled to operate.  It is not fair that, suddenly and without any prospect of their being able to make adjustments, these impositions should be imposed on them.  If the Minister were about to introduce the very heavy penal rates that have been introduced, I submit that they should have been staggered in such a way that the people concerned would have been able to use up their old vehicles and then not purchase new ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Deputy Sweetman say that the legal limit still exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware it is still there.  Certain county councils do not enforce it.  As the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Harris, will be able to tell him, not so very long ago in a place very near where I live we put a limitation of five tons on a particular road that we had remade. We imposed that limitation because we felt that to put anything more than five tons on that road would be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different from the legal limit of eight tons which I understand was the highest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was eight tons per pair of wheels or per axle.  I expect that the legal limit related to the weight per axle&mdash;that you divided the total weight by the number of axles on the vehicle.  A story was going the rounds in Kildare some time ago that a certain firm were summoned for having a vehicle of excessive weight.  That firm succeeded in persuading the court that they had so many wheels on the vehicle, and that each axle had only one pair of wheels on it.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten Deputy Allen and myself as to the existing legal limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a stipulation. Apart from that, it has always seemed unfair to me&mdash;although I can understand it from the point of view of administrative convenience&mdash;that the person who could not afford to put <Col N="1755" /> down a whole year's tax at once had to pay substantially more, as is the case at present.  The Minister referred to that in his opening remarks, and suggested that there was a minimum and a maximum&mdash;I think of 30 per cent.&mdash; of the yearly duty as being the duty for the quarter.  Do I understand from that, that the Minister suggests that there is any option for a local authority to provide that the minimum figure will be operative instead of the maximum figure&mdash;or is the margin one which is determinable by the Minister, as apart from the local authority which collects the money?  It is unfair that a man who cannot afford to put down the whole rate of tax for his lorry has to pay substantially more now&mdash;as, indeed, has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience in all these matters is that if you pay yearly, it is cheaper than if you pay quarterly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be fair enough if the difference were small, but the difference in the case of lorries is going to be very large indeed.  If you were considering it on the basis of a £10 tax, there would be little hardship involved but I am thinking of the small man in the country who has a lorry and with the rates of taxation that are now going to be operative, it will mean a very substantial difference indeed to him.  I want it to be quite clear that I have taken the Minister up correctly.  You have the position under the Bill under which a vehicle which exceeds four tons but does not exceed five has a tax of £102. I take that as being the nearest to £100 for the sake of ease.  If one is not able to pay the £102 in one sum, and has to pay four times £30, that is £120 in the year; it will mean an additional <Col N="1756" /> payment of £20.  There are many small people in the country who have such lorries.  I think the Minister will agree that while there may be a case for a small increase to cover additional administrative costs, there is no case for imposing such a heavy burden as that on a small person.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned the great difficulty that arises for local authorities at Christmas time when people are trying to get all their car taxes through in December.  If the difference were more nominal, there would not perhaps be the same difficulty in that respect or perhaps again it might be possible to arrive at some administrative method by which you could take out the tax for some substantial period so that you would not get this concentration of work at the same time.  When we were discussing this matter before, Deputy Allen told us that motoring was cheaper to-day than it was 20 or 30 years ago.</P>

I had occasion recently to see a deputation and I mentioned to them that a Deputy had stated here that motoring was cheaper to-day than it was 20 or 30 years ago.  I could not remember at the time that it was Deputy Allen who said it and I had to look it up afterwards but the people concerned thought that I was a lunatic to think that any Deputy would suggest such a thing.  Petrol which was mentioned by the Deputy, tyres, parts and everything else are dearer unless the Deputy was suggesting that the computation was to be at the differential rate of the value of money.  I do not know whether he meant to put it that way or not.</P>

      <P>This measure has been conceived by the Minister as part of the general policy of Fianna Fáil at the present time, which is to take as much as they can out of the pockets of the people.  If the Minister had come in with it as part of a general reorganisation scheme there would have been some excuse for it, but to come in with it in this way is merely to impose hardships on the people and do no lasting good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage discussions on the Financial Resolutions, the Minister admitted that the only reason he could see for the change in the basis of assessment on hackney cars was the fact that the privilege that was there was being abused.  That seems to me to be an extraordinary defence for the Minister to make.  Surely, it was up to him and to the Government to take proper steps to see that the abuse was not there and was not continued.  If the Minister had taken those steps, then that line of defence would not have been left open to him.  This additional impost on the tools of the hackneyman's trade is bitterly resented by them, and in their view is going to lead <Col N="1760" /> to the utilisation of a smaller type of car.  If that should happen, it is going to have a very damaging effect on, amongst other things, the tourist trade.  The use of a smaller type of hackney car in a tourist area is going to be looked down upon by tourists coming here.  If the Minister were sincere, I think it would have been possible for him to check the abuses that he speaks of, and to continue the exemption that was there by which hackney owners would get a reasonable remission on the basis of paying 75 per cent. of the ordinary private car rate. That will give them a remission of 25 per cent. on the tax paid in respect of private cars.</P>
    <P>Our Party will have certain detailed amendments to put down for the Committee Stage.  The general principle was, I think, sufficiently discussed on the other stages.  In view of that, I am prepared so far as we are concerned, to accede to the Minister's suggestion that he should have a decision on the Bill at an early stage.  I am not prepared to accede to his request that he should have the Bill. The Minister can easily understand what I mean.</P>

      <P>I rise for the purpose of replying to the challenge of Deputy Sweetman when he asked me to give further proof of certain figures which I gave when speaking on this subject on the last occasion.  I gave certain figures then, and I challenged any other Deputy to produce another set of figures if he wished.  Deputy Sweetman has referred to my statement on that occasion.  He has not disproved the figures which I gave then or produced any other set of figures.  On that occasion I mentioned that 30 years ago petrol was 4/6 and 4/9 per gallon. Deputy Sweetman may not be aware of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of a set of cushion tyres to-day, as compared with 30 years ago, has doubled or trebled. In expressing that view, I am fortified by information given to me by a <Col N="1761" /> member of the motor trade, by a man who for something like 40 years has been in the motor business.  I may say that, politically, I do not know whether he is a friend of mine or not.  That is why I suggested on the last occasion that motoring is cheaper to-day than it was 30 years ago.  Deputy Sweetman lives in the County Kildare and I take it that he is interested in farming.  The predominant type of farming pursued in that county is cattle rearing.  May I ask him, how many two year old or three year old bullocks, he thinks, it would take 30 years ago to buy a car, and how many it would take to-day?</P>

      <P>I am not 100 per cent. concerned with what happened 30 years ago, but I do think that, in many other respects, I also gave reasonable proof in support of the statements which I made on the last occasion.  I am in favour of the proposals in this Bill.  If the tax in existence up to now could be said to have been a just tax in 1926, surely the increase is justified now? I am sure Deputy Sweetman will readily concede that there is no relationship whatever between the cost of maintaining roads to-day and the cost of maintaining them away back in 1926.  The road tax was increased in 1926 for the purpose of providing funds to help to build roads at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would say &ldquo;constructing roads&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the maintenance of roads&rdquo; I would agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;to build roads&rdquo;. I am not concerned about the maintenance but about reconstructing them. If that was a just tax in 1926 to aid in the reconstruction of roads, the Minister's proposals to-day are very just, having regard to the cost of reconstructing roads then and now. Perhaps each year during the intervening years between 1926 and 1952 there should have been a revision of the road tax, whether up or down, just as there had to be a revision of the costs which the local authorities <Col N="1762" /> had to provide for the reconstruction of roads during these years.</P>
      <P>If there has been a time lag of over 26 years in regard to the revision of that tax, it is unfortunate for the farmers of this country.  It is also unfortunate for the motoring public of to-day that, in the last 26 years, more capital had not been made available for the reconstruction of roads from the Road Fund or otherwise.  If it has taken since 1922 or 1923, when road construction work started, to reconstruct 8,000 miles of roads, and we still have 36,000 miles to reconstruct, it is a very serious matter.  As I said previously when I spoke here, the extra amount of money to be provided is only a mere bagatelle in view of what is required.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that if the £800,000 is doled out amongst the various local authorities, it will add very little to what is available to them for the reconstruction of roads.  I do not know whether the matter of road policy can be referred to on this Bill. The Minister did refer to it to a small extent and Deputy Sweetman also adverted to it.  I am referring to the matter of providing capital.  I believe this money should be used by the Minister for the purpose of making available larger capital sums to local authorities for the reconstruction of roads.  If that money could be made available to pay interest and sinking fund on loans, whether raised locally by the local authorities or raised from the Local Loans Fund, then the local authorities would make some progress.  Up to the present, anyhow, they are not allowed to purchase capital equipment out of money from the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>Capital equipment is badly needed in most counties.  Deputy Sweetman's county council would probably be the leading council in the matter of up-to-date equipment.  Fortunately for them, and unfortunately for us, they acquired our engineer.  That is their luck and our ill-luck.  Amongst the counties in Ireland, that county has probably the most up-to-date equipment in many respects for road making.  Some counties have not sufficient essential equipment for the reconstruction of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> That problem exists from county to county.  I suggest to the Minister, in regard to the matter of local authorities needing more and more up-to-date equipment, that it will require very large capital.  They cannot acquire that equipment unless there is some provision made from the Road Fund to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>The opposition to this measure from members of local authorities and rural Deputies is absolutely unreal in all respects.  I have met a good number of people in the last six weeks who own all kinds of motor vehicles and I agree that the extra impost on them will be difficult, but it is not serious in any respect.  There is no relation whatever between the cost of reconstructing and maintaining roads 26 years ago and what it costs now.  At that time road workers' wages were about 3/- or 4/- a day and they are now, I suppose, four times that.  In every other respect the cost to the local authorities has gone up.  I am surprised that Deputy Sweetman is not prepared to give any credit to the rural ratepayers for all the money they provided during the last 24 or 25 years to help to reconstruct and maintain the roads.  At the same time, the traffic on those roads increased to a great extent which added to the wear and tear, and they got no compensatory advantage.</P>
    <P>As I said, if the rates of tax were considered just at that time, and a unanimous Dáil at that time considered that they were, it is extraordinary that the small increases proposed by the Minister should meet with such opposition, especially from rural Deputies, who fully understand the problem of reconstructing and maintaining roads and the great burden placed on the ratepayers and the farming community to try to maintain those roads in the inadequate way they have been trying to maintain them up to now.  Everyone who lives in a rural area or who has anything to do with a local authority realises that, with all the other charges which local authorities have to meet, the roads, to a large extent, owing to force of circumstances, had to be left <Col N="1764" /> as the Cinderella of the local authorities' services.  The local authorities had to maintain hospitals and medical services and the thousand and one other services which they must maintain at a reasonably good standard. They have no option but to maintain them at that standard.</P>
    <P>No county council was ever satisfied, however, that it could justify to the ratepayers road maintenance and construction to the extent which every member of a local authority would wish.  This proposal is an effort in the right direction.  Given an opportunity of improving that service and given more money, there is no doubt that every local authority will do so.  The local ratepayers also are prepared to add their moiety.</P>

      <P>I believe that they are willing to do so provided they get the service.  The vehicles are doing the damage.  Traffic has come from the railways to the roads and the main reason is that motor transport is cheaper than rail transport to the community. That is why we have the problem, the blister of Córas Iompair Éireann to-day.  This is not an effort to bring traffic back to the railways, nothing of the kind.  It will not affect the cost of motor transport by 2 per cent. or by a half of 1 per cent. in most cases and well Deputy Sweetman knows that.  I hope that the Minister will have a speedy passage for these proposals.</P>

      <P>In certain respects.  I am not one of those unreasonable people who oppose merely for the sake of opposing.  I am in the peculiar position that I do not believe that the Road Fund should be the sole source of contributions to local authorities for the maintenance and construction of roads.  Deputy Allen said a minute ago that the road tax was considered just and equitable 30 years ago when we had what he described as a unanimous Parliament. That does not necessarily mean that, at the present time, the road tax proposed by the Minister is either equitable or just.  My main point is that, in certain respects, the burden has been placed on people ill-equipped to bear it, and I think that I would have agreement on that even from Deputy Cowan.  The amount of work done on the roads is determined by the number of motor-cars and other mechanically propelled vehicles in the country.  I do not think that is right. I do not think that it should be determined by the amount contributed to the Road Fund.  Let me reiterate my belief that the moneys contributed to local authorities for the upkeep and construction of roads should come from the Exchequer as grants are paid in respect of other public works.  Deputy Allen, the Minister and everybody in the House emphasised the need for better attention to our roads, but I say that, as long as that attention is determined by the number of mechanically propelled vehicles we have in the country, the problem will never be tackled in the right way.  I can give the Minister a certain amount of credit for what he is attempting to do because I appreciate&mdash;those who know appreciate&mdash;the struggle that always goes on between any Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance in any Government so as to get the Minister for Finance to realise the importance of maintaining good roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> We have a peculiar problem in that we were left a legacy of bad roads and those roads were not improved by the conditions which obtained in the country 30 or 35 years ago.  I would agree with Deputies who advocated borrowing for the reconstruction of roads because if we examine most of our roads we will discover that they are merely glorified cow tracks that never have been and never will be suited to the type of traffic they are asked to carry at the present time.  Therefore I would again suggest that money for work on roads should be taken from the national Exchequer.  The Minister's defence of this is that we in opposition want money given to the county councils but on the other hand are not prepared to pay what he demands.  This must be linked up with the general financial policy of the Government.  I say this not in any sarcastic tone or merely for the sake of sarcasm, but I do say that some of the moneys given in the last Budget to people who did not really want those moneys could have been well devoted to the roads and would have meant much more than the £830,000 which the Minister now asks.</P>

      <P>With all respect to your ruling, the Minister has endeavoured to point out to the House why he needs this money and why he must raise it in this particular way.  I am merely submitting that the Minister could do much more for the roads if he had devoted to road construction and maintenance the sum of over £1,000,000 granted to tobacco manufacturers in the last Budget and the £140,000 remitted in respect of the dance tax.</P>

      <P>In any case that is my submission as far as securing moneys for road construction is concerned.  Again we must make some plea&mdash;all of us I think have expressed concern&mdash;for some modification of the proposal in respect of hackneymen and taximen.  It appears like making a plea to deaf ears because we all know how adamant the Minister can be, but I again submit that the tax in respect of these people is an unfair and an unjust tax.  These are not people who keep cars for pleasure; these are not people who are engaged in any other type of employment or industry; they are dependent solely on the amount they get for the hire of their motor-cars or taxis.  The proposed increase may not appear big, but we must remember that the proposals of the last Budget must be paid for by hackneymen, their wives and their families and that this to them is a second Budget, a severe Budget.  If the Minister at this late stage could consider some modification in respect of these men I do not think that this proposal would be thought as harsh as it undoubtedly is at the present time. It is, as many people have said, a tax on their means of livelihood, a tax on the tools they use in their ordinary work.  These unfortunate men are plying a fast dying trade.  I know from my own experience that there will not be a rush from the country in emigration but even if this proposal affects only two people in a provincial town they will be a loss to the country.  This tax will be the last straw that will break their backs and send them out of business, because methods of conveyance by bus, train and private motor-car are so numerous now that it is increasingly difficult for a man who knows nothing else except the hackney type of employment to make anything that approaches a decent living from week to week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in pressing the point too much because the Minister is well aware of all the facts and of all the statements that have been made in this <Col N="1768" /> House on behalf of the hackney and taxi owners.  I made a plea, and I do not know whether the Minister would consider it now or not, that the quarterly payments of tax on cars and, if you like, especially on hackney cars, be the exact quarter of the yearly amount and that no addition be made as at present; I think it is something like 20 per cent.  To give the House an example, if the tax on a motor-car is £28 a year and the owner of the vehicle is able to pay only quarterly, he is charged something like £7 14/-, £7 15/-, or £8 per quarter.  He is paying £32 a year, whereas if he were able to afford the full amount he would pay merely £28.  This is an anomaly and I would suggest that the Minister, rather than increase the burden on him by reason of the fact that he is able to pay every quarter only, should allow him to pay the exact tax.</P>
    <P>I made another suggestion to the Minister in respect of the driving licence, that is, that a driving licence for 10/- be given to people who are in the habit of taxing their cars and taking them out merely for the six months of the summer.  Many of us know that there are such people.  I do not know whether Deputy Carter laughs at that statement but there are a number of people in this country who run small Ford or Prefect cars and who have large families.  They tax their cars for only six months of the year, from April until the end of September, for the sake of taking their families to the country or to some seaside resort.  These small things add up.  They may not appear big to people who are able to run cars for the whole 12 months but these things mean something to people with large families who can ill afford it.</P>
    <P>I may be allowed on Committee Stage to raise this question, but in case I am not I want to suggest to the Minister that he should allow the quarterly payment of the tax to be a quarter of the yearly payment and that he should consider giving a six-months' licence for people who tax their cars merely for the summer period.</P>

      <P>I want just to say <Col N="1770" /> that this particular matter will have to be considered in connection with the general financial policy and that an opportunity will be available there for dealing with it.  There is undoubtedly something to be said for Deputy Corish's other proposition, that all the road construction that is required cannot be paid for out of the Road Fund. That again is a matter that requires to be considered in relation to the general problem.  I, of course, would not accept the proposition of Deputy Corish that we should simply go out and borrow this money.  Within the policy of the Labour Party I am sure that Deputy Corish will find a better solution for the problem than simply borrowing at 6 per cent.  or 5 per cent. interest.  I think Deputy Hickey will agree with me on that.</P>

      <P>There is a very interesting problem there but I do not think the Chair will permit us to discuss it on this particular Bill.  I speak on this stage of the Bill now for no other reason than to make the appeal I made to the Minister when the Resolutions were before the House in regard to the taxi and hackney proprietors.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in regard to the taxi and hackney owners is this, that apparently there is more than one organisation and when we were discussing the matter on a previous occasion quite a number of us had been approached by an organisation which had its basis mainly in Dublin but which nevertheless had a country membership.  The members of that organisation put forward to us a proposition that we should advocate, and that we should ask the Minister to consider favourably, their suggestion that in regard to taxis and hackney cars there ought to be a flat rate tax of £20 per annum.  That was mentioned by a number of Deputies and I avail of the opportunity of reiterating that and of repeating the request I made to the Minister when the Resolution was under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies had the opportunity this evening of meeting another organisation of hackney <Col N="1771" /> owners, the Irish Small Public Service Vehicles Association.  The organisation had delegates representing a number of counties in Leinster.  The delegates from Kerry were not able to arrive.  The case put forward to the Deputies who met them was a strong one, pointing out the difficulties under which they are labouring.  The majority of the members of the association are buying vehicles on the hire purchase system and have to meet monthly instalments.  In a specific case given to us the monthly instalment was £26 3s. 8d., over a period of two years. Eighteen months' instalments have been paid and six months' instalments remain to be paid.  Insurance costs £67 and, heretofore, the tax was £16. Under the new taxation, the tax will be £36 or an increase of £20 a year or £10 for a period of six months, which is something less than 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>Viewed in a general way, 10/- a week does not seem to be much, but in the case of hackney owners who are put to the pin of their collar at the moment that extra 10/- a week is undoubtedly a serious burden.  We calculated that approximately £8 a week is the amount that that particular individual will have to earn before he can make anything for himself, not taking into account expenditure on petrol, oil or the repairs that are inevitable, especially when the cars are being used in country areas and, more especially, where the roads are not very good.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of the members of this association served in the Defence Forces and received a small gratuity on termination of the emergency, which they converted into a hackney car or taxi in order to earn a livelihood. Up to the present, they have been paying in respect of particular vehicles £16 a year tax, that is £6 a year more than the Dublin taximan was paying.  They consider that it would not be unreasonable for the Minister to maintain the same difference&mdash;£6 a year&mdash;between the tax that they pay and the tax that the Dublin taximan pays.</P>
    <P>The association put forward other proposals in which the Minister will <Col N="1772" /> be interested and which have been mentioned in previous debates on this subject.  They asked for an inquiry regarding the holders of small public service vehicle licences.  They suggested that where a car, in respect of which the owner holds such a licence, is not available to the public at all reasonable times, the car should not be deemed a small public service vehicle and should not be licensed as such.  They make the point, which is a very good point, and which, I think, would be accepted by the Minister and by everybody in the House, that people who tax their cars as small public service vehicles and make them available to the public only when it is convenient for themselves to do so, are entering into unfair and unreasonable competition with those who have to earn their livelihood through ownership of small public service vehicles. Everyone would agree with that proposition.  All classes of people through the country use their cars as public service vehicles, hire them out for reward, and undercut the local hackney owner who is depending on earnings from his hackney car.  That is not a satisfactory state of affairs, and I am quite sure the Minister and every Deputy would be anxious to terminate it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The association also put forward the suggestion that a small public service vehicle licence should be issued only in respect of a car that qualifies to carry four passengers excluding the driver.  I do not know what instructions are issued to the people who are authorised to grant these licences, but from examples given by the deputation I understand that the rules are not the same in every place, that there is not uniform application of the law and that that causes unfair competition.  The association also requires that the law prohibiting the carrying of passengers for reward by lorries, vans and private cars should be more rigidly enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say only a few more words on it.  I want to relate it to the general position.  The more stringent application of the law would eliminate these unfair sources of competition, <Col N="1773" /> and I am quite sure the deputation we met would accept it if the Minister would do everything in his power to ensure that the law is applied rigidly in the case of that type of unfair competition.  If those matters were dealt with, security would be given to the hackney proprietors and, if that were given, the increased tax would not bear so heavily on them.  I think every Deputy would press the Minister to eliminate that unfair competition.</P>
      <P>I want to renew my appeal to the Minister to consider favourably the case made by the representatives of the taxi and hackney proprietors.  I think that the case that was made by the first organisation that we met, that for a flat rate tax, was the better one. I would ask the Minister to reconsider the recommendations that were made to him in that regard.  Undoubtedly, these taxi and hackney owners&mdash;particularly the hackney owners in the rural areas&mdash;render a first-class social service to the community.</P>
      <P>They are available at call for urgent journeys.  Many of those journeys result in the saving of life.  It is necessary that there should be an adequate number of hackneys everywhere in the country.  When we have a body of men rendering a service such as that, that is so essential to the community, it is desirable that some special provision should be made for them.  I would urge the Minister to consider these aspects of the matter, to consider the case that has been made for that special body.  Although there are difficulties in the way, looking at it in a very broad general way I think that a very good case has been made and it would be reasonable for the Minister to grant the concession in regard to taxation that has been asked for by the owners of those public service vehicles.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this stage of the Bill at all, as our attitude towards it has been made abundantly clear.  Probably I would not have spoken had I not been so moved by the eloquent appeal made by Deputy Cowan.  I do not know how the Minister can resist it.  But, of course, it means nothing; Deputy Cowan is wasting his breath and wasting <Col N="1774" /> his time.  Deputy Cowan knows better than I do or any member of the House does, that he is not going to get relief for those people of whom he has spoken in such moving terms.  He is not going to get this proposed injustice removed from their shoulders merely by talking: he can only get that by walking into the proper Lobby.</P>

The Minister would be very slow in saying to Deputy Cowan that he was sorry he could not see his way to accede to the Deputy's very reasonable request&mdash;if he knew that the alternative was that the Deputy was going to walk into the Lobby in support of the statement he has just made himself.  I cannot understand how Deputy Cowan or any other Deputy can get up in this House and speak with such feeling and such eloquence for 15 minutes against the injustice which the Minister proposes to impose on this section of the community, how he can get up and make that appeal, how he can be so filled with the righteousness of their claim, and at the same time walk into the Lobby behind the Minister for the imposition of the additional taxes which he has just announced.</P>

I doubt if there is anyone in the House who is going to vote against the Bill, who could possibly make as eloquent or as good a case against it as Deputy Cowan has just made.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways&mdash;he is either for the people for whom he has just spoken or against them.  The test is not what he says; it is what he does.  The Deputy can determine that by going into the right Lobby.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the Deputy and one or two of his <Col N="1775" /> colleagues who feel exactly as he does decided to go into the right Lobby these additional taxes would not be imposed&mdash;they could not be imposed&mdash; and to that extent the Deputy himself and his colleagues will be more responsible for the imposition of this tax than the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a problem which has already been before the House and has been discussed at considerable length and I do not want to travel in detail over the ground which has already been traversed.  As the Bill is now presented to us, we are asked to express our opinions thereon, so I want to put again, perhaps in a new form, the viewpoint of those who earn their livelihood by operating hackeny cars or taxis.  Those of us who know the pattern of life for the taximen, whether in Dublin or Cork, and for the hackneymen in the small towns and rural areas, know perfectly well that they work hard and get only a very frugal living.  Not only are they obliged to work at all hours of the night and day in order to earn their livelihood but they very often operate under circumstances which compel them to depend in large measure on being paid subsequently for trips which they undertake without prepayment in order to convenience those who live in the vicinity and with whom their domestic lots are cast.  It seems to me, therefore, that before we are justified in imposing additional taxes on these two classes of the community, we ought to be satisfied that they are capable of bearing these new burdens.  I think we have selected the worst of all years to demonstrate that hackney owners and taxi owners, as a class, taken together, are capable of bearing the new burdens which this Bill will impose upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only are they getting, like the rest of the community, the full impact of higher prices consequent upon the recent Budget, but they are getting also the impact of higher prices in respect of the commodities which were not subsidised, but in respect of which there has also been an increase in prices.  They are getting the impact <Col N="1776" /> of a recession in employment, as is evidenced by the fact that we now have nearly 11,000 people more unemployed in the country than we had 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>These things necessarily impact upon those who earn a livelihood operating taxis or hackney cars, but in respect of these two classes, the taximen and the hackney owners, we have subjected them to the special hardships which will be visited upon them by the introduction of a Bill which immediately increases the cost of running cars for them, as exemplified in the fact that they will have to pay increased road tax in order to continue to operate their cars.</P>
    <P>If they had no other problems but to meet this increased charge for operating their cars, the problem would be difficult enough but, as Deputy Cowan has rightly said, they have other problems as well.  In recent years in particular there has come into the hackney-owner class a number of people who are not legitimate operators of hackney vehicles.  They are persons who are in the nature of &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; in the business.  That is, they come in and they get, as they get easily under the ineffective law which we have at the moment in this matter, a small public service vehicle licence.</P>
    <P>Having got that, this class of person operates the car for his or her own use but enters into keen competition with the legitimate hackney owner if they see any creamy traffic available but they will not take the short runs. They will not take the night runs and they will not take the hard runs.  All they will do is to operate in such a way that they will get the softest traffic.  This operates to the serious disadvantage of the legitimate hackney-car owner who is doing his best to make a livelihood for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The law is wide open to anybody who wants to pirate in that way on the legitimate hackney owner and we ought to have from the Minister an assurance that some steps will be taken to close the gap there so that those who genuinely earn a livelihood by operating hackney-cars will not have to contend with the unfair cutthroat competition of those who are <Col N="1777" /> in the business to skim the cream off it and make it harder for the ordinary hackney owner to earn a reasonable livelihood.</P>
    <P>Then there is the further question of the type of cars that are operated as hackney vehicles.  Unless we do something to put the taxi owner in a position whereby he can meet his responsibilities and earn a reasonable livelihood for himself and his family we are likely to get any type of vehicle used as a hackney vehicle.  We know that types of hackney vehicles can be used which leave much to be desired.  We ought to try and put the hackney owners in a position by the avoidance of heavy impositions on him whereby he can operate a decent service in the form of decent vehicles and by that I mean a vehicle which will take, let us say, four passengers and the driver.</P>
    <P>If we press the hackney owner by the extraction of additional revenue from him to such an extent that he cannot purchase or even continue to own a decent-sized vehicle the tendency will be to push him back to the small and, perhaps, quite unsatisfactory vehicles. To that extent we are losing revenue for the Exchequer because the smaller car will consume less of the taxable fluid, petrol, than the larger car will.</P>
    <P>Then there is the overriding consideration which has exercised the minds of this House, the imposition of additional taxation on hackney owners and taximen.  Whatever you might say about the justification for that in other circumstances I urge the Minister that 1952 is not the year to select, having regard to the hardships already inflicted upon the working-class section of the community in particular, for the imposition of these additional burdens on taximen and hackney owners.</P>
    <P>There is no justification at this stage in selecting them for a double dose of taxation such as they are getting under this Bill and under the Financial Resolutions which preceded it.  I could face up to voting for a Bill of this kind imposing even heavy taxation on the large mechanically propelled vehicles used on our roads which are not fit to carry those vehicles if I could see the Minister recognising that it is unfair to taxi owners and hackney owners to <Col N="1778" /> penalise them in the manner in which this Bill does.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan was quite right when he called attention to the fact that under this Bill they will have to pay additional taxation for the road licences, but as we all know a very small minority of the hackney owners can afford to pay their annual road licences in one instalment.  They are compelled to get the licences in instalments over the year and because of the fact that they cannot pay for the licence in one instalment they have to pay 20 per cent. additional payment in respect of each quarter's instalment.</P>
    <P>In other words, over a whole year the hackney owner who operates his car by paying from quarter to quarter for the licence, because he cannot afford the money to pay for the entire licence in one instalment, has to pay not merely the additional rates but 20 per cent. more because he is not able to pay in one instalment.  That will happen in the future as it is happening to-day but he is going to pay the additional 20 per cent. on the additional charges which are being imposed in this Bill.  In other words, the poor fellow who is doing his best to earn a living for himself and his family by operating a hackney car will have to pay, because he is short of money, a road tax which the ordinary person can pay in one instalment.  That works out in this way, that the man who pays in quarters has to pay almost the cost of 15 months' road licence in order to operate the vehicle for 12 months because he is not able to pay for it in one instalment.</P>
    <P>It is most unfair to ask those who earn a livelihood by operating a motor-car, as hackney owners do, to pay this additional percentage on the ordinary rate of taxation.  Again, I think that some steps should be taken to ensure that those who operate vehicles for a living would not be asked to pay that additional impost. It seems to me and to every fair-minded Deputy that to ask a person to pay an extra 20 per cent. because he is too poor to pay his year's licence in one instalment is to ask these folk who have slender resources to pay too high a tax because they are compelled <Col N="1779" /> to take out their licences in instalments.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of the matter which the Minister could remedy speedily by legislative action or by legislation which would command the ready support of all sections in the House.  I urged the Minister, and so did other Deputies, that, so far as this Bill and the Financial Resolutions which preceded it were concerned, he was asking hackney owners and taxi owners to bear far too heavy a burden. Even Deputies in the Minister's Party spoke in favour of some easement of the burden on hackney and taxi owners, although these Deputies, having expressed lip sympathy with the position of the hackney and taxi owner, subsequently went into the Division Lobby and voted against the grant of any concession to these two classes.  Having been appealed to by all sections of the House, I put it to the Minister that he ought not to try to steamroll this Bill through the House and that, instead, he ought to leave the matter to a free vote so as to ascertain the real views of the House on a matter which is so important to two large sections of the community, the taxi owners and hackney owners.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will do that or not, but Independent Deputies do not need any permission from the Minister in exercising their right to demonstrate that they are Independent Deputies, and there is no obligation on Deputy Cowan or on any other Independent Deputy to follow the Minister's lead in this matter.  I take it that they would resent it if I suggested they were members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;If they are not&mdash; and I am quite prepared to accept their view that they are not formal members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;they ought to demonstrate here on this Bill that they are independent and can vote freely, that they have no obligations to the Party in power, that they are completely free of entanglements and at liberty to demonstrate not only to their constituents but to their own consciences which keep constant watch over them, and in particular to those of <Col N="1780" /> their constituents who are affected by this legislation, that they have the right to decide, untrammelled by the Party Whip, and that they will do so on this occasion in order to show that their real sympathies lie with those who are being squeezed by the Bill the Minister has put before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, might face up to it in a more broadminded and understanding way by saying that he wants this Bill to be the conviction, based on its merits, of the House, and ought not to try to press the House and even members of his own Party to do what he knows is offensive to their consciences, namely, to impose heavier taxes on two sections of the community who we know are not financially equipped to meet the impact of these taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was always under the impression that our transport problems are pretty well confused here, but listening to the Labour Party and Deputy Norton, I have been convinced that there is a large amount of confusion with regard to our transport system.  I am also convinced that there must be an enormous number of vehicles on the road which are not capable of functioning properly and which it is not safe to have on the roads.</P>
      <P>If the owners of these vehicles are so hard hit by this tax, it is fairly evident that they were unable to keep their vehicles in proper order.  The Labour Party surprised me a good deal because they were aware of that confusion in the transport system, and I always heard them holding forth here on the need for giving some form of protection to the old transport system, Córas Iompair Eireann.  I can remember the time when Deputy Norton would have opposed fiercely any private system of transport which was entirely opposed to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one fact that we have to realise, and I think everybody realises it, that, in view of the cost of road maintenance, it was fairly obvious that something would have to be done to get money to keep these roads in order.  The only chance of survival for some of the financially weak owners of transport vehicles is better roads.  I <Col N="1781" /> am told that, in certain counties, the roads are so bad that tyres are ruined, after perhaps one run.  Tyres represent a very considerable expense, and if a man puts a pair of new tyres on a vehicle, there is a very heavy tax imposed on him.  If the roads are kept in reasonable order, it may involve him in extra taxation, but, if he gets better roads, he gains.  The effect of this tax is to eliminate quite a number of transport vehicles which are unable economically to stand the pace.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Cowan and Deputy Norton that there is very unfair competition from small cars which function when it pleases the owners, who carry the passengers they like best and who possibly pay best.  That, however, does not arise on this measure. The Ceann Comhairle might pull me up on that point, but, at the same time, it shows the confusion that exists, and any Minister who wants to impose taxation will naturally be inclined to tax a confused system of that nature, and, for their own sakes, try to eliminate some of the uneconomic vehicles which are on the roads.</P>
    <P>I am fairly satisfied that if the rules and regulations were strictly enforced, quite a number of these vehicles would not be allowed to operate.  Anybody who travels the roads regularly&mdash;I travel them every night and every day &mdash;knows the confusion that exists.  One sees on the roads heavy lorries with trailers, and one cannot see even the end of them.  These vehicles travel on narrow roads, and one meets quite a few licensed passenger vehicles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Quite a number of these vehicles are unsuitable for transport purposes.  They are unsafe because their owners are not financially able to keep them in order and I do not see any way, except taxation, to <Col N="1782" /> eliminate them.  Whether we like it or not, they will have to be eliminated, because everybody knows what is happening on our roads.  Every day one sees reports of accidents, due, in some cases, to bad brakes and in others, to faulty steering and so on. It is time some segregation took place and to my mind this is the only way in which to segregate them.  Give Córas Iompair Éireann a chance of survival because the others may disappear and, if they disappear and Córas Iompair Éireann breaks down, we will have no transport at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third occasion on which I have spoken in the last ten or 12 days.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to ease the burden on the taxi and hackney drivers and on the small vehicle owners.  The last speaker said he saw no need for the ten-ton lorries with the big trailers.  None of us on this side has spoken in favour of the ten-ton lorry with the trailer attached because the very use of that trailer deprives another man of employment. We are not in favour of transport that harms our roads and it is neither right nor fair to drag in that issue while we are discussing this question.  Deputy Norton has already said the taxi owner and hackney owner are almost crushed out of existence. Their tyres are heavily taxed.  Their petrol is heavily taxed.  Their repairs and replacements are heavily taxed. The taxi driver and the hackney driver are tax collectors for the Government.</P>
      <P>This burden is the last straw.  Will the Minister cease hitting the weakest of our people, the people whose backs are not fitted to bear the burden they will be called to bear under this Bill? Deputy Norton has appealed for an easement of this burden and he is prepared to back his appeal by walking into the Division Lobby against this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the representatives of these people to-day.  Deputy Cowan met them.  So effective was their case that Deputy Cowan felt compelled this evening to make the speech he did make.  As Deputy Morrissey said, however, something more practical than lip-service is required.  If Deputy Cowan tells the Minister that he must <Col N="1783" /> stop hitting the weak because he will not vote for him if he does not do so, the Minister will find some excuse for carrying the debate over until 10.30 to-night so that there will be no division to-night.  Otherwise he will embarrass Deputy Cowan and those other Deputies on his own benches who made eloquent speeches on behalf of the taximen and the small vehicle owners.</P>
    <P>Last week, Deputy Moran, Deputy de Valera and Deputy Colm Gallagher made very eloquent appeals but when it came to taking a decision they walked into the Lobby and voted for the imposition of the burden against which they had so eloquently appealed.  I suppose that is one of the difficulties that men have to face.  The Government and the Minister are not fair to their supporters in the way in which they deal with them because they force them into the Lobby against their consciences.</P>
    <P>Some of us met these men to-day. Six of them were ex-Army men who had served the country during the emergency and in the I.R.A. in the old days.  Those who got gratuities put them into the purchase of small cars which the Government now proposes to tax.  That is not playing the game. These men's struggle is hard enough. There are not many visitors calling for taxis or hackney cars at the present time.  I join in the appeal that has been made by other speakers to give these men a chance to earn a livelihood and keep their families instead of having to sell their cars.  It was pointed out by them to-day that there is now no market for their cars and if they go out of business they will not get even half their capital value. What will they do?  Are they to draw unemployment benefit or go on the dole?</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to meet their demands?  What demands did they make to-day when they saw Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan and myself?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been instructed by the committee of the Irish Small Public Service Vehicles Association to write to you requesting your support of certain grievances of hackney owners <Col N="1784" /> in connection with the issue of S.P.S.V. licences which, if allowed to continue, will have the effect of jeopardising the hackney business entirely particularly in provincial towns and rural areas throughout Éire.  I would be much obliged if you would raise the following points in the Dáil...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and Deputy Norton have raised these points.  There is no need for me to repeat them, I ask the Minister to consider favourably the appeals made to him from both sides of the House and, if he has any doubts, to leave the matter to a free vote of the House and give Deputies thereby an opportunity of both exercising their rights and satisfying their consciences.</P>

      <P>I had no idea that we were likely to-night to have a debate covering the field of discussion ranged over on the Committee Stage and on the Report Stage of the Resolutions. Perhaps I may have been unreasonable in thinking that Opposition Deputies would consider that their prejudices and their feelings in relation to these proposals had been amply ventilated. I was wrong in my judgment and the field covered this evening was the field covered on the Committee Stage and the Report Stage of the Resolutions.</P>

    <P>When I hear statements loosely thrown around as to the injustices which the proposals in this Bill will impose upon certain sections of the motoring world I wonder if the Deputies who make these statements have really examined the effect of these proposals.  Taximen and hackney-car drivers have been referred to <i>ad nauseam.</i>  The figures supplied to me by the association representing taximen and hackney drivers amounted in all to £12 17s. 8d. weekly outlay. When the proposals before the House come into operation the additional charge on these men will amount to 2/8 per week.  During the discussion on the Report Stage of the Resolutions I admitted that even 2/8 per week was an important matter to people who belonged to the lower income groups but surely it is unreasonable and a gross exaggeration to contend that the addition of that 2/8 per week to the <Col N="1785" /> overheads of taximen and hackney-car drivers will mean their going out of business.</P>
    <P>I tried to convey to the House what was aimed at in these proposals. Deputies are aware that the roads of the country for which the local bodies are responsible are financed from two sources.  They are financed from the rates struck by the county councils and by other local bodies and financed by grants made available to these local bodies through the Road Fund.  The Road Fund is created and supported by the taxation that has been paid all down the years, and that will continue to be paid by motorists and users of mechanically propelled vehicles.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - White Paper on Trend of External Trade&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the White Paper on the Trend of External Trade and Payments, 1951, presented to Oireachtas Éireann by the Minister for Finance, in so far as it purports to draw conclusions from the statistical material set out, is in the main tendentious nonsense; that the White Paper has been presented improvidently and that the Minister for Finance is deserving of censure for having presented this discreditable document to Oireachtas Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday, intermittently and between the antics of house-gathering, I was endeavouring to address myself to the subject-matter of this motion.  To view this White Paper and its implications, it is necessary to analyse in a general way the economic structure conceived by the present occupant of the Department of Finance and at the same time to point out in a demonstrably clear way how far wrong the assumptions were and how far-reaching and devastating in fact were the repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This White Paper, in itself, must <Col N="1786" /> have the criterion of truth.  In its tables, in its general information with regard to figures and statistics, one accepts without qualifications the basis of truth.  But the quarrel in the whole presentation of this paper and in the general atmosphere that surrounded its presentation was the completely erroneous conclusions that were come to by the Minister.  So erroneous and so unreal were these conclusions that we press the view that the very nature of this error, the very magnitude of the mistake that could be made on these assumptions, disqualifies the present occupant from being worthy of or capable of holding his office.  We had the insistent wails, taken up in chorus by those on the Government Benches, prognosticating doom and ruin.  It is true that the devil can quote scripture for his purpose.  In this case, I submit to the House that figures were deliberately twisted and distorted and that inferences were drawn from figures for the purpose of creating a false premise on which the Minister for Finance based his hair-shirt policy and his appeal to the Irish people to eat less, drink less and, in fact, to depress their general standard of life.</P>
    <P>One may feel sympathy for the Minister in the resentment he might have felt at the unqualified and unparalleled success of the previous three years' administration.  One might feel sympathy for the chagrin that must have permeated his being when he realised the impetus of expansion that was left as the trail of successful government&mdash; government that envisaged the needs of all sections of the community, government that embarked on a policy of immense national capital development and based its financial approach on the theory that Irish money was best and most properly invested at home in the development of Ireland itself whether it be in the building of houses for its citizens, in the continued expansion of rural electrification, in improved drainage, in increased afforestation or in other projects of national magnitude. I know that that was a deep source of torment to the present Administration. However, one has to analyse here in a realistic way the assumptions that it led to.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Minister's doctrine <Col N="1787" /> was that there could not be any appreciable expansion of exports.  Never was a statement so false and never was it made on so slight a premise, because the exact contrary has been the case. It is true that the Minister may&mdash; through particular glasses coloured by spite and hate&mdash;have taken a distorted view of the work of the previous Minister for Agriculture, but the facts are now abundantly clear.  The impetus given in agriculture has manifested itself in an unprecedented and unparalleled expansion of exports. The full extent of that expansion can be seen only now because, of necessity, there must be a delay in the coming to light of the full value of the impetus which was given.  The Minister did not seem to appreciate the fact that Deputy Dillon, the predecessor of the present Minister for Agriculture, re-established Irish agriculture on a firm basis.  We were having an expansion of live stock in the country and the pig industry, which had disappeared, was re-established on a sound basis. All the caterwauling and all the wails of Deputy Corry about various trade agreements were to fall to nought and we were to see reflected, not only in statistics but in actual financial returns, an increase of earnings by the agricultural community that reached an unprecedented height.</P>
    <P>The Minister started, on the basis of this document, a campaign to reduce consumption.  He took the view &mdash;we may say erroneously, even maliciously erroneously&mdash;that the Irish people were eating too much, that they were looking too well and that their standard of life was too good. He set about putting his dead hand on the Irish people.  He immediately depressed imports&mdash;imports that we suggested here in a realistic way would find their own readjustment.  The period of scarcity that had arisen from emergency and war conditions had passed and, with the expansion of our own exports, we would find coming automatically in a short period an adjustment of the balance as between imports and exports, and there was no need for alarm.</P>
    <P>We in the Opposition asserted and fearlessly asserted our belief in the <Col N="1788" /> capacity of the Irish people themselves, working on the land of Ireland, to right the whole situation by their own productive effort.  Thanks be to God, here, in the realism of the atmosphere before us now, on a factual analysis of the results, our faith has been more than justified.  Once again, the economy of this country has been righted in the main through the effort, the industry and the increased productivity of the land of Ireland by the people working on the land and getting their living from it.</P>
    <P>This motion gives us an opportunity of analysing the fallacies of the economic conception of the Government. The trail of misery that it has left behind is pathetic.  It is infinitely pathetic to us here in Opposition when we realise that it is unnecessary and that it is a hardship that should not have been inflicted on the Irish people. We say that the results that have flown from this document, the keystone of the economic fallacies of the present Government, have been rising unemployment, a depressed standard of living, depressed consumption, increased part-time employment, trade recession and all the various other attributes that must inevitably flow when the Government and the Minister responsible for the national purse takes the line of a doleful Jimmy.</P>
    <P>We say now that, in the light of what happened, there was no need to retard the expansion that the previous Government had envisaged.  There was no need to check the gathering strength and impetus to improve not only production but to wrest in a realistic way with the problem of housing, the problem of social development, the problem of general internal improvement in the conditions of the people and the general standards of life.</P>
    <P>We say that but for the gloomy prognostications arising initially out of speeches made by the Minister for Finance apropos of this document, there would have been no necessity for the unprecedented rise in unemployment, no necessity for the slowing down of housing or no necessity for any Minister for Finance to have to go to the people of this country for a national loan at the rate of interest <Col N="1789" /> which the Minister recently had to offer.  We asserted here at the period when this document was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas that the Minister was deliberately endangering and imperilling the possibility of getting that loan.  We say that this document, followed as it was by the Central Bank Report and then by the bludgeoning savage Budgets, has had the effect, has, in fact, been the root cause, of forcing the Minister to offer such attractive terms for the biggest national loan ever offered.  At the same time, it has had its reaction in making the price of borrowed money for all persons very much higher, and, as we contend, far in excess of the rate they should be asked to pay.  Despite the wails of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs about standing armies in England, we protested vehemently to the Government that there was no need to slow up the repatriation of foreign assets when they could be repatriated for the purpose of giving an impetus to projects of capital development at home.</P>
    <P>We know now, only 12 months afterwards, that this Government, where it had not the courage to abandon the schemes envisaged by the last Government, initiated a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; policy. We know that application after application for inspection and review under the land rehabilitation scheme is held up on technical hitches and that there is a delay in the forward impetus of liming and rehabilitation of land.  We can see from the rising unemployment in the building trade that there has been a definite depression and &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; policy in that trade.  We know, and it is a fact that even the Government themselves cannot get over, that, from the time they took office, from the time the economic policy announced by the Minister for Finance on the wrong assumptions and the wrong inferences drawn by him from that document came into being, this country has suffered difficulties and recessions in trade which are virtually unparalleled in its history.</P>
    <P>All the assumptions of the Minister were based as I said before, on the conclusion that there could not be a rapid expansion of exports.  Many <Col N="1790" /> tawdry excuses were used in this document to suggest that it would be unwise to draw this conclusion or that conclusion.  Even the strike that was temporarily in being at the ports was used to justify the statements that it would not be safe to take the figure in September as a reliable one.  All these prognostications have been proved completely false.  We have reached the extraordinary position in this country that for the first time in our history exports are going to be well over the £100,000,000 mark.  If this Government had realistically faced up to the fact that the Irish farmer was geared up to expand, that the farmer and his helper on the land, having improved and better conditions, were geared up to make a bigger contribution to the national effort then we could have expanded exports even more rapidly.  Instead we had this woeful dallying, this succession of lachrymose prognostications by the Minister for Finance with the Tánaiste following him, and, of course, the ever-increasing wails of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who has set himself up, apparently, as the economic genius or who purports to be the economic genius, behind this queer facade of omniscience.</P>
    <P>The sooner this Government realise that the inferences drawn from the White Paper have brought about the state of affairs where a working-class district like North-West Dublin can give the answer it did to the Government a week ago, the better for themselves. If they are to stay in office and I believe personally they will endeavour to stay there as long as possible, we urge from the Opposition Benches here that they should get somebody more worthy to fill the office of the Minister for Finance than the present occupant.  We say that the very basis and the very conclusions drawn by him from the figures set out in this paper disqualify him from holding the high office he does.  The present Minister has occupied many offices in the Government of this State from time to time but none with less distinction than he has displayed in the one he occupies at present.  We say that, in the main actuated by spite because of the success of the previous <Col N="1791" /> Administration, the Minister for Finance has set about the task of bludgeoning the Irish people, depressing their standard of living, deliberately decreasing their consumption and deliberately creating an atmosphere so unreal that it took a by-election in a working-class district to extract the real answer of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am not going to labour this motion any further.  I can appreciate Deputy Briscoe's anxiety to get in.  I would not be here this evening talking on this motion if a reasonable opportunity had been given to me on Friday to say what I have now said.  I want to say that, in the light of all that has happened, it is full time for the Minister now occupying the office of Minister for Finance to recant, if he has any sense of public duty, and to vacate that office because every conclusion drawn by him has been completely erroneous. The sooner we get the opportunity of putting the Irish people back on the road to expansion and development and of putting Irish boys and girls back into employment in Ireland, and of arresting the present trends, the better it will be, not only for the Ireland of to-day, but for the Ireland of to-morrow.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins, in concluding, has indicated to the House that, had he not been prevented from saying on Friday evening what he has said this evening, he would not be speaking this evening.  Deputy Collins has had time since last Friday to examine the document to which the motion before the House relates, but in all the ferocity of his attack, or his attempted attack, he did not quote a single figure from either the exports or imports referred to in the White Paper under discussion.  He generalised in a manner that one might expect to hear a speaker indulge in at election time &mdash;an appeal to the emotions of the people by saying that this Government is out, as a result of this White Paper, to force the people to eat less and to drink less&mdash;but he did not produce a single figure to substantiate that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, when Deputy Dillon moved this motion, he was surrounded <Col N="1792" /> at the beginning of the debate by some 30 or 40 members of the Opposition. At the beginning of his introduction to the motion, there was great hilarity and applause at his joke.  He reminded me of a man I heard about who, when surrounded by a certain number of people, made remarks which resulted in rounds of applause and laughter. The person making the jokes, or what he thought were jokes, believed that the laughter was at his wit.  He did not realise that it was at the half-wit.</P>
    <P>Shortly after Deputy Dillon had commenced his introductory speech, he found himself entirely without support from the Labour Benches.  There was not a single Labour member present, and, except for an odd member of his own Party coming in to replace another member on the Front Opposition Bench so as to be sure that somebody would be present to second his motion when he had concluded, there was nobody there to listen to him.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think it is relevant to read for the House an extract from a speech which was made here on the subject by Deputy Costello when he was Taoiseach.  I propose quoting from Volume 112, column 2146, on the 5th August, 1948.  I think it is well, in view of what we have heard from the proposer and seconder of this motion, that attention should be drawn to what was then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the 1938 Agreement was being negotiated the adverse trade balance between this country and Great Britain was such as not to cause any anxiety or certainly very little anxiety.  In the intervening period the adverse trade balance has gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or who looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.  The balance of payments between this country and Great Britain has, in recent years, become completely disordered. When we took office some months ago and became aware of the actual position in regard to the adverse trade balance and the nature and the alarming extent of that adverse trade balance it was one of the problems that gave us the greatest pos- <Col N="1793" /> sible cause for dismay.  We felt that it was essential, if this country was to retain its economic stability, that steps must urgently be taken to redress that adverse balance of trade and to try to restore order into our disordered balance of payments. That was one of the big factors that we had to keep before us during our negotiations with Great Britain.  I am glad to say that we have been able to achieve agreement, embodied in the agreement that is before the House, as to the methods by which we will be enabled to deal with that very alarming and very urgent problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conclusion referred to in this White Paper, part of paragraph 17, which has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> during this debate, and which says that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The inescapable conclusion is that substantial relief to the balance of payments can only be achieved by importing less&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>is regarded, and stated categorically by the previous speakers to be, &ldquo;tendentious nonsense&rdquo;.  Our predecessors, in their few years in office, regarded that as a vital, important and urgent matter, in connection with which they did nothing, but when it fell to their successors in office to try to recognise the serious position that could overtake this country if a continuation of that policy were allowed to go on, it is immediately translated, notwithstanding what they said as holders of office, as &ldquo;tendentious nonsense&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon started off his references to the White Paper by the production of a rather large photograph which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> depicting some timber being shipped to the North of Ireland.  He held it before him as exhibit No. 1, one of the many exhibits he was going to produce to satisfy the Dáil and the country that, in the words of his motion, this White Paper was deserving of condemnation.  It is only reasonable that one should try to get some perspective about the facts and deal with them also in a reasonable way. The Deputy adduced, first of all, as <Col N="1794" /> one of his figures, that the cost of timber in the construction of a house would be somewhere about 5 per cent. of the total cost of the building of a house, and from that proceeded to show the desperate situation which now confronts us as a result of a certain limited amount of timber having been exported.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister for Finance who pointed out to him by way of interjection that timber merchants in this country were prevailed upon to import and to build up a substantial stockpile of timber in order that our requirements, particularly with regard to housing, would be met. That was confirmed by Deputy Dillon, who stated quite clearly that it was at the request and on the advice of the then Government these timber merchants, as other importers of essential commodities were asked to do, imported sufficiently large quantities to warrant our supply being regarded as stockpiling.</P>
    <P>The annual consumption of timber in this country, according to figures which are available, is about 75,000 standards, and for a half-year would be 37,500 standards.  As I said, following the advice of the then Coalition Government, the merchants bought in timber rapidly, notwithstanding the fact that they were buying in a rising market. We must not forget that the reason given for the necessity to buy and to stockpile was the advent of the Korean situation and, with the advent of that situation, the prices throughout the world of most commodities took a steep rise.</P>
    <P>The price of Scandinavian softwood rose from £60 per standard c.i.f. in the first half of 1950 to £84 in March, 1951, and ultimately to a figure of £104. Since then timber slumped to something like £74 per ton in the first half of this year, and has now settled itself at from £80 to £84.  Obviously in that stockpiling of timber there must be some timber, if it has not been used or has not been replaced by the cheaper timber which has come in since that period, bought at the high price and that is now affected in its price by the world price of timber.  Consequently, traders and firms who held large stocks of commodities brought in owing to <Col N="1795" /> this stockpiling idea, found themselves with large overdrafts and heavy pressure to liquidate them.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the permits to export a quantity of this timber would affect the building programme and the housing of our people.  It was even stated that this was proof that this Government were going to stop the campaign which they had inaugurated in 1932 and kept going at full speed during the time of their previous period of office and again taken up since they resumed office.  Nobody told us on Friday how much timber was in the country and how much had left it.  Fortunately, as a result of a question by Deputy Donnellan to-day, we got some very important elucidating information which shatters completely the arguments put up on Friday by Deputy Dillon.  It is worth while asking ourselves what it all means.  The Minister's reply to to-day's question states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Towards the end of 1950 timber merchants were encouraged by the Government of the day to lay in stocks of timber against a possible emergency.  It was considered that stock should be maintained at six months' requirements, or approximately 80,000 tons, and the timber trade was exhorted to try to reach this target.  In 1951 heavy purchases were made by these firms.</P>
    <P>During the early part of 1952 timber prices on world markets began to fall and by the middle of the year the prices had dropped by about a quarter as compared with the 1951 level.</P>
    <P>Last July representatives of the timber trade informed me that the fall in world prices had placed them in an extremely serious position as they were carrying very heavy stocks of high-priced timber.  They stated that timber in stock and purchased represented almost one year's requirements and that the drop in prices had thrown a serious strain on their financial resources, especially as certain firms who had not previously imported timber were availing of the current lower prices to bring in timber, thus rendering the high-priced <Col N="1796" /> timber more or less unsaleable.</P>
    <P>The timber trade representatives asked that they should be helped to liquidate without loss the stocks which had been built up in keeping with Government policy and proposed that imports should be controlled.  This proposal did not commend itself to me, because, among other reasons, import control would tend to keep up building costs.  As an alternative, I indicated that the grant of export facilities would be considered to help them to reduce surplus stocks and facilitate the earlier importation of lower-priced timber.  The timber trade representatives did not consider that it would not be possible for them to avail of that facility to any extent and, up to the present, licences have been issued only for the export of 5,745 tons, a quantity which represents less than 4 per cent. of our normal yearly requirements of timber.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is very difficult sometimes to get people to understand the most simple language.  Deputy Dillon told us at one stage that he was speaking figuratively and at another stage that he was speaking literally.  I am not speaking metaphorically; I am speaking categorically. First of all, I have tried to prove that we have sufficient stocks of timber in the country at the moment to meet approximately one year's building requirements at the present rate of building, which is higher than last year and higher again than the year under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> There have been many occasions on which the Government spokesman has been precluded from making a reply. I am putting it to you, Sir, that most of the time of this motion has been occupied by speakers on the opposite side of the House, and that one spokesman of the Government should be heard without further interruption.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Military Service Pensions&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that Old I.R.A. military service pensions should be increased on a par with the increase given to other pensioners of the Republic of Ireland, and that as this increase is overdue it should be retrospective to the operative date of increases to other State pensioners.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this motion I feel I have to go back a little in retrospect from a service point of view, to prove what men did from the advent of the Irish Volunteers until the closing date, which is the same date in all the Bills that have been passed for military active service in this House, that is, September, 1923.  I feel I have to go back to the days of 1913.  In that particular year, a few people&mdash;sore heads, cranks and irresponsibles, as they were called at the time&mdash;started the Volunteer movement in Dublin, and from there the resurgence permeated throughout most of the 32 counties of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It went on to 1914, and those who can remember, who are members of this House, will agree that in the <Col N="1811" /> Howth gun-running there was actually active service for men.  As a matter of fact, lives were lost as a result of that venture.</P>
    <P>We come on to 1915, where you had a certain amount of activity in drilling and in manoeuvres, and where a lot of Volunteers were more or less disemployed from their particular vocations and, as a result, some of them were victimised and lost their positions.</P>
    <P>Then we come on to 1916, the year of the Rebellion, which of course was the peak year for that particular period and for some years after.  A lot of people who took part in that Rebellion, either under arms or through some other channel of service in the Volunteers which did not necessitate carrying arms, were imprisoned. Some were sentenced to death and the sentences carried out. Some were sentenced to penal servitude. Some members who are present in this House at the moment suffered the hardship of undergoing their sentences in English jails, and some were interned.</P>
    <P>We come on then to the release in 1917.  There was in 1917 a big reorganisation taking place and you had the Volunteer movement springing up again into activity, &ldquo;rearing its ugly head in certain places,&rdquo; as was mentioned by some famous reporter for an English paper at the time.  As a result of the activities, there was further imprisonment and I am sorry to say some good men lost their lives as a result of hunger strikes they went through in Irish jails.</P>
    <P>In 1918 this activity continued and the activity was intensified in the month of March, for a particular reason&mdash;there was a threat by the British Government at that time that conscription was going to be enforced in this country.  You had some of the people who started from the beginning again very active in the campaign against conscription and as a result of their activity, they were again imprisoned. But conscription was not enforced.</P>
    <P>In 1919 a lot of those men were released.  In 1920 you had four famous hunger strikes&mdash;two here and two in <Col N="1812" /> English jails.  Numerous Irishmen were prominent in the Volunteer movement&mdash;at this time it had become the I.R.A.&mdash;and as a result of their activity some of them left these prisons with their health impaired in consequence of the hunger strikes. Some of them went to their Maker very early after that and some of them lived and were as a result chronic invalids for the remainder of their lives.</P>
    <P>In 1920 we saw the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries in this country. We saw the atrocities they committed and the way in which they were met by the I.R.A. in small armed bands operating in various localities.  Armed opposition was continuous.  Throughout 1920 there were ambushes of great importance from the point of view of the morale of the people of this country and that of the garrison that was trying to impose their will on the people.  Fighting was continued until the Truce was signed in July and in 1922 and 1923 we had the civil war.</P>
    <P>My reason for mentioning all this is to show that people who ordinarily would have pursued some lucrative avocation lost their careers as a result of their activities and their continuous service.  Many of those who took part in the fight instead of holding minor posts as they do to-day might have been enjoying far better conditions if they had taken no part in the movement as it was called.</P>
    <P>In 1924 the Cumann na nGaedheal Government decided upon a pensions scheme for men who had served in the National Army.  Non-commissioned officers got something like £5 per year for each year of service while officers got pensions from £5 upwards.  Those pensions continued until 1934.  In the meantime there was a change of Government in 1932 when Fianna Fáil introduced a pensions scheme more or less on the same lines as the 1924 pensions scheme.  The assessments, the service and the amount of money allowed were the same.  In 1945 there was an amending Act to both the 1924 and 1934 Acts when the same amount of money was allowed and the same service stipulated.  In 1949 the inter-Party Government introduced another <Col N="1813" /> pensions scheme somewhat on a par with the former schemes.</P>
    <P>Nobody can gainsay that from 1913 to 1923 the men in question manned the beárna baoil.  When a limited number of volunteers were asked for that number was available.  That continued on into the period of the columns.</P>
    <P>As a result of that movement and the efforts of those people, the institutions under which we are carrying on here to-day were set up.  Every institution that is recognised in the country at the moment was set up as a result of the activities of a band of half-drilled and badly armed men who were ready to sacrifice their lives by fighting against a well-disciplined force during the period 1916 to 1922. Practically all officials in the State and certain people who received pensions for service to another country have had their pensions or salaries increased, except the men who were responsible for the establishment of this State.</P>
    <P>Some cynics, either verbally or through the Press, may treat this motion with scorn in the morning and say: &ldquo;Those fellows are looking for more pensions.&rdquo;  Let them be what they are, but the men who earned the pensions are the men who brought the State to the point at which it is at the moment.  They are the men who established every institution in this State.  Were it not for them, we would probably be bound up in chains to our friends across the water and carrying on directly under the institution of Westminster.</P>
    <P>I believe that, no matter how much I may praise those men, I could not praise them enough.  It is only now in retrospect that we can realise all they did.  They faced a disciplined army, a great number of whose personnel was recruited from men who had gained promotion to the rank of officers by bravery on the field of battle.  Half-armed and half-drilled, and with the will to fight and suffer, the men of whom I speak went out to achieve the freedom of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Yet every Government, irrespective of what Party happened to be in power, never mentioned an increase in <Col N="1814" /> pension for the pensioners under the 1924, 1934, 1945 and the 1949 Acts. Nobody will appreciate more than the Minister himself the hardships which these anomalies involve for veterans who suffered.  The Minister was at one time senior officer of the Dublin Brigade.  He knew very well what all the men under his command had to go through and what he had to go through himself.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>It is not a popular thing to raise a matter on the Adjournment, and it is over eight years since I was responsible for bringing a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary into Dáil Éireann on the Adjournment.  On this occasion, I was compelled to do so for the reason that, as I indicated in my question, the foundation of our national economy was at stake, in view of the fact that in the past 12 months our live-stock population has declined by 97,100.  I thought the Minister would take this matter seriously in his reply, but I have to state here that he did not grasp the position, and did not realise the seriousness of the situation when he replied that the figures for 1951 and 1952 were not of a magnitude to give ground for alarm.</P>
      <P>When our live stock, our chief and, indeed, our only export, and the only income that we have worth speaking about, have declined to the tune of 97,000, surely the Minister could not have been serious when he told me that the figures did not give any ground for alarm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> In reply to a supplementary question, he said that if I would look at the statistics for some years back&mdash;I think he mentioned 100 years&mdash;I would find similar reductions.  Surely the Minister is not serious in suggesting that I should go back 100 years.  If I went back to the time of the famine, more than likely I would find some similar reduction, if it were possible to get the figures.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go back to the time of the Famine, and neither will I go back to the time when we had compulsory tillage in this country, because at that time there was bound to be a reduction in the live-stock population.  Neither will I go back to the time of Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Agriculture, the professional calf slaughterer of this country because everybody knows we were bound to have a reduction in live stock at that period.  I will confine myself to this year and last year and to the reduction of 97,100 which has taken place.  It cannot be said, I hope, that I raise this matter for any political reason because a serious matter of this kind should be treated above politics and that is the way I intend to treat it to-night.  I hope that that is the way the Minister will treat it, because one matter in respect of which it is dangerous to play politics is a reduction in our live-stock population.</P>
    <P>Looking through the <i>Trade Journal</i> for September, 1952, I find that in milch cows and heifers in calf alone, there is a reduction of 23,800 almost 24,000, in the foundation stock of our industry.  I need not point out that the milch cow and heifer in calf constitute the foundation of our live-stock industry, and according to the <i>Trade Journal</i> there is a reduction as compared with last year of almost 24,000 in these cattle.  Surely the Minister and every member of the House must look on that as alarming. There is no use in telling me that there was a reduction at the time of the Famine, during the period of compulsory tillage or at the time of the slaughter of the calves.  We have none of these conditions at the moment, but we have a reduction of 24,000 in our <Col N="1816" /> foundation stock and the Minister must do something to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>Again, I find in the <i>Trade Journal</i> a reduction of 58,500, or 6 per cent. of the total population in cattle under one year.  Does the Minister not realise what that means?  Does he not realise that the cause of that is the reduction in our foundation stock?  In the case of cattle of one year and under two years, there is again a reduction of 14,800, or 1.5 of the population. Does the Minister not realise that that shows that things are going from bad to worse?  It is his job as Minister to do something about that situation.  If we add up all these figures, we find a total reduction of over 91,000 in the past 12 months. Surely that is something which must be dealt with as something apart from politics?</P>
    <P>I have to refer now to something which shows a different trend, but I do not refer to it for any political purpose or from any wish to make a case for the Minister's predecessor.  In the same issue of the <i>Trade Journal,</i> I find that cattle of two years and upwards increased by 26,400.  I ask the Minister to pause for a moment and ask himself what is the cause for the increase of 26,400 in the over two-year-old live stock in the country?  I presume it is because the foundation for that live stock was in sufficient numbers and it is that that has caused the increase for that year.  I tried to get the figures for each county but I was unable to get them for the past year. Here, however, I find that in County Galway in-calf heifers have gone down nearly 1,500 in one year.  Surely the Minister will agree that in a county like Galway, which is comparatively small in so far as the cattle trade is concerned, it is a serious position to have the foundation for our live stock decline by 1,500.  In County Cork, it has gone down by over 7,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that if that trend is permitted to continue the position will become very serious.  Losing over 97,000 of our live-stock population is very serious.  That is the number we lost last year.  If we lose that number next year, or perhaps more than that, we will find ourselves in the position of having neither a live-stock trade nor a <Col N="1817" /> dead meat trade.  I am putting the case as fairly as I can.  I am not seeking propaganda.  I do not need it.  I do not raise this for political kudos.  I raise it because it is such an important matter for the country generally.  Yet the Minister told me to-day that the decline was not of a magnitude to give ground for alarm.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister must realise that a decrease of 97,000 in the live-stock population is of sufficient magnitude to give ground for alarm.  The Minister must have seen the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday. There is an article in it on the decline in cattle stocks.  That article states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has been stated that one of the prices being paid by this country for the expansion of the export trade in dead meat is a marked reduction in the number of cattle.  How far this is supported by the figures can be judged by a comparison of the returns of live stock over the past two years.</P>
      <P>In the summer of 1951 the total number of cattle in the Twenty-Six Counties was estimated to be 4,376,000.  In June of the present year it was less by 70,000.  Except in the case of cattle of two years and upwards the falling-off was to be observed in all groups.  This year milch cows are fewer by 24,000; cattle less than a year old are fewer by 59,000; and cattle over a year but under two years are 15,000 fewer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are far from reassuring. Whether the decline can be wholly ascribed to the new industries is another affair.  Unfortunately, it cannot be attributed to more tillage, because this year the total acreage <Col N="1818" /> under corn, root and green crops was in fact slightly less than last year's total.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely a loss of 97,000 in our live-stock population plus a decrease in our tillage gives ground for serious alarm. I know that the Minister is concerned about agriculture, and I am certain that the civil servant who wrote the reply to the question I put down, stating that there were no grounds for alarm did not express the Minister's view.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Donnellan did not have the courtesy to follow the precedent I established last week in dividing the time fairly on a question in which two Deputies were interested.  The Minister replied to-day to two questions set down by Deputy Donnellan and me.  Whatever Deputy Donnellan's motives may have been in setting down the particular question, I can assure the House that I, at any rate, had no political motive. As an Independent farmer Deputy, I am primarily concerned with the agricultural industry, and I have always taken a deep interest in the progress of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan stated with considerable emphasis and frequent repetition <Col N="1819" /> the number of cows shown by statistics for the present year have declined by 24,000 as compared with last year.  He failed to mention that last year the number declined by 50,000 as compared with the year before.  When Deputy Donnellan referred to the reduction in the number of young cattle in the country he must have realised that these non-existent cattle were the progeny of the non-existent cows of the year before.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Donnellan were not concerned with it from a political angle, he would have referred to the fact that the decline was steeper than last year.  My concern is for next year.  I am anxious to ensure that the dangerous trend which was set on foot by the former Minister for Agriculture, when he announced his intention to reduce the price of milk, will be reversed. I trust that that dangerous trend which was started, as I say, by the Minister's predecessor, will be arrested by the present Minister for Agriculture in the coming year.</P>
      <P>It is true that those trends correct themselves to a certain extent by the operation of the law of supply and demand, but, at the same time, we are anxious that the Minister will take whatever action he can take, and which it is in his power to take, in order to right this matter.  I am sorry I have not time to develop the matter more fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I took Questions Nos. 51 and 52 in the names of Deputy Cogan and Deputy Donnellan, together, and I stated in my reply that &ldquo;the fluctuations shown in the numbers of dairy and young cattle in the preliminary census statement for June, 1952, as compared with June, 1951, are not of a magnitude to give ground for alarm. The total number of cattle in 1952 was <Col N="1820" /> the third highest in the last 30 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Cogan has struck the right note.  There has been a decline for the past two or three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a decline there, but that has happened over the past 100 years.  The first census of the cattle population was taken in 1851. If any Deputy looks up the records of the censuses or the statistics over that period he will find that, down through the years, there were periods of fluctuation: there were periods when there was a rise and there were periods when there was a fall in the numbers of dairy and young cattle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan said that the decline was not due to compulsory tillage.  Even in the years when we had compulsory tillage in this country our cattle population was not as low. What was the position when we had compulsory tillage?  It might be of interest to Deputy Donnellan to know that in no year since 1944 had we as many young cattle as we had in that year&mdash;and we had compulsory tillage at the same time.  Therefore, apparently, compulsory tillage does not affect the cattle population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the year 1952.  I might point out at this stage that there is a certain mortality in the cattle population.  It has been there every year, as has been proved in the past 30 years since this State came into existence.  We have had these fluctuations all the time.  Any Deputy who looks up the statistics over a long period will note these fluctuations.  Let us examine the position.  In 1952 we had 918,700 cattle under one year old. That figure was less than the 1951 figure but it was greater than the 1948 figure when we had 852,725 cattle in that category.  In 1947 the figure was 850,000.  Therefore, it will be seen that the figure for 1952 is higher than <Col N="1821" /> the figure for 1948.  As I have said, there was a reduction from June, 1950, until June, 1951, of 50,000 cows.  Why was there that reduction?  Deputy Cogan has said that the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, went to Waterford and told the people there: &ldquo;We will give you 1/- a gallon for milk for the next five years.&rdquo;  That had an important bearing on the whole question.  What was my attitude towards the problem?  How did I endeavour to keep more cows on the land?  I increased the price of milk by 2d.  That encouraged the farmers.</P>

This year we had a further drop of 24,000.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That fluctuation is there over the years, due to mortality and to many causes.  For instance, the drop in the number of heifers and cows can be attributed to one or two causes. The first cause is the high price for beef.  A number of farmers who had heifers did not allow them to go in-calf but sold them as fat heifers.  That was one way in which they were got rid of.  To-day, that is changed. Springers are going up in price. Farmers are holding on to heifers now. Consequently, you had a drop in 1949-50 of 20,000 heifers.  That has been happening over the past 100 years.  The cow population rose from 1,055,000 to 1,350,000.  There are certain years in which there is a fall in the numbers and there are other years when there is an increase in the numbers.  We have been trying to arrest the fall by our attitude in regard to the price of milk.  As I say, we increased the price last year.  We are endeavouring to arrest the fall also by other means. We are endeavouring to do so by artificial insemination, for instance. That was part of the answer I gave to-day.  There are also higher prices for dressed meat going out of the country and there are higher prices for live stock.  All these things are tending to encourage people to keep more cows, to produce more calves and, consequently, to produce more live stock for export on the hoof and in the form of dead meat.  That has been our policy and we have been carrying it out.</P>
