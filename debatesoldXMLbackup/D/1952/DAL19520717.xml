      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was urging the development of advisory services which would be based on the parish rather than on the county.  In the parish of Bansha, which was one of the three parishes where the scheme was actually initiated, there is evidence already to show that the parochial organisation of advisory services yields results, because in that parish, in the short period of 18 months or two years at the request of the farmers themselves, the soil of nearly every farmer in the parish was tested.  The use of fertilisers was increased to an unprecedented degree.  We successfully initiated the operation of a scheme for the elimination of uneconomic cows from the dairy herds.  We succeeded in persuading the farmers to make the grass ensilage the better to feed their cows in winter with a corresponding improvement in the milk yield of the dairy herds of the parish.  We intensified the rehabilitation of land.  All that was achieved with the enthusiastic co-operation of the farmers themselves. Perhaps, one of the most dramatic achievements of our work in Bansha reproduced what has already been done in the Loophead Peninsula, the reduction of calf mortality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is an exaggeration <Col N="1101" /> to say that in the parish of Bansha, where hundreds of calves had died every winter in the past, in the winter of 1950-51 the mortality of calves had been reduced to about 12 head.  I believe that that can become one of the most important economic factors in our live-stock industry, as a result of a nation-wide campaign against calf mortality, which was initiated three years ago.</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of Deputies to Appendix 2 of the White Paper, circulated by the Minister for Agriculture yesterday.  If they will look at the numbers of live stock, they will find under the heading &ldquo;Other Cattle&rdquo;, four categories&mdash;cattle three years old and over, cattle two years old and under three, cattle one year old and under two, and cattle under one year.  If they will look at the number of cattle under one year in the year 1947, they will find it is 850,000. If they will look at the cattle between one year and two years old in the following year, 1948, they will find it is 741,000.  That is to say, that between 1947 and 1948, 109,000 calves disappeared. We do not export calves in that age group at all practically, so that those calves have disappeared through slaughter and death from disease.</P>
    <P>If you will look at the number of cattle under one year in 1948, it is 852,000, and in 1949 it is 804,000, so that the loss has been reduced to 48,000 calves.  If you will look at the number of cattle under one year in 1949 it is 957,000, and in 1950 the number of cattle between one year and two years is 911,000, which represents a loss of 46,000.</P>
    <P>In 1950 there were 982,000 cattle under one year and in 1951 974,000 cattle between one year old and two years which shows the dramatic development that, instead of losing 100,000 calves as we did between 1947 and 1948, we lost only 8,000 between 1950 and 1951.  I do not say that the average annual loss was 100,000 calves, but taking that figure as a convenient one, these cattle reared to three year olds would sell for £50 apiece one with another.  If those figures were valid, this reduction in calf mortality would <Col N="1102" /> be worth £5,000,000 per annum to the live-stock industry of this country through no other activity than preventing the calf mortality.  Divide that figure by two in order to arrive at a conservative estimate of the value of this saving in young cattle and we get a figure of at least £2,500,000 per annum accruing to the live-stock industry as a result of the elimination of disease, mainly in calves.</P>
    <P>In Bansha I do not think the potentialities of the parish plan are by any means exhausted.  I had promised the parish of Ballyduff in Waterford that the parish plan would be extended there.  In fact, it never was owing to difficulties which presented themselves, but the co-operative apple-packing plant in Dungarvan is part of that undertaking because a survey of the parish of Ballyduff was made and it emerged in the course of that survey how considerable the orchard area of that particular district was.</P>
    <P>The senior horticultural inspector of the Department wanted an opportunity to bring the horticultural section of the Department fully to bear so that we might determine what fruit might be garnered from a concentrated effort.  In these circumstances, I directed him to concentrate his attention on that particular area of the south-east of Ireland with the result that we have the co-operative apple-packing plant in Dungarvan where a group of farmers formed their own co-operative.</P>
    <P>They carry out the cultural operations through the medium of the technical staff of their co-operative which sprays many of the orchards up to eight times in the course of the year.  The farmers pick the apples, the co-operative collects them at the farm and pays them a basic price on delivery of the apples at the packing station in Dungarvan.  The apples are packed and graded there and stored in gas storage chambers and, when the marketing season in the spring comes, they are repacked and regarded and the farmer gets his second payment corresponding with the quality of his apples as they come out of the gas storage.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the bulk of <Col N="1103" /> the orchard owners in that area have this year received twice as much for their apples as they ever received before and there is every reason for believing that the payment for their apples hereafter will be even better.</P>
    <P>All that leads me more and more to the conclusion, without going into the details of the parishes of Tydavnet in Monaghan and Ardee in Louth, that if you can mobilise from existing county instructors and future graduates approximately 300 agricultural advisers and allocate one to every three parishes and rejuvenate the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society so that it would effectively organise co-operation amongst the farmers, not only for the purpose of manufacturing butter, but for the purpose of marketing apples, marketing onions, marketing fowl, marketing eggs, marketing pigs and the hundred and one things which the small farmer has to do, no one of which could not be better done through co-operation, you can completely revolutionise the whole life of the small farmers of Ireland into the most highly efficient and economical producers that can conceivably have the custody of the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We had planned to sustain the parish plan as adumbrated by me now by the establishment of a new institute of agricultural and veterinary science which would constitute an approved college of the National University and of Dublin University.  The buildings and equipment for that were to be supplied by an appropriation from the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund and that scheme was, I believe, approved in principle by the Marshall Aid Administration.  I had in fact invited and secured the gracious acceptance of a distinguished scientist to be first president of that institute and it was in the process of organisation when I left office.  I do not want to pretend that the major difficulties had been overcome or that I left my successor a cut-and-dried scheme.  I certainly did not and it would be an arduous job to carry to completion the plans we had in mind. I trust he intends to carry them to <Col N="1104" /> completion and to ensure that the existing research institutions under his control and the faculties of University College, Dublin, and University College, Cork, will all be brought together with the veterinary college in an institute that will reflect credit on the country and provide a steady supply of veterinary surgeons and agricultural advisers sufficient to man the parish plan on the lines outlined by me now some time in the early future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably associated with University College, Dublin and T.C.D. but that would not mean that all the work would be carried out in Dublin, just as in Belltsville, outside Washington, which is the centre for the Federal Department of Agriculture of the U.S.A., the centre is at Belltsville and they have several stations all over the United States.  The subject-matter of research is usually located in the area in which the research relates to the type of agriculture normal to that area.</P>
      <P>There are only two details to which I wish to refer now and I shall leave the rest of these matters to other Deputies to discuss.  I suppose we all have a certain yearning for vindication. I want to direct the attention of the Dáil to Volume 130, No. 9, of the Official Report of the 3rd April, 1952, column 1365:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. T. O'Sullivan asked the Minister for Agriculture if he would give an indication as to what the prospects are as to the disposal of the 1952 flax crop.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The Minister replied to that question and then Deputy M.P. Murphy asked the following supplementary question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seeing that many farmers are already preparing to grow flax, is the Minister prepared to take steps to see that the present price of flax will be subsidised?</P>
    <P>Mr. Walsh: There is not a market for flax, first of all.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: May I ask the Minister this?  Does he not tremble in his shoes to say that, seeing that he is sitting beside Deputy Patrick Smith, who threatened me with assassination for saying the same thing?</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: For insulting our customers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy then asked a further supplementary question, to which the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no question of subsidisation of flax.  The representatives of the flax growers made their own arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He further said that he had already pointed out that he was not in negotiation with anybody in connection with the price of flax.  &ldquo;The representatives of the growers were.&rdquo;  Then the Minister added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My information is that there is a market this year for about half the acreage grown last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret that my distinguished colleagues, Deputy Mrs. Rice and Deputy Dr. Maguire, are not here present.  I foresaw two years ago that the Belfast flax spinners intended to try that trick on our people, that, as soon as their market for linen cloth began to dwindle, they would take 100 per cent. of the flax grown in the Six Counties and simply tell our growers to do what they liked with that which they had been enticed into growing.  I told our people not to depend on one buyer and, unless these buyers were prepared to give a firm contract in advance, to get out of flax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith, my predecessor, representing Cavan; Deputy Mrs. Rice and Deputy Dr. Maguire, my colleagues <Col N="1106" /> in Monaghan, had fits.  They addressed public meetings.  They wept over my lack of courtesy to the nice, kind Belfast flax spinners.  If I had only stroked them and told them how I loved them, they would have bought all the flax from the flax growers; it was bad Deputy Dillon who upset the little darlings! My successor is a man of grace and charm, but he does not seem to have been able to put the &ldquo;comether&rdquo; on them either.  The difference is that when I was Minister for Agriculture I told the flax growers: &ldquo;Do not grow flax.&rdquo;  But when I left office the poor people were told to get conacre, to grow flax, and now there is nobody to buy it.  They have to go, hat in hand, to as tough a gang of tulips as ever I dealt with.  I threw them out when they came to me.  I told them to go and take a running jump at themselves.  These are the words I used and these are the words in which I was reported in this House. Was I right?</P>
    <P>There is not even a yap out of the people opposite now.  I declare to goodness they nearly lifted the roof of this House two years ago in virtuous indignation.  Goodness knows, I often wonder how the vascular system of their countenances has been able to carry the blushes that they have to endure from time to time.  What is the use of worrying?  If any Deputy wants a good hearty laugh, let him get Volume 114 and read Deputy Smith on the virtues of the Belfast flax spinners, in columns 1279-1283, with an obbligato, if you please, from Deputy Michael Moran of Castlebar, God save the mark.  I would advise you not to read it unless you have got strong stomachs because it would make a strong man sick.</P>
    <P>Would it be rather indelicate if I inquired, if it is a matter of any interest to the Minister for Agriculture, why the barley growers, who had a contract with Guinness's which would have secured for them a price of 102/-per barrel for barley this year, went into conference with Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Company, and came out with the announcement that they had accepted 75/- per barrel?  I have been a long time in public life, but that <Col N="1107" /> is the daftest transaction I ever heard of.  I think the oddest feature about it is that the Minister for Agriculture declares himself entirely disinterested. He says in effect: &ldquo;It is none of my business; I have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;  Surely, if any group of lunatics, professing to represent the farmers of this country, go into the principal barley buyers of Ireland, tear up a contract under which the farmers were to have been paid 102/- per barrel for their barley, and accept a new contract under which they will get only 75/- per barrel, you would imagine the Minister would send for some of them and ask: &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How can the Minister for Agriculture say to us that this is a matter in which he did not interest himself and does not intend to interest himself?  I want to say quite deliberately that I have never heard an explanation of that transaction.  I do not understand it, and I have never found anyone who could tell me why it was done or how it was done.  I am going to suggest to Dáil Éireann now that the Minister is failing in his duty if he does not investigate that transaction and find out why it was undertaken.</P>
    <P>The last thing that I want to tell the Minister is something which I think he ought to look into.  We have had annually a considerable difficulty in securing sufficient supplies of nitrogenous fertilisers.  I was recently at a meeting of industrial chemists in Aberdeen, and there I was rebuking certain prominent figures in the industrial chemistry industry in England for their failure to make available to Ireland supplies of phosphates, especially in view of the quantities of agricultural produce which are being exported from this country to Great Britain.  As I was talking, a gentleman whose name I will furnish to the Minister, turned round and said to me: &ldquo;What are you talking about? Why would you not take the 27,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia which were offered to you at £10 below the current price on ship?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You never offered them to me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I did&rdquo; and then <Col N="1108" /> he named the person to whom he offered them, and said that person had refused them.  Now I will give to the Minister the name of the person who gave me that information and the name of the person to whom he said he offered them.  Will the Minister inquire why the offer was refused? I have put the matter to the Minister in this way because my informant gave me the information in the presence of two other witnesses whose names I will furnish to the Minister. The standing of my informant was such as to put it beyond doubt that the information he was giving to me was true.</P>
    <P>If an investigation of that matter expedites a decision on the Minister's part to take active steps himself to ensure that there will be adequate supplies of fertilisers wherever we want them, whether the ring wants the supplies in or not, then a useful purpose will have been served by my sojourn in Aberdeen.</P>
    <P>I have moved to refer back this Estimate and to tell you the honest truth I am damned if I know why I did.  I think the only ground is that the Minister appears to me to be a great deal more somnolent than he ought to be. I think he has begun to forget that he is the Minister who counts and is allowing himself to be kicked about by Ministers who do not count or ought not to count.  I do not know if the House read yesterday the comment of the United States team which came over here to survey industry in Ireland and its export potential.  The verdict was that the industries in Ireland are so highly protected that they have no incentive to reach a standard of efficiency which would give them a hope in hell of selling on any export market in the world.</P>
    <P>The exports of this country in the last six months are a record, and it is the small farmers of Ireland who produced them all and sold them in that market which none of the highly-protected tariffed industries, whose owners float around this city in limousines, have ever wished to compete in.  The Minister for Agriculture is the Minister for those who produced those exports.  Not one single one of <Col N="1109" /> the tariffed industries or their limousined proprietors would survive a fortnight if they had not the right to batten under the protection of tariffs and quotas on the hard-won earnings of the small farmers of Ireland.  There is no economic activity in this country which is not ultimately dependent on the interest which the Minister represents in this House.  The whole standard of living of all our people ultimately depends on the success or failure of the people for whom the Minister speaks.</P>
    <P>The fault that I find with the Minister, mainly, is that he does not make that felt and that all those who are living on the agricultural industry &mdash;not in it, but on it&mdash;assert a claim to precedence, and have the impudence to claim that their interests shall prevail over those of the agricultural industry when they come in contact with them.  My fault with the Minister for Agriculture is that his voice does not carry sufficient weight.  My fault with him is that he is allowing others to push him about.  My fault with him is that, when the drivelling Minister for External Affairs comes waddling into a discussion on the Department of Agriculture, the Minister for Agriculture does not sweep him up and throw him into the ash-pan where he belongs. If the Minister for Agriculture assumes the position that belongs to him by right, as the most important Minister in the Government of Ireland, next to the Taoiseach, I am damned if I can find very much fault with the opening statement which he made in introducing the Estimate.  I adhere to my view, however, which the Minister frankly confesses is an honest difference of opinion between him and me as to how best the advisory services can be organised in the country.  I rather believe that the Minister is differing with me in no small measure, because he thinks it is necessary to find something on which to differ with me, but in his heart I believe he agrees with me that the organisation of the advisory services on the basis of the parish would work much better than an attempt to organise them on the basis of a whole county, where there is no nexus of social integration on <Col N="1110" /> which to found effective advisory services which I have no doubt both he and I sincerely want.</P>
    <P>Wake up! That is my principal admonition to the Minister for Agriculture. Wake up and throw your weight about, because if you do not, others will.  There is no use in being too idealistic in the world of politics. Others will not.  There is no need to be too tough, but there is always need to let our neighbours know that, if we have to be tough, we can be.  It is true, and we might as well face it, that there are two outlooks in this country&mdash;the city outlook and the country outlook.  I am often astonished at the utter inability of the city outlook to understand the problems of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am often amazed at the inability of the city outlook to realise how far they are dependent on rural Ireland for their very existence.  I was often staggered by the arrogant impudence of those who were no more than parasites on the agricultural community of this country in their assertions that the so-called industrial arm was what mattered when, to any unprejudiced observer, they were nothing but blood-sucking parasites on the only industry in this country able to earn its living, in competition with the world.  We may have to be prepared to carry these parasites so long as we can afford it.  The duty of the Minister for Agriculture is to make it perfectly clear that the whole crazy structure of the tariff industries is being built up on the foundation of the agricultural industry.  Not a single one of the tariff industries would last a month if they had not the agricultural industry there to earn the money to keep them in existence.  It is time the Minister for Agriculture said to his more romantic colleagues: &ldquo;You can build too much on this foundation.&rdquo;  If you keep on piling up a growing burden of excess costs on the agricultural industry that has to sell its entire surplus output in the competitive markets of the world where they get no protection, the whole underlying foundation of their crazy structure will collapse and fall into dust and ashes but the tragedy is that underneath it <Col N="1111" /> will be buried the sole and the ultimate source of all the wealth of our people.  The Minister for Agriculture represents that source.  It is his duty to protect it.  It is because I feel that he has failed in that duty and that he has not appreciated the significance of the position to which he has attained&mdash;it is because I feel that he is not fighting as he ought to fight in the defence of the interests of what, in the last analysis, is the only section of our community that matters economically&mdash;that I think the motion to refer this Estimate back is justified.</P>

      <P>There was reclamation there before this scheme ever came up and I would like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that there has been great neglect in West Connemara of the drainage and reclamation schemes which are carried out by the people themselves by their own family labour.  They complain to me frequently that there is such concentration on administration of the machine scheme that people who are prepared to do their own on the grant available cannot get their inspection carried out. Deputy Dillon said that I was such a dishonourable man and so mercenary that I would crawl in on all fours, and I would see this fraud which he initiated going on, and that nevertheless, I would crawl out on all fours, accept the scheme, and draw my stipend as a Parliamentary Secretary which, incidentally, he increased for the purpose of weighting his argument, to £1,800.  Now let me use that argument against him.  I can therefore give him a proportionate increase on his salary when he was Minister.  I can fix it at £2,500.</P>

      <P>Having denounced this other scheme instituted by Deputy Dillon's own predecessor as Minister as a disgusting fraud, tomfoolery, and an attempt to put the dalladh mullóg on the people of Connemara, he came along nevertheless and placed all the services of his Department, according to his own statements, at the disposal of the tomato growers, swallowed his own words, continued in office for three and a quarter years, and continued to draw his £2,500 and his pension after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I went in on all-fours and came out on all-fours&mdash;I have only been a year in office yet&mdash;and swallowed the scheme, I suggest that Deputy Dillon is much nearer the ground than all-fours. In fact his record in relation to-tomatoes, if he wants the Deputies on his side of the House to believe I was a crawler on all-fours, renders him a <Col N="1117" /> gastropod.  For three years he drew his salary and for those three years he put the services of the Department at the disposal of the growers and he tried by the roundabout and dishonest method of swamping this market with Dutch tomatoes to kill the scheme he had not the courage to kill by the exercise of his ministerial functions.

      <P>We changed the scheme and it has now been reduced to some semblance of reasonableness.  It is only rocks that have something under them in the way of soil that are now being tackled.  There is a widespread request and demand in these areas for <Col N="1118" /> a concentration on the work of fertilising the land and the people have been going ahead with the fencing of it. The people will tell you that that is the most useful expenditure that can be undertaken in relation to land reclamation in these areas.  In none of these schemes, even as they are now being carried on, will one produce arable land.  The people who are working the schemes, the people for whom they are being worked and everybody resident in the areas admit one cannot make tillage land out of it.</P>

Where the people are prepared by their family labour to carry out these schemes inspections should be expedited.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will pardon me making that observation but I am speaking from my experience of Deputy Blowick.  I ask the Minister to pay more attention to the part of the scheme which is carried out by means of family labour.  In that case the degree of detailed inspection is much smaller than it is where machinery has to be used and where rock has to be dealt with, even though it is only the rock that one meets with in drainage operations.  I refer in particular to Connemara and other areas like Connemara where the spadework can be done and where there is soil of some sort, whether it be bog or clay, on which some progress can be made with hand labour.  If the inspections are carried out and the O.K. given to the people to go ahead with the work many more schemes can be undertaken simultaneously.  These schemes provide a very suitable type of employment for the family when it is not engaged on other farming duties.  We have experience of how well these schemes have worked in the past. These schemes should not be held up merely because rock is encountered in the making of drains.  There should be some reorganisation of the machinery used so that when all the rock encountered in drainage operations has been laid bare the driller can then come along and do a number of these schemes, as we say in Connemara, out of face.  Let the blasting be done and the people themselves will be willing to clear up the rock debris left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to represent to the Minister <Col N="1120" /> the views of the people mostly concerned, the small holders themselves. They are anxious to get on with reclamation work, and I suggest that the Minister should do either of two things: send in some other officers of his Department, or, better still&mdash;I think it could be done this way&mdash;give back again some authority to the assistant agricultural overseers already in the place to make these inspections in the course of their other duties and give the O.K. to these people to start, or take away some of the staff who are now concentrating all their attention on the machine end of the job. If the Minister does what I suggest, he will find that he will get a much larger output of reclaimed land, and there is a great deal of this soft land in which work can be speeded up.  That is the advantage it has over dealing with places which are mainly bedrock with a couple of inches of &ldquo;scraw&rdquo; over it.</P>
    <P>You are never going to get any tillage land in these places, and the best service we could render would be to increase the amount of tillage land, so that the people can have more potatoes, more oats, more milk and more of the other things which go to increase the standard of living in the household.  A very large amount of good work was done in these areas under the two previous schemes, which were run entirely on the grant basis. It was £5 originally, and the equivalent of £5 now would be a much larger sum, and the sum which has been provided under the Land Reclamation Act, 1948, is, on the whole, I think, looked upon as satisfactory.  I have not heard any complaints about it.</P>
    <P>I want to say, and I think I should say it, in view of the refutations I have had to make in my opening remarks, that this Party places land reclamation in these areas in a very high place on the priority list of services to the Gaeltacht and poorer areas, and the fact that we denounce in no uncertain terms an attempt at the impossible does not derogate or detract from our interest in and support of genuine land reclamation in these areas.  There is no better service could be put on foot for these people, but, as public representatives, we are certainly entitled, and we have a duty, to see <Col N="1121" /> that this money is spent to the best possible advantage for the applicants and the taxpayer who provides it.</P>
    <P>I have had to stand some very severe barrages of criticism over the things I have denounced in my opening remarks. While Deputy Dillon could get away with it, as apparently he gets away with the most fantastic things, we are expected, as I was told, to show some better sense of proportion in relation to this type of service.</P>
    <P>We were expected to do sooner what in fact we have now done, but I pointed out to these critics that, unlike Deputy Dillon, we did not set out, when we came in, to tear down labels. If a thing was good, we accepted it, no matter what label was on it, and this ramp of tearing F.F. off every scheme that Deputy Dillon found in the Department was not followed by us and in fact we gave this thing a fair try out.  I am not saying that I was prepared to give it the try out the Minister gave it, but he certainly gave it a sufficient trial under his administration as Minister.  He found it wanting, and, having found it wanting on a fair test, he changed it, and I think it is capable of still further adaptation and improvement.  I hope he will carry out these changes and adaptations without reference to any political consideration.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary who has just concluded is, I am glad to notice, beginning to take a different view of what the duty and responsibility of a Deputy or a Government are, and if Deputy Dillon and the inter-Party Government have succeeded in bringing him to a sense of his duty they have done a good day's work.  No matter how the Parliamentary Secretary likes it I must point out that he made statements and took a line of action while we were a Government that he now wants to back out of as gracefully as he can&mdash;that is if the Parliamentary Secretary can do anything gracefully.  He condemned the land rehabilitation scheme, lock, stock and barrel.  He comes in here now and tries to justify himself by representing to the House that some kind of queer scheme was going on in Connemara.  The land rehabilitation scheme was going on in Connemara in the same way as in any other part of the country and did good work there. I am glad to notice that under the present Minister for Agriculture it is still going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give my opinion of the land rehabilitation scheme.  It has been two and a half or three years in action now and already we have some idea of what good it is doing and what it will achieve.  I want to put on the records of the House that my opinion of the land rehabilitation scheme initiated completely by Deputy James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture is the finest <Col N="1123" /> and most revolutionary scheme ever introduced by any Minister for Agriculture in Western Europe.  The one fear I had when we were moving up to this Estimate was that the present Government, simply because the scheme was initiated by Deputy Dillon, might tamper with it, might take it into their heads to abolish it or alter it to such an extent as would leave it useless, and I was very proud, happy and contented to hear the Minsister for Agriculture saying that he took it over look, stock and barrel just as it was handed to him in working order by his predecessor, Deputy Dillon, and that he was continuing it. There could be no better scheme for the country because of its peculiar agricultural problems.  No scheme introduced in our lifetime was as necessary or could do as much good as that scheme will do.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned rock drilling.  He said that we were drilling the granite bedrock in Connemara.  No such drilling of bedrock took place.  I have travelled through Connemara, although it is not my constituency, and I claim to know a fair amount of what is going on. There was drilling of rocks which were too huge to move by hand.  There was drilling and blasting of rocks on the surface which were impeding land reclamation just as in the arable areas. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary does not suggest that land reclamation could go on without removing the surface rock&mdash;that is, where there is sufficient soil to justify the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made a very interesting discovery: that there are parts of Connemara that no amount of reclamation will make arable.  That is on a par with the time when Deputy Burke, during the inter-Party Government régime, made the astonishing discovery that all rivers flow to the sea in the long run.  It is of the same magnitude.  It shows the intense intellectual pressure under which the brain of the Parliamentary Secretary over there is working. Anybody connected with land knows quite well that there are vast areas of Connemara where, unless we carted in <Col N="1124" /> soil and sheeted the land over with soil from some other part of the country, there is no means of making the land arable.  It now transpires that the Parliamentary Secretary or his colleagues thought that when the land rehabilitation scheme was in force we could grow tomatoes up the sides of mountains as barren of soil as a heap of concrete.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is beginning to realise now that it is not wise to make daft statements when in opposition, even though they may have a certain vote-catching value at the time.  Bit by bit, we are whittling down the members of the Dáil who sit on the other side to a little sense of decency and responsibility.  Even when the Parliamentary Secretary was in opposition, he should have got his facts and figures, and studied the problem before he had the temerity to speak on it in this House and advance opinions which, in my view, were advanced by him for no other reason than their mud-slinging value and their vote-catching value.  It takes a long time, but, nevertheless, we are bringing them down to common sense, and that is one good object.  If the inter-Party Government did nothing else, that is a proud achievement.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary made wild, extravagant, foolish, daft statements while he was in opposition and has a different view now that he has got inside and sees the truth like the Minister sitting beside him who made statements to which I will refer later, both gentlemen should have the courage and decency to come out now and admit it.  After all, they might copy the Taoiseach.  He has the courage to come out and admit he is wrong.  When we chide him about something which he said in his early years in office or before he took office, he has told us a dozen times from the seat the Minister is sitting in now that he thought he was right but found afterwards that he was wrong. Evidently the Parliamentary Secretary has not reached the stage of having the courage and the manliness to come out and admit that statements he made were wrong.  I am not ashamed to do that.  When I was first elected here I had not the knowledge I now <Col N="1125" /> have and I thought that certain things could, and should be, done in a certain way.  It was not until I had acquired more information that I found that if some of my first ideas had been put into operation they would, instead of having a good effect, have been disastrous. The Parliamentary Secretary was in this House long before I came into it.  He has been 17 or 18 years a member.  Between 1948 and 1951 he made statements about which he now feels very sore and hot under the collar.  There is nothing wrong about that provided he did not make them with a bad intention.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech last night opening the debate was very short but it was complete vindication of inter-Party agricultural policy.  As a matter of fact, he crossed swords with his predecessor only on one small matter: whether agricultural advisers down the country should be under the control of county committees of agriculture or under the direct control of the Department in Dublin.  That is the only thing he crossed swords about.  Every other single item&mdash;pigs, the dead meat trade, poultry, fertilisers, land and buildings, ground limestone&mdash;dealt with by Deputy Dillon, as Minister, has been taken up by the present Minister. I am very glad and proud there has been no radical change in policy, that the Minister has taken up where Deputy Dillon left off, but I want to warn him that a sleeping attitude will not do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put in tremendous work during a period of three and a half years, but had not encompassed fully all the problems confronting agriculture.  We will not accept from the Minister the attitude that everything can be left as Deputy Dillon left it, that all the ills will have been cured by Deputy Dillon's policy running its full course.  Fresh problems are arising from time to time, and the inter-Party policy does not cover the whole field.  Deputy Dillon chided the Minister on the fact that he was going to sleep.  I hope the Minister will not continue like that.  We have to be thankful that he did not upset the policy Deputy Dillon handed over this <Col N="1126" /> time last year.  I warn him against going to sleep, pulling a blanket over his head, saying that everything is all right with agriculture.  There are always fresh problems.  The Minister, being the most important Minister in the Government, and holding the most important portfolio, cannot afford to go to sleep or even to sit back complacently and say that Deputy Dillon's policy was good and was all right, and that he will let it run.  We will not stand for that, and if the Minister thinks he is to have an easy time, reaping the reward of Deputy Dillon's brainwork and energy, he will find out that that will not do.</P>
    <P>Unlike the case of many other countries, agriculture is our principal industry.  There was a long time from 1932 to 1943 or 1944 when the policy of the Party now in power was that agriculture did not matter.  It seemed to be a kind of blister, a big and costly Department, and they did not see why it should be kept going at all.  It came almost to the point that the farmers&mdash; and the small farmers in particular, the backbone of the country&mdash;were looked upon as parasites, and the sooner they were eliminated the better.  Coupled in that category we had the Board of Works Special Employment Schemes Office, whose works largely dealt with the problems of farmers, and we had the Irish Land Commission, another Government Department which deals exclusively with the problems of farmers, especially small farmers.  It is only inside the last few years that Fianna Fáil has been awakening to the fact that while industrialisation is to be admired and aimed at under full pressure, it was bad policy to neglect our principal industry.  Not only was it neglected, but it was trampled on. Not only were the farmers trampled on, but they were cheated.  Let us take one example.</P>
    <P>A sum is appropriated each year, mar dheadh as a subsidy for fertilisers. It was £300,000 in one year but only £11,000 was spent; it was £200,000 another year and the farmers thought all this money being appropriated would be spent as a subsidy on fertilisers, yet little or none of it was spent. In their last year in office, 1947, <Col N="1127" /> £190,000 was appropriated but only £19,000 was spent&mdash;£1 out of every £10.  That is deliberate cheating, using this Book of Estimates to cheat the farmers.  I am glad to see a complete change of front.  It is about time it occurred.</P>
    <P>As regards subsidies on fertilisers, the Minister was very vocal here, as Deputy Tom Walsh, on the 22nd June, 1950, when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This problem is one which the Minister should have made provision against.  It would be far better, and in my opinion would provide far greater security for the country, if the Minister instead of spending £40,000,000 on land reclamation were to subsidise markets in order to ensure production at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the Minister still of that opinion? I am sure that on the 22nd June, 1950, when he made that statement he had not the wildest dream that he would be Minister for Agriculture some day. He happens to be Minister to-day and I ask him to live up to that statement. He made statements about the price of milk before he became Minister and he has not lived up to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, he had a great deal to say about it.  There again the Minister seems to have swung round completely to the view that the farmers, and particularly the small farmers, are not to be regarded as a crowd of whipped slaves, as they were regarded up to 1947 and 1948.  The Minister has now come round to the view that if he wants to get increased agricultural production the farmers, good and all as they may be, do not take whipping too nicely.  I am glad the Minister has begun to realise that all the farmers ever ask for is a fair price for agricultural produce.  They will produce all the Minister wants, all that it is humanly possible for them and physically possible for the land to produce, if the Minister arranges to give them a price which will cover three things&mdash;their own labour, the cost of production and a small reasonable margin of profit.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Smith, treated us here one night to a three-hour speech on the closing of the debate.  He told us all the things he would do.  It seemed to me that if Deputy Paddy Smith remained Minister for a few years, all the farmers would be landed in jails and concentration camps surrounded by barbed wire, or driven into the Atlantic or the Irish Sea and drowned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the outlook of Fianna Fáil, bear in mind, towards the farming community and towards agriculture. They were regarded as nothing but a useful crowd of slaves to produce a certain amount of exportable agricultural produce each year in order to have a correct balance of trade between this and outside countries. That policy has completely changed and I am glad it has.  I would again warn the Minister of the complacent attitude he appears to be adopting.  If he thinks that the inter-Party policy is automatically going to cure all ills and <Col N="1129" /> that he can sleep on the job, he is making a mistake and we will keep reminding him about it here.  Agriculture, by its very nature, has fresh and constantly recurring problems which must be dealt with and it takes a wide-awake Minister to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement here some time ago when he took office.  I thought we had finished completely with the problem of New Zealand butter which we heard so much about while we were the Government.  Did the Minister stop all imports of New Zealand or foreign butter?  We have nothing but tales of woe about the yellow butter.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the briefest possible reference to the whole question of milk production and butter when speaking last night.  He did not tell us if New Zealand butter was still being imported.  Why has he not kept it out if it was such a crime in our time to import it?</P>
    <P>On the 9th July, 1951, the Minister, I think it was in his own constituency, said that he was very happy to have been able to implement one of the points in the 17-point Fianna Fáil programme by increasing the price of milk.  He did not say that he was going to give them the 8d. or 9d. a gallon that he promised before he thought he would be Minister for Agriculture.  He gave them 2d. instead of the 9d.  That was one of the promises made during the election but,&ldquo;owing to the state of finance on the termination of the Coalition Government, it was not possible to increase the price of milk&rdquo;&mdash; poor fellow&mdash;&ldquo;and at the same time not to increase the price of butter. The Government was going to ensure that the people would not have to rely on supplies of imported butter next February or March&rdquo;.  Have you lived up to that?</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the dead meat trade.  He said the dead meat trade was 36,000 tons last year; it was 18,000 tons the year before, and 10,000 tons the year before that.  I am very glad and proud to see the dead meat trade established.  I would ask the Minister to do as we did, that is, to give it every encouragement and to give those engaged in it every facility provided they handle it properly and correctly.  There was a dead meat industry started in many places.  Such an industry was started in my own town, Castlebar, which has expanded and grown out of all bounds and beyond what was anticipated when it was established.  It is most useful because such a trade utilises offal and various by-products, and can give immense employment.  It has not reacted in the slightest on, or done the least damage to, the trade of selling animals on the hoof.  I would ask the Minister to do all he possibly can to foster and to increase the industry, and to keep pace with the demand for dead meat and cooked meat outside.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister is up to date in his knowledge of what is happening in connection with poultry production. Is he aware that the bottom is falling out of that industry?  I would ask him to tell us, when he is replying, what steps he proposes to take in the matter?  We expected a good deal of information from the Minister.  We expected the bald truth as to what was happening, whether it was good news or bad, from the point of view of his side of the House or of this side of the House.  We wanted the truth.</P>

Short as is the time from one spring to another, the ordinary small farmer has not the necessary capital to fertilise his land to the extent that would enable him to make a much better living out of his holding, and to <Col N="1132" /> produce more than he is producing now.  The Minister should realise that generally the small farmer buys his fertilisers in January or February, but has to wait at least 12 months and sometimes 15 or 18 months before he can cash in on what the fertilisers produce.  The price this year is preventing many farmers from using the amount of fertilisers that they would use otherwise.  What is the Minister's attitude towards it?</P>
      <P>I do not want a repetition of what happened in the years 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947, of appropriating a sum, putting down a figure at random in the Book of Estimates and saying: &ldquo;There is £300,000 or £250,000, as the case may be, to subsidise fertilisers&rdquo;, and then spend none of it and return it all to the Department of Finance.  I do not want cheating of that kind.  There is no other name for it.</P>
      <P>I want a genuine effort made.  My reason for referring to this matter is to try to check the flight which is occurring at an alarming pace from the small holdings and, secondly, to try to increase agricultural production. There is unanimity on all sides of the House as to the necessity to increase agricultural production.  We know that the amount of imports depends, ultimately, on the amount of exports.  The farmer is our only source of exports, and we should assist him in every possible way to increase exports.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a survey that was taken a short time ago, the result of which was published in the March issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  Did the Minister take cognisance of what that survey revealed?  Does he grasp what is happening in the country, particularly in the case of small farmers along the west coast, from Cork to Donegal, and to small farmers all over the country?  I am not blaming the Minister for that, because the problem has its roots dating a long time back, before the Minister or myself entered public life, but I want to draw his attention to a very serious state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After this, the Minister cannot say that he is not aware that there is a flight from the smaller holdings in this country that would leave the clearance made by the landlords of <Col N="1133" /> almost 100 years ago in the shade. The Minister for Agriculture is one of the Ministers who have the solution to that largely in their hands.  Was the Minister in north Mayo during the recent by-election?  I would advise him during the holiday period to travel around Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Monaghan, Cavan, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, parts of West Cork.  Let him not stay on the main roads but leave them behind and go through the villages and along the byroads where he will meet farmers at work in the fields.  He should ask them questions like this: &ldquo;How many houses were in your village 20 or 25 years ago?  From how many of these houses were children going to school 20 or 25 years ago?  How many houses are occupied to-day, and how many children are going to school to-day in this village?&rdquo; The Minister should not depend on the answers he gets in one area or in one county.  He should spend a week or even a fortnight visiting all the counties.  It is perfectly true to say that the clearances effected by the landlords 100 years ago are only in the halfpenny place compared with the flight from the small holdings to-day, particularly from small holdings in the west of Ireland.  Deputies representing western areas will agree with me in this.  I went to the national school with children from 11 houses in a particular townland.  There were 14 houses in all in this townland but to-day only four are occupied.  Are the members of the present generation who are sent as elected representatives to this Dáil going to stand idly by and watch rural depopulation grow without even asking: &ldquo;What is the cause of it?  Is there anything we can do to stop it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands should make a survey of this particular aspect of rural life with particular emphasis on the nine counties along the western seaboard which constitute the congested areas; the problem is worst in these districts.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;I cannot force John So-and-so or Tom So-and-so to live on a small holding.&rdquo; I know the Minister cannot force him but, at least, he can entice him.  In <Col N="1134" /> my view, the reason for the flight from the small holdings is that their problems have been neglected down through the years by their elected representatives and by successive Governments. It is impossible to make a living on small holdings at the present time due to the prices offered for agricultural produce.  I admit that the Minister has no control over one very important factor.  I am referring to the organised labour in the towns and cities of Britain and in the towns and cities of this country.  This fact is enticing the youngsters away from the rough-and-tumble life on the land.  They like the prospect of the bright lights, an eight-hour day, a half-day on Saturday and a fixed wage when employment is steady.</P>
    <P>I will repeat again that the Minister for Agriculture, his colleague, the Minister for Lands, and any other Minister who has the emigration problem at heart should have a survey carried out.  The Minister for Lands can make files available to the Minister for Agriculture from the collection branch of the Department of Lands which will show that the small farmer is rapidly being crushed out of this country.  The view is held that the small farmer should go.  In my opinion, people of this opinion are choosing the readiest way out of the problem.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I think that if a day comes when the small farmer is no more, rural Ireland will die with him.  Small farmers are buying up holdings.  In other words, they are relieving their own congestion, which they could not do if their neighbours had not flown from the land. Every person that changes from a life on the land to a life in the cities across the water or in the cities of this country is a definite loss to our nation. I will not dwell further on this point except to say that the flight from the land is one of the most serious problems facing the Government at the present time.</P>
    <P>Shortly before I left office I intended having a survey carried out in conjunction with the Department of Justice&mdash;the Minister can get access to the relevant documents if he wishes&mdash; of all the holdings, particularly those in the West, where the problem is <Col N="1135" /> worst.  There is an appalling crushing-out of the small farmer at the present time.  When I refer to the small farmer, I have in mind all those who had houses and out-offices built for them and other improvements carried out by the Congested Districts Board shortly before the passing of the 1923 Act.  Such holdings are now being vacated, and what about the residue&mdash;the holdings that the Land Commission have not yet reached, which are in a rundale and in an uneconomic condition?</P>
    <P>The small farmer has been too long looked upon as some sort of handy slave who does the work but does not need to get properly paid for it.  He is supposed to have no rights; he is expected to produce as much as possible from the land without getting anything in return; and he has probably to do his best to rear a family in the meantime.  This has resulted in the appalling flight from the small farms.  I want to impress on the Minister again that he should confer with the Minister for Lands and certain other Ministers in the Government with a view to having a survey carried out to find out exactly to what extent this crushing-out of the small farmer is going on in the countryside, to what extent it is likely to occur in the next few years and what steps can be taken to rectify the position.  In fairness to the Minister and to the present Government, I feel I should say that the flight from the land will not be stopped overnight by waving a magic wand.  It will take five or perhaps ten years before any schemes brought forward to stop it will have borne fruit.  However, if such schemes have borne fruit in ten years' time, the Government will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I will give this little illustration of the state of affairs in a half-parish with which I am acquainted.  At one time there were five national schools in this area&mdash;a Gaeltacht area&mdash;but two of them have closed down during the last 12 months; in the period between the months of May and October there was one marriage in this half-parish and two baptisms in the Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture talked about the land rehabilitation as if it were going to cure all ills.  I say that a great deal of good would also be done by the development of forestry in congested areas.  I said quite a lot on that subject before, and I do not propose to repeat it now.  However, I would like to say a few words about an industry which is peculiar to my own county, and that is the growing of strawberries.  For some reason or other royal sovereign and a few other varieties of this fruit are virus-free in County Mayo.  A pretty extensive industry has been built up there due to the assistance of the Department of Agriculture instructors.  These instructors have done such magnificent work that no words of mine could adequately praise them.  I do not happen to be even acquainted with these instructors, but I have heard the growers saying that they have proved of immense assistance.  However, the survival of the industry depends entirely on two factors&mdash;the sale of the runners and the sale of the fruit to the jam manufacturers. The sale of the runners is an easy matter, because anybody who advertises virus-free runners is advertising a great rarity.  In certain areas in County Mayo&mdash;I do not think the area has been clearly defined&mdash;certain strains of strawberries are virus-free. That is something that cannot be said about strawberries in England, Scotland or Wales.  The result is that there are tremendous possibilities for a market for runners here.  Owing, however, to imports of fruit pulp the strawberries are not wanted.  Is the Minister aware that small growers who actually had contracts with the jam manufacturers&mdash;they were not written contracts but verbal ones&mdash;to supply them with all the strawberries they could produce were told to go and find a market elsewhere for them this year?  That is due to the imports of pulp.  The Minister shakes his head, but I can assure him that that is the case.  The manufacturers cannot make strawberry jam without the strawberries, and if they cannot get the strawberries at home they will get them from outside.  It is quite possible, <Col N="1137" /> of course, that they can buy pulp cheaper outside.</P>
    <P>It is the small farmers, with a poor law valuation of under £10, who are engaged in this industry.  The industry is growing, thriving and expanding.  It is one which is helpful to the small farmer.  I was speaking to one small farmer&mdash;I forget the particular acreage he had under strawberries&mdash;whose wages bill last year was £960.  He was a small farmer with a poor law valuation of £10 or £11.  That instance should give the Minister an idea of the possibilities that are in this particular little industry.  If the Minister, when he is replying, tells me that we cannot expect jam manufacturers to give 98/-per cwt. for strawberries for the making of jam when we can buy pulp at half the price, then I want him to tell us why I should pay £2 10s. or £3 for a pair of Irish-made boots when I could get English boots of the same quality for £1 10s. 6d.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of strawberries. I do know that there are growers of bush fruits other than strawberries who are in the same difficulty. Deputy Dillon's attitude to the glass-houses when Minister for Agriculture was criticised.  A lot of that criticism was misrepresentation.  It is the small farmer who is engaged in the cultivation of strawberries.  That applies to every small farmer in every single one of the Twenty-Six Counties. It is a common occurrence to have crops of apples without having anybody to use them.  In Dublin we find apples which are imported from California and Australia.  We have to pay 10d. each for them.  The Minister for Agriculture should not allow his colleagues to impose hare-brained ideas on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers of the country are the Minister's own peculiar charge.  Their welfare is the Minister's responsibility, and if he allows the state of affairs to which I have referred to happen he is not fit for his post.  Deputy Dillon <Col N="1138" /> gave him some valuable advice on what his relations should be with the Minister for External Affairs.  Ordinary farmers know exactly the value to put on the remarks on agriculture made by the Minister for External Affairs.  They treated them as a joke.  The man likes to talk about agriculture, but, judging by his remarks, he knows absolutely nothing about it.  For charity's sake we refrain from guffawing at him. What does the Minister intend doing about the matter?  I want him to protect the industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister might take a leaf out of the book of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  What I am asking the Minister to do for the farmers is exactly what the Minister for Industry and Commerce did in respect of industry.  That is not too much to ask.  That is what the Minister is there for and I make no apology for asking him to do these things.  If the Minister is going to allow an industry to die, it means that he is taking Deputy Dillon's machinery and agricultural policy and just sitting back calmly and allowing the matter to run.  We are not going to have that and if the Minister does that he will have a pretty stormy passage in this House whether his term of office as Minister is long or short.  There has been a reduction of practically 24/-per cwt. for strawberries.</P>
      <P>Last Monday I was told by a man who had ten acres of royal sovereign that he ploughed them up as he could not afford to pay the labour.  Does the Minister think that farmers are just a crowd of daft people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>You told me it was sold before you came into office.  That is what I wanted to know.  With regard to loans to farmers at 6 per cent., the Minister should take that matter up with the Minister for Finance.  Farmers should be given a cheaper loan than 6 per cent. if at all possible.  In that regard I do not see why it is necessary to act like school children as the present Government seem to be doing.  We follow suit in everything that is done across the water whether it is right or wrong. There is a big difference between the problems of this country and those of England.  We should not follow them blindly in everything.  I do not see why the Minister and the present Government should adopt that attitude.  No farmers will accept a loan at 6 per cent.  It is too heavy.</P>
      <P>On the question of farm buildings, I want to bring to the Minister's notice a matter which I have mentioned many times before.  There is scarcely a holding or a homestead in the Twenty-Six Counties that has sufficient out-office buildings.  The Minister should not be niggardly in regard to the making of grants for out-office buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want the Minister to take up with the Minister for Finance the question of the poor law valuations on out-office buildings.  The Minister may say that is a thorny problem, and perhaps it is for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister should remember, however, that because of the heavy rainfall in every part of this <Col N="1141" /> country the loss suffered by farmers each year is pretty hefty.  That applies particularly in a bad year.  Crops and farm machinery, therefore, should be housed.  On most farms the crops and the farm machinery cannot be housed because there are not sufficient buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell me that this has its roots in the past, that, because of the old landlord system from which we got away only a comparatively short time ago, farmers had not any incentive to build out-offices. If they did it in these old days they would be building for somebody else, because they would be evicted as soon as they had put up the buildings. One serious problem facing most farmers is that, because of the heavy rainfall, a certain percentage of corn and hay is lost each year.  These should be housed and the farm machinery and tools should be housed. More stock should be housed to provide the farmyard manure necessary to keep up the fertility of the land.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons that deter farmers from putting up extra out-offices is that there is a relic of the old landlord system still with us. When the farmer has finished putting up such a building a valuation officer is on his doorstep to clap on an increased valuation.  That is a relic of the time when, if a man put in better windows in his house, the landlord's agent was around to raise his rent. That is a relic which we should be ashamed to admit is still with us.  I would say that the loss all over the country in crops and farm machinery and from the fact that we do not house sufficient live stock to produce more farmyard manure would amount to £5,000,000 or even £7,000,000 a year. That is a very serious gap in our economy which should be stopped.  The amount provided in this Estimate for farm buildings is totally insufficient. If the Minister wants to induce farmers to put up more and better out-offices, the first thing he must do is to take up with the Minister for Finance this question of the poor law valuation being increased when the out-offices are finished.  These may seem very commonplace things, but they are <Col N="1142" /> important in the working of every holding all over the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the present Government have not departed from the policy handed over to them by Deputy Dillon.  The only danger we are confronted with is that in the Minister's speech there was an atmosphere of complacency, a feeling that everything was grand.  I want to compliment the Minister on continuing the land rehabilitation scheme.  He should carry that on by all means.  He should not mind Deputy Bartley's statement about what was supposed to be happening in Connemara.  There is a vast area in Connemara on which it would be only criminal waste to spend money, but there is a certain area of land which can be usefully reclaimed there.  If the Minister wants to further the interests of the people there and to do good work for them, he should interest himself in the forestry side of the operations of the Land Commission because there is a whole lot of land on which it would be wrong to spend money in order to reclaim it but which will grow excellent timber.  If the Minister looks up some of the experimental work done during my time and which is proceeding very nicely at the moment, he will find that that is the way to do it.  He should get on with the land reclamation scheme.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the land reclamation scheme there is another problem, namely, that the work being done by the land rehabilitation officials may clash with that of the Board of Works in connection with arterial drainage. In South and North Mayo there was a considerable area which the land rehabilitation officials were quite willing to deal with but could not do it because the river Moy and certain tributaries were being held up by obstructions. Shortly before the change of Government there were consultations between the Board of Works officials and the land rehabilitation officials as to removing major obstructions in the Moy.  I can understand the objection of the Commissioners of Public Works to doing piecemeal work, but nevertheless I believe that that should be done in certain cases.  The Tinnacarra rock is an outstanding <Col N="1143" /> example of what can be done in a piecemeal way without waiting for a big drainage project to be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the urgency of doing certain work on rivers even though the Board of Works may regard it as piecemeal work.  There is one argument which the Board of Works cannot get over, namely, that if there are three or four or five obstructions on a river which are holding up land reclamation activity, and they are removed, there will be less work for the Board of Works to do when they come along.  It does not mean overlapping.  If a ton of rock or silt or sand is removed from the bed of a river by the land reclamation officials to ease flooding in a particular area, that is so much work done for the Board of Works when they come along with their arterial drainage scheme.  The Minister should not take that argument from the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>The principal matter to be considered, however, as I said, is the terrible flight from the land, particularly of small farmers.  I do not want the Minister to sit back complacently and let them go because he can and should find some solution to check that at least.  The flight of small farmers from the countryside at present leaves the clearances by Cromwell 300 years ago in the shade.  If it continues for a few more years rural Ireland will get into a very bad plight.  If the Minister has any doubt as to what is happening he should have a talk with the Minister for Education and ask him for the average of attendances in the national schools.  He will find that there is an alarming drop in the number of children attending these schools and that many schools have been closed down.</P>

Last night when the Minister was introducing <Col N="1144" /> the Estimate and speaking of the work that had been done by the Department and the policy that it is proposed to pursue during the coming year, his speech was interlarded with applause, rousing applause, from his immediate predecessor.

      <P>For 30 years this country has been cursed with a conflict between the two main political Parties in regard to agriculture.  I, as a farmer, have watched that conflict with a certain amount of anger and resentment because I considered it was unnecessary.  There is no room for two sound agricultural policies in this country.  There is room for only one agricultural policy and that is a policy calculated to increase the annual output of the land while at the same time preserving and increasing its fertility.  There is the foundation of agricultural policy and all Governments, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or inter-Party must base their agricultural policy on that foundation if this country is to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that filled me with anger and resentment all during the years of the inter-Party Government was the attempts, the persistent attempts, made by Deputy Dillon as Minister to stir up acrimony and bitterness in regard to agricultural policy, the attempts which he made to pretend that he had initiated an entirely new agricultural policy and that everything was wrong until he took up office.  In the course of his speech to-day he has more or less suggested that our present Minister is too mild and too moderate and, perhaps, too peaceful in his dealings with agricultural matters.  Might I suggest, on the other hand, that during his period of office Deputy Dillon was too noisy and too overbearing in his dealings with agricultural <Col N="1145" /> matters?  He blew his own trumpet so loudly that he could not hear the voices of those trying to advise him and the result was that he made serious and grave mistakes which he now perhaps regrets and which contributed in a large measure to his removal from office.  All that, however, is past.</P>
    <P>To-day we face the future and we must face it with courage and confidence, but not with complacency.  I do not entirely agree with Deputy Dillon when he says that the volume of agricultural output increased and that it is satisfactory.  It is not entirely satisfactory.  We have very little increase over the pre-war level. We know that the agricultural output in 1937 and 1938 was low and there was very little increase in the period since the war.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact we find that the White Paper which has been circulated reveals a substantial decrease in recent years.  In the last year in which Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture as compared with the first year when he was Minister there was a decline of 500,000 acres in tillage.  In the same year 1951 when he was turned out of office the number of cows&mdash;and cows are very fundamental to our agricultural economy&mdash;went down by 19,000 as compared with 1950.  The number of in-calf heifers went down by 33,000 and that was a substantial percentage of the total number of in-calf heifers. In that year also the number of calves declined by 5,000.  In the same year the number of sows declined by 400 whilst the number of poultry went down substantially.  At the end of that year Deputy Dillon himself also went down with all his guns blazing, leaving behind him on the public mind an assurance that his policy was a failure.  &ldquo;Keep one more cow, one more sow and put one more acre under the plough&rdquo;, was the policy which he recommended.  Instead of one more cow, the number of cows had gone down substantially during his period of office.  Instead of one more sow the number of sows had been reduced substantially and instead of one more acre under the plough there <Col N="1146" /> was a decrease of 500,000 acres in tillage in his last year of office as compared with the year in which he took office.</P>
    <P>Realising I suppose that the management of the Department of Agriculture was not as simple a proposition as he had thought before he took office, realising that he had not such a magnificent record to show to the public, realising all the difficulties that face a Minister dealing with Agriculture, I think Deputy Dillon faced the consideration of this Estimate in a milder mood than it was customary for him to display in this House.  I think that is all to the good. I do not want a bitter conflict in regard to agricultural policy.  What we want is steady progress.  I do not accept the view of Deputy Dillon that because our present Minister does not go around the country bellowing and boasting about what he is doing, what his Government is doing and what his Department is doing, nevertheless steady progress cannot be made.  On that basis I want to express my views in regard to what is most urgently essential in relation to agricultural policy in the next few years.  I am taking it as a matter of fact that the present Minister for Agriculture will have control of agricultural policy for a number of years.  If I were asked to give a list of what are the most important essentials in regard to the development of agricultural policy I would say: &ldquo;First improve the fertility of the soil by the restoration to the soil of the mineral and organic matter which is necessary for the production of crops.&rdquo;  All agricultural policy or progress should be based on the soil being put into first class condition. That is essential No. 1.</P>

      <P>The soil was there before Deputy Dillon was ever heard of and the soil will be there after him and after all of us.  One can say that <Col N="1147" /> 50 and 100 years ago the farmers realised the importance of increasing the fertility of the soil.  Men actually drew lime a distance of nearly 40 miles to spread it on their land in order to improve it. They dug up the marl clay in the bogs, carted it long distances and spread it on the land in order to improve it.  Even when the price for live stock was not very good, they fed their stock over the winter months in order to be able to accumulate supplies of farmyard manure to increase the fertility of the soil.  They did all that long before Deputy Dillon was heard of and his loud-tongued play-acting in this country.</P>
      <P>Having brought the soil to its maximum state of fertility, the next essential is to increase the live stock population.  The figures which I gave in regard to cows, in-calf heifers and yearlings were not encouraging, but I believe that, with a steady, progressive policy, we can step up the number of our livestock.  I should like to point out to the Minister that you cannot increase the numbers of cattle and sheep very rapidly.  That is particularly true of cattle.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to say in regard to sheep in that respect because I think the position there is satisfactory, but in the case of cattle, you cannot expect a very rapid expansion in numbers.  That is why I think great emphasis should be laid on the necessity for an expansion in the number of pigs.  Steps should be taken immediately to increase the pig population. Having increased the fertility of the soil, you can build up a bigger live-stock population most rapidly by expanding the pig-producing industry. It must be based mainly on home-produced feeding stuffs.  I propose to go into that in much greater detail later, but that, as I say, should be the basis of our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next essential is to increase and substantially improve the quality of our dairy stock, particularly in regard to milk yield.  The final point, of course, in regard to what is essential in agriculture is the improvement of <Col N="1148" /> technical knowledge and agricultural education generally.  Those are, I think, the broad fundamental principles which should guide the Minister in regard to agricultural policy.  The first is to get the soil into condition.  If it is not in condition, nothing is in condition. Any investigations that have been carried out in this country have revealed that 80 per cent. of the soil of Ireland is not in a proper condition of fertility for maximum production.  The question is how to get individual farmers to utilise the maximum amount of lime and fertilisers, by putting them on the land as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick mentioned that the ground limestone scheme was initiated by Deputy Dillon, but of course we all know that the scheme for the setting up of the limestone grinding plants was long in operation before Deputy Dillon took office.  We all know, too, that when he did take office there was a lime subsidy scheme operated by the county committees of agriculture, and that immediately the ground limestone came on the market the county committees of agriculture proceeded to apply the lime subsidy to it.  No sooner had they announced their decision to do so than the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, stepped in, I think at the end of 1948, and said: &ldquo;No, you must not subsidise ground limestone&rdquo;.  Now, how can any Deputy like Deputy Blowick assert, in the face of that fact, that Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture, initiated the ground limestone scheme?</P>
    <P>What Deputy Dillon did was to try to kill the ground limestone scheme by prohibiting county committees of agriculture from giving the subsidy which they were entitled to give under the previous scheme.  I was one of a deputation from a county committee of agriculture that waited on Deputy Dillon in 1949, and on bended knees implored him to continue the subsidy for ground limestone.  What he did was to chase us all out of the office and tell us that he would continue the subsidy on burned lime, and that under no circumstances would he allow any county committee of agriculture to pay a subsidy on ground limestone. That condition operated in 1949 and <Col N="1149" /> 1950 until stronger powers, the representative of the E.C.A., took action and compelled the then Minister for Agriculture to reintroduce the ground lime subsidy scheme.  When he was kicked into adopting that scheme by the representative of the E.C.A., the then Minister and his admirers went through the country with their trumpets announcing that this was another Dillon scheme.  In public life, as Deputy Dillon mentioned to-day, a certain amount of toughness is necessary, a certain amount of what Deputy Corry would describe as &ldquo;neck&rdquo;.  I suppose Deputy Dillon has kept that point before his mind and has developed it to the fullest extent.</P>

I simply want to emphasise the one point that the subsidy on ground limestone was not initiated by Deputy Dillon.  As a matter of fact, the scheme was already in operation, and he deliberately prohibited the county committees of agriculture from continuing to make the subsidy available on ground limestone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know there was a good deal of racketeering in regard to the manner in which Deputy Dillon's subsidy on ground limestone was operated.  If that matter was gone into closely, it would, I suggest, disclose a considerable amount of racketeering and hugger-mugger, dishonesty and inefficiency.  I think that a certain amount of it is still continuing by reason of the fact that the subsidy on limestone is payable regardless of the distance that it is carried.  I think that, as a result, there is a good deal of over-lapping with regard to transport and that attempts are being made to earn as much of the subsidy as possible by carrying it long distances when it could be obtained more easily closer to the farm.  These are matters which I am sure the Minister will keep under supervision.  I do not intend to go into all of these matters now because I have certain constructive suggestions to make in regard to the manner in which we should get lime applied to the greatest portion of the land as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In the past year, I think that over £500,000 has been laid out in the subsidy on the transport of limestone. My only complaint is that a great many farmers who need this limestone very badly are not able to avail of the scheme to the utmost.  Well-to-do farmers can get the full benefit of the subsidy.  They have their bank accounts and their cheque books and all they have to do is to go in and order 100 or 200 tons of lime for their pasture land in Meath or Westmeath, and so forth.  But the poorer farmer &mdash; the struggling man about whom Deputy Blowick spoke&mdash;finds it difficult to avail of the full benefits of the scheme.  He is living from hand to mouth and the result is that either he will be satisfied with a very small quantity of lime or that he will do without it altogether.  In consequence, his crops suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday I spoke to a farmer who has a very considerable acreage of dry, sound upland which is in a very poor condition.  He said that he would like it to be fertilised.  I referred him to <Col N="1151" /> the lime and fertiliser credit scheme which is under the Minister's control. He pointed out that if he availed of the scheme for the liming, and fertilising, of his entire holding the cost would be added to his rent.  When he went into the figures he found that if he were to do the entire farm it would add very considerably to his rent.  He asked if it would be possible to get the Minister for Agriculture to revise the scheme so as to enable a farmer to treat a portion of his farm with lime and fertiliser or, alternatively, to treat the entire farm with lime only: I think that would be the more attractive alternative.  A farmer does not like to add substantially to his rent and the cost of buying lime and fertiliser is very substantial. The cost of applying lime only would be a lesser undertaking and it is one which any farmer would be prepared to consider.  If the lime and fertiliser scheme is amended so that a farmer who is not prepared to face the cost of a complete scheme can have a partial scheme for his land then I think it will be readily availed of by thousands of farmers who have not so far taken advantage of the present scheme.  I think that a partial scheme would have several advantages over the complete scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost of artificial fertilisers is very high at present.  Therefore, a farmer who incurs debt in order to apply those fertilisers would be undertaking a fairly heavy liability from which he might not reap the greatest benefit, unless he had the best quality stock on his land.  If, however, he limed his holding to the extent to which it needed to be limed he would get an advantage not for one year but for a considerable number of years because the fertilising value of the lime in the soil lasts for a considerable time.  I hope the Minister will consider that revision of the lime and fertiliser scheme.  Having supplied the necessary mineral and organic matter that the land requires, you must, side by side with that, remove the weeds which are simply waste in the pasture.  You have either to re-seed the land or plough up the land for an arable crop with proper rotation and proper renewing before putting it down to <Col N="1152" /> pasture again.  All that costs a considerable amount of money but, if you like, it is a short-term expenditure because the growing of crops on well-manured land must yield a fairly speedy return.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out what I consider to be the fundamental principles in relation to improved agriculture.  I have said that an expansion of the pig-producing industry, based on home-produced feeding-stuffs, ranks very high in the order of priority. The farmer who has improved his soil by the application of manures can get a return from that soil by sowing cash crops and selling them off the land.  That type of return is, however, a very short-term return. At the end of a few years he will find that his soil has gone back to the poor condition in which he found it originally.  The best method is to feed by far the greater quantity of the additional output from the land to live stock and to produce the organic manure that is necessary for the soil and thus create an unending cycle of fertility in his soil.  Having regard to the price of live stock at present, it is difficult for the farmer with limited means to increase quickly the number of his live stock on the farm. That is why I suggested that the Department or the Minister should emphasise the need for rapid expansion of the pig producing industry; that policy of increased numbers of pigs to be linked up closely with the growing of increased quantities of feeding barley, potatoes and fodder beet; these three crops to be almost exclusively for pig feeding&mdash;perhaps for poultry also but mainly for pig feeding&mdash;and the two lines of policy, the growing of increased supplies of feeding stuffs to be linked with the feeding of additional numbers of pigs. That is one feature of the agriculture that can be expanded rapidly, that can be expanded very extensively.  I believe that if an all-out effort is being made with regard to the pig industry with perhaps the same publicity and drive as was given to the expansion of the poultry industry during the last year of Deputy Smith's period of office and the first year of Deputy Dillon's period of <Col N="1153" /> office, if that were done with regard to the pig industry we would get an expansion in our total agricultural output that would be spectacular in the course of a couple of years.  If the farmer grows his potatoes and the other crops I mentioned almost entirely for the purpose of converting them into pork on the farm, the output of his farm and his income would grow enormously.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is significant to mention the figures of employment and income and the value of the output on the land in Denmark as compared with Ireland.  In the Irish Republic the number of persons per 100 acres employed on the land is five.  In Denmark the number is seven. That is not a very substantial excess over the number here but it is a fairly substantial percentage and if we were to increase the number of agricultural workers or the number of people living on and making a living on the land by that percentage it would be very substantial. It would amount to the employment of tens of thousands of additional workers.  But that is not the important point.  The important point is that with our low standard of employment on the land, the value of the net output of each worker here is £163.  The value of the net output of each worker in Denmark is £288.  That is a startling figure and one which should be perused carefully by anyone who is inclined to be complacent about agricultural progress in this State.  Not only is there in Denmark an increased number of persons employed on the land but the income per person is almost double what it is here.  If you look at the question from another angle and take the value of the net output per acre here as compared with Denmark you will find that the value of the net output of each acre of land here is £8.2.  The value of the net output of each acre in Denmark is £20.5.  Surely there is something radically wrong when we consider that our output per acre is so low.  There may be certain other factors in connection with this matter, certain difficulties here that do not exist in Denmark but there should not be the gap of £12 between the value of the net output of an acre of land here <Col N="1154" /> as compared with Denmark.  It is, of course, true that in Denmark the percentage of land under tillage is 75 per cent. and here it is 15 per cent.  There again the gap between the two countries is too wide.  I do not believe in tillage for its own sake.  I do not think anybody here does nor do I think anybody should, but there is very much to be said for increasing tillage so as to increase substantially the live-stock population of the country.  That is particularly true in regard to poultry and pigs.</P>
    <P>Apart from his opening blunder in regard to the application of lime to the soil, I think one of Deputy Dillon's great mistakes was when he pinned his faith for the poultry and pig producing industries on the importation of unlimited quantities of cheap maize.  In his first year of office he announced to the world, he proclaimed from the house tops, that farmers should go ahead, keep all the pigs they could, all the poultry they could, all the hens they could, drown England with eggs, and so forth, and that he would guarantee to them unlimited quantities of cheap imported maize. Farmers did increase the number of hens; they did increase the numbers of pigs on their farms during that year and early in the subsequent year, but they found when they stretched their hands for the cheap imported maize it was not to be had and farmers who had gone in for poultry keeping on a large scale, buoyed up by the promises of the then Minister, found themselves with heaps of wooden poultry houses all over their fields which were not a source of profit to them because they could not find the feeding for their poultry.  They had to dispose of those poultry houses at whatever they could get for them.  That was a disaster which hit many innocent, unassuming and trusting people some of them amateur farmers who accepted the Minister's word that he would provide them with unlimited quantities of cheap imported maize.  Because of the Minister's reliance upon cheap imported maize and his subsequent failure to supply that essential commodity the pig and poultry industries <Col N="1155" /> collapsed again on his hands and he went out of office with both of those branches of agriculture in a state of grave decline.</P>
    <P>Now we have a chance of starting again.  We have not so much chance of expanding the poultry industry, so I am not so confident there and anyhow there is not so much room for a big expansion in that industry but there is certainly plenty of room for a big expansion in the pig industry. We have a reasonable assurance of stability of price, but I think the farmer must be assisted, particularly the smaller farmer, particularly the man with limited capital, in the first place, with an assurance that there will not be any more of this huckstering with the price of pigs.  It is not good enough to have the price of pigs fluctuating from month to month when there is no apparent reason for this fluctuation.  There is a strong feeling amongst farmers that the prices of pigs and bacon are manipulated by those in the bacon curing and in the pig-buying business.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take strong action in that matter.  The people who will produce pigs and expand pig production are the ordinary farmers. They are people of limited means. They have limited powers as far as organisation and agitation is concerned. They must be protected from any sharks who may try to exploit them.</P>
    <P>The man who produces a first-class pig of the right weight is entitled to get the last penny that pig is worth and that is where the Minister must be strong and firm when he is dealing with the bacon curing and pig buying interests.  There have been too many fluctuations.  A farmer may spend three or four months producing a first-class pig and find at the end of that period that the income he expected to get is drastically cut because of the operations of some combine or other. There is a certain amount of over-lapping which brings in its train incompetence and inefficiency.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the importance of the industry and the part it can play in increasing output and the extent to which it can benefit the uneconomic <Col N="1156" /> smallholder, the Minister should make up his mind to the fact that his first obligation is to ensure that the man who produces a first-class pig gets the highest price he can for his animal. Naturally there was antagonism to the scheme for the elimination of coloured pigs.  I have the greatest sympathy with the farmers who felt themselves aggrieved because of the operation of that policy.</P>
    <P>The feeding and rearing of pigs is not the simple task some would have us believe.  A small farmer may have two or three sows.  He may find that they are not productive.  On the other hand, he may find that the coloured breeds are more virile and more productive.  That may not be the experience of the Department of Agriculture, but it is the experience of the ordinary farmers.</P>
    <P>We are looking forward to a huge expansion in our bacon exports.  If that is the aim of the Government, then we must consider the desirability of producing the best quality bacon for that market.  That is the sole justification for the Order.  It would be very undesirable to find that our bacon, because it was produced from breeds not providing the best quality meat, was refused or that a lower price was offered for it on the export market.  We must aim at perfection in supplying our customer's demands.  The Minister should look into the matter.  It is true that certain breeds produce a better thriving and more productive pig and it might be possible to find some breed which can be crossed with the large white.</P>

He has considerably modified his attitude towards agriculture but during the recent elections he went through the country with a flaming torch and his satellite, Deputy O. Flanagan, followed him with a smaller but smellier torch.  These two gentlemen proclaimed from the housetops, or as near the housetops as they could get, that it was the intention of the Government to impose a tax upon our cattle exports.  Imagine these gentlemen thinking they could fool the farmers into believing that the Government would tax their cattle.  But the farmers of Waterford, Limerick, Mayo and the country generally know these two playboys well.  They did not accept one word they uttered.  That damped Deputy Dillon's ardour and he did not appear in the House for a fortnight, but it did not entirely damp Deputy Flanagan's ardour.  He crops up as spruce as you like at the Laois County Committee of Agriculture and announces that the Government are going to impose a tax upon cattle.</P>

      <P>The hare was started in the recent election by the Flanagan-Dillon combination.  They chased that hare all over the county, but it got away from them.  The unfortunate thing is that there are still some simple, innocent country people who will swallow that type of propaganda and Deputy Flanagan succeeded in getting his county committee&mdash;there may not have been many members present&mdash;to pass a resolution protesting against this alleged tax on cattle.  It is time to put an end to that kind of balderdash. I am sorry that Deputy Dillon is leaving, because I have another piece of propaganda here which I should like him to hear, but perhaps Deputy Collins will deal with it. Deputy Flanagan announced at the same meeting that Irish creamery butter was being sold in Antwerp at 2/7 per lb., or 1/3 less than the price at which it is being sold to our own people. That statement was made by Deputy Flanagan at a meeting of the Laois County Committee of Agriculture and he said: &ldquo;I am very definite about this.&rdquo;  His veracity could not be questioned.  Competent judges had expressed their opinion on it and nobody in this House dared to disagree with him.  The editor of the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i>, however, got in touch with the Department and then published this denial:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our reporter who phoned the Government Information Bureau on Wednesday to verify Deputy Flanagan's statement was informed that no creamery butter has been exported since 1950.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that no creamery butter has been exported since 1950, Deputy Flanagan claims that it is being sold in Antwerp at 1/3 less than the price at which it is sold to the people of Ireland.  It may be some of the 1950 butter which is still in preservation there.</P>

      <P>It is not good enough that the agricultural industry should be&mdash;I will not say sabotaged, because I do not think it is in the power of either Deputy Flanagan or Deputy Dillon, his tutor, to sabotage the agricultural industry&mdash;damaged by these gentlemen who now occupy the front Opposition bench who go around the country trying to do it the maximum amount of harm.  Both these statements were utterly and completely false, but they were circulated and given the widest publicity possible, with scare headings, in order to do the maximum amount of damage to the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>There is one problem which will face the Government in the near future to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  I refer to the marketing of our present year's oats crop.  One of the last acts of the former Minister was to import into this country from Australia 16,000 tons of oats.  It was not oats of the very best quality but the price was fairly substantial and the net result of that importation was to put the grain stores of the country in a rather congested condition, with the result that over the past winter the price of oats not only did not increase but declined considerably. Farmers who could afford to do it, and who thought they were cute in so doing, held oats and then found that, because of Deputy Dillon's imprudent import, they had to take a very substantial reduction in the price of their oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the congested condition of the corn stores has been completely remedied up to the present and for that reason the Minister should take steps to ensure that any farmer who has a quantity of oats to sell will be assured of a market for it at a reasonable price.  It will be remembered that one of my disagreements with the former Minister was in connection with this matter.  I suggested that if everything else failed, if the merchants could not see their way to buy oats from the farmers, the Government should step in as a buyer not at <Col N="1160" /> a high price but at a price which would enable the farmers to get the oats off their hands and so meet whatever demands they have to meet in order to pay their way.  The then Minister ridiculed that scheme.  He called it &ldquo;Deputy Cogan's tomfool scheme&rdquo;, but it was put into operation in spite of him by his colleagues and the net result was that, at the end of the year, the oats were sold at no loss to the taxpayer.  Not one penny of the taxpayers' money was lost over the transaction and farmers got a market for their oats.  The only mistake made was that Deputy Dillon towards the end of the year again imprudently authorised the export of half the total amount of oats.  A quantity of 20,000 tons was bought and he authorised the export to Germany of 10,000 tons.</P>
    <P>He possibly thought that the way to deal with the Nazi beast was to stuff him with stirabout.  This problem may arise again to some extent or it may not.  It may be that the Minister will take away whatever surplus oats are available and that the whole problem will be adjusted, but if it is not the Minister should consider a scheme which worked so successfully before in spite of Deputy Dillon's opposition and which cost the taxpayer not one shilling.  There will always be occasional surpluses of agricultural produce but they will not be permanent. You may have a surplus of oats one year and a shortage the next and with judicious management you can hold over the surplus of one year to meet the shortage of the next so that hardship to small farmers and people with limited capital can be avoided.  That is why I strongly recommend the Minister to keep a close eye on the oats market to ensure that the problem which arose in 1948 will not arise again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was very vocal and jubilant about farmers' butter.  To him it is a source of great delight that the ordinary hard-working farmer will not get as good a price for his butter as he should.  He has the impudence to suggest that only the farmer who makes bad butter finds a difficulty in selling it.  He says that people who make first-class butter get a first-class <Col N="1161" /> price equal to that which the creameries are getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.  It just shows how well informed Deputy Dillon is about ordinary agricultural produce. Viewing the farmers from the safety of the right side of the counter he thinks that he can view their difficulties and problems with a certain measure of complacency and amusement.  The problem of farmers' butter is a peculiar one and a peculiarly difficult one, in that the farmer who makes good butter and has a certain quantity the whole year round has a market whereas the farmer who makes good butter but has a surplus to sell for only two months cannot get a market. There are thousands of farmers with the best quality butter which is far superior to creamery butter who cannot find a market at the present time because it is during the two or three months of the summer that you have a glut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the real problem and it is extremely difficult because it is difficult to devise a means by which this good quality butter can be collected from the farmers and stored in such a way that it will keep. Farmers' butter does not keep as well as creamery butter unless it is very heavily salted and it requires cold storage as well.  Over the years the purchase of surplus butter in the summer months was left to one or two firms.  If those firms wanted to get the maximum for that commodity, if they went all out to ensure that it would fetch high prices in the market and find a ready sale, they would do their utmost to operate an efficient system to collect that butter from the farmers, but we all know that the system is hopelessly inefficient.  This butter is bought in the main by country shopkeepers who have no system of grading it and who, even if they decided to do so, would find it very hard to operate a grading system against their customers.  The result is that the very best quality country butter is thrown into a box with the very worst quality and, of course, it all deteriorates and is brought down to the same condition.  In addition, <Col N="1162" /> the butter lies in the shop beside artificial manures and all the other commodities which you find in a country shop for at least a whole week after being perhaps two or three days in the farm before it is brought in. Under these circumstances, no matter what effort the farmer makes to ensure first-class quality, the butter could not be in first-class condition after that.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming Deputy Dillon for the fact that it is difficult to find a good export market for this commodity. The blame rests to a considerable extent upon the people engaged in the trade.  Deputy Dillon, however, did not improve matters by describing the butter as cart grease and proclaiming to the world that we had to call out the fire brigade to get it to the boat for export.  That is not a good way to get better prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I said about Deputy Dillon was that he did not help the position by proclaiming that the butter was of inferior quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several things which should be done to improve the position.  The butter could be graded.  Buyers could be sent around to grade it and only good quality butter should be purchased. We should also ensure a more <Col N="1163" /> speedy and efficient system of collection.  It is true that over a long period the Department of Agriculture have, to a great extent, been rather neglectful of country butter.  We have poultry and butter-making instructresses throughout the country but very little time is devoted to butter-making. Almost all their time is devoted to the poultry side of their business.  You can see the contrast in the case of creamery butter, inasmuch as every creamery is on a register which is passed by the Department and that is a guarantee that the quality of their butter is up to standard.  A similar system should be possible for farmers' butter.  You could have some sort of registration and a wrapper could be issued to the people who produce it efficiently so that it would be sold as first-class butter.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to enlarge the area of creamery collection so as to cover all districts where farmers' butter is made. That is the only alternative, particularly for the three or four months of the summer, and it is the alternative which should be carefully canvassed and considered by local committees of agriculture wherever this problem arises.  The use of lorries and the travelling creamery can enlarge the scope of every existing creamery.  I am not suggesting the erection of additional central creameries.  I am suggesting that their scope of operation should be widened.  The problem is extremely difficult, not because the quality of the butter is bad but because the production period extends for only three months, during which the market is glutted with this product.  With lorries, the creameries would be in a better position to carry out the collection of the milk.</P>
    <P>In outlining the essentials of a sound agricultural policy, I mentioned the improvement of the soil as priority number one and next to it the expansion of the live-stock industry, mainly in order to bring about immediately an expansion of the pig producing industry and then the improvement of our dairy stock.  I am a member of a county committee of agriculture <Col N="1164" /> and at their last meeting I proposed a resolution requesting that our officials should press for the establishment of cow testing associations all over the county, so that every cow in the county, whether supplying milk to the City of Dublin or to the creameries, would be on the register and under test, so that her yield would be recorded.  The committee, by a majority&mdash;and in this case the majority consisted mainly of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;voted against the proposal and said that cow testing was not called for.</P>
    <P>I do not agree.  If we are to get an upgrade in the milking qualities of our cows, we must make cow testing general.  No matter by what means we extend it, we must extend it to every district and to every farm throughout the State.  Every cow, whether employed for the purpose of producing milk for the farm or for the rearing of calves, or used to produce milk for delivery to the city or to creameries, should come under the scheme of registration.  All farmers would then have a clear idea of the productive capacity of those cows and would have the record established, so that the progeny of the cow also could be registered and they could bring a higher price to the rearer.  Also, the person purchasing an in-calf heifer or a milch cow would have some definite scientific information in regard to the pedigree of that cow as far as milk yield is concerned.  That is essential. There has been a lot of talk about dual purpose cows, but no cow should be kept unless it is registered, whether to rear calves or feed pigs or something else.  It does not pay to keep lowmilking cows and there is no necessity to keep them, if we would only have a yield record, so that any man going out to the market to buy a cow would at least have the assurance, from the ancestry of the cow, that the cow had a certain milk yield behind it.</P>
    <P>I was mentioning, before the Minister came in, that the county committee of agriculture in his own constituency, which should be a very enlightened place, passed a resolution within the last month condemning cow testing.  I do not know on what grounds these gentlemen, mainly of <Col N="1165" /> the Fine Gael Party, condemned it.  I think cow testing is essential.  There may be certain faults in the way in which it is operated at present.  It may need some tightening up or improvement, but it is absolutely essential for the improvement of the milk yields.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to have low milking cows.  Any Shorthorn cow should be able to give over 600 gallons, if fed properly.  That should be a minimum, and with that we could make good progress.  We would have the cow producing a substantial quantity of milk and also producing heifers required to replace the cows in the dairying industry and also, if required, it could produce first-class beef cattle for the beef trade.  The farmer could go to the Shorthorn cow if he wants to go in for the store cattle trade and stock portion of his land with good store cattle.  He could cross the Shorthorn with an Aberdeen Angus or a Hereford, and get the best quality stores, a better quality perhaps than he would get if his cow were of the pure beef breed such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus alone.</P>
    <P>Just to show how essential this is, I may relate that I was speaking to an extensive farmer last week, who keeps a Friesian herd and supplies milk to the city.  He is an extensive farmer inasmuch as he carries a certain amount of store cattle on his farm.  He finds them expensive to buy and wants to breed store cattle.  He proposes to breed them from the Friesians by a cross with the Herefords.  I do not know how successful he will be.  He told me himself he had some cows of the Shorthorn breed that are equal to the Friesians, and I thought he would do far better to concentrate on the Shorthorn breed, where he would have a better foundation stock both for the beef branch of his business and the milk branch of his business.</P>
    <P>There was only one matter in which Deputy Dillon expressed his disagreement with the Minister for Agriculture. In regard to every other matter, he had nothing but applause for the Minister's policy generally.  He did condemn the change which has been introduced by the Minister with regard to <Col N="1166" /> the advisory service throughout the State.  Deputy Dillon talks about the parish plan as if he were the father and mother of that plan.  We all know that the author of the scheme was Father Hayes and Muintir na Tíre, and that it was taken over by Deputy Dillon in his first year of office.  He very grandly announced that he would put into operation in every part of the land a parish plan, or a parish agent as he calls it, in every parish.  He announced that at a rural week in Carlow.</P>
    <P>A year later, difficulties having arisen in the meantime, he got up at another rural week, I think in Navan, and announced that the parish plan had gone up the spout.  Later again, he introduced what he called the three-parish arrangement, by which three parishes would be grouped together, because he could not find enough agents to put one in every parish.  He pretended he was about to introduce, in conjunction with Macra na Feirme, a three-club plan.</P>
    <P>All these plans hung gracefully in the air until Deputy Dillon went out of office and the present Minister announced that he had no intention of following these various activities of his predecessor and that, as we need additional advisory service and since that is probably justifiable in present circumstances, his proposal was to increase the number of agricultural instructors in each county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister for Agriculture.  His plan was to increase the number of agricultural instructors in each county and that is the policy which I assume he will continue to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On analysis, fundamentally there is not a great difference between the two propositions.  They both achieve the same result.  They both increase the advisory service.  The present Minister is not impressed by the Americanism of calling these gentlemen parish agents.  We are American educated to a great extent through the cinema. That name may sound attractive but <Col N="1167" /> the present Minister, being a cautious, prudent, plodding gentleman, does not want to make any change and he calls them agricultural instructors as they have been called in the past.</P>
    <P>What will be the net result of this increase in the number of agricultural instructors?  If the scheme is properly organised, it will mean that each instructor will have a comparatively small area.  We hope that, after a time, the area will be little more than three parishes.  In many cases it will be no more than three parishes.  The instructor will have a small compact area in which to operate.  It is essential that he should reside in the area. In a very short space of time he should get to know every farmer and his system of farming.  Thus he will achieve quietly and without any Americanism or bluster what the former Minister intended to achieve. There will be close contact between the individual instructor and the farmer. Responsibility rests to a considerable extent on the county committees of agriculture.  They must be very active in ensuring that local instructors reside in their areas and keep in active and very close touch with every farmer in the area, not with the farmers who have big banking accounts, who look prosperous and can make a good show. It is more essential to keep in touch with the small farmer, the man with the big family that he is trying to support out of poor land.  That is the man that the local agricultural instructor should keep in touch with and try to help in getting his land into better condition and better stocked.  If that is done, extensive progress will be made.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why, under this plan which the Minister is organising, local organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Young Farmers' Clubs, the Countrywomen's Association and any other progressive local agricultural organisations should not co-operate with the local instructor.  There is no reason why they should not invite the local instructor to their meetings and discuss problems with him.  There is no no reason why he should not help them to eliminate inferior cows and to take <Col N="1168" /> advantage of any schemes that may be in operation.</P>
    <P>In the case of the smaller farmer, the Minister should endeavour to see if something could be done as regards fertilisers.  I have mentioned the position in regard to lime and the modification of the present lime scheme. There could be some provision for short-term credit at a low rate of interest for the purpose of providing manure and seeds.  The best way to help the man who is in a difficult position is to help him to get his land into condition, to get at least one good crop.  There is need for improvement in regard to short-term credit.  The agricultural instructor may go to the type of farmer I have in mind and may tell him, having tested his land, that its fertility is very low and that he must put so many hundredweights or tons of fertiliser into it and must reseed certain fields.  As the Minister pointed out, reseeding in certain cases may cost as much as £20 per acre.  All that involves considerable expense.  A doctor attended a sick farmer and left an expensive prescription.  The sick man inquired if he had left any money along with it.  The farmer who gets a prescription from the local instructor may have difficulty in carrying it out. Therefore there is need for improvement in the provision of short-term credit for that type of farmer.</P>
    <P>Advisory service and agricultural education must be considered in conjunction with residential agricultural schools.  As a member of a committee of agriculture, I know that farmers are often rather slow to take advantage of the scholarships provided for attendance at rural schools.  That reluctance is due to a variety of causes.  The son of a farmer or agricultural worker who is anxious to remain on the land will want to avail of services of that kind as early as possible but his services are very valuable on the farm and, having regard to present agricultural wages, his parents may be anxious to retain his services on the farm, perhaps in order to help in the education of younger members of the family.  That may not be entirely fair to the particular boy.  It should be impressed upon farmers that the young generation are <Col N="1169" /> entitled to the highest degree of education and technical training that can be given them so that they may become progressive farmers.</P>
    <P>If a young boy is sent to an agricultural college where a large percentage of the pupils have no intention of becoming farmers, he is brought into contact with boys who are going on for a degree in agricultural science or for some job.  On entering the school, he may be keen to become a farmer and he may leave that school at the end of the year with the idea of getting a job.  Residential schools which are open to boys who intend to remain on the land should be confined exclusively to that type of pupil so that they will have the same outlook on life.  These boys talk about their plans when they have finished their course, how soon they can get qualified and get a job, and so forth.  I think it should be considered having schools which would be confined solely to intending farmers and agricultural labourers.  With the increase that is taking place in the number of agricultural inspectors, I hope we will be able to have more continuous classes designed to teach agricultural subjects in every parish to young boys.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to impress on the local committees of agriculture that every boy who leaves the primary school and who intends to remain on the land, be he a farmer or an agricultural labourer, should be given an opportunity of doing a course in a local agricultural class.  No district should be overlooked.  This may need a lot of organisation, but it is a necessity.  I repeat that every farmer and agricultural labourer&mdash;who is a farmer with another name&mdash;should get an opportunity of doing an intensive course in agriculture.  Even though the course may only be an evening one, it should be comprehensive.  If the numbers interested in attending such a course are too small in a certain district to warrant the formation of a class, they should be amalgamated with those from another district.  An effort should be made to reach every district.  I am in agreement with the Minister's efforts to increase the number of agricultural instructors.  He should follow <Col N="1170" /> up those efforts by trying to ensure that every one of those instructors is enthusiastic in promoting agricultural knowledge, development, experiment and research.</P>
    <P>There is a decline in the beet acreage this year.  To a certain extent, that decline is due to a certain amount of misunderstanding and misrepresentation that occurred at the time the price was being fixed.  In the Carlow beet factory propaganda was circulated to the effect that the Beet Growers' Association had met the factory representatives and asked for a better price for the farmers.  A price was offered which was accepted by a majority of one&mdash;the chairman's casting vote.  That settlement was broadcast throughout the area, and when I heard it I resented it very much.  I felt that the Beet Growers' Association had acted rather hastily when 50 per cent. of the members were against the decision, and that they should at least have held up their decision until the matter had been referred back to the growers. There was a complete misrepresentation of what happened in regard to the negotiations between the Irish Sugar Company and the Beet Growers' Association.  What actually happened was that the Beet Growers' Association asked for an all-over increase of 7/- per ton.  That is an all-over increase which cuts out the readjustment as between the pulp and the price of beet.  They were offered an average increase of 11/-.  To the average grower, that represents 4/-more than he asked.  That information was not conveyed to the growers. Instead the position was misrepresented.</P>

Is he not aware that that subsidy provides for the free transport of beet to the factory?  In actual fact, that subsidy amounted to 4/6 in the case of suppliers living near the factory, as compared with last year, and almost 20/- in the case of suppliers very distant from the factory.  Therefore, the people living near the factory did not get the 7/-increase which they asked, but the people living far away from the factory got almost 20/- of an increase.  The average increase for the growers in the whole area was in or about 11/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to impress the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this is a very great mistake.  Propaganda of a very unjust type was used against people and, as a result, there was a serious decline in the acreage of beet this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the matter will be better dealt with in the negotiations for the coming year.  Deputy Keane referred to the pulp.  The position in regard to the pulp is that the growers' association asked for an increase in the price of pulp to be offset, of course, by an increase in the price of beet.  They thought that would be more equitable and just for various reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as blank as you are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the price of pulp was offset by an increase in the <Col N="1174" /> price of beet.  The position, therefore, is exactly the same as it was.  The only net increase in the price to the grower, as compared with the previous year, was in the subsidising of the transport of beet, which works out on an average at about 11/-.  Some of the very members of the council of the Beet Growers' Association, who went about advising not to grow more than one acre of beet, and who grew only one acre in order to keep their names on the register of the Beet Growers' Association, were the very people who advocated that the price be increased not to 12/- or 12/6, as it was, but to 15/-.  That fact cannot be denied. They asked the sugar company to increase the price of beet pulp to 15/-. They then had the audacity to protest at the way the unfortunate people were being treated.  All that was misrepresentation. It was a very discreditable type of misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>As far as I knew, I did not think that there was any political implications behind it but, as the matter developed, I began to see that there were.  It was one of those things that was designed to discredit the existing Government and to upset their efforts to make this country self-supporting in regard to sugar.  I hope this matter will be dealt with very efficiently in the coming year and that in respect of whatever price is agreed on between the growers' association and the factory, or whatever negotiations are carried on, the same opportunities for misrepresentation and misunderstanding will not arise.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the campaign against the growing of beet had gained considerable ground before the Irish Sugar Company launched out with the publicity campaign to explain the true facts of the case in so far as they could.  I hope and trust that, as a result of the friendly, frank and free negotiations between the growers' association and the factory a price will be fixed next year by agreement which will be satisfactory to all concerned, and that the facts in regard to any agreement entered into will not be misrepresented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the beet crop does not give a very big return to the <Col N="1175" /> man who has only an average yield.  I hope that through the efforts of the advisers of the Department of Agriculture and the active co-operation of the local instructors working in conjunction with the advisers of the Irish Sugar Company we will succeed in overcoming the difficulties in regard to production so that we will bring our yield per acre up to over 11 tons per acre.  If we can do that we will have what will be a very profitable crop for the farmer.</P>
    <P>Sugar beet not only gives a valuable crop to the nation in so far as it provides employment and a valuable foodstuff in the way of sugar but it also provides additional feeding-stuffs on the farm.  More important still, it leaves the soil in a cleaner, better and more fertile condition.  Whatever is done in the future, I hope we will not have a campaign, based on falsehoods and misrepresentation, against the growing of sugar beet.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon set a good headline, I must say.  But we had a little contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture who thought he had been maligned, blamed in the wrong or that he had been called an unworthy name.  We then had a reply from the ex-Minister for Lands in the last Government which will not help the decorum with which this Estimate should be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been listening to the most amazing amount of tripe for the last hour or two.  We were told that we should do this and that and that the Department should do this and the Minister should do that.  Now we have been told about the black pig and that the Department should examine the possibilities of discovering some more suitable breed to cross with the <Col N="1176" /> Large White York.  Anybody with any sense of responsibility should impress upon the farmers in areas where black pigs are being reared the necessity for eradicating the black pig immediately and producing a pig whose bacon will be acceptable to consumers.  Anyone who knows anything about pigs knows that the Large White York is the most suitable.  Deputy Cogan is supposed to be a farmers' candidate. Yet he talked about reintroducing the black pig or some other breed in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  The Deputy stated that I said the black pig should be introduced.  I said nothing of the kind.  As a matter of fact I said the direct opposite, that we should eradicate it.</P>

Perhaps I have done a good day's work in preventing the Department from looking for this wonder pig we are to produce in this country.  I say stick to the Large White York with the long side and both producer and consumer will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a widow living in my town whose son was an agricultural worker. He was dissatisfied with his avocation in life and decided to join the Army. Incidentally, he was a loss to the neighbourhood as he was a very good worker.  After a period of 12 months he wrote to his mother and told her that if she would be in a certain place on a certain day he would be passing through with his regiment and she could meet him.  She went there and met him and they had a reunion that night.  Discussing the matter later with some neighbours, she was loud in her praise of the fine lot of lads she saw, but, she said, &ldquo;I was very sorry to see that they were all out of step but my Paddy.&rdquo;  Fine Gael got out of step with Deputy Cogan, Fianna Fáil are getting out of step with Deputy Cogan, the inter-Party Government were out of step with Deputy Cogan. Incidentally, I am afraid that Deputy <Col N="1177" /> Dillon will become an obsession with Deputy Cogan before he is finished.  I do not remember how many times Deputy Cogan mentioned him, but it looked as if his contribution was on Deputy Dillon and not on agriculture.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister when on this side of the House took the Deputy very seriously when he suggested some fantastic schemes, but they were dropped very quickly when he assumed the responsibility of office.  I am sure the Minister will not fall for the act which Deputy Cogan has been putting on here with his nicely modulated voice.  We got a certain amount about agriculture from him but we got 90 per cent. of tripe.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister intends to amend the Agricultural Workers (Half-holiday) Act which was passed by the inter-Party Government. As representing the agricultural community, he should do that, because if inducements are not held out to the agricultural workers, the drift from the land will continue.  Until all the amenities which town and city workers are enjoying are extended to agricultural workers, the drift from the land will continue.</P>

      <P>Then we will come to something for which he is responsible. I should like to refer to his promises before the election with regard to the price of milk.  I am not confirming Deputy Dillon's statement that the Minister promised that the price would be raised to 1/9 per gallon, but I have a hazy recollection that he mentioned 1/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>As a practical farmer I am sure the Minister probably had costings of his own at the time, that he did not make public statements just for the sake of exploitation.  I do not believe a man in his position would do that.  I am sure he carried out some little experiments.  I know of the experiments he carried out since he went to Merrion Street&mdash;the Mitchelstown one.  Recently Mr. Barry, Secretary I.C.M.S. seemed to be very annoyed with something that the Minister said.  Since Mr. Barry took on the responsibility of a member of the Costings Commission a paper has been issued and in its first edition it gives the result of the costings carried out by the Mitchelstown creamery at 1/6 per gallon.  It mentions one farmer who had a herd of cows producing on an average 800 gallons of milk a year and that through having such a good yield his costings were more.  That is not a very good start off by people who are to be responsible for the costings experiment in this country under the ægis of the Minister.  Surely the <Col N="1179" /> farmer with an average 800 gallons yield produced milk more economically than farmers with only a 480 gallon average and whose cost of production was 11.94 pence.  Mr. Barry should know very well, as well as the vice-chairman who is also on the Costings Commission, that 480 gallons was the average for the cows at Mitchelstown and that 11.94 pence was the average cost.  The Minister should let the people know the exact costings in connection with the Mitchelstown creamery.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister, but I have no doubt that the increase of one penny in the price of milk was given as a matter of political expediency when he took over the office of the Minister for Agriculture. If such was not the reason the Minister when a Deputy deliberately led his constituents astray by giving 1/6 or 1/7 a gallon which could only be a national figure.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister referred last night to the success of the land rehabilitation scheme. Undoubtedly, according to the statistics given to us by him, that scheme is going on, as the old saying has it, like a house on fire.  It is a good man who will carry on another man's idea.  I do not give a hoot who started this scheme.  The proof of a man's honesty is that he is willing to carry on anything that he believes to be a success even though it has been initiated by some other man.  If the people are going to benefit by that plan, it is immaterial who initiates it or completes it.  The chief consideration is that the plan is being carried out in such a way as that the agricultural community will derive very substantial benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of fencing under that scheme, I took the matter up with the officer in charge and I suggested that oak posts, properly treated with cresote, were very nearly as substantial as concrete posts.  Their life would be anything from 20 to 40 years, if they were properly treated with creosote.  There would be a very substantial reduction in the cost of fencing some farms where oak stakes <Col N="1180" /> are available if such stakes were used in preference to concrete stakes and I think that the Minister should give consideration to that.  I do not want him to accept it as a general rule for I recognise that every herring must hang by its own tail, but such an arrangement would afford relief to many people who may not be able to afford concrete posts or who may not be in a position to get them made. Perhaps the Minister, in his charity, will make some reference to that matter when replying.</P>
    <P>Since my advent to this House, I have always prefaced my remarks on the Estimate for Agriculture by saying that the whole key-note to the agricultural economy of this country is production.  &ldquo;P&rdquo; is the operative letter and &ldquo;production&rdquo; is the operative word.  I am very glad to see that, so far as milk yields at the moment are concerned, the Minister is carrying out an intensive effort to produce a better type of dairy cow which of course will eventually mean an increase in milk yields.  The figures read out by Deputy Cogan, in one of the most creditable parts of his contribution, to my mind, to this debate, gave the comparison between Denmark and Ireland.  I believe that if the Minister will continue the various insemination centres he has set up, perhaps in the foreseeable future we may have the cow with the 500 gallon yield and, mind you, that would not be too bad.  Six hundred gallons is excellent but 500 would not be too bad either and I should like to have a 700 gallon yield if we could manage it.  I believe that by perseverance and initiative there is every possibility that we can produce a cow here that will average 500 to 600 gallons.  That would mean an increase of 200 gallons on the average yield of the moment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here when Deputy Dillon was in office&mdash;I think it was on the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;the necessity of establishing a veterinary service for dairying centres.  I am still of the same mind as I was in that regard three or four years ago.  I believe that a veterinary service is complementary to the success of any plan you put into operation.  You may <Col N="1181" /> call it a parish plan, a Muintir na Tíre plan, a Dillon plan, a Walsh plan or any other plan.  I believe that where you have a big dairying centre, you must have a veterinary service somewhat on the same lines as the dispensary services are operated for human beings at the moment.  That is of vital importance.  We have, unfortunately, a very heavy mortality list in calves and, without making any direct allegation, I think I can say that I believe a lot of that is due to the treatment of the calves immediately after calving, and perhaps to failure to have them injected against black-quarter and the various other diseases they get when they go out on after-grass. I am sure that the majority of the casualties take place between these periods.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, it means on a conservative basis £2,500,000 for this country every year. I am sure that a great many of these calves could be saved if proper veterinary attention were available. Most of them unfortunately belong to the small farmers&mdash;the four, five, six or seven-cow farmer.  He finds it very hard to employ a veterinary surgeon.  I believe that the Minister should give every consideration to the setting up of these services in dairy centres.</P>

      <P>If, pending the decision on her claim for a pension, a widow is granted home assistance in excess of the amount which would have been granted if she had been receiving payment of the pension, the Widows' and Orphans' <Col N="1185" /> Pensions Acts authorise a refund to the public assistance authority out of the arrears of pension provided the amount of the excess is certified to my Department before the arrears are paid to the widow.  In granting home assistance in such circumstances, a public assistance authority is precluded under the provisions of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts from taking into consideration the first 10/-of the pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this a great hardship on the widow.  I have a case here where a pension was held up in the Minister's Department.  The widow had to go to the local authority after she got the amount of the pension.  The full amount due to her by the Department was £7 16s., and she received £1 6s.  There was that deduction.  I want to find out if it is the county manager is doing this or is it the Minister himself who is making these orders?  This was a widow with a young family.  She was waiting for the period from the 18th January, 1952, to the 28th February, 1952, for her pension to come from the Department. I think these are very low, mean tactics.  The Minister's Department or even the county manager should not do it.</P>

      <P>Apart from areas of bog, mountain and waste, the Land Commission have <Col N="1186" /> on hands some 25,000 acres of land which was taken over under the Land Acts, 1923-1950.  Less than half of this area is arable.  Early this year I arranged with the Land Commission that they would let in conacre tillage as much as possible of the arable lands in their possession which could not be allotted last spring.  These lettings were made by local auctioneers, stock managers and inspectors.  The returns of all the lettings are not yet to hand but it is estimated that the area let in tillage is in the region of 2,000 to 3,000 acres.  The balance of the lands have been let in grazing.</P>
      <P>In considering the area let in tillage, it must be borne in mind that the arable lands on hands include second crop meadows, impoverished lands in need of rehabilitation, land inadequately fenced for tillage, etc.  In addition, the Land Commission had to have regard to the fact that much of the area on hands would be allotted later in the year in new holdings and that it would not be feasible to till an undue proportion of the lands comprising these holdings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the possibility of the Minister establishing veterinary services in the dairying areas to improve milk production by having diseases such as mastitis and sterility eliminated.  Thank goodness since strain 19 was introduced&mdash;though, unfortunately, some people will not use it&mdash;I have heard various people with herds a good deal larger than I have saying it was 100 per cent. success.  However, mastitis is still there rearing its ugly head and so is sterility.  The advice of the agricultural instructors may also be necessary because, rightly or wrongly, the opinion is prevalent that sterility is due to the lack of some essential mineral in the soil.  With a proper soil survey in conjunction with the work of the veterinary surgeon, it should be possible completely to eliminate this.</P>
      <P>I have an idea that in some parts of Clare something like this occurred a couple of years ago and by a judicious application of a proper fertiliser I believe everything was made all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would like to make to the Minister is that apart entirely from the breeding of dairy cattle I am very much afraid that in the period between December and April, when the cow is more or less immobilised, the feeding given by the dairy farmers <Col N="1198" /> is not up to the mark.  The sooner these people's minds are disabused of the idea that just an ordinary quantity of hay and a good drink of water will suffice for the cow that will be calving in the month of March or April, the better it will be primarily for themselves and the better it will be for the country as a whole.  If a cow is not fed with certain concentrates to make up for all she loses in the actual calving and for what the calf takes out of her, that cow will not milk as she should milk, maybe, for two or three months after calving, whereas if the cow was supplied with the necessary concentrates there would be a return after a month to the full supply of milk.  I would ask the Minister to give every consideration to this question. Even if he does not set up the veterinary services as suggested by me perhaps he would give consideration to having a veterinary surgeon in an advisory capacity or ask the creameries to advise their suppliers to give to the cattle in the winter time, when they are not milking before calving, something besides hay and water.</P>
    <P>As regards increasing the production of cereals I believe that the pamphlets issued by the Department have been very informative.  Anybody can read them and with the proper application of fertilisers you can get good value for whatever you spend on that line. As we are on the question of fertilisers I must say I am very sorry to see the attitude adopted by various committees of agriculture this year.  I could be an iconoclast if I liked and start criticising the Minister.  I will not do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are representatives on county committees of agriculture manned by farmers who, when certain fertilisers are increased in price through no fault of the Minister's, advised the people not to use fertilisers. If there was sabotage, as Deputy Cogan alleged there was, in any quarter it was sabotage by the people who utilised the Press either for political or personal propaganda, and prevented a certain number of farmers from putting fertilisers on <Col N="1199" /> their lands this year.  Those people are criminals.  We all know that we have not yet returned to full soil fertility. Undoubtedly the price of fertilisers is high.  Even though there may be a reduction in prices next year, in the aggregate it will cost the farmers more because they will have to make up next year for their failure to put fertilisers on the land this year.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister several questions about barley.  On one occasion I asked him if 84/- a barrel would militate against the production of wheat in the quantity in which both he and I would like to see it produced.  I was told in reply that there was a guaranteed price for wheat, and there was no guaranteed price for barley. Surely the Minister is not so ignorant as not to understand that 84/- per barrel for 16 stone is infinitely more attractive than 72/- per barrel for 20 stone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister comes from a barley growing area.  Indeed, it might be described as a tillage area and he must be aware that one gets more barley per acre than wheat per acre.  I was not surprised when the farmers in my constituency failed to grow wheat. As a matter of fact I was amazed that any of them grew wheat.  I asked the Minister the other day would he be prepared to supply helicopters for the eradication of the wheat midge. We had Deputy Corry, the archangel of the Fianna Fáil Party hopping from house to house in his helicopter having barley growers meeting in one house, beet growers meeting in another house and grain growers somewhere else and everywhere he was telling them they would get 102/6 per barrel for barley.  If ever there is a crown for the king of the barley growers he should get it.  As a matter of fact Deputy Martin J. Corry, who is not in the House at the moment, is an emperor because he took more than a couple of constituencies under his wing.  I believe that this 84/-, which was subsequently increased to 102/6, as publicised by Deputy Corry, was a kind of condonation of Government policy.  It gave an opportunity to the brewers to come along and clap the first penny on the pint of porter.  When <Col N="1200" /> the price was reduced to 75/- the brewers failed to reduce the price of the pint.  That, of course, is typical of the democratic Fianna Fáil Government. It is rumoured that they sent back the Minister for Finance's Budget five times for revision by him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry assessed the damage done by the midge in Cork last year at in or around £750,000.  I was not present on the occasion of his making that assessment. Providence inspired me not to attend that meeting.  If Deputy Corry was on this side I wonder how many millions the midge would be costing this year?  I believe it would take a good skelp out of the Budget to compensate the farmers for the loss caused by it in Deputy Corry's estimation. One would assume that Deputy Corry would play ball with the Minister and his Department in the drive for greater wheat production. I do not know whether Fianna Fáil is a disciplined Party.  If it is, as it used to be, Deputy Corry should be admonished.</P>

The sooner this kind of personal propaganda on the part of Deputies, Senators or Ministers ceases the better it will be for the country.  One of the principal culprits responsible for the reduction in the wheat acreage in Cork this year is Deputy Martin J. Corry, who will come in here and tell us soon what the farmers are enjoying now under the new régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in last Tuesday's <i>Cork Examiner</i> an advertisement by O'Mara's of Limerick and another advertisement by Donnelly's of Dublin, and I wondered whether the farmers are being led back again to the years when they had to sell their pigs at a loss.  To some people, these maybe were very insignificant items, <Col N="1201" /> but anyone with any idea about the marketing of pigs will realise the discrepancy in price when I say that O'Mara's top price was given from 1 cwt. 0 qrs. and 7 lbs. to 1 cwt. 2 qrs. and 7 lbs. with a 6/- bonus per cwt. for a suitable pig of that weight. <i>En passant</i>, it would be the Large White York and not the black pigs so often spoken about in this House and outside.  Donnelly's quotation was the same, 252/- per cwt., for 1 cwt. to 1 cwt. 2 qrs.  There is a big difference in the different weights without taking the 6/- bonus into consideration as between O'Mara's price and Donnelly's price.</P>
    <P>The Department or the Pigs Marketing Board should direct its attention to that matter immediately and inquire the reason for the discrepancy in the prices of the two bacon curers.  The farmers must face up to a realisation that the people eating the bacon they produce must get the bacon they want and the sooner the farmer realises that the suitable pig is between 107 and 127, the better it will be for himself. Deputy Murphy referred to a case here to-day of some farmers who lost their market, but these farmers were not to blame because they put their pigs on the market at the proper weight.  They were not bought and they had to bring them back, because they could not be allowed to starve, and next time they put them on the market they were overweight and the price was cut.  That racket was all cleared away last year and the year before by opening the gates of the Border.  It will not increase the price of bacon to the consumers because it has reached saturation point.  Pigs were down 14/- per cwt. in my town last Tuesday, and I am anxiously waiting to see the reduction in the price of bacon as a result.  I am very sure it will never come.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, agriculture, our fundamental industry, the industry on which we all more or less depend, has the greatest bunch of softies ready for all the confidence men of the various industries in the cities and towns, and until such time as concentrated action is taken by them to assert their rights they will continue to be subjected to <Col N="1202" /> the same type of thing.  The Minister should very seriously consider opening the Border again.  That will bring these fancy boys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy take a rule and compass and think a little north of his eyebrows and not just accept things he sees haphazardly.  The inter-Party Government rectified all these things and the spivs running the various factories, after a fortnight, were coming in with their hands up and there was no increase to the consumer, either.  Now the price has gone up for the consumer and down for the producer.  That is a repetition of the Fianna Fáil 1946/47 policy.  Let them not tell me that they are solicitous for the poor man because that game was played out in Brian Boru's time when the Deputy was only a corporal and I was a buckshee sergeant.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position with regard to bacon pigs exported to England.  Some people are of the opinion that the impost is £1 per pig, while others think it is £1 per cwt.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know exactly how much has to be paid in tax or in any other way.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Blowick who mentioned the small farmer, and I am afraid that what he said obtains in Mayo, obtains also in the area I represent.  The sooner we apply ourselves to assisting the small farmer &mdash; and if we are to err, let us err on the right side &mdash; the better it will be for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that I was chairman of a local committee and I had a chat with the manager and the chief technical officer.  I said that we could build local authority houses for small farmers of a certain valuation, and we did.  We paid them £60 per acre for their land and returned them as tenants.  The Minister should see that the agricultural community are provided for. Many small farmers live in houses which I will not call hovels &mdash; they may <Col N="1203" /> be very respectable little dwelling houses &mdash; but there is no room for their sons and daughters.  They must be sent out, as the farmer cannot afford to keep them.  If we could provide what one might describe, with some exaggeration, perhaps, as dower houses, we could take some of those sons and let them live there instead of having them drift away to the towns, across to England and further afield.  I would ask the Minister to mention that in his Cabinet conversations with the Minister for Local Government.</P>

He then ran away from it.  He never could listen to the truth in his life and to the price presently charged in Midleton to the consumers, that is, 3/7 per gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to realise that we seem to have found at least some basis for realism in our agricultural policy as between successor and predecessor.  Certain facets of that policy having been withdrawn from the political arena.  I think it is now the duty of the House to analyse the major problems underlying our agricultural development.  I will not comment in any great detail on the activity or, maybe, the conspicuous lack of activity of the present occupant of the Ministry of agriculture.  Rather will I address my mind to what I conceive to be the major issues and problems which must be resolved before we can increase agricultural production.</P>
      <P>I do not mind who is to get the credit for what may be achieved: I want to see the achievement.  I am glad that the Minister had sufficient tact, if nothing else, to pay tribute, not in a specific way but in the general tenor of his speech, to the work of his predecessor.  Despite the fact that the alleged Independent Deputy from Wicklow has an obsession about Deputy Dillon, we must realise that his energy and effort in the Department of Agriculture did in fact sow seeds which have grown startlingly, as we must admit when we recall that in the first six months of this year the highest all-time figure for exports in this country was reached, about £46,000,000.  It is now quite clear that before the end of this year exports will be over £100,000,000, and the maximum part will be agricultural produce.  It shows that there is a really solid foundation on which to work.  We must take the fundamental problems and try to right them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that the problem which besets us might easily be divided into six parts.  First of all <Col N="1205" /> we must rehabilitate and put back into heart abused land.  We must remember the very simple maxim or law of nature that you cannot take out of the land any more than you put into it.  I do not care who will ultimately get the credit for educating Irish farmers into the progressive and intelligent use of fertilisers, but I want to see that done, because, approaching this problem objectively, we realise that it is possible to step up in a short time the production of every acre of land in this country.  I will have more to say on that from the tillage aspect later.</P>
    <P>The second part of the problem is to improve the quality and type of grassland.  There has been a lot of discussion here to-day, much of it disjointed, but the kernel of the problem where milk is concerned must be related to the problem of the feed of the cattle and in the ultimate analysis the yield of milk.  Whether it is a good or a bad cow, if it is to be kept alive and do its best it must be properly fed.  Therefore, it becomes essential, in dealing with the ordinary economics of the dairy herd, to improve the quality of grassland to such an extent that about four blades of grass will grow for every one now growing.  The period at which grass will be available as feed should be extended at least a further month at both ends, thus reducing very substantially the problem of winter feeding.  That is what I describe as the second facet of the problem.</P>
    <P>After that, we must come inevitably to the problem of our general plan of agricultural husbandry.  It was epitomised in his realistic way by the late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Hogan &mdash; go ndéanfaidh Dia trochaire ar a anam &mdash; when he preached the simple three-pronged doctrine of: one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough. Taking that as the central piece of the agricultural structure, the keystone of our agricultural policy, we must radiate from that to fill all the essentials that will go to the ultimate achievement.  I am glad to see that the present Minister had the courage to repeat in his address to the House <Col N="1206" /> the theory and philosophy of his predecessor when he subscribed to the belief that it is essential for the Irish farmer to plan his tillage on the basis of producing the maximum possible amount of feeding stuffs for the maximum stock he rears on his farm and walk it off the land on the hoof. We are coming back to sanity when we face reality.  I am glad that catchcries and catch-crops are leaving our economic purview as far as agriculture is concerned.  The time has come to face it in a realistic way and to plan how best agriculture is going to expand and, having made the plan, to implement it.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious facet of the problem to which, representing, as I do, a large creamery area, a milk and butter producing area, I will have to advert at length, that is, the general problem of milk and milk prices.  I will be straightforward and honest.  I think the Minister has made a complete and absolute cod of the milk situation.  Whether he was forced into it in circumstances of political expediency or driven into it by the irresponsibles or by the lack of intelligence of some of his independent support, I do not know, but I feel that he has retarded the investigation and solution of that problem very seriously. Having said that, I hope, in the course of my remarks, to demonstrate in an impartial way where he went wrong and to give, as I am entitled to give, the approach that I feel would have been the more practical, the more honest and the more likely to succeed.</P>
    <P>We talk of the wealth we export in the way of carcase beef or stores.  In all the period that we have been developing that type of trade, we have allowed the continuation of ill-health in the body politic, in so far as we have not put right the fundamental system.  We have not tried to analyse and secure in position the keystone and to set on a firm basis the corner-stone of all our cattle trade, namely, the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the expediency of a penny a gallon increase in milk here or a penny a gallon increase there is the way to face that problem, nor do I think the present commission <Col N="1207" /> being set up by the Minister is the way to deal with the problem. Commissions or committees of this House or set up by Ministers have had an indeterminable way of acting, and often before they have reported on the problem they were set up to investigate, not only has the problem gone, but it probably has died in the interim for lack of attention.  It is not in a year or two that we want to know what the costings of milk are.  The problem is one of the immediate present.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary circumstances have arisen that heifer beef is more valuable for slaughter and sale than for production to build up in a milch herd.  It is the immediate urgency of the problem that tempts me to deal with it at length.  The fantastic situation has arisen that if we have a denuding of the country of young heifer beef for slaughter purposes we are going to have not only an acute problem with regard to ultimate replacement of stock sold but we are going to have an acute problem in maintaining the milk supply for essential purposes, for human consumption as well as for keeping up the supply of milk for creameries.</P>
    <P>The farmer is a realist &mdash; unfortunately, in many ways too much of a realist.  When he can see and hold out his hand to grasp something of immediate value to himself, he does it, at times without realising the ultimate consequences.</P>
    <P>Whether I was on the far side of the House or on this side, I have always advocated that there is no point in trying to deal with this problem on any basis other than the threefold one.  First of all, we must get the feed problem right for our cows.  Many of our farmers have to be taught that they are likely to get a more economical return in milk yield by a better feed for the cows.  We all know and accept the point that it costs as much to feed a bad cow as to feed a good one.  It even costs more to feed a bad one, so there is the duty of the Department to get about the task at once to improve the quality of the cow that is to be an integral part of recognised dairy effort in this country.  At the same time an obligation will be <Col N="1208" /> thrown on the farming community to find the most economic and most expeditious way of turning milk into cash.  Responsibility must be placed on the agricultural community to improve the method of dealing with milk, perhaps by milking larger herds by machinery, and certainly there will have to be an improvement in the method of handling milk and delivering it to creameries.</P>
    <P>It is a threefold problem.  It is not one of a penny here or a penny there. It is a question of State effort and advice in the initial stages in order to improve the quality, type and texture of grasslands.  It is a question of aid, advice and help, again by the State, particularly in the present day when it is possible for the State to build up a reserve of good type heifers. They should be doing it now because any uneconomic cow or heifer that is taken from a farmer to-day will realise in the carcase meat trade or beef trade as much money as the Department will have to pay for the type of heifer they want to buy for the purpose of improving milk herds. That has been proved in a realistic and startling way in one parish in this country.</P>
    <P>It is now a positive fact that every animal that was deemed uneconomic in the herds of Bansha has been eradicated and replaced by another animal without one halfpenny cost to the Exchequer.  I cannot say, and nobody can say as yet, whether all the replacements will be successful, but there can be another weeding out without any cost to the Exchequer and gradually a herd can be built up that will be economic from the point of view of yield.</P>
    <P>I do not want that type of herd to be the exclusive property of the man who has capital and can afford to be selective about the type of animal he buys.  I want that type of herd to be within the right and the capacity of any small farmer.</P>
    <P>That problem cannot be tackled by people who are anxious to remain in the dairying industry unless they get State assistance to the extent that in-calf heifers to the best type of milk-strain <Col N="1209" /> bull are made available for replacement purposes.  The only people who can afford to build up that type of herd are the Department, and they should make such a bank available to the man who is anxious to improve the quality and class of his stock.</P>
    <P>If the dairy farmers were approached in the right way, given the full facts of the problem and given State assistance in improving the quality of their cows, they would co-operate and the general approach to agriculture would be improved.  In a very short period the farmer would get increased yields of milk which would make a reasonable price for milk an economic price to him.</P>
    <P>A cow that would produce 600 gallons to 700 gallons, at present prices, is a far better proposition for the country than an increase in the price of milk to a level that might be uneconomic to the consumer and which would encourage the retention of uneconomic cows.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had taken the Irish dairy farmer into his confidence and had produced a concrete, reasonable plan, allowing prices to be adjusted on a costs basis over a certain yield, he would have succeeded in making the dairying industry economic for its participants, and improving the quality of cattle and grasslands.</P>
    <P>The second part of the problem is interwoven with that mixed type of husbandry that is essential on a small farm.  The farmer must be made to realise that the judicious use of dung with artificial fertiliser can improve crop yields enormously.</P>
    <P>The farmer must learn the fodder and the food that he must grow in order to be successful in the production of mixed stock.  He must learn the value of the various feeding stuffs.  I was pleased last night to hear the present Minister advocate, as was advocated by his predecessor, the intelligent use and development of fodder feed.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves the question as to whether in modern conditions, the farmer is getting the advice, direction and aid that are necessary to enable him to make the most of, in many <Col N="1210" /> cases, a small holding.  Is the farmer sufficiently well versed as to the value of ensilage, whether it be potatoes or green grass or any other crop?  Has he yet learned that he can produce on his farm a balanced feeding that will compete with any imported feeding?</P>
    <P>One of our main problems in pig rearing has been the question of feed. When, in circumstances over which we had no control, there was an alarming and rapid increase in the price of maize, the general pig producer was up in arms and there was an outcry. Deputies representing agricultural communities must, in duty to our people, direct their attention to the fact that the only way to avoid the fluctuations in price that must arise in the case of imported feed is to produce at home a balanced ration for animals.</P>
    <P>I want to see that advice made available to every farmer in this country.  I realise, of course, that it will call for an enlargement of advisory services.  However, I have always contended and still contend that if there is one bureau of reference that should know no limit where the indulgence of this House is concerned, it is the Department of Agriculture.  We give lip service to our belief that our whole economy is fundamentally and completely tied up with agriculture.  If it is, the best possible advice should be readily available to any farmer in this country with the problem arising out of the husbandry of his land, the best possible advice so as to help him to get over it.  I have always felt that we would be doing the best possible service to this country if agriculture as such were taken out of the realm of politics altogether and if we got down to the establishment of machinery designed to give advice on agricultural matters.  An agricultural policy should be established which should not be subjected to the capricious winds of political talk.  We know how much land we have and how much of that land we can improve and reclaim.  We know exactly, as a result of various types of analysis of soil, what the potential of farms can be brought up to.  Knowing all that we should be able to go ahead with our task without political interference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> That is the task to which I intend to direct most of my observations on this occasion.  I do not feel that our farmers are getting a return commensurate with the contribution they are making.  From an analysis of statistics, we find that all facets of economic activity in this country ultimately revert to the land and to what is produced from the land.  In that knowledge, we are entitled, representing a farming community, to come to this House and to make demands.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary my demand that every possible scientific aid the farmers may need should be readily and freely made available to them; it is only by the expansion of the volume of agricultural produce available for export that the economic salvation of this country can be achieved.  We hear talk of trade depressions and trade recessions, but people seem to forget that the virility or otherwise of the home market for commodities other than agricultural produce depends on the economic success of the farmer.  Lip service has been given to the theory that, unless the agricultural community is prosperous, nobody is prosperous.  I maintain that we have reached the stage in this country now when we should be able to see the road along which agriculture should advance.  We should have the courage to help the farmer along that road, because, by so doing, we are ensuring our own economic salvation.  It is no use making appeals for increased agricultural production.  Increased production can only be achieved as a result of a practical and sensible plan designed to refertilise, rehabilitate and, where necessary, drain the land.  All possible technical advice should be readily and freely made available to farmers.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the day arriving when the farmer, with the aid of the Department of Agriculture, is able to say without hesitation what peculiar features or soil conditions exist in fields or in portions of fields on his farm that would militate against any particular crop.  With that knowledge, the farmer would be able to use every <Col N="1212" /> field to the best possible advantage. That is the service that the agricultural community have merited.  We will not have an expansion in agriculture unless we make a progressive plan and advance gradually to our ultimate goal.  I appreciate that it would take a capital investment, probably to the tune of £1,000,000,000, which is a tremendous amount of money, to put Irish land into top condition, by draining it as it should be drained, by clearing various types of headlands and by improving top soil and grass.  All this cannot be achieved overnight, but I feel that we have reached the stage in agricultural policy in this country where we can provide a plan and, having provided it, gradually work to our goal, namely, to have every acre of land in this country producing its maximum.  It is because the atmosphere of this debate has not got the usual acrimony of politics that I advocate, in such a positive way, that we should get down to the job.</P>
    <P>Various sections of the agricultural community have their own problems. Apart from the major problems of bad quality grass, dehabilitated land and uneconomic cows, various people grow crops which cannot be consumed on their own farms and for which they must find a cash market.  The time has come for the Department to be able to estimate, in a real way, what quantity of these particular types of cereal would be essential to prevent any danger of failure.  On that basis, they should be able to advise the farmer of the extent to which any crop might be grown with reasonable security in a year.  They should be able to cushion any farmer against economic shock caused by the collapse of any of his cash crops.</P>
    <P>I do not care whether Deputy Dillon was wrong in bringing in 16,000 tons of oats from Australia or whether Deputy Tom Walsh, the present Minister for Agriculture, was wrong in bringing in barley from Poland, provided those errors have taught us a lesson.  I think that the Department should be able to view the general problem in an objective way.  They should be able to provide, by way of storage, against possible shortages at the end of the year <Col N="1213" /> or during the period before the next crop will be threshed.</P>
    <P>It has been a difficult problem up to now.  The moment a situation arose in one area that created a problem there was an outcry and a scare, whether it was the problem of oats in Donegal or the question of ware potatoes in Louth a couple of years ago.  A scare, altogether out of proportion, was created in regard to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture will have to take responsibility for advising farmers as to what the market potentialities are in regard to such crops as oats, barley, fodder beet, potatoes or other root crops grown for feeding.  That, having been done, the farmer, by using his intelligence, will be able to assess what he should do in regard to his own immediate problem.</P>
    <P>The farmer in this country should learn quickly that it would be infinitely better for him, where possible, to grow a mixed type of crop on the land he is now putting under the plough, a crop which will be sufficient to feed at least the type of stock he keeps himself.  In the ultimate analysis, there is real truth in the statement that the best price he will get for those cereals is the return he will get from the bullock, the heifer, the pig, or the hens that are walked off the land.  By doing this he will exclude the various problems in relation to the sale of cash crops etc.  At the same time, he will exclude much of the loss that can be occasioned as between the primary producer and the ultimate consumer, when the middle man comes in.</P>
    <P>We will have to get the Department of Agriculture to adopt, as quickly as possible, a practical policy for the farmers in their separate areas.  Having done that, we should press him to allow that development to take place to the maximum.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister returned, I was dealing with the problem of milk and I said that I would have to come back and deal with it at length.  I will be honest with the Minister and recount for a moment what I said in his absence.  I feel that he went the wrong way about this problem.  I will not deny him whatever solace he might get from the difficulties he was in but expediency, <Col N="1214" /> in the form of a slight increase in the price of milk, was not a desirable way to deal with the problem nor, indeed, was it desirable to submit the problem to a commission who may report some 12 or 18 months hence.  The problem is one which exists in the immediate present.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that this was a matter in relation to which he could have used his courage.  He could have gone direct to the dairy farmer with the full magnitude of the problem.  He could have taken him into his confidence, and he could have avoided irksome commissions that may report too late to give any practical remedy to present problems.</P>
    <P>I would not for a moment suggest that the Minister could solve this problem by waving a wand, but I think he will have to get the farmers working on the basis that there is more to the problem than price.  I quite seriously suggest to the Minister that he should go to the dairy industry and explain that over a period he has to achieve three separate things. Initially, he will have to achieve a considerable improvement in the quality of grass and grasslands on which the cattle are fed.  He will have to achieve a considerable improvement in the quality and type of cow that is in the dairy herd.  He will have to step up the yield of that cow and lastly, he will have to make the price of milk economic as between the producer and the consumer in relation to what the average yield of his cow is.</P>
    <P>That problem was shelved.  I want the Minister to tell me, when he is replying, how he is going to counteract the extraordinary phenomenon that exists where heifer beef is more profitable to the farmers to be sold for the beef trade now than it is for the replacement of stock in milch herds. That is why the problem is of such immediate and pressing importance.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, by some action of his, arrest the danger that, when somebody comes back with a report that milk should be whatever price it should be per gallon, there will not be sufficient strength in the dairy industry of Ireland to carry on the dairying industry at all?</P>
    <P>Another one of the Minister's difficulties <Col N="1215" /> is that milk for purposes other than butter production is making a better price.  I do not know what the Minister proposes to do in the interim, but I will tell him straight from the shoulder that there is gross dissatisfaction because he has cast the problem into the melting pot of some commission.  Confidence must be restored in that industry.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to say that there are unprecedented quantities of milk being sent to the creameries at present.  We are glad of that. It has been an unusual type of season and I suppose, just as in the past when the Minister as a Deputy in opposition tried to blame Deputy Dillon for the bad weather, he will take credit for the good weather which has improved the milk supply to the creameries. The fact remains, however, that in view of the clash between the price of heifers sold for meat and the price of heifers sold for milk production, Professor Murphy may be bringing in his report at a time when the saving of the industry will require drastic action far in excess of an adjustment of prices.  I ask the Minister seriously to deal with the problem as it exists now.  No matter what Party is in office, those who are producing the milk and butter which the people require should get proper service from the Department of Agriculture.  But the agricultural community which is carrying the greater share of the burdens in this State is not getting the service or the attention which it deserves.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticism in this debate of an indirect nature, and in many cases of a poisonous nature, against a colleague of mine on these benches in connection with the question of beet. No matter how the Minister tries to malign Deputy Hughes for his stand in connection with the Carlow beet problem, it was not Deputy Hughes who made the mess of the problem. The Minister, instead of making veiled references to individuals, would serve a better purpose if he had ensured that all the play-acting, misrepresentation and codology that went on in the Beet Growers' Association was not allowed to arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> The misrepresentation was not on the side of the decent farmer who, having grown very extensive quantities of beet, knew that people were being herded in to grow beet at an uneconomic price.  When a responsible Deputy in this House who gives advice to his constituents can be hounded by impractical, useless farmers such as some of the Independent Deputies, Irish public life must be in a sorry state.</P>
    <P>It is amusing to find such a spirited defence of beet-growing being made by the Government Party.  We all remember the sneers and jeers which were cast at the establishment of the beet factory about which the Minister is now so perturbed.  The Minister can rest assured that when an increase in the acreage under crops is necessary he will get the full support of this Party as long as he gives the farmer a price commensurate with the cost of the labour entailed in producing these crops.  He will get that support without hesitation from Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry last year styled himself as the barley king who had done a great job.  The price of barley had been stepped up to an unprecedented height.  Why was it let go down this year and the Iron Curtain pierced to bring in barley at 30/- a barrel in excess of the Irish price?  I heard Deputy Corry here giving a display of vitriolic abuse with bags of this and that on the bench before him.  I did not, however, see him coming in here with samples of Polish barley to fight even for the re-establishment of the price paid last year.  I do not propose to rail against the Minister for that. If that mistake can be of value to the Minister to improve his approach and his Department's approach to the question of the quantities necessary to be produced, then, perhaps, in the long run, it was a cheap mistake.  But Deputy Corry cannot have it both ways by exhibiting bags of what he called Formosan sugar and then forgetting about the barley brought from behind the Iron Curtain and landed here at a cost of 103/- a bag.  Farmers in Deputy Corry's constituency and in my constituency who produce barley would be delighted to get 103/- per barrel for <Col N="1217" /> it.  In fact, they would be quite satisfied if Deputy Corry had been as vociferous in trying to maintain the price of 85/- as he has been in his condemnation of some of the things done by the former Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture was reasonably and fairly described by Deputy Cogan this morning as a conscientious plodder. If the Minister is a consistent plodder he can achieve a lot.  I am sure it is gall to Deputy Corry that the Minister has followed so closely the policy of his predecessor.  We must give credit to the present Minister, however, for the fact that when he saw the fruits of the efforts of his predecessor exhibited in a realistic way by the increased figure for exports this year, like a sensible man he said, &ldquo;I will get what kudos this expansion will give me but I shall not stop progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what battle went on between Deputy Tom Walsh, Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen as to who would be Minister for Agriculture but I think it is fortunate for this House that the least harmful of the three has emerged in the office.  I will say this in fairness to the present occupant, that at least he has the will to see the scientific side and the advisory side of the job of his Department improved.  I think that if the Minister for Agriculture perseveres in the line of giving an improved service to the agricultural community, in giving the best possible technical assistance to the farmer and making technical assistance and help available in his Department for the farmer, he will be doing a good job.  So long as he does not set himself up to be master of all, so long as he does not continue with veiled threats of compulsion or does not adopt some of the fantastic statements made by the alleged agricultural experts who are his colleagues, the Department will carry on successfully.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to come out into the open.  There have been veiled threats and positive threats by some of his minions, some of his potential successors that there will be <Col N="1218" /> compulsory tillage.  I want to know from the Minister, does he really think he can achieve his object by compulsion or is he going to persevere, as he commenced, in the idea of encouragement and leadership to the farmers as distinct from bullying and driving?  I make an earnest appeal to the Minister to persevere in the line of encouragement and leadership because the Irish people, no matter what section of the community they belong to, are not very easy to drive and it is impossible to bully them.</P>
    <P>There is an uneasiness, particularly among the farmers who are trying to get the quality and standard of their land improved.  Where they have fields that have been over-used, they are trying to give them a rest, and the Minister knows perfectly well that they badly need that rest.  Therefore I would suggest to the Minister that he leaves the problem of what must be produced to the farmer, to his loyal co-operation, as distinct from trying to bully him.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put a tooth in it. I think compulsory tillage is wrong. I think it is the duty of this House and the duty of every Deputy to fight for that principle, and to establish firmly the principle that the farmer is master in his own farm, that he is entitled to run that little farm as an industrial unit, according to his judgment, so long as he owns it.  I do feel that if the Minister clears the air once and for all of the threat of compulsory tillage, and comes out then with an appeal to the farmer to support him in whatever acreage of A, B, C or D crop he wants, he will get that support.  I am recommending that to the Minister very seriously.  He is a new man in office. His tenure of office has been to date rather undistinguished.  Maybe that is a slightly unfair criticism in so far as his predecessor was slightly more flamboyant and certainly more often heard.</P>

      <P>At least, I was proud that the Minister had the courage to come from behind his glorious silence and blow sky-high the lamentations and the moanings of some of his Cabinet colleagues about production. The stark real facts are that the fruits <Col N="1219" /> of his predecessor's policy will show in this year an improvement in agricultural production that will be the highest in living record in this country.  There is no gainsaying that. Maybe Deputy Cogan, excellent magician that he is &mdash; he made the Government &mdash; can conjure away the cattle that are going out on the hoof since Deputy Walsh became Minister, but I do not think that the Minister is likely to accept his figures.  He apparently wants us to believe that there was a drop in the number of live stock, in the number of pigs, the number of hens, and the number of all other animals until the change of Government 14 months ago, and then, as the previous Minister walked out to become Deputy Dillon in the Opposition, and as Deputy Tom Walsh walked in to become Minister for Agriculture in the new Government, the figures went up overnight.  I think it is mushrooms he is thinking of, not cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You are an optimist. At any rate we are very glad to hear the story the Minister has to tell.  I am not in the least bit anxious to detract one iota of credit from the Minister that he is entitled to.  So far as I am concerned, I do not care who does the work so long as it is reflected in an improvement in the standard of life of, and in a return to, the farming community of this country.  Our first duty is to them.  We have had to stand by, and sit by, in this House and see aid by way of subsidy given to this industry and that industry, to see this <Col N="1220" /> thing and that thing being built and bolstered up while less and less regard was being paid to the farmer from whom a real return could be had.</P>
      <P>I want to urge on the Minister that he should allow the activities of his Department to be speeded up to disperse the general belief rampant throughout the country, and that is certainly being felt in my constituency, that the Minister is putting the brakes on the land rehabilitation scheme and the ground limestone scheme.  I had to advert to this in a positive way by parliamentary question because there was slowness of deliveries.  I am glad to be able to tell the Minister himself &mdash; I went to the scene &mdash; of what was happening.  The opinion has got abroad and the feeling is still there that this Government is going to apply the axe to kill anything started by its predecessors which had achieved success.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister is anxious to see the land rehabilitation scheme go ahead to its maximum effort.  I would be anxious if he would go out in the open about it and push it to the full.  Having adopted the scheme, I would not mind if he were now to call it the Walsh rehabilitation scheme. I think there is sufficient in achievement in the idea of this scheme to put the name of many a Minister on the roll of honour in the farmer's mind. If the Minister wants to ensure his place on that roll, he should push ahead with the scheme as quickly as possible.  The technicians have improved it, and the Minister pointed out in his opening speech that the contractors have become more expert in the use of the equipment.  The capacity for expansion is bigger this year than in previous years.  The potential is there. Might I urge on the Minister to exploit to the absolute limit that potential in the coming year, and particularly between now and Christmas?  In that way, he could play his part in arresting the difficulties that exist with regard to unemployment in rural Ireland.  He would be able to keep people working at home if he were to get these machines working in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ground limestone scheme has <Col N="1221" /> presented difficulties.  The Minister is aware that I represent a very isolated type of constituency.  He will know that the necessity for rehabilitation is very urgent there because the holdings are small and the families are large. They are the type of people who need help.  I would urge on him, in connection with the ground limestone scheme, to devise ways and means of overcoming any difficulties that may exist in these isolated areas in regard to transport and distance.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to the main problems which have to be faced.  I suggest that, irrespective of politics, we have to get back to the question of what we should produce and what, generally and basically, our agricultural policy should be.  I feel that up to the present the Minister's Department has not given either the lead or the help it could have given in that direction.  I take the simple proposition of the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough,&rdquo; and add an additional one in the light of our present economics: &ldquo;Another henhouse,&rdquo; so that we may get a picture of where our agricultural strength is.  We have the land itself which must, in ever increasing quantities, produce all the essentials that go to feed the pigs, the cattle and the hens.  The Minister has the obvious duty of initiating and popularising certain types of new feeding that can be grown.  He will, of course, have to overcome a good deal of conservatism and of a non-desire to change.  In view of the unhappy experience we had during the international situation with regard to the cost of importing feeding stuffs, I urge on him to go on an all-out drive to ensure that we produce in our own fields all the feeding stuffs we need. All that is needed is to convince the Irish farmer that he can produce a balanced ration, whether it be made up of beet, oats, barley and other cereals and root crops, and that he can produce enough to make him completely independent of the whims and caprice of an international market.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister, in an honest way, that if he goes out on <Col N="1222" /> a campaign of that kind he is going to get every possible support from every member of my Party.  We want to ensure that there will be no difficulties which might operate in a month or two to eliminate whatever just profit the producer might be entitled to.  I believe that the Minister is genuinely <i>ad idem</i> with me on that line of policy.  The Department itself will have its difficulties.  Nobody realises that more than I do.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in dealing with this problem, he must expunge for all time the bandied threat of compulsion.  The farmer knows his farm.  Help him to know it better, and in that knowledge he can do better work on it.  That is the way to get the maximum effort out of it. I think that the Minister, in his heart and soul, believes that himself.  I suggest to him that he should try what I have suggested and keep trying at it. One or two years will not be sufficient, especially when the Minister considers the ravaging that was done to Irish land during the emergency.  The exigencies of the time may have demanded that, but now that we have the opportunity of doing something to revive the quality of the land the Minister should not allow various stupid statements to be made by some of his otherwise dumb back benchers, statements which give an ominous background to Fianna Fáil policy, that they are going to introduce compulsion.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with other problems that are more intimately constituency ones.  I welcome the enlargement of the Clonakilty insemination centre.  I am glad to see that it is going to extend further into my constituency.  I have given it already any assistance that I could in my public and constituency utterances.  I think it is going in the right way to improve what is the basic problem of dairying, the overall low yield of cows in a dairy herd.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan to-day entered into a kind of plea for another type of compulsion &mdash; that is, cow testing.  I do not know that to make it compulsory would achieve any great purpose.  I am quite sure that Deputy Cogan was only saying something that might make a headline for him somewhere when he made <Col N="1223" /> that suggestion.  I say to the Minister that I should like to see fair co-operation given by Deputies in this House to him to extend it in a voluntary way. I do not think we have done an awful lot or near as much as we could to break down the conservatism of the farming community with regard to this matter.  The farmer should ultimately be convinced that his best interests lie in knowing the real potential of his own dairy herd, because no matter what price might ultimately be fixed for milk on a costings basis no price for milk will make an uneconomic cow economic. The only way we can find out and weed out uneconomic cows is to expand and rapidly extend cow testing.  A fair amount of cow testing is done in my constituency.  I should like to see more of it.  I should like to feel assured, as I am sure the Minister and the Department would like to feel assured, that every cow in a milch herd is worth feeding.</P>
    <P>In general, there is a gradual passing of the unrest which the Minister, unfortunately, created by ill-advised talk in the novelty of his own Ministry. I suggest to him, as a rational being and as a sensible man, that he follow his new departure of steering his ship on the sea on which he finds it, improving where he may and in no way detracting from the work of the captain from whose hands he took charge. There has always been too much acrimony in this debate on agriculture. There has always been too much &ldquo;do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;do that&rdquo;.  It is our duty as a Parliament and it is the duty of the Minister, as custodian of the Department of Agriculture to ensure that the best we as a Parliament can give is given to the agricultural community, acknowledging, as I must, in conclusion, that to them and to them alone goes the major credit for our retention of our proud economic independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather impressed by the attitude adopted both by the present Minister and the previous Minister for Agriculture in their speeches in the House.  Both of them seemed to be quite complacent and <Col N="1224" /> quite satisfied with the position of agriculture in this country.  They were rather inclined to take credit for a great achievement and whether it was the responsibility of the present Minister or the responsibility of the previous Minister was the only point on which they disagreed.</P>
      <P>Deputy S. Collins has just told us that we have had an all-time record of agricultural production.  Anybody who has even glanced at the figures issued to Deputies will know that that statement is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not bank on sterling values.  Sterling is depreciating.  The volume of our production is not going up to the extent to which it should go up and it is not going up to the extent that it should make the Minister or the previous Minister satisfied with the position.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to raise is in connection with pigs and bacon.  As far as the pigs and bacon trade is concerned, the present position is causing producers to go out of pig production again.  A trade agreement was made some 12 or 14 months ago with the British Ministry of Food.  I asked the Minister, by way of parliamentary question, if he would make available to Deputies of this House the terms of that agreement.  The Minister replied that it was not the practice to publish trade agreements made with the British.  I think that that is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is extraordinary that representatives of the people may not get a copy of a trade agreement made by the Department of Agriculture and the British Ministry of Food.  To my mind this is a bad agreement.  As far as I can understand from the long and elaborate circular issued by the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the agreement provides that half the exports should be in the form of bacon at what is called the &ldquo;general import price&rdquo; in Britain.  It is quite an unsatisfactory price.  I think it is somewhere in the <Col N="1225" /> region of 263/-, and if we export over a certain target it goes up somewhere in the region of 300/-.  The pigs which we export on foot or that we export in the form of dressed pork are to be paid for at 2/6 less per score than is paid to the British pig producer.  If we could export our pigs even at 2/6 less than the British producer is getting for his pigs, we would get quite a satisfactory price from the point of view of the Irish producer.  Because of this ridiculous agreement, however, which will not be shown or published and which Deputies of this House are not permitted to see, every pig that is exported live and that is exported in the form of pork is to carry a levy to build up the price of the bacon exported by the bacon curers of this country.  I do not know what possessed anybody to insert such a clause in that agreement.  I am sure that it was not the British Ministry of Food: they did not care where they got the pigs or the pork so long as they got them.  The hidden hand of the organisation of the bacon curers was there in the Department. They were responsible for inserting that section into the agreement, and it has resulted in making the present arrangement for the export of pigs and pork quite useless as far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked a lot of sense last night when he referred to the position in regard to the price of hides. Everybody knows that there was a wholesale racket going on in the hide industry and in the tanneries of this country.  We had tanners who could buy their raw material at from 4d. to 8d. a lb. when their competitors had to pay up to 4/6 a lb. for hides. Not alone were they getting the higher price for the leather from the boot manufacturers in this country but they were exporting leather and they were actually exporting hides.  I mentioned already in the House a case where 14 lorry loads of hides were smuggled across the Border because the price here was pegged down to 8d. a lb. while the price across the Border was over 4/6 a lb.  Deputy Dillon referred to these matters and he referred to them at length.  Deputy Dillon related his remarks to the effect that the price of hides has on the carcase meat trade <Col N="1226" /> of this country.  I hope that the Minister will adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon of leaving a free market for hides in future.</P>
    <P>I agree with the other Deputies who found fault with the present Minister for importing malting barley and malt from Poland and found fault with Deputy Dillon for importing large quantities of oats from Australia. Some of that oats has come in during the term of office of the present Minister, but I understand that it was ordered before the present Minister took control and he had to accept supplies as they were delivered.  Nevertheless, I think it is a ridiculous thing for us to import malting barley from Poland at £5 3s. per barrel when Messrs.  Guinness could obtain all the barley they wanted at 84/- a barrel in this country.  Messrs. Guinness refused on innumerable occasions to take barley that was offered to them last harvest.  If at the end of this year Messrs. Guinness wanted barley they could get all the barley they wanted at 84/- a barrel.  It is wrong for the Minister to say that Messrs. Guinness could not get their requirements in this country.  Messrs. Guinness could get all the barley they possibly wanted at 84/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what happened with regard to the price agreement with Messrs. Guinness for next season's barley.  Messrs. Guinness made a contract to buy barley next season at 2/6 per barrel above the British price and for some extraordinary reason which I cannot understand Messrs. Guinness asked to be relieved of that contract that they had made.  It is very hard to see why Messrs. Guinness should apply on the one hand to be allowed to pay a very low price to Irish barley producers and at the same time for Messrs. Guinness to come to the Minister for Agriculture and ask him to permit them to pay to the Poles for barley &mdash; whether it was malting barley or not I am not sure &mdash; a considerably higher figure than they would pay for Irish barley.  There is something radically wrong.  There is something very suspicious about the whole manoeuvre.  I admit that I do not understand <Col N="1227" /> but I am very suspicious of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>With regard to wheat, the price the Minister has fixed is, of course, inadequate.  Even at 75/- a barrel which is the price Guinness intended to pay for barley this year, wheat is not as good a proposition as barley at 75/-.  You get 75/- for 16 stone of barley and 75/- for 20 stone of wheat. I think that the Minister could have got more wheat grown this year had he made available or seen that suitable supplies of seed wheat were available.  I know that the Minister will say they were available but I know there were a number of merchants who told their customers that they had no seed available for them and I know there were a number of extra acres which would have been sown in wheat had the merchants a suitable variety of seed available.  I understand the reason they had not the stocks was that there was some mix-up or some disagreement between the Minister and his Department and the seed assemblers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no mix-up between the Minister and the seed merchants.  We had 70,000 barrels of seed left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The seed merchants had no quantities of seed in Cork, and they refused a number of people, and I think on some other date I gave the Minister the names of the firms that informed customers that they had no seed wheat available.  There was also a circular issued by the merchants that they would not give credit for seed bought for sowing in the spring of this year.  That circular was freely circulated, and I think the Minister got a copy of it.  The Minister's attempt to solve the problem was quite ineffective. The whole business was too involved.  The solution was not acceptable to the merchants, and I believe that the seed was only available to a very small extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back again for a moment to the regulations regarding the export of pigs and bacon.  Under the present regulations a person must give 11 days' notice to the Pigs and Bacon Commission that they want to ship a <Col N="1228" /> live pig.  That makes it very difficult for a person who is in the trade to decide 11 days beforehand that he would have bacon pigs of a certain quality ready for shipment.  That is something else that should be altered in this trade agreement.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the land project, but we see very little work being done under that scheme in County Cork, particularly in cases where the farmer has applied that it should be done by the Department rather than by himself.  Very little work has been done in that county, and I hope that the Minister will take steps to ensure that a fair percentage of the money spent on this land reclamation work will be spent in the largest county in the State.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us whether he proposed to extend to other areas the scheme that is in operation in Bansha for the eradication of uneconomic cows?  I am very interested in that.  I went to Bansha to see how the scheme was operating there.  I found they were not so much concerned with the uneconomic cows as with the tubercular cows, which are, of course, not always uneconomic.  Is the Minister prepared to extend that scheme to other areas and is he prepared to finance the scheme in the same way as the Bansha scheme was financed?  I think it would be a good thing if we could eradicate all the uneconomic cows and pay the farmer a decent price for them.  The Bansha scheme cost the Exchequer nothing while giving complete satisfaction to the owners of the uneconomic cattle and improving the health of the cows in the area generally. I think the scheme should be extended to every parish.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the lime subsidy scheme.  I have complained before that this is wrongly labelled as a subsidy to farmers and it should not appear in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  It is a subsidy to Córas Iompair Éireann and Córas Iompair Éireann will not allow anybody to draw the subsidy unless he is is working for them.  Córas Iompair Éireann want the cream of the freight. They do not want to buy spreaders and spread lime on the land.  They want to get the subsidy when it suits <Col N="1229" /> them.  That subsidy is down in this Estimate as a charge against agriculture. It should be in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce as a further subsidy to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>The service in connection with soil analysis is too slow.  The farmer may apply to the Department to have his soil tested.  He will get no result of the analysis until his crops are set and, in many cases, harvested.  Something should be done to speed up that service and to make the information available to the farmer as quickly as possible so that he will be in a position to apply the requisite fertilisers at the proper time.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the growing expansion in industrial production and the lack of expansion in agricultural production.  Industry is producing in a very favourable market and industrial products are selling here behind the shelter of a 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. tariff wall, whereas agricultural production has to be sold at competitive prices and at lower prices than those prevailing across the Border or in the English markets.</P>
    <P>Since we have to produce in competition at lower prices than the producer in Northern Ireland and Great Britain receive, the Minister should make it his business to see that the raw materials for agriculture are made available at reasonable prices. There are certain raw materials for which the farmer has to pay through the nose.  There are excessive profits on practically every requirement that the farmer has to purchase from these highly protected industries at fantastically high prices in many cases.  The Minister should see that a standard of requirements is set out in connection with these materials, and they should be made available to the farmer at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister should exert all his influence to ensure that the agricultural industry gets representation on the various boards connected with it. There is a prices body dealing with the prices of various commodities.  On that there are representatives of all classes, but there is no representative of the agricultural community.  There is a <Col N="1230" /> body which deals with the costs of milk production, and on that there are representatives of the Prices Advisory Body.  There is a potato marketing board, composed practically entirely of potato factors who have no interest in the producers.  Córas Iompair Éireann handles all the agricultural traffic. That body has on it representatives of both brands of labour, representatives of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Clann na Poblachta, but no representative of the agricultural industry.  The Minister should make his weight felt.  He should ponder the words of the Tánaiste that there is a future, and the one future for this country is the development of agriculture over the next 20 years.  That was a change of heart on the part of the Tánaiste.  I hope the Minister will take full advantage of it and that he will see that his Department is treated as the most important Department in the State and not relegated, as it has been in the past, to third or fourth place.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister means well, and I am sure that, in any steps he takes for the advancement of our principal industry, he will have the full support of all Parties.  If there is anything to be said about compulsory tillage, it is the Minister who should say it, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not go round the country threatening compulsory tillage as he did recently.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has plenty to do in his own Department. If he has any time on his hands he should use it in trying to find a solution to the Córas Iompair Éireann problem and leave compulsory tillage to the Minister for Agriculture and his Department.  I hope the Minister will take immediate steps to do what his courageous predecessor did, and that is, to open the Border for the export of pigs, thereby preventing the pig industry from dying as it did before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been accepted by all that agriculture is the most important industry in the country, and consequently it is only natural that it should receive from the members of this House the close, careful and diligent consideration that it requires.  Opinions vary greatly as <Col N="1231" /> to the general prosperity of the agricultural industry.  You will hear one person say that the farming community are very prosperous at present, and another say that many farmers are not very far removed from poverty.  I believe there is a certain amount of truth in both statements, because conditions vary very much over different parts of the country.  It is a peculiar feature of this debate, as it is of other debates that I have listened to, that our agricultural problems are viewed in a general way, as if conditions were quite the same all over the country. Every one of us knows very well that agricultural conditions in this country, small as it may be in comparison with others, vary more than they do in any other country under the sun, and that what may be applicable to one part is not at all applicable to another.  That is the reason I say that the statement that farmers in some parts of the country are enjoying a prosperous period is undoubtedly correct.  They are enjoying a prosperous period, and, if they are not, it is definitely their own fault.  However, I have personal knowledge of a number of other farmers who work from one end of the week to the other, and who avail of every possible method to improve their position in life, but who, despite all that work and effort, find it very difficult to make ends meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief line in farming is accepted as being the dairy industry, and the Minister took a very deep interest, prior to his becoming Minister, in that industry and in the prices prevailing in it.  If statements made by him which I read in the Press are correct, he was of opinion that the price of milk was entirely inadequate and uneconomic. I believe that his viewpoint before assuming office was that if the price of milk was not considerably increased, milk production would rapidly decline and those views were in a general way applicable to the whole country.  Many farmers believed that, when the Minister took office, in view of those statements, the price of milk would be increased by at least 4d. or 5d. per gallon.  Even though one Deputy mentioned that the Minister's <Col N="1232" /> idea of an economic price for milk was 1/6 or 1/7 per gallon, I believe that at some committee of agriculture meeting, he gave the price as 1/9 per gallon.</P>

      <P>It is the people who interrupt who are the cause of any digression and not I.  The Minister agreed that what he quoted as an economic price for milk was 1/6 per gallon.  If anything less than 1/6 per gallon is uneconomic&mdash;the present price is 1/4 &mdash; the price prevailing at present must be uneconomic.  The Minister comes from one of the best counties in this country where the farmers enjoy first-class land, can keep cows giving a high milk yield and can get high yields from their crops, be they barley, oats, mangolds, potatoes or any other crop.  It is only reasonable to assume that if they throw off their coats and take the trouble to provide fodder and root crops for their cattle, they can grow sufficient of these for their purposes and get comparatively high yields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present price of 1/4 is uneconomic in the Minister's opinion, as it must be, unless he has changed his mind since becoming Minister, for these people, how much more uneconomic is it for the people on the other side of the picture, the small <Col N="1233" /> farmers living in the isolated areas of the country, the areas covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act, the areas known as the congested districts, where the position is quite the reverse?</P>
    <P>I believe that, in dealing with agriculture, we must separate these areas. What applies to Kilkenny, Limerick or parts of Cork does not apply in other parts of Cork, in Kerry, in Mayo, in Galway or in Donegal.  So far as the price of milk is concerned, I believe we must have some innovation.  There must be a change from the present policy if milk is to be produced at all in these congested areas.  I am of opinion that the best method to meet that situation is to give farmers living in these congested districts an increased price for milk or to give the creameries a subsidy to enable them to give the farmers an increased price for their milk over and above that prevailing generally in the country.  I put that viewpoint as strongly and as forcibly as I possibly could to the Minister when he visited the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  He agreed with it in principle, but felt that it was entirely unworkable in practice, because, he asked, how could you have a farmer in Kilkenny or East Cork getting one price for his milk and a farmer in the congested districts of West Cork, Kerry, Clare, Mayo and Donegal getting another?  It was entirely unworkable, and could not be employed.</P>
    <P>I see no difficulty whatsoever in putting my views into operation.  Take a man working here in Dublin, say, improving the roadway outside this House; he is paid a certain wage for that work.  A man in Cork City is paid another wage for the same type of work and a man in my area is paid a different wage again.  Although it is the same type of work, the conditions are different.  The same maxim should be applied to the production and price of milk, because conditions are different.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the difficulties under which small farmers who produce milk and sell it to creameries labour.  I am personally very well acquainted with those small farmers because I am one of them myself and I understand and appreciate the many difficulties with <Col N="1234" /> which they have to contend.  They can only keep cows which give a very poor milk yield.  No matter what artificial insemination stations may be set up, no matter what devices may be employed to improve the milk yield of our cattle, I believe that they will benefit those areas only to a very limited extent.  The land is unfortunately of a poor nature and only a hardy type of cow, such as the Kerry breed, will survive at all.  If you bring in to those areas a high milk yield type of cow like the Friesian or the Jersey they will live only for four or five months.  In many of those areas, therefore, in parts of my constituency &mdash; and the same would apply to districts in the West of Ireland &mdash; farmers can get a milk yield of only 200 gallons a year from their cows.  Deputy Corry stated some time ago that he gets from the worst cow in his possession &mdash; and I am sure he has up to 40 &mdash; 600 gallons of milk per year.  If his statement is correct his worst cow gives the same amount of milk as three cows in some of the isolated rocky areas which I know.  If the present price of milk is uneconomic or only barely economic for people with cows like his, how much more uneconomic is the present price for the people in those areas?</P>
    <P>A man who milks seven or eight gallons of milk per day has the same overhead expenses as the man who milks far more.  He must tackle his horse or donkey and set out to the creamery.  He has the disadvantage that because there is a small supply of milk in the area he must travel twice or three times as far as his well-to-do brother in another part of the country. I know people who get on an average eight or nine gallons per day or perhaps less and must go three or four miles to the creamery.  Then they must come back again and it is actually one o'clock before they are finished with their drop of milk.  What is their total return taking present figures for eight or nine gallons of milk?  It would be about 10/8.  Take a man in the same locality who is fortunate enough to secure work as a carter for the local authority.  During the same period with no cow at all he has earned about 10/6 &mdash; a guinea or £1 is the usual wage for a man doing that type of work. <Col N="1235" /> Without owning a cow he has in the time earned as much as the farmer.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there is no use in bolstering up uneconomic holders; that the only thing we will do by giving a subsidy is to put them in the frame of mind where they will sit still and continue to ask for increased subsidies.  That is not the position.  Those people who live in these areas at present, and will be there in the future, are labouring under tremendous disadvantages.  They do not work eight hours or nine hours a day.  I know many of them who work 12 or 13 hours a day.  They have no alternative, because they must keep hammering from morning till night, in order to keep body and bones together. Will the Minister and the Government disown all responsibility to these people?  What are they going to do with them?  Are they going to let the people from those isolated parts come here to Dublin, to Kildare, to Cork City, to Limerick City, or somewhere else looking for work?  No section of the community have greater cause for complaint than that section.  They are not getting the attention they deserve and which is owed to them.  They are not getting it from this Government, and they have not got it from any Government since the establishment of the State.  In view of the particular disadvantages under which they labour, if the present Government give them a subsidy of at least 3d. per gallon on their milk, I do not see why people in Limerick or Kilkenny should view it with disfavour, because the position which obtains in those areas is entirely and completely different.</P>
    <P>I want very particularly to impress on the Minister the need to do something for the small farmers of the congested districts.  He knows very well that their holdings are mainly uneconomic. There have been statements by many eminent men, including His Lordship, the Bishop of Cork, that rural Ireland is decaying, and that unless something is done for those districts, in the course of time they will not be inhabited at all.  Why should the statement of His Lordship, the Bishop of Cork, not be correct when <Col N="1236" /> those people are not getting the attention they deserve from the various Governments in this State since its establishment?  I am acquainted with the labour section in the City of Cork.  I know many of them intimately, and I know that many of them, through lack of employment or other means, find it very difficult to live, but I will say without fear of contradiction that I know several small farmers whose position is worse because, on account of their few acres, on account of their couple of cows, on account of their having the name of going to the creamery, they will not get employment on the road or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I am relating this to my argument in the debate.  I am making a claim for the small farmers of the congested districts. Those districts were clearly defined in the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  While I am not in favour of giving one section of the community any preferential treatment I say that there is no way of helping the dairying industry except by giving those people some subsidy, say 3d. per gallon.  It is costing £104,000,000 to run the country for the present year.  If my view were put into practice about £250,000 would meet the situation.  The Minister may say that any increase in the price of milk will bring about an increase in the price of butter.  Irrespective of whether it does or not, I will say here, as I have said in other places, that those people should have that increase for their milk.  It is not so long since we had an increase of 10d. in the price of butter without any advantage whatever to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard from Deputies that in Galway and Mayo people are not troubling themselves to keep dairy cows because, as the land is bad and with the present price of milk it would not pay them to bother going to the creameries.  That is not so in Cork, in parts of Kerry and in Clare, and when people are prepared to produce milk &mdash; as they are&mdash;and are doing their best <Col N="1237" /> to uphold the agricultural industry of the country, they should get special treatment.  In all the circumstances the best way to meet the situation is to give them 3d. per gallon extra on their milk.  We have a costings board to go into the price of milk.  The Minister named its members to-day.  I know that no more than Adam does any member of that board understand or appreciate the difficulties of the farmers in those congested districts to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a few months ago, in view of the extensive area covered by congested districts, if he agreed that it was only right and natural that some member should be put on the Milk Costings Board from the small farms in those areas.  The Minister took good care not to accede to such a request.  That only indicates in a clear way the trouble the Minister is getting from those people.  I know he puts very little value on them. It is all right for him &mdash; he has 300 acres on which to keep a few racehorses or other forms of making money.</P>

It is far more difficult for a man who is trying to make a living out of cows in West Cork &mdash; or in Tipperary, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of farmers all over the country who are not enjoying creamery facilities.  Some of them are in my constituency, living on islands and so on and have no alternative but to make butter at home.  I remember, during the time when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, that adverse comments were made by various members of the Fianna Fáil Party that home-made butter production had been killed by Deputy Dillon.  Fianna Fáil speakers paid particular attention to that point in the by-election in West Cork in 1949.  They took special care to send some member of this House of the Fianna Fáil denomination <Col N="1238" /> to every farm in the West Cork constituency where butter was being produced at home.  I know there was not a single farmer in West Cork producing butter at home whose name was not handed over to some representative or other and the home was then visited by a Fianna Fáil T.D.  For what business?  It was to find out how Deputy Dillon's policy as Minister was adversely affecting them, to prove that were it not for Deputy Dillon the price for the butter they were selling the shopkeepers would be 8d., 9d. or 10d. per lb. more.  That word &ldquo;pound&rdquo; was clearly emphasised. Some of them were such good mathematicians that they took pencil and paper and totted down the amount &mdash;&ldquo;How much butter do you make each week?&rdquo;&ldquo;20 lb.&rdquo;&ldquo;Then, 20 lb. at 10d. &mdash; 16/8; if you help us to remove Deputy Dillon by electing the Fianna Fáil candidate, your increase will be 16/8 per week.&rdquo;  They were saying that to the farmer who was making 20 lb. of butter.  Unfortunately for them and for the country as a whole, within two years Deputy Dillon was removed from office and the man who was so vocal about milk prices and the price of home-made butter and so much condemnation of the then Government came into office. He was in a position to deal with the causes.  At that time there was supposed to be no difficulty in finding a market for farmers' butter.  Fianna Fáil had the market, they said, and in view of the hardships, along with the market price they guaranteed a subsidy.  What is the position now, 12 months afterwards?  All those farmers in West Cork who were visited by Fianna Fáil T.D.s during the election campaign know the position very well. The price was never lower in recent years than it is now.  It is very difficult for many of them to find a market and the price now obtainable is 2/2 or 2/3 per lb.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister to-day at Question Time, did he consider 2/2 and 2/3 an economic price, he answered in a sharp kind of way: &ldquo;That is as good a price as we can get&rdquo;; and you could see by the looks of him that he might well have added that he did not give <Col N="1239" /> a damn, that it was sufficient.  That was the view I took, that he did not care.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil always hold themselves out as patrons of the man who makes butter at home, through no fault of his own, but because he is in an isolated holding or living on an island or where there are no creamery facilities and has no alternative.  Now that the Party opposite hold themselves out as patrons of such people, I want to know from the Minister, when he is replying or through his Parliamentary Secretary, what he is going to do for the numerous farmers all over the country who are placed in that position.  Are they going to honour the promises or the assurances given to the farmers in my constituency in that category?  They got something very different.  There was not one of them who was not visited and did not get a personal assurance from one Fianna Fáil T.D. or another that there would be a jump in the price of farmers' butter as soon as Deputy Dillon jumped out.  I regret that the Minister is absent now.  I am very doubtful if he is perturbed at all about this, but I am not saying that in any disrespectful way.  As Minister, he is doing this in a narrow, sectional way. All that is troubling him is the farmers in Kilkee, who have the advantage of good land and can keep greyhounds and racehorses, and have not much interest in producing milk.  I am sure more milk is produced and sold in West Cork, bad as the land is, than at Kilkee.  I can visualise going through Kilkee and seeing fields of bullocks or dry heifers and racehorses and greyhounds.  They are not the backbone of the country.  The man who has to go out on the land, take off his coat and work is the man entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to try, if at all possible, before the milk prices have completely flopped, to get the Dairy Disposals Board to extend the creamery facilities which they are giving in many uneconomic areas.  I should pay tribute to the Dairy Disposals Board because, irrespective of the many adverse comments made on <Col N="1240" /> that board, were it not for their being in operation, many of our people would be suffering considerably to-day.  In those congested isolated areas, private creameries or creameries operated by co-operative societies will not trouble their heads.  They know very well that in those areas the opening of creameries is more or less an uneconomic proposition.  I appreciate very much what the Dairy Disposals Board is doing for the farmers in the economic areas of the constituency I represent and, I feel sure, in the economic areas of other constituencies. It would be a great blessing if the board could extend its facilities still further, and take in parts of areas which are not already covered.  If they do so and if, as a result, their balance sheets at the end of the year show a debit balance, I cannot see any member of this House objecting to making up that deficit from the Central Exchequer.  It is due to the farmers, to those small people, to get that out of the Exchequer, seeing that a lot is being put into it by them at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane referred to the pig industry, and very rightly so.  I am particularly interested in the pig industry because there is not a farmer living within miles of me who does not keep pigs.  In some cases they keep perhaps only one or two, and in others nine or ten.  The pig industry at present is being very badly managed. If pigs are allowed, as they were allowed during a period during the régime of the last Government, to be exported <i>ad lib</i>, it may result in unemployment in the bacon industry and in a higher price for bacon.</P>
    <P>I would be the last person in this House to suggest that anyone should lose employment, but I do not agree that because there may be some likelihood of that happening the pig producer should suffer and pay the piper in full.  If pigs were allowed to be sold on a free market I am definitely of the opinion that, over a period of 12 months, the number of pigs would be at least doubled.  If that theory is correct, and I am confident that it is, it is only natural to assume that the consumption of pig feeding stuffs <Col N="1241" /> would double.  Therefore, the labour employed in producing feeding stuffs at various mills would double.  Instead of retarding employment, it would increase employment.</P>
    <P>I know that it is very difficult to give the pig producer a good price and to put a cheap rasher on the consumer's plate.  The two things are incompatible. People buying bonhams at fairs at £7 or £8, and buying feeding stuffs, as is usual at this time of the year, cannot make a profit at present prices.  I am convinced of that.  We must take cognisance of the needs of every section of the community and the pig producer is entitled to consideration as well as others.</P>
    <P>I think the price of pigs to the producer could be increased if there were closer examination of the methods adopted by the various bacon factories. I am of opinion, whether rightly or wrongly, that the pig producer could get a better price for his pig without increasing the price to the consumer, because I believe that there is too wide a margin between the price paid by the consumer and the price paid to the producer.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at question time to-day, pig producers in my part of the country are finding it very difficult to get a market for their pigs at the present time.  I know of people who were told that they should wait a fortnight before the factories would be able to take their pigs.  As a result, when the pigs were brought to the factory they exceeded the weight which would qualify for maximum price and they had to be satisfied with a reduced price.  Pigs are paid for on a graded scale.  I know a woman who sent a pig to a factory near my place a few weeks ago.  The pig weighed 20 stone and she got back £16 or £17 for it.  I would like to know if the shopkeepers who bought that pig as bacon got the benefit of the greatly reduced price paid to the woman.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with a person who deals in a very big way in the bacon trade.  He told me that although he purchased a good deal of bacon from bacon factories he never got a reduction, that the bacon is sold <Col N="1242" /> at a flat rate, irrespective of the weight of the pig.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that consumers are not getting the benefit of the reduced price paid by the factories for pigs, particularly pigs over 11 st. weight, it is time that the Government inquired into that matter. If they did that, they would get useful information.  It would help to do away with the racket &mdash; I do not want to use that term, but, having regard to all the information at my disposal, I am convinced that it is the term that is applicable &mdash; that is being carried on by some of these bacon factories at the present time.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>In many farms, pig rearing is the second sideline.  Encouragement should be given by the Government to pig producers, and they should get as high a price as is possible for their pigs. Every penny that comes into this country, from England, Northern Ireland, America or any other country, adds to the general wealth of the nation, and, apart from the home market, every effort should be made by the Government to provide a remunerative export market for pigs.</P>
    <P>I believe that the pig producer could get an increased price at the present time without a proportionate increase being passed on to the consumer. Undoubtedly, there is something very strange in the affairs of the pig industry as carried on by some of the bacon factories that I know of.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fairly conversant with the position in the poultry industry.  At least, he told us he was when he was in Cork.  Poultry-keeping is the third sideline in agriculture. Many people, particularly people living on small holdings and cottages that have small areas of land, keep poultry in a very big way.  It is only right and just that the Government should give them all the aid they can to make it an economic proposition.  As one who is very conversant with that particular line of business, I am doubtful that that aid is being given in the best possible manner at present, and I am very doubtful if the advice given to poultry keepers by the various instructresses could not be improved. As we have a large staff employed in <Col N="1243" /> this country to give advice on this matter, a better policy should be drawn up.</P>
    <P>People should benefit equally, and lectures should be given in different centres and in different parishes.  That is only being done to a very limited extent having regard to the number of instructresses available.  The position is that a few people are being visited regularly, while the great majority are scarcely getting any assistance at all. I feel that the method of giving expert advice with regard to this particular industry could definitely be improved. Whether or not this advice is given, the poultry industry could be put on a sound, paying basis.  If Irishwomen who engage in poultry-keeping have a thorough knowledge of their subject, they can make a great success of it without getting any expert advice whatsoever from instructresses.  I could add to that that I am doubtful if they are of much advantage.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to a very important industry which affects a few constituencies in this country.  I am referring to flax growing.  As we know, flax is a very suitable crop for certain land in this country, because it will grow on land which would give only a very poor yield of other crops.  Flax is grown extensively in many areas and particularly in the one I represent. The acreage under it increased considerably within the last five or six years, and many of the farmers in my district expected that it would become one of their principal sources of income.  All went well until political racketeering was resorted to.  When the Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government was unable to get the price for flax which Government agents promised, many people were very disappointed.  The result was that the Minister fell in for a lot of adverse comment which I honestly say he did not deserve.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the flax industry, as well as in other lines, Deputy Dillon's policy as Minister for Agriculture, was a very good one, and the sound results of that policy are showing themselves in many ways at the present time.  When the people were unable to get the price for flax which <Col N="1244" /> Government agents promised private negotiations were entered into and certain prices obtained.  Last year the price averaged 52/- or 53/-.  This was the highest price ever obtained, and people engaged in this industry were delighted.  If that price had been maintained this industry would have expanded enormously.  I committed the error this year of following the present Government's advice &mdash; advice which has had a very adverse effect on many farmers in my area.  Immediately after he was appointed to office, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, accompanied by some members of his own Party, toured West Cork in connection with the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  They tried to advise people how best to make a livelihood, and a good deal of their advice centred around the growing of flax. Farmers were told that the crop could be favourably grown, and that those farmers who were already engaged in the industry had received a good price. I took part in the campaign for flax growing, and I urged farmers, publicly and privately, to grow it.  The Parliamentary Secretary, and those accompanying him were quite positive that they knew everything about flax growing and that the price obtaining when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture would hold.  Some farmers fared very well; they let their land out in conacre at a good price to agricultural workers and farmers' sons who had no land of their own.  The price tumbled down to 20/- a stone.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture to give us his views in this House on this very important question.  I believe there is only a market for some 8,000 acres of flax this year, and I am very perturbed about that.  I notice that there were 11,947 acres grown in this country last year.  As there will be a market for only 8,000 acres this year, according to the Minister, if people kept to last year's figure, there would be no market, if the Minister's contention is correct, for almost 4,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I can quite easily imagine what some people, including some of those in my own constituency, would have to say if such a condition of affairs existed when <Col N="1245" /> Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government. They would not say that the position was due to world conditions.  They would simply blame the inter-Party Government.  That type of dirty policy, however, is not being carried on by the people I represent.  They know very well that it has arisen mainly due to conditions over which we have no control.  However, at the same time, having regard to the fact that we advised people, at least in my own constituency, to grow flax and that they would reasonably infer from our statement that, if they grew it, the price would be somewhat similar to last year's price, some action should be taken to improve the position.</P>
    <P>On average, there are 45 sts. in an acre of flax.  Therefore, every acre of flax grown this year would mean a loss of £45, which is a princely sum.  Due to those losses, I feel that the flax industry will come to an end.  It has been of a marked advantage to the farming community, and many of them have reaped a good harvest from it.  If this industry disappears, what will happen to all the workers employed in the flax mills which were established in the areas producing this crop?  The number of workers directly employed in this industry in West Cork is fairly extensive.  As regards the flax industry, whoever is responsible for muddling it, I believe the Government did not do very much about it.  If, as a result of this muddling, the industry is wiped out, what will become of the farmers who are looking on this crop as their principal source of income, and what will become of the workers who are entirely dependent on it for their livelihood?  That is the problem with which we are faced, and I am bringing it up in this House with a view to impressing on the Minister to do something to improve the price of this crop, if it lies within his power to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not think I would be far off the mark were I to ask that those people should get some kind of a subsidy. They were asked this year to grow the flax under false pretences, if you like. They were given to understand, not in a direct way, but in a most definite <Col N="1246" /> indirect way that the price would continue. As a result, the people who grew flax this year will lose, on an average, £40 to £45 per acre.</P>
    <P>I think it would be out of place for me, coming as I do from an area where there are islands, to finish my contribution to this debate without referring to the agricultural position of those islands.  There is no doubt but that the islands of this country should be put in a different category.  They should be segregated from the mainland in so far as their dealings with the various Government Departments are concerned.  The islanders labour under many disadvantages owing to the decline in the fishing industry and the agricultural industry in so far as it applies to the islands.  The islands have no creamery facilities.  The people have to convert milk into butter and sell it at 2/3 a lb.  If they have a pig for sale, they have to sell it at about £2 or £3 less than its market value, owing to the fact that there are no local facilities for selling it.  The pig has to be transported not only by lorry but also by boat.  Having regard to all that, the islanders are labouring under definite disadvantages.</P>
    <P>I plead for them here irrespective of whether or not it means an increased burden on the Exchequer.  Something must be done for those island people. Not so long ago I was on one of those islands and I noticed that there was a definite absence of any people between the ages of 18 and 50.  There was a number of elderly people and people in the youthful group.  I am of the opinion that, unless something special is done to improve the lot of those people, inside 30 years island life will have disappeared altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not see that they are going to reap any benefits from the agricultural policy now being pursued.  These people are, if you like, the Irish-Irelanders. In some of these islands Irish is the language mainly used. These people have no foreign blood in them and are descended from the Irish for generations back.  They are the pure, old, Irish stock and they are entitled to better consideration than they are getting at present.  I would make the strongest plea in my power to the Minister to take special cognisance <Col N="1247" /> of the plight of those people and of the many disadvantages under which they are labouring and either by way of subsidy or some other suitable method he may devise give them the advantages they do not enjoy at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would not like to finish without touching upon the subject which Deputy Lehane mentioned, the lime question.  Everybody knows that if agricultural production is to expand the land must be fed with fertilisers of various types.  One of the fertilisers which is considered to have a marked advantage is limestone.  Due to the fact that many farmers are very far removed from lime kilns, the price of lime was prohibitive in the past.  Consequently, they were not able to buy any lime for their land.  There were adverse comments on the matter and we had a comment from Deputy Corry at meetings of the County Cork Committee of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think the greatest tribute should be paid to the former Government for devising and bringing in a system whereby farmers in isolated places could get lime at the very same price as the man living a mile away from the kiln.  Take the case of a farmer who lives in Allihies in the County Cork.  He is 80 miles from the nearest kiln.  As a result of the scheme devised and brought in by the former Minister for Agriculture, he can get lime at 16/- a ton, the very same price he would pay for it were he living on a farm adjoining the kiln.  That is a marked advantage to those farmers.  It is only right that I, as one of those representing some at least of the farmers, should voice my appreciation of that scheme.  If the present Minister copied something from that scheme and applied it in other directions, it would be a great advantage.</P>
    <P>For instance, he could try to improve the position of people in the congested areas and in the islands. This system whereby lime is delivered to farmers at a flat rate is undoubtedly a marked advantage to those living in remote areas who could not, owing to the prohibitive road transport costs, avail of lime at all.  I believe that farmers all over the <Col N="1248" /> country are thankful for that scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not present as I believe he has in mind &mdash; and it seems to be the opinion of the experts in the Department &mdash; the discontinuance of the sand subsidy scheme as operated at the present time in some counties.  I am only aware of the operation of this scheme in a limited part of Cork and Kerry.  I believe I am voicing the opinion of almost 100 per cent. of the farmers in my constituency and, I feel sure, in the adjoining County of Kerry, where conditions are somewhat similar, when I say that this subsidisation scheme is a marked advantage for farmers for years past.  They believe that applying sand to the land leads to very good results and that it increases the yield of cereal crops, wheat, oats, barley and rye, and is very conducive to the growth of grass.</P>
    <P>Each farmer in the areas in County Cork, where this scheme is in operation at the present time, receives a subsidy of 3/6 per ton up to a maximum of £2 16s.  As many of those farmers live far away from the seashore, they find that the cost of transporting the sand is very high and this subsidy of £2 16s. is an inducement to them to draw the sand.  It also gives the sand to them at a reasonable price.  The sand itself is cheap enough to buy but the cost of transporting it is very high.  The subsidy brings down the cost of transport. I think it is only just that that subsidy should remain.  It does not cost very much and the Department contributes only 50 per cent. of the cost.  The subsidy should be continued because farmers are availing more of sand now than ever before.  I am sure that at least eight times as much sand is put out on the lands of West Cork than is covered by the subsidy, a clear indication that there is a good case for the retention of the subsidy.  It induces farmers, many of whom are in uneconomic holdings, to continue drawing sand and applying it to the land in order to improve yield.</P>
    <P>The question of rabbits is also important.  What is to become of them? The rabbit trade has grown considerably in spite of the fact that large numbers of rabbits have been caught in recent years.  The death rate among <Col N="1249" /> rabbits should be higher in recent years than ever before but for one reason or another, instead of their numbers decreasing, it appears they are on the increase.  Even though they are destructive they are also a source of remunerative employment to a number of people during the winter months.  Last year I believe there were 6,000,000 rabbits exported and they brought into this country a sum of £1,100,000.  That is no small sum of money.  I should, however, like to see those pests wiped out completely because the destruction which they cause is more costly than the income which they bring into the country.  I ask the Minister to endeavour as early as possible to find a market for these rabbits, because if he finds a good market &mdash; I believe there were some difficulties in regard to that in the latter part of last year &mdash; it will induce people to go all out to kill these rabbits and probably in the course of time they can be completely eradicated.</P>
    <P>As to the seed distribution scheme, that scheme I believe costs the Exchequer £17,000 a year.  These seeds are made available to small farmers who deem it necessary to have a change of seed and whose circumstances would not warrant them paying the market price for these seeds.  We all know that seed oats and seed potatoes reached a prohibitive price last year. I believe the areas in which this scheme is operating are entirely too limited. Instead of a sum of £17,000 being provided for this scheme in the Estimates I should like to see another nought added to that or the amount trebled anyway.  There is no doubt that it is desirable to give to people on small uneconomic holdings a change of seed. If, owing to their limited financial resources, they cannot get that change they will have to be satisfied with their own seed and the results will not be very good.  I hope that in determining policy for the coming year the Minister will bear in mind the great value of that scheme and the advantage it would be to include further areas and to provide more money for its operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the main point which I raised in this debate as I believe it cannot be <Col N="1250" /> emphasised too often, and that is the plight of the farmers in the congested districts.  There is a great difference between the man who has a farm of a couple of hundred acres of first-class land, who can produce crops in abundance, and who is able to improve the breed of his cattle so as to get an average yield of 700 gallons of milk from them and his unfortunate brother in the congested districts who has to work from morning until night to make a living.  Many of these small farmers must continue producing milk in order to eke out some kind of a livelihood and the Government should do something for them.  The last Government did not improve their position to any great extent although they did provide creamery facilities in many isolated areas.  These areas would not enjoy these facilities now if it were not for the activities of the former Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The only possible way to help these small farmers in the congested districts is to give the creameries operating in these areas a price for butter which would enable them to give an increased price of at least 3d. a gallon to these farmers for their milk.  I believe they are entitled to that.  In view of the different conditions under which milk is produced in various parts of the country, I believe that we will never make any headway if we view that matter in a general way.  Even though the country is a small one, the conditions which obtain in one area do not obtain in another area.  The only possible way we can help these small farmers is to put them into a class by themselves and give them the justice to which they are entitled from any Government.  I hope they will get that, as I have no hesitation in saying that they are the backbone of the country.  They are the people who, if they are needed for any particular line of action whether national or otherwise, will always be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing I am convinced of after listening to this debate is that if Deputies from the South do not get something done about the question of milk they will all have milk fever.  For the 15 years which I have been here, every year on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture we <Col N="1251" /> have heard about this milk question from southern Deputies.  For ten years Deputy Madden has been telling us that he has been selling off herds. If that is the case, it is a poor look out for the lot of us.  I hope the Minister will do something about this milk question and settle it once and for all. Deputies from other parts of the country are tired listening to Deputies from the South talking about this question.  I agree that they have a good case and the Minister should end the trouble now once and for all.</P>
      <P>This morning we had the Minister for Agriculture and the former Minister throwing bouquets at one another, while during the last three years there was nothing but turmoil in this House when the Agricultural Estimate was being debated.  From the time that Deputy Smith left office and Deputy Dillon took over we had nothing but a racket and absolutely bombastic nonsense. I am glad that we have bowed to the inevitable because this thing must stop some time.  We have had a fairly reasonable debate on the Estimate to-day and yesterday and certainly that is a change for the better.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that, having travelled along a weary road for 30 years trying to find a policy for agriculture, Fianna Fáil have arrived back on the road we were travelling all the time.  Now the two Parties are to jog along together. It has taken a long time to teach Fianna Fáil that lesson and I hope they will continue to profit by it.  The Minister has been very vocal in this House in criticising the former Minister, Deputy Dillon, and I must really give him credit for swallowing his pride and accepting lock, stock and barrel the policy of Deputy Dillon.  That was a big thing for him to do and all credit to him for doing it.</P>
      <P>I come from a county which is in the more or less happy position that it never has to look to any Department of State for anything.  We are a mixed farming and middle-class farming community. We work for our living without worrying about what Government is in office.  The people of the county carry on without worrying when a change of Government takes place.  As I say, we go in for mixed farming and we live fairly well on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> When I here one side of the House trying to claim from the other side that they are responsible for the healthy position of agriculture, and for the fine prices which the farmers are getting, I would ask Deputies to throw their minds back seven or eight years and try to remember that at that time there was a poor unfortunate half-madman named Adolf Hitler.  I hope he is happy to-day, but had it not been for him, our Irish farmers would be still in misery and degradation.  It was the European war that put our farmers on their feet, just as the first European war put them on their feet over 20 years before.  The Irish farmer got little or nothing from this House; it was always what happened outside that helped him along. The farmers had always to wait for something in the nature of a blood bath abroad; although it meant death for thousands of other people, our farmers generally got on their feet as a result of it, but they got very little assistance from this House.</P>
    <P>Having been here for the last 15 years, I am satisfied that there is no proper plan for agriculture in this country, and that the Department is not able to put its finger on the sore spot at the right time.  At one time we experience a great scarcity of produce, then there is a plentifulness and a glut in supplies.  From what we hear to-day, there appears to be over production of pigs at the moment, and something must be done to deal with it.  I want the Department to be in a position at any time to put its finger on the sore spot.  When Deputy Dillon was in office, and the farmers were faced with a falling market for pigs, because of an alleged glut, he soon solved the situation by opening the Border, and he saved the farmer.  I ask that something similar should be done to-day, so as to prevent a glut of pigs, and so that the farmer will not have to say: &ldquo;To hell with pigs. I will rear no more of them.&rdquo;  Then after four or five years the farmer will be begged to go back into production again, with probably a repetition of the vicious cycle.  Again, I suggest that the Department should always be able to put its finger on the sore point, so as to deal with these alternate <Col N="1253" /> periods of plenty and scarcity, which are the cause of the whole trouble, as they arise.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot in the past about compulsory tillage.  Is it not a fortunate thing that we had not compulsory tillage for the last two or three years?  If we had, we would now be piling up a huge surplus of barley, oats and other crops and we would have no granaries to store them.  Even last year, I got scores of letters from people in Meath asking me to get the Government to do something to secure sale for their oats which was piled up in damp sheds and was beginning to sprout. Would it not be a nice state of affairs if we had compulsory tillage and found ourselves in a much worse position?  I think that there should be a publicity department attached in some way to county committees of agriculture so that they would be able to get their finger on the sore spots because it sometimes happens that while some districts are crying out for oats and barley there are other districts where there is a glut of these crops.  There should be some system of co-operation so as to make the needs of these districts known to one another.  That is the job of the Department of Agriculture and that is what they are paid for doing.  What we want is leadership.  I am glad that we got that leadership three years ago.  Deputy Dillon gave us that leadership and it is going to go on, no matter what Government is in power.  We got down to rock bottom in these times.  Previously the Minister for Industry and Commerce was killing agriculture and there was a weakness there all the time.  I am glad that Deputy Dillon when Minister throttled the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and secured for the farmer the position in the life of the country to which he is entitled, in other words, first place. I hope that the present Minister will see whenever Cabinet conferences take place that the farmer is always entitled to first consideration.</P>
    <P>Our efforts should be directed towards the development of mixed farming, towards the encouragement of the farmer who tries to produce a little <Col N="1254" /> of everything, so that if one line of production fails, he can switch over to other lines.  If we were to depend on the single-line farmer, every one of us would have been sold out long ago.  It was because we had not a plan for a real mixed-farming economy in most parts of the country that, in the past, we were up for a few days and down for several months.  We were mostly in the doldrums.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there is a great price, to my mind too big a price, for cattle.  It is the big export of cattle that is saving this country. There is not the slightest doubt about that.  These exports are necessary to counteract the adverse balance of trade.  Yet 20 years ago, if you said anything in praise of the cattle industry to a supporter of Fianna Fáil, he would be horrified.  The cry then was: &ldquo;The bullock for the road and the land for the people.&rdquo;  At present there is hardly a Fianna Fáil farmer with a few pounds in his pocket who is not running up and down the country to buy white-headed cattle.  He will not tell his neighbour when he hears that there is a calf for sale in a certain place lest the neighbour may get there in front of him.  I am glad they have seen the foolishness of their ways in the past and that they realise that the good old bullock has been a life-saver for this country on many occasions.  I should not like, however, the people to become too crazy in regard to cattle production.  I hope they will not neglect other lines of agriculture in order to engage in the cattle trade, for, should the prosperity of the cattle trade last for many more years, some people will grow grass up to their hall doors.  It would be a sorry day for this country that that should happen.  I say that our ideal should be a mixed farming economy, that we should have balanced farming, adopt the happy medium and have a little of everything. I would ask the Department to keep a close eye on developments in this regard.  For at least the next three or four years the cattle business will be a right good business.  Britain is being devastated by the foot-and-mouth disease and the cattle population in Europe has been almost wiped out.</P>
    <P>Thank God we have escaped so far <Col N="1255" /> and I hope we shall continue to do so. I hope however the prosperity in the cattle trade will not go to our heads and that we shall not rush into the cattle production to the exclusion of everything else.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would do something to ensure that an adequate supply of fertilisers will be made available for my county.  People in that county are crying out for fertilisers. Most of the land in that county is very rich but the ranchers in the days of compulsory tillage grew wheat on the same fields year after year with the result that the land is now in very bad condition.  Unless something is done to provide sufficient fertilisers there can be no hope of restoring fertility to the soil.  I hope, furthermore, that the Minister will be able to get fertilisers at a reasonable price.  We do not want it at a cheap price but we want it at a reasonable price so that we shall be able to get a return for our expenditure.  I know of some men who tried to grow wheat without fertilisers and they got a very poor return.  They got only three, four or five barrels to the acre whereas the man who could get fertilisers was able to get 18 to 20 barrels to the acre.  If we are able to feed the land, the land will feed us.  If we do not get fertilisers at a reasonable price we shall not get the return from tillage that we expect.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to see that adequate supplies of fertilisers are made available.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the starting of industry in this country meant the death knell of agriculture, which over the last 25 or 30 years has been allowed to be carried on in a sort of haphazard way.  The whole cry during that period, from platforms and elsewhere, was for the starting of factories in towns and cities.  That resulted in drawing the boys and girls away from the land.  The industries got big protection. They were behind a gilded wall and could not fail.  They were able to pay a handsome wage to many of the boys and girls who were drawn off the land.  On the land, the workers could not get 50/- or £3 a week.  Those <Col N="1256" /> who have remained at home are up to their knees in mud and dirt, while the girls working in the kitchens have none of the amenities to be found in the cities and towns.  The boys and girls who came to the towns and cities were having a delightful time.  Their friends at home become dissatisfied, and say they, too, will go to the towns and cities where conditions appear to be so good.  They say: &ldquo;To hell with this, I will make for the cities, too.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the boys and girls who had jobs in the towns and cities became disemployed they did not go back to the country, but hit for London.  After a time there they were able to come home well decked out with plenty of money in their pockets.  Their friends at home, in the same old tatters, become dissatisfied and decide to go across to the other side.  There is no one left in many homes except the slowest and most stupid member of the family.  He cannot get married because he has his old father or mother sitting in the corner, who refuses to give up the place to him.  He has to wait until he is bald and grey before he can think of getting married.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the land is being depleted of young people?  As long as the conditions are such as I have described them, the young people will not remain on the land.  No matter what may be said in this House, from platforms or anywhere else, the drift from the land will go on.  There will be no improvement until we make agriculture the pivotal point for everything in this country.</P>
    <P>As regards agricultural machinery, its production here is protected by high tariff walls.  The result is that we have to pay colossal prices for plough points and for every article of agricultural machinery that we require.  It is beyond the capacity of the people to pay the prices which they are being charged to-day.  It is pure robbery.</P>
    <P>I agree that it was right to start industries here, but what I object to is the mad and crazy manner in which it was done.  The people concerned did not give two hoots so long as they got an industry going.  If we had had a long-term plan before we started out on the establishment of industries, the position would not be what it is to-day. <Col N="1257" /> Our main industry is agriculture.  That has been so for thousands of years and that will continue to the end of time. The main concern should be to get from the soil all the food that we require for the people.  Agriculture provides a most beautiful life for a man if it is carried on in a balanced way.  We have had 30 years of native government, and during that time agriculture never got its rightful place. I believe in the industrial revival to a reasonable extent, but not to the extent of destroying agriculture and of depleting the land of its people.  I know that what I am saying may be quoted by the journal of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I will be denounced for saying it, but I do not care who denounces me so long as I stand for the farmers and the man working on the land.  I do not give two hoots for a lot of those people who live in the towns and cities who may denounce me.  We have the grandest little country in Europe.  It has escaped many of the devastations which have over taken other countries in Europe in our time, and yet we are allowing the land to be depleted of its people.  We are doing that ourselves. We cannot say now that Britain is doing it.  There would be no need for any man to go to Britain if this Government or the last Government had done its duty.  There is plenty of money in the country, hundreds of millions of it, and plenty of work for all our people on the land and in the bogs.  There is no need, either, for our young people to be going to the town and cities.  The one thing that will save the country is to spend money on the land.</P>
    <P>What is the good of freedom if the people are drifting away from the land?  For years before we won our freedom, we spoke of all the wonderful things we would do if the control of our destinies was in our hands.  We have had control for 30 years, and what a despicable sight the whole countryside is to-day.  The small farmers are getting out as quickly as they can.  I see that a Senator has an office in London with big placards asking the English to come over and buy our farmsteads &mdash; going around with those Englishmen and selling those homes to <Col N="1258" /> them.  It is a crying shame that Ireland should sell her destiny in that way.  I would ask the Minister to put his two heels in the ground and carry on where Deputy Dillon left off.  I ask him to improve on what Deputy Dillon did if he can and not to go back on the wrong road which had been travelled over the last 30 years.  Give the people a chance.  In regard to the poultry industry, it was said that Deputy Dillon killed it.  That was a damned lie. We all know what killed it &mdash; the dirty mean way that the Minister before him acted.  He went over to England and took a bribe of £1,000,000 to start a poultry industry here.  What did he want £1,000,000 from England for? We had our own millions of money. England gave us the £1,000,000 to start an industry for all classes of poultry and eggs.  Everyone got into poultry, rich and poor, but when they had the cockerels for sale England said: &ldquo;I will get back my £1,000,000 now very handy; I will depress prices&rdquo; and she did.  She got the poultry at her own price and got back her £1,000,000. The Irish Paddy Smith, the patriotic Irishman, skulked over and took that £1,000,000.  Deputy Dillon did not do that.  Why should we skulk over and take money for anything?  We have enough money ourselves to build up the poultry industry.  That was done by the republican Deputy Smith.</P>
    <P>We have the same position with regard to fruit-growing.  For the last 15 years I have been listening to the East Meath Fruit Growers' Association talking about the price of fruit.  I do not know whether it is a real association or not, but hardly a year passes that they are not crying out for something to be done to enable them to get a price for their fruit.  We have the same cry this year.  Deputy O'Reilly and myself were asked to do something about it.  The fruit was rotting in their hands because the jam manufacturers would not pay them the price they expected to get.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Department did not answer a communication from the county committee of agriculture, and the result is that those people in East Meath have been left to fend for themselves. The fruit is rotting, and they <Col N="1259" /> have been let down by the Department. Can we be told whether it is worth while having fruit grown in East Meath or is it a joke?  The people there should be told either to cut down their fruit trees and burn them, or else something should be done to help them.  I do not want to be running between East Meath and the Dáil about this, and then find that the Minister can do nothing.  Of course, the time to have a matter like this attended to is when trade agreements are about to be entered into with other countries.  A trade agreement made with England is the cause of all this trouble.  The pulp is coming in here at a cheap rate from England.  That has been done under a trade agreement. Until the people in East Meath are told the truth in a straightforward way, this bickering and grumbling will continue.  If the Government cannot stop the importation of this cheap pulp let them say so; tell the people in East Meath months ahead of the season.  There is no use in anyone saying: &ldquo;I know Tommy Walsh; he never let us down.  I can get in by the back door, and I will get it solved for you.&rdquo;  I think no one can solve it unless some steps are taken to deal with the jam manufacturers.  There is no use in knowing the Minister because he can do nothing.  It was Tommy this and Tommy that, but the whole of it was tommy-rot.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Department of Agriculture have started a Government farm in my county.  Royal Meath has waited a long time to get something. It is an artificial insemination station. I believe it is very important and that it is doing well.  I hope that it will be operated in the same manner as it was operated while Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.  I have heard a rumour in that connection which I hope is incorrect.  It is to the effect that the Minister was only a few weeks in office when he visited that farm and brought one of his colleagues with him. That colleague brought an exporter with him.  They inspected the herd of heifers, and it is alleged that they took out 40 of those heifers at £45 each and that they were exported to Britain at £65 each.  I want the Minister to reply <Col N="1260" /> to that allegation.  If it is true, then it is a crying shame, and there should be a Government inquiry into the matter.  It is almost unbelievable that men would be allowed to go in and select some of the people's property and make a large sum of money overnight out of it.  I want the Minister to confirm or deny that report.  If he confirms it, then I shall see to the matter further.</P>
    <P>I have also heard that before Deputy Dillon left office there was an arrangement that Father Hayes of Bansha would get a certain number of cows to replace old cows which he was to give back.  The system then, as I hope it still is, was that if you had good healthy old cows that were not good milkers you could hand them over to the Department of Agriculture and get in return good in-calf heifers.  Father Hayes had to pay full price for those in-calf heifers and the old cows were not taken in return.  That is what I am told, and I hope the Minister will reply to it.  If my information is correct, then it means that the Minister is going back on Deputy Dillon's scheme, which was a fine scheme.  The old cows were taken in and fattened off.  I understand that they were making as good a price as the in-calf heifers and that there was no loss to the Department.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal of talk about committees of agriculture.  All that is between Deputy Dillon and the Minister is the parish plan.  I am a member of a committee of agriculture. The present Minister stated that his idea is to have more staff officers on the committees.  I say that that would be a waste of public money. We should reorganise our committees of agriculture on a basis of justice to the Irish farmer.  Committees of agriculture are started and kept in being by political Parties.  In most cases they are a racket and a ramp.  They are a handpicked clique, though I do not say they are bad agriculturalists.  They will do what is planned behind closed doors before the meetings take place.  I want first-class representative farmers on these committees, and I do not care whether the farmers are elected or coopted. All I desire is that they will <Col N="1261" /> represent the people and not the interests of any political Party.</P>
    <P>The committees of agriculture are not suitable from the point of view of the working of the parish plan.  If you try to work it through them the scheme will be a failure.  I know most of these committees, and they are the same throughout the country.  Once the election is over and they get a majority they decide amongst themselves to keep out this person or that person because it suits their interests to do so.  Some of the best men in my county were kept out of these committees just because they are men of integrity, character and ability.  They are men who would fight for agriculture, and who would never mention politics, but just because they would not eat out of the hands of the others they are kept out of the committees. Under Deputy Dillon's plan, three parishes were to be combined, and the people were to be allowed to work in their own interests.  Father Hayes has the scheme in operation, and it is a gigantic success.  I hope that at the next election Father Hayes will be able to come into Dáil Eireann and put his plan into effect.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon were Father Hayes then every three parishes in Ireland would be grouped overnight with the consent of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the other Parties.  Deputy Dillon, who has to endure the hatred and venom of Fianna Fáil, formulated that plan.  It is a crying shame that when a man formulates a good plan for agriculture it is not accepted for political reasons.  I hope that Father Hayes will be able to come to this House and will make an impassioned speech from the Front Bench on the subject of agriculture in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are losing millions of money because we have not co-operation throughout the country.  We have hand-picked cliques of different kinds. I want to see justice and fair play.  We cannot make progress unless we have clean politics and we have not clean politics to-day.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the Dillon plan&mdash;or, if he prefers to call it so, the Father Hayes plan&mdash;and to put it into effect. The parish is the pivot of this country. <Col N="1262" /> I hope that all this bickering and nonsense will cease and that we shall get a balanced plan for agriculture.  If we get a balanced plan for agriculture and if our people are happy and contented on the land then we shall carry industry on our shoulders and bring this country to peace, plenty and prosperity. We cannot have that ideal situation so long as we have the old game of seeing who will get to the Front Bench and of keeping the others out.  The late Deputy Hogan said that he wanted to see one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.  Fianna Fáil are now shouting the same slogan.  We want to see two blades of grass growing where one grew yesterday.  We want to see double the production on the little farms.  We want to see our rivers and drains cleaned so that the Dillon scheme can be put into effect.</P>
    <P>The Dillon scheme has hardly touched my county.  I know a man who has his work completed for months, but it has not yet been inspected, although he is crying out for his money and although we have three or four officers in my county.  There are three or four farmers who live not far from my home.  They have 40 or 50 acres of reasonably good land which could be made into top-grade land under the Dillon scheme, but they cannot do it, because the Act was not put into operation.  A ditch on the land of a man near me is blocked.  His scheme is ready to be put into effect.  He has men employed, but he can do nothing, because the people in charge tell him: &ldquo;Until you have a flow for the water, your scheme cannot take effect.&rdquo; Consequently, the men are idle, and cannot continue with the work.  The money being spent on the scheme is the people's money, and it is going to waste when the scheme cannot progress. The farmers concerned are paying their way and giving employment, and they are as much entitled to respect as anybody else.  The county council should spend £50 on that little drain that will relieve the difficulties of four or five farmers and give them a chance of getting on with their work. These farmers want nobody to help them.  They are going on with the work as far as they possibly can with <Col N="1263" /> their spades and shovels.  They are doing the work themselves and making a good job of it, but they are held up because of the obstructions I have mentioned.  Matters of this kind are pressing on the farmers and represent a considerable burden on them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to settle down, to forget the past and improve on the Dillon scheme if it is possible to do so. I do not care whether you call it the Dillon scheme or the Walsh scheme.  If the Minister can improve on the Dillon scheme, let him call it the Walsh scheme next year.  I hope that the Minister will go further and make it a better scheme.  I want to see every penny of that £40,000,000 spent on Irish agriculture, and when it is spent, I want to see this country as a land flowing with milk and honey and to see the stream of people, of boys and girls, who left the rural areas in favour of the cities and towns, flowing back to the country.</P>
    <P>I hope they will stay in the country instead of coming to live in the cities and then tripping across to England. The country will be saved, must be saved and can be saved for each and every one of us.  In order to reach that happy position it is necessary that all this bickering should be stopped.  Let us have clean politics, clean Parties and let us give credit to every side if they have done something worth while instead of condemning everything whether it is good or bad.  Deputy Dillon was hounded for three years although he was carrying out his duty as Minister with energy and vigour.  He was showing the truth and the light but Fianna Fáil, outside of assassinating him did almost everything that could block him in his efforts to put Irish agriculture in a prosperous position.  He is a big man and a strong man.  He has the roots of Irish nationalism in him.  If he had the opportunity once more of being Minister for Agriculture he could be relied on to do his utmost for the country.  He does not give two hoots who stands in his way and if the present Government do not do their duty Deputy Dillon will be there again and Dillon will be the word and Dillon will be the man.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon did not correct that statement, and he was in the House, when it was made here to-day by Deputy Cogan.  The scheme was put into operation in Ballybeg, and the farmers started getting their ground limestone from Ballybeg. There was no Government scheme, and there were no Government proposals in regard to ground limestone during the whole of that period until Mr. Miller insisted that some of the millions they were getting from America should be spent on subsidising lime for the Irish farmer.  It was then the scheme started.  What was the attitude adopted towards the plants that were producing the lime and spreading it on the farmer's land?  I have here the <Col N="1267" /> Official Report of 18th April, 1951, when I raised the matter here.  The fact was that, though there was a subsidy scheme in operation at that time, as ordered by Mr. Miller, that subsidy scheme was debarred to any farmer who took lime from the Irish Sugar Company.  One could go to Córas Iompair Eireann and get ground limestone from Córas Iompair Eireann down to one's farm, heeled out on the side of the road, and one could then with one's shovel, shovel it into a cart and take it out and spread it on the land.  One dare not ask Córas Iompair Eireann or the Irish Sugar Company to come along and take that lime, which they were producing themselves, put it into their own spreaders, and bring it out and spread it on the farmer's land.  One had to pay the full 30/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, Sir.  The first thing that happened in connection with barley was that for a number of years the Beet Growers' Association negotiated the price of barley with Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and Son. That condition of affairs continued during the war.  I endeavoured on a few occasions to get the barley grown by contract, so as to get rid of the objection by the Government to the payment of a high price for barley, for fear it would interfere with the growing of wheat.  I failed in that.  In 1948, there was a change of Government and Deputy Dillon made accusations against the previous Government with regard to their action in controlling the price of barley during the emergency. He was then asked if he would withdraw the control from barley.  It was pointed out to him &mdash; he had stated that the farmers had been robbed of some £2,000,000 &mdash; that it would mean that they would get close on £1,000,000 back. He refused to withdraw the control, and he fixed the price at 50/- per barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That price was fixed on 29th July, 1948.  Representatives of the beet growers the following morning had to meet Messrs.  Guinness to fix the price. They met Messrs.  Guinness with Deputy Dillon's 50/- rope around their necks.  Despite that, we extracted from Messrs.  Guinness for the following year a price of 57/6 per barrel for barley with a guarantee that the price would in no case be less than 2/6 per barrel over the prevailing price in Britain.  We also succeeded in getting a contract clause with Messrs.  Guinness providing for the growing of barley under contract.  The following year, the price went down and we got <Col N="1271" /> 54/6, but, in the case of the 1950 harvest, Messrs.  Guinness found that the price in England was higher and we had to get an increase of 2/- per barrel; but immediately that bargain was made, the very same game was played as that which was played in regard to oats, an example of which I gave to Deputy Giles.  The bargain was made in the last days of July, and, in August, the game started with the importation of 66,000 cwt. of foreign barley.  In September, the importation was 105,000 cwt.; in October, 159,000 cwt.; in November, 254,000 cwt.; and so on, down to the following June.</P>

Other maltsters through the country had their stores filled with Deputy Dillon's barley.  One of these was the Cork Distilleries Company, who opened at 57/6, the price agreed on by us, paid that for six days, closed down for three days, and reopened at 50/-, with their stores packed with foreign barley brought in by Deputy Dillon, then Minister for Agriculture, who was supposed to be the protector of the farmers.

      <P>We succeeded, under the agreement last year, in getting as high as 84/- per barrel for malting barley. We made an agreement with Messrs. Guinness last November at the basic price again of 57/6 per barrel, plus my half-crown, which gave the 84/- of the year before and up along for the other years.  In February last, Messrs. Guinness asked to have the agreement reconsidered and asked to meet us on the matter.  We went to meet them, and they offered, instead of 57/6 basic, a fixed price of 75/- per barrel for the barley.  They were informed that the matter had to go before the Beet Growers' Association Committee to be considered by them and decided, and that they would be told the decision on the following evening.  The Beet Growers' Association met and, by a majority, decided that the bird in the hand was better than the one in the bush, and they accepted the 75/-.</P>

      <P>For the information of Deputies, I personally moved that we hold Messrs. Guinness to their agreement and that proposal was seconded by Deputy Desmond Lehane.  We were beaten on a vote, majority rule prevailed, and that was that.  We have <Col N="1274" /> other gentlemen, however, who consider that we are getting far too much for it.  I allude to the young farmers. I have here the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i> of Saturday, July 12th, and here is what they say about the barley:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The damage done by the thunderstorms to my wheat will not be evident till harvest, but not so in the case of a friend's corn.  Attracted by the price offered for this year's malting barley and being well in with the manager of a local malt-house, and thus able to get contract for whatever acreage he required, my friend sowed no other corn but Spratt-Archer.  Though lodged crops are supposed never to break a farmer, the corn in this man's manured ground shows every sign of breaking his heart when it comes to harvest.  Though hardly out of blossom yet, it looks like nothing so much as a choppy sea, lying crisscrossed every way, with odd pieces sticking up like stooks.  This won't be the only piece of badly lodged Spratt-Archer in the locality this year.  In view of the `luxury price' offered for malting barley, many farmers, having got over the initial difficulty of getting a contract, chanced growing it in fields which, four years out of five, would give a badly lodged crop.  Already, it seems as if the gamble won't come off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic law of supply and demand has been tampered with frequently of late years.  While it is easy to apparently justify these attempts to modify it, the fundamental law has a most unpleasant habit of reasserting itself.  An example of this is to be seen in the agreement which the Irish Sugar-Beet Growers' Association made with the maltsters and distillers last spring.  The Beet Growers' Association, of which I am a member, are to be lauded for their efforts to obtain better prices for the farmers' crops.  Yet the success which has crowned their efforts to get a better price for malting barley has created serious difficulties.  At 75/- per barrel, the price agreed upon between the Beet Growers' Association and the maltsters and brewers, <Col N="1275" /> there are too many farmers wanting to grow too much barley for too high a price.&rdquo;</P>

The contract is of great importance, as barley grown under it will be 50 per cent. higher in price than the same barley grown outside it.  That will show you the value.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to answer Deputy Sweetman on his point about the agreement.  Before the agreement and contracts were made, the manner in which barley was purchased by the maltsters was that you took your barley, threw it in to him in September and on Christmas Day or a couple of days before he told you what price you would get for it.  That is how you stood at that time and the price he was prepared to pay was 12/- per barrel. That is the difference between our contract system and what this young child wants to get back.  I take it he is a young fellow, because he belongs to the Young Farmers.</P>

      <P>I notice that this year there is a largely increased acreage of feeding barley being grown.  I want at this stage, now, before the harvest, to point out to the Minister that whilst it is most advisable that we should grow the food required for our people and our animals, we do not want from the Department this season the old yarn we used to get in his predecessor's time: &ldquo;Walk it off the land.&rdquo;  There are grain belts in this country.  You have counties and portions of counties where grain for other counties that cannot produce it can be grown.  It is a question as to whether you will have it grown here or grown by the foreigner.  The present price of Milo maize is £32 per ton, with every prospect of increases in that line.  I suggest to the Minister now that it would be worth his while to issue a little word of advice to the &ldquo;Get rich quick&rdquo; gentlemen in the grain trade as to the price that will be paid for feeding barley and oats after this harvest.  On the result of this harvest depends whether that green belt is going to continue growing feeding barley or not. I think this is the proper time and place to give that advice.  If we find a repetition of the position that obtained in 1948, or if we find a beating down in the price of the feeding barley grown here at home to take the place of foreign Milo and foreign maize, then the farmers next year will be depending on foreign Milo unless they grow it themselves.  That is only fair advice from a Deputy representing one of the grain belts concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not start off on these things by saying: &ldquo;Oh, it is Irish&rdquo;, and then another fellow says: &ldquo;There is a lot of moisture in it&rdquo;, and a third says: &ldquo;20/-&rdquo;.  It is time that game stopped &mdash; and if it does not stop, the organised grain growers will take steps <Col N="1279" /> to stop it.  We are determined that the farmer who grows the crop is at least going to get a fair price for it.</P>
    <P>The next matter is the position of this Department of Agriculture of ours. I have noticed that every Minister who ever went into that Department in a very short period got the Scotch bull outlook in it.</P>

      <P>The beef bull&mdash;some of you heard of him&mdash;the kind of mongrel misnamed in this country the dual purpose animal.  It is all very well for Deputy Giles and others like him who want cheap bullocks to mock the farmers producing milk and say: &ldquo;The southerners are kicking up, we hear nothing here but shouts from the southerners about the price of milk.&rdquo; That is a happy position for Deputy Giles and others like him, who would like somebody else to milk the cow and rear the calf.  Of course, Deputy Giles would like that calf to be a Whitehead so that he could have beef.  That is a very nice picture.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that it is high time that the gentlemen in Deputy Giles' country and any other ranchers learned to keep a few cows themselves and, if they want beef bullocks, let them produce them and not have a policy in the Department of Agriculture which is ruining the milk yield.</P>
      <P>I see from some of the announcements that have been made to us that an artificial insemination station will be established in Clonakilty, that it will provide for the Cork milk area and that the bulls to be kept there are Shorthorns and Whiteheads.  I would like to know from the Minister if he can adduce any reason why his Department would not keep in Clonakilty some bull of a milk-yielding breed. What objection has the Department to keeping a Friesian bull there?</P>

      <P>We have seen this policy carried on by the Department for a long number of years and it is high time that it is ended.  Fancy putting into that insemination station, for the service of dairy cows, in an area that is purely milk producing, Whitehead bulls for beef so that the two Deputies up there and their constituents will have handy stores and the farmer producing milk for the city will find himself with a cow that yields 250 gallons or 200 gallons. Before I am finished with the Deputies to-night they will be pretty well satisfied.  They will learn to milk a cow.  It will not be 40 bullocks and a goat that I will see on their farms.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that there was a reduction during the past two years in the number of in-calf heifers. In 1951, the number of in-calf heifers reached the lowest figure&mdash;3,000 lower than in 1939.  The number was falling steadily ever since Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, made the famous announcement of the bob a gallon for five years.  Immediately that announcement was made, it had an effect on the number of in-calf heifers. In 1948 we had 128,000 in-calf heifers; in 1949, 123,000; in 1950, 113,000, and in 1951, which is the last year given in the White Paper, the number was down to 80,117.  Unless Deputy Giles can find some means of inseminating something else to produce calves, if he has not heifers, he will not get the calves.  In 1939 there were 83,810.  There are now 80,000.  There was practically the same decline in milch cows.  Between milch cows and in-calf heifers, the number has declined by over 100,000 in two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who knows anything about dairying would know that milk production was bound to be up this year in the season that we have had up to the present.  I am suggesting to the Minister that if the milk situation is left in its present position until the costings board has given its decision, which will take a pretty long period, as we know, it will then be too late to save the dairying industry.  I suggest that this is something about which the Minister should take early action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer to the position as regards the beet industry.  We have <Col N="1282" /> heard many complaints, both inside this House and outside it, about this industry.  During this year an organised campaign was carried out against the growing of this crop in many counties.  I admit that we had a pullback a month afterwards by the various county committees of agriculture which had been stampeded into this ramp.  There was a general rescinding of decisions and resolutions by them, but a considerable amount of harm had been done at that stage.</P>
    <P>I have with me a statement which appeared in the <i>Tipperary Star</i> of the 1st March, 1952, which says that the North Tipperary Committee of Agriculture rescinded the resolution that they passed at the last meeting against the price of beet, and that the resolution was passed under a misapprehension. This campaign was widespread and did an enormous amount of damage to an industry that has earned the support of every farmer, and I have heard various complaints about it.  Resolutions complaining of the action of the Beet Growers' Association in regard to the price of beet were passed by Carlow, Kilkenny, North Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford County Committees of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and demanding £6 a ton for it in some cases.  While I do not want to hold up the House, I will read an article which appeared in the <i>Nationalist:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;North Tipperary County Committee of Agriculture, at Thurles on Monday, rescinded a resolution passed at the last meeting from the Borris beet growers expressing dissatisfaction with the Beet Growers' Association in accepting a price for this year's crop, the charge at the factories for pulp and manures, and asking that the price should be increased by £1 per ton.</P>
      <P>The committee admitted that they had been misled, and at the close of the meeting a vote of thanks was passed to General Costello.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You had gentlemen who never grew beet coming in there and advising farmers of the price they should get for it.  You had that deliberate campaign carried on.  I do not want to go so far as to mention names, but there <Col N="1284" /> is no doubt about the fact that a campaign was definitely and deliberately carried out against the growing of beet.  We have got in the Beet Growers' Association what the milk producers of this country have been seeking for seven or eight years at any rate, namely, that the cost of production be found and that, on that cost, they should get a fair profit.  That has been done.  A certain number of areas in this country which were far away from the factory were being bled for the benefit of the areas beside the factory.</P>
    <P>The year before last the agreed price per ton for beet with a 15½ per cent. sugar content was 92/6.  That is agreed upon by everybody as being a fair price.  The growers signed their contract at 92/6 per ton and that was the price they were entitled to under the costings, that much and no more.</P>
    <P>It so happened that at the end of January, 1951, due to the importation of an enormous quantity of foreign sugar, the Beet Growers' Association considered it a good opportunity for getting a little more.  We then had an interview with the sugar company and got an increase even though the majority of the beet growers at that time had signed their contract and were satisfied with 92/6 per ton.  We got an increase of 7/6 per ton over and above the contract price.  On the same day, we got an increase of 2/- per ton bonus on the previous crop so that beet growers got roughly 9/6 per ton over and above what they were entitled to on costings.</P>
    <P>Knowing the manner in which Córas Iompair Éireann runs transport in this country, it is practically impossible for any negotiating committee to know what freight charges are going to be. We had an increase that year of 16½ per cent. in freight costs on beet.  When we met the sugar company last year in regard to the question of price, we were anxious to end some of the anomalies that existed.</P>
    <P>One of those anomalies was that you had farmers 30, 40 and even 80 miles away from the factory growing beet and paying as much as 14/- per ton more for the transport of their beet than the men who were living near the <Col N="1285" /> factories.  These were getting 14/- per ton less for their beet than the men living near the factories.  In an endeavour to end that, the price having been fixed at what we were exactly entitled to on beet costings, we went to General Costello with a proposal that we should get free freightage.</P>
    <P>We got that free freightage.  Apparently the only objection raised at one of these meetings was that the Carlow people would get very little benefit because they lived near the factory. They wanted an addition to the price without considering the man who was living far away.  We had to consider all sections of our growers.  That was the reason for the change so that, where the company were paying 4/6 subsidy in 1952, they will now be paying an extra 4/6.  Where the sugar company were paying up to 19/10 per ton freight they will now be paying an extra 12/10 per ton on that beet.</P>
    <P>Those are just two instances of how the thing works.  In addition to the 16½ per cent. imposed, another 5 per cent. will have to be added to Córas Iompair Éireann freightage costs this year.  That is an increase of over 21½ per cent. in the cost of freight on beet.</P>
    <P>The agreement further provides that the beet will be taken free from the nearest railway station for the farmer. That makes every man alike except the man who has several miles to go to a railway station.  Growers who are more than three miles from a railway station in addition to free rail transport on beet from their nearest railway station will get a further benefit by way of freight subsidy on the net factory weight of beet delivered from their pick-up point by the shortest route to their nearest rail station.  Those who are over three miles from a railway station will get 4d. per ton.  Those who live over four miles will get 8d. per ton and those who live over 12 miles will get a subsidy of 3/4 per ton.</P>
    <P>Those are the extra benefits that the beet growers of this country will receive this year in addition to getting the cost of production plus a fair profit. Those are the conditions under which we hope to see grown in this country the full requirements of the nation's sugar.  I will leave it to those who conducted the campaign against that <Col N="1286" /> and who endeavoured to sabotage that industry to consider their position now.</P>
    <P>Those very people signed contracts in January, 1951, at 92/6 per ton and were quite satisfied with that.  They received, on the 29th January of the same year, a gift from the sugar company of 9/6 a ton.  But because the unfortunate man living far away from the factory who was, in some cases, as I have pointed out, 14/4 a ton worse off in the price of his beet than they were, was being relieved of that extra burden, those gentlemen went on strike and reduced their acreages.</P>
    <P>As I said, this will have a serious effect on the position with regard to our sugar supply for next year.  The campaign was deliberate, led in many cases by gentlemen who came to this country under the new plantation system from Great Britain, some of them only six months resident here, and who became chairmen and secretaries of farmers' associations, protesting against the price for beet.  It is a rule in this House not to mention the names of individuals and I shall not do so.  If any Deputy wishes to see the names, I have them here.  But I certainly object to this kind of deliberate campaign against an organisation of farmers who have done their best for the beet growers.</P>
    <P>I have heard certain individuals and, in some cases, Deputies object to the costings.  I am proud to say that these costings were produced by representatives of practically every Party in this House.  On that costings board with me were the late Deputy Jim Hughes, Deputy Lehane, the present Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Beegan. You had representatives of all Parties working out a system that would prevent the constant wrangling that was happening every year and injuring beet growing.  These costings were accepted by all.  Why, then, have we this filthy campaign?  I should like to pass from that as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>That is the general opinion in Cork.  In fact, they call him &ldquo;Dillon's fly.&rdquo;  The trouble is that farmers in Cork County last year lost over 50 per cent. of their wheat.  These were not isolated cases; it was general. We appealed after the last harvest to the Government to give some compensation to these farmers, but we were met with a deaf ear.  We were told that these midges came in cycles, that if they were there one year they would not be seen again for five or ten years, but they are worse this year than last year.  Farmers who sprayed their wheat against midge, thanks to the advice given which was appreciated, found that operation most successful. That operation cost roughly about 30/-an acre.  If the advice of the Department's special genius were carried out, it would cost £3 10s. an acre.  I am suggesting now to the Minister that he should take that into consideration between now and harvest in seeing that something additional is given on the price of wheat.  If Milo maize, not <Col N="1289" /> ordinary maize, is worth £32 a ton and if you pay £30 a ton for wheat, is it any wonder that a large quantity of wheat will be converted into animal feeding?  That is the point I should like to impress on the Minister, that if the mongrel stuff, nigger corn&mdash;and remember it was displayed over there for the benefit of this House a few years ago &mdash;if that filthy stuff has to be purchased at £32 a ton and the farmer has nothing else to feed to his cattle but that Milo maize and he knows that he can flake wheat and that it is as good as cotton meal, is he going to send his wheat to the mill at £30 a ton?</P>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that he should improve on that price.  Any Deputy here who got this sheet and who sees here the reduction year by year&mdash;366,000 acres in 1950 and 281,000 acres in 1951&mdash;any Deputy who will take into consideration the dangers under which this country must constantly lie in regard to bread for our people, will agree that there should be a price paid for the grain to make bread at least as high as that for the grain to make beer.  Instead of the price being £30 it should be, roughly, about £32 10s. 0d.  I am suggesting to the Minister that it would pay him and it would be an added incentive to the farmer who found within the past month that he had to rush off to his merchant, get his D.D.T. spray, get his horse and cart, go out and pull it through his fields and spray his crop against midge, in order that the bread supply of the country might be secured.  He, at least, is entitled to a decent price for that crop.  I think that is only justice and I would appeal to the Minister to see that he gets that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stepped in here last night specially to listen to Deputy Dillon.  I wanted to see how Deputy Dillon would act and I cannot say that he was at his best.  It struck me that the result of the by-election had a very depressing effect on him.  I wanted to see how far Deputy Dillon had reverted to the old style that he used to display here before he was placed in the responsible position of Minister.  I found that he had gone back about 50 per cent. to it. He was 50 per cent. serious and 50 per <Col N="1290" /> cent. the irresponsible playboy we used to know here for a number of years.  That was my decision on him.</P>
    <P>I have just made a note here which would be interesting in regard to the sales of lime from Ballybeg.  In 1949-50 the sales were 23,000 tons; in 1950-51, 21,000 tons, and in 1951-52, 91,000 tons.  I think that is a distinct proof of the anxiety of the farmers in Cork County to get lime out on the land and it is a definite justification of the action we took in 1947 in advising General Costello to start this scheme.</P>
    <P>I have listened to other Deputies here from time to time.  I heard Deputy Seán Collins this evening speaking for an hour on another hare that these gentlemen over there have started&mdash;compulsory tillage.  He was appealing to the Minister not to have compulsory tillage.  That is about as good a hare as the hare that was started during the elections by Deputy Dillon about the tax on cattle.</P>

To our amazement, we found that there was no creamery butter exported to Antwerp.  I have been wondering where this creamery butter came from, which Deputy Flanagan said was being sold at 1/3 a lb. in Antwerp less than it was being sold here to the Irish people.  Would the Deputy tell us where that butter came from or was it Irish creamery butter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It covered a number of different aspects of the work of the Department in which many Deputies <Col N="1292" /> will be interested.  There is one particular aspect of agriculture in which I am vitally interested.  It was not touched on in any way.  I refer to the position of that vast category of people who come under the heading of agricultural workers.  So far, in this debate, there has not been, as far as I know, any mention made of agricultural workers.  Since I became a member of the House I have noticed that, when this Estimate is being discussed, with the exception possibly of two or three Deputies, the members of most Parties manage somehow to forget the existence of agricultural workers, and to forget their importance to our agricultural economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this Estimate provides an opportunity each year for a re-hash of what was said the previous year, with one or two changes: that what was said last year was a re-hash of what was said the year previous, with one or two small changes. I think it is a safe bet to say that, if one were to dig up the debates on this Estimate going back over the last 20 years, the speeches made on it would be found to be substantially the same as the speeches we listened to last night and to-day, and what we will be listening to probably next week, with of course, the one difference in the changing circumstances which time brings about.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it is worse than foolish for political Parties, when approaching this tremendous problem of Irish agriculture, to proceed on the general assumption that once they are in opposition and some other political party is in power, everything must necessarily go all wrong, but that when they are in power, and the other political Party is in opposition, everything necessarily is going all right. That is the essence, I suppose, of party politics.  It is also the essence of futility.  That particular attitude amongst our political Parties has, in my view, led us over the years down a cul-de-sac policy in relation to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a lecture delivered recently in Wicklow by a learned gentleman who lectures in Dublin University. He is a Master of Arts, a <Col N="1293" /> Doctor of Literature and a Master of Science.  He was speaking on the changing structure of Ireland's economy.  The lecture was given under the auspices of the Barrington Trust, in co-operation with the local Vocational Education Committee.  He said many things with which we probably would disagree.  The lecturer did provide some interesting facts in relation to agriculture and the development of agriculture.  One of the most amazing and revealing facts which he brought out, and propounded at that lecture was this, that in the past 15 years we have lost 110,000 people on the land.  In other words, 110,000 people have left the farms of this country and gone, largely into industrial employment in this country or across the water or in some other country.  If that is what has been described as&mdash;the phrase has become so hackneyed that one is almost sick of hearing it&mdash;the flight from the land, it is a very serious thing.  I do not believe that the political Parties generally have yet developed an agricultural policy which will even partially prevent that drift from the land, and the reason why they have not such a policy is because of the stress and strain of party politics.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies, when thinking of this question of agriculture which has so many facets, to look at it from every pont of view, and try to see not alone what is best for the farm and what is best for the farmer, with a family, who employs no labour, but also to try to get the point of view of the man who works for wages on the land, the man who has no right of ownership whatever, and who will go down into the clay without ever owning an acre and is to-day struggling for an existence on that land.  I do not think enough thought is given to that particular class.  I do not think that the agricultural worker has ever had fair or adequate consideration from the central authority in this country.</P>
    <P>Those members of this House who will glance through the writings of undoubtedly the greatest land reformer we have ever had&mdash;the late Michael Davitt, who did such great work to <Col N="1294" /> secure the three F's for Irish farmers&mdash; will find that he admonished people who have the responsibility of public office or who are elected in any representative capacity to care for and do what they can for the agricultural labourer.  At the time he was writing, the agricultural workers by far exceeded the number of those who owned land, because, of course, ownership was then confined to a relatively small number of the population.  Every farmer who owns land in this country can look back just a generation, or at most two generations, to the time when his forebears were socially no more than agricultural workers.  I do not mean that in a derogatory sense. I regard agricultural labourers as the most reputable, fair dealing, hardest-working, honourable and dignified section of workers which we could have.  I have experience of agricultural labourers, and I have had a lot of experience of industrial workers and various other classes of society and, as a class, I have nothing but the highest respect for agricultural labourers.  The trouble is, perhaps, that they accept their burden too quietly.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating what I said before in this House, namely, that during the years of the emergency appeals were made by public men of every type and of every Party to agricultural workers to produce more and to stand by the country.  They were told that they were the front-line soldiers in the battle which they were waging during the emergency.  Nobody can say that they did not do their work.  At the time of the emergency they would not have been released to go to work in Britain, but, of their own free will, most of them chose to stay at home, because agriculture is their pattern of existence, and will remain so.  What sort of thanks did they get? At present an effort is being made by a highly-organised and highly-skilled group of trade operatives in this city to improve their position, as they are entitled to.  High and well-developed as the skill of these operatives may be, the skill of the agricultural worker is just as hard to come by, and takes just as long to perfect.  If we compare the standard of existence of the agricultural worker with the present standard <Col N="1295" /> of existence of the workers who are now engaged in a dispute to improve their position, as they are entitled to do, we find that farm workers have the very lowest level of existence in this Republic.</P>
    <P>About 100,000 men are working for wages on the land of Ireland.  Between 1946 and 1951&mdash;excluding farmers and sons of farmers&mdash;31,836 men employed on the land for wages left the land.  In 15 years 110,000 men left the land.  Since 1926&mdash;26 years&mdash;140,000 persons have left the land.  At nice cosy tea parties and at various functions throughout the country we hear discussions on the flight from the land.  Suggestions are made that we should build more parish halls, have more platforms for dancing and make life brighter for the people there in an effort to remedy the flight from the land.  We must appreciate that those who indulge in these fantasies do not grasp the problem at all. The agricultural labourer belongs in this country perhaps more than any other worker.  The generations of most of them could never be traced in the country because they come out of the mists of history.  They cling to the land because of their innate love for it, for their village, their parish, their town and their country.  Despite all that, however, they are being driven from the land in their thousands by economic necessity and by no other force.  If agricultural employment offered that was even slightly attractive, if there could be some guarantee of continuity of employment for farm labourers and if they could be assured of a wage that would give them some chance of living, we should begin to see the end of the favourite theme of armchair politicians and armchair philosophers, namely, the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>We have not seen, under any of our Governments so far, this problem tackled as it should be tackled.  Farm workers throughout the Twenty-Six Counties are earning at the moment the magnificent sum of £3 10s. to £3 14s. a week.  I do not know how any Minister for Agriculture, any member of any Cabinet or any member of this House could feel at ease with himself, at ease with his own mind, with <Col N="1296" /> his own conscience, to think that there is that vast concourse of people, over 100,000 labourers, not to mention their families, their wives and their children, living on so low a level that can be provided at £3 10s. a week.  But, apparently, if you manage to remain within the precincts of this House for a sufficiently long number of years you will become so shell-backed that your conscience will not trouble you in many matters.</P>
    <P>During the whole course of this sometimes dreary debate we have not heard one word about the agricultural workers.  Since February of this year the cost of living has risen, it is estimated, by eight points&mdash;not estimated by me or by anybody connected with my Party but estimated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who, when he was replying to a question addressed to him recently on the position in regard to the removal or the reduction in the food subsidies, and when he was asked to state in terms of points what this reduction would mean, stated that the changes in the price of butter, tea, bread and sugar would mean an increase in the food index alone of 10.2 points, which is interpreted to mean an increase of seven points in the over-all index.</P>
    <P>The total cost-of-living index figure therefore would stand at 122, which represents an increase of 18 per cent. over the figure that existed in April, 1951.  The wage level of £3 10s. to £3 14s., to which I have referred, has been operative roughly from that time. The cost of living has increased by 18 per cent.  It cannot be denied, no matter what may be said to the contrary, that the cash income of the farming community has increased since the war, and has increased considerably since the war as compared with 1938 and 1939.  But the agricultural workers' income has not increased.  I wonder would it be because the agricultural worker is not regarded as having very great political influence in the country.  I am inclined to the view that that explains the very sparse mention he receives in this House. Because of the peculiar set-up which we have here, because of our history and the development of agriculture in <Col N="1297" /> the country, there are almost four landowning agriculturists, if we may call them so, to every one wage worker on the land; in other words there are four farmers' votes for every one vote of the agricultural labourer.  I wonder would I be uncharitable if I were to suggest that that is the real determining factor, when the whole question is examined and analysed, that has the agricultural worker where he is to-day-nobody's child, forgotten, forgotten by most people, anyway.</P>
    <P>I had some hopes when Deputy Walsh began to make speeches around the country&mdash;I should not go so far as to say I had some hope, but I do know that agricultural workers who voted for the present Minister in his own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny had hopes&mdash;they happened to be members of my own organisation&mdash;that perhaps Deputy Tom Walsh was going to do something for them, was going to give them a better way of life than they had.  Their hopes were reinforced when they opened the <i>Irish Press</i> dated 5th March of this year and read this statement by Deputy Walsh: &ldquo;The agricultural labourer was worth 10/- a week more than the building labourer, the forestry worker or road worker, and if he was allowed to remain long in office he would place them in that position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity last week to ask the Minister what steps he was taking or proposed to take to implement that undertaking.  I received the usual meaningless reply which can be so very well drafted by the Department of Agriculture or by any Government Department when they want to put a Deputy off.  The reply, which might have suited Deputy Corry, but which made no impression at all, I am quite sure, on the agricultural workers of the country, was that when farmers have been put in a sufficiently strong position of prosperity, which he was going to do, they would then be in a position to pay a higher level of wages than they were now paying.  Ten shillings a week more than the building labourer in my constituency means £7 a week, and this was translated by that small handful of agricultural workers in County Dublin, who were <Col N="1298" /> deluded into voting for Deputy Burke, to mean that the present Minister for Agriculture intended to see that they got £7 per week.  They have £4 5s. per week much against the will of the Agricultural Wages Board, to which the Minister has often referred, and there is no sign of their getting £4 10s. per week or anything like £5 per week let alone £7.  We do not see any sign of any speeches being made around the country by members of the Government, by Fianna Fáil Deputies, urging the farmers to pay higher wages to their workers.  We do not see any efforts being made by the Minister to secure, even for the agricultural labourers in his own constituency, a decent wage to live on.  As I said at the outset, it seems to be entirely a policy of making the agricultural labourer the plaything of political Parties.</P>
    <P>I am not so foolish or so immature in politics as to imagine that as a result of my speaking here the Minister will bend his energies towards the task of uplifting this badly treated section of the community.  Neither am I so foolish as to hope that were the Minister replaced by any of his colleagues a metamorphosis would take place as far as agricultural workers are concerned.  I am satisfied that agricultural workers will have to learn the lesson that all other workers have had to learn, that they will have to rely in the first on their own strength because it has been obvious to me for a long time that they can look to this House with very little hope for any improvement in their conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Corry here to-night one would imagine that the farmers had no right to fight for proper prices.  He claimed here that there was a deliberate campaign against the growing of beet.  The statement also has been made here by the Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for Finance, that there was a deliberate campaign against the growing of beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is absolutely untrue.  The beet growers were not satisfied with the price arrangement this year and I think they were fully entitled to go out and protest against the price.  Deputy <Col N="1299" /> Corry stated in the House that a resolution that came from Carlow was approved by the various committees of agriculture and that, when the truth was known of that resolution, it was rescinded.  Actually what happened as far as that resolution goes was that it came from a committee in Borris, County Carlow, Borris Show Committee, and the resolution read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we protest to the Beet Growers' Association against the unfair price fixed for beet between them and the sugar company and that we ask farmers to refuse to sign contracts for the 1952-53 season.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That resolution came before the Carlow Committee of Agriculture and it was adopted by that committee.  A Fine Gael supporter on the committee proposed the adoption and I happened to be the seconder.  We adopted that resolution deleting the last portion where it asked that the farmers refuse to sign contracts for the 1952-53 season.  That proves definitely that as far as the Carlow Committee of Agriculture were concerned they were anxious to see beet grown.  They would not adopt the resolution with the last part in it asking the farmers to refuse to sign contracts.</P>
    <P>Naturally we were anxious in Carlow to see the beet industry carried on.  The beet industry to the Carlow farmers is very very important. But, we felt that we were badly treated by the Beet Growers' Association who negotiated the price. The new price for this season was 7/-a ton more than the 1951 price but to counteract that there was an increase in the cost of pulp to the farmers of £4 5s. a ton.  The increase in the price of pulp practically outweighed the increase in the price for beet. There was then only 6d. to the advantage of the farmer.  This year the farmer had to meet increases in manures, fertilisers, labour and other increases, and the growers could not accept the present price.  I believe that the growers were definitely entitled to protest against that price as they believed that the Beet Growers' Association had mishandled the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> Deputy Corry referred to the price being arranged by costings which were produced in 1948.  We as growers were very dissatisfied with those costings because one glaring matter that was definitely against the grower was that there were 360 farmers selected to do the costings&mdash;they were agreed upon by representatives of the Beet Growers' Association and by the sugar company as a fair average of the type of grower &mdash;but out of the 360 growers that were selected only 160 completed the costings and there was a lopsided result. It was not a fair average.  The good farmer stayed in and the indifferent farmer went out.  To show that that was the position, the yield for the costings was 11¼ ton; the average yield for the four factories that year was nine tons to the statute acre.  That left the farmer in a very bad position as far as costings were concerned.  It meant a disadvantage straight away of £12 an acre.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite aware of what was happening as far as this campaign against beet growing was concerned. He has stated here and the Minister for Finance has stated that it was a political campaign.  I state definitely that it was not a political campaign and no one knows that better than the Minister.  The proposer of the Borris resolution is a very keen supporter of the Minister and his Party and if it was political that man would not have proposed that resolution if Fine Gael were behind it.</P>
    <P>The Minister was warned that the beet would not be grown in Carlow. Four of his supporters asked him to intervene and try to have the matter fixed and he said that it had nothing to do with him, that it was a matter between the Beet Growers' Association and the sugar company.  Those four people asked the Minister would it not be a good thing if he went to General Costello and asked that the price negotiations be reopened and the Minister said that General Costello would tell him to mind his own business. That is the type of attitude the Minister took towards beet growing this season.  He was warned by his own supporters that the beet would not be grown, that the growers were dissatisfied with the present arrangement.  If <Col N="1301" /> there is any blame to be laid at anyone's feet it is to be laid at the feet of the Minister because he got due warning, as I say, by his own people and he paid no heed to that warning.</P>
    <P>I have been attacked in this House personally by the Minister for Finance that I was not prepared to grow beet at the highest price in the world and that I was not prepared to produce food.  I challenge the Minister for Finance that I am producing as much food per acre as the Minister for Agriculture, if not more, and I am prepared to allow any independent man to test it out.  It was a disgraceful charge by the Minister.  I have always done my best to produce food and work my farm properly, and if beet is not paying me this year I am perfectly entitled not to grow beet.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is interested in the question we are discussing, he ought to be clear what the charge is against Deputy Hughes, particularly in view of the statement by the Minister for Finance with regard to Deputy Hughes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said that I was not prepared to grow beet at the highest price in the world and to produce food for the people and that I thought that I should still be left my land.  I make the challenge to the Minister that I am making as good use of my farm as the Minister.  He is not prepared to take me up on that challenge, but he has the cheek, like the Minister for Finance, to attack me personally.  I am not in the least afraid to let anyone examine how I run my farm.  The farmers of Carlow were entitled to protest against the way they have been treated by the Beet Growers' Association this year, an association which, I believe, does not represent the views of the growers.  As I say, the Minister got due warning, but took no heed of it.  He knew the acreage would drop in Carlow, but it was a very simple thing to put the blame on me.  It is his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the highest price in the world for beet is concerned, the sugar company spent thousands of pounds telling the growers that the price was the highest in the world.  There was no daily or local paper you could take up that had not got a half-page advertisement announcing that the Irish beet grower was getting the highest price in the world.  But the Irish beet grower knows his own <Col N="1304" /> business.  He knows when beet is paying, and he will grow beet if it pays him, and politics or anything else do not enter into it.  If I thought beet was paying me, I would grow as much as any other grower, but when it is not paying me I refuse to grow it, and I am entitled to do so.  We have at least that freedom in this country still.</P>
    <P>A comparison is made with British price, but there is no allowance made in that comparison for the subsidy the English farmer gets on fertilisers and there is not a word about the English farmer having complete derating. There is another very important factor which is never taken into account in regard to the price of beet, our heavy rainfall, which is definitely a big disadvantage to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>Another matter discussed by Deputy Corry was the ground limestone subsidy. He said that Deputy Dillon, when Minister, refused to continue that subsidy.  When Deputy Dillon went into office, there was no subsidy on ground limestone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated&mdash;to get back to beet as we had gone away from it&mdash;that the Beet Growers' Association had become political.  To prove that, I wish to say that, two years ago, a member of the Beet Growers' Association died.  He came from South Kildare, which is a very concentrated beet-growing area.  A member was co-opted in his place. That member was Deputy Tom Harris of this House, who had no interest whatever in beet growing.  He was put there for political purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would grow as much as Deputy Allen myself with one acre. The price of barley this year was fixed by the association at 75/- and the growers all over the country were very dissatisfied with that arrangement. They believe that it was a move by the Government to keep down the price of barley so that wheat would be grown.</P>
      <P>We heard the Minister speak last night on the land reclamation scheme. I was glad to learn that the scheme was going so well.  You would imagine by the Minister that he was taking full credit for that scheme. That is a complete change of front.  Not so very long ago he condemned that scheme completely, but I am glad to see that he has changed about and that he is the champion of the scheme now, and is praising it and hoping it will continue and expand.  I believe it will, as it has been one of the best schemes started here to help the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few improvements which could be made in that scheme.  Some encouragement could be given to bring in more contractors.  I believe the <Col N="1311" /> Department's plant is too elaborate and is not getting to the smaller farmer, who really wants to get the benefit of the scheme.  Where six, seven or ten acres need to be reclaimed, it is costing the Department too much to shift the plant into that type of work.  They are inclined to get on to the bigger scheme, where there are 40 or 50 acres to be reclaimed. For that reason the farmer who wants eight or ten acres done is being left behind.  Something should be done to get in more contractors, and then the work would be done faster and the ground covered more quickly.  The plant in operation at present is too elaborate, and it is costing too much to induce the contractor to go in.  If there were some type of plant that would not be so elaborate, some type of trencher that would make the drains and yet not be so costly, it would help the scheme very much.  You could have quite a number of these small plants doing the work in smaller areas, doing four or five acre fields.  That would help the scheme considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister thought there was not going to be a good response in regard to wheat growing this year, and immediately said there was a political campaign against wheat growing as well as against beet growing.  I can assure the Minister that is not so, that there is no political compaign against wheat growing.  My experience of our supporters in Fine Gael is that their own business comes first, and they are not prepared to jeopardise their own business for political ends.  They are prepared to grow wheat and beet if they are paid for doing so.  The Minister ought to stop the kind of propaganda that wheat is political.</P>

If the farmers are treated rightly, they will deliver the goods and the Minister ought to be fully aware of that situation.  It is very bad policy on the part of the Minister to go around making these statements, and the sooner he changes the better for everyone.

      <P>He did not refer to all these matters, and there is no advantage in having them continued here. <Col N="1313" /> It is of no benefit to agriculture in the future.  There are many aspects of agriculture that nearly all groups of farmers agree on, and any controversy on the price of beet or the subsidy on lime and so on could be brought to an end fairly soon.  I know something about the price of beet last spring.  On the eve of the time for sowing beet, an agitation did start amongst farmers on the question of price that was detrimental to the beet growing in the present year.  The price was fixed in November, and the agitation started strongly in March and April and affected the amount of beet grown this year.  It was in my own county, and spread all over, mainly in Leinster. Very many farmers in my constituency fully appreciate the distinction which is made.  They have been agitating and fighting that since the beet growing started.  They have been beet growers from the beginning, and never could see a reason why they were placed at a disadvantage in not getting something from the subsidy over and above what other growers in the immediate vicinity of the factories had thrust upon them.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present,</i></P>
      <P>The farmers in Wexford appreciate what was done by the sugar company and the Beet Growers' Association to provide for beet to be delivered to the nearest factory carriage paid.  For years the farmers in South Wexford have been sending beet to Thurles and Mallow, and paying very high carriage on that beet.  For years they were advocating to have that position remedied, and they are now glad that something has been done, whether by the sugar company or the Beet Growers' Association, or through the joint efforts of both, in making provision for the payment of the carriage on beet to the nearest factory.  In the earlier years of beet growing it was the people near the factory in Carlow who prevented the operation of a flat rate for beet and the carriage being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a good number in Carlow also.  I am not saying it was confined to Carlow only but they felt that, if there was any money to be spent, they should get a proportion of it in addition to those growers who live further away.  The people have told me that themselves.  It was a great pity that this agitation was carried on on public platforms.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of sweat and effort put into the costings by people of all shades of political thought.  A good day's work was done for the agricultural community when those beet-growing costings were brought into operation on behalf of the producers. There may be different opinions as to whether the basis was a sound one but it is at least there now as the foundation of any future effort that may be made.  The beet growers' organisation has been in existence for ten or 20 years and it has done a good day's work for the farmers.  The efforts of the organisation should be appreciated.  If the farmers think they can get a better association it is in their own interests to do so.  It is not right that an agitation should start just on the eve of the sowing season.  That was the first occasion on which it was said that the present association was not representative of the growers.  That happened in the months of March and April, the months in which the beet was about to be sown.</P>

I hope the new association will give as good service as the existing one has given.  It has worked night and day in the interests of the farmers for years past.  The price should definitely be agreed upon between the various interests.  The position would then be much more satisfactory for the industry as a whole.</P>

They are under complete Irish management and Fianna Fáil's criticism in the early years was directed not against the growing of beet and the manufacture of our own sugar but against the bad bargain that was struck with a group of foreign capitalists coming into this country.</P>

      <P>With regard to ground limestone, I distinctly remember Wexford County Committee of Agriculture giving a subsidy in 1947.  I think it was the first committee to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is mixing that up with caustic ground limestone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A subsidy was given on both in the same year.  Wexford County Committee gave a subsidy for one year on both and for two years, I think, on ground limestone.  Ground limestone was available to the farmers in Wexford at £1 per ton during the operation of the subsidy.  That was before the advent of the Coalition Government and during the first year in which they were in office.  Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, abolished both the subsidy on ground limestone and burnt lime and did not replace that with anything else for two years.  It only came into operation a month before he left office.  I would like to mention another matter which is incidental to that and which should have been mentioned a long time ago in this House, that is the handing of the lime subsidy over to Córas Iompair Éireann.  There were a number of private persons, 20 in all, who had <Col N="1317" /> been engaged in the manufacture of ground limestone, and some of them in the transport of it.  I think I am right in saying though, of course, I speak subject to correction, that they succeeded in selling this lime to farmers at less than 35/- a ton.</P>
      <P>When the subsidy came into operation one month before the Coalition Government left office, it was handed over to Córas Iompair Éireann, and private persons who had been engaged in the grinding of lime were allowed to remain in that business only for so long as their lorries could remain on the road.  In my view, that was one of the greatest injustices ever brought about in this country.  It is an injustice to continue this arrangement, and I put it to the Minister now that he should alter it.  Men put their capital into the producing of lime and succeeded in selling it, and then the subsidy was introduced and they were put out of business.  State funds, without the aid of the law, were never used for such a purpose before, and I hope they will not continue to be so used.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to say what has become of the scheme which was in operation for the growing of pedigree seed wheat and for the selling of it to farmers each spring.  My information is that the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, brought that scheme to an end.  It was a very good scheme and one that is absolutely necessary if we are to continue growing wheat, which is all-important for us.  The bringing to an end of the pedigree seed wheat growing scheme was one of the undesirable actions taken by Deputy Dillon when Minister for Agriculture, and I would like if the Minister and his Department initiated it again, and also a scheme to grow pedigree seed oats, so as to provide farmers with all the seed they require.  There is a pedigree seed barley scheme in operation in many areas already, and it is a great success.</P>

    <P>Every farmer knows that his seed wheat is liable to become mixed and that it needs to be replenished with pure line seeds after some years.  A good quantity of pure line seed potatoes is grown from pedigree <Col N="1318" /> stocks, mainly in Donegal.  That scheme could be extended, and it would be of advantage to our farmers. If they are given good seed in the first instance and if they follow that up with proper manuring and proper tillage the crops will be good.  However, in the absence of proper seed, it does not matter how good the manuring and the tillage may be, good crops will not be produced. Therefore, we see the necessity for launching schemes with a view to making available to farmers all the varieties of seed they require.</P>
    <P>I drew attention last year, when speaking on this Estimate, to the small amount of money provided for the horse-breeding scheme.  The small amount provided in this Estimate has also been drawn to my attention.  Horse-breeding may have become unpopular amongst farmers owing to the small amount allocated in the past for making available to them thoroughbred horses for breeding horses of the hunter type.  I think it is a great pity that more money is not provided for this purpose.  It will seriously damage agricultural and horse-breeding interests if thoroughbred horses are not loaned or leased to farmers in as great a number as in former years.  Ireland is internationally famous as a breeder of horses of the hunter type, thoroughbred horses, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is an all-important industry and it has been responsible for earning a vast amount of money for this country. I have in mind mainly the type of horse used at one time by the Army jumping team.  This team brought glory to Ireland, but it has not been so successful of late.  Perhaps this is because sufficient money has not been made available to get the best material or because as good a type of horse is not being bred now as was the case a dozen or so years ago.</P>
    <P>It should be the policy of the Department of Agriculture to encourage small farmers to continue, as far as possible, breeding working-type horses.  A comparison could be introduced between this undertaking and the maintenance of the railways; they have to be kept going, whether or not they are an economic proposition. <Col N="1319" /> Farmers ought to continue breeding working-type horses as a safeguard against an emergency period.  I feel I am right in saying that 80 per cent. of the fuel stocks used for agricultural production are imported, for instance, petrol and diesel oil.  If an emergency came upon us we would be in a very serious plight after about six months. In fact, the country might be on the borders of starvation, due to the lack of imported fuel.  I feel, therefore, that farmers should be encouraged not <Col N="1320" /> to go completely away from the breeding of working-type horses, so as to have them for tillage operations in case of necessity.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 22nd July, 1952.</P>
