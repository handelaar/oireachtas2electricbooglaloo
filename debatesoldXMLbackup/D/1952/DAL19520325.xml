      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Ballyorgan rural area, which includes most of the parish of Glenroe, has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions but has not been successful owing to a low financial return.  The board consider it <Col N="290" /> to be unlikely that the development of the area will take place in the near future.</P>
      <P>The board also inform me that the Glenbrohane area is included in the Garryspillane area which also has failed to be selected on a number of occasions.  Last year the local committee approached the board with a view to securing some improvement in the economics of the area but although the committee was asked to ascertain the demand for supply in an adjoining district which could be added to the original area to improve its economics, no further communication was received from the committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will indicate (a) the quantity of American coal imported into Cork and Dublin in each of the last six months; (b) the quantity purchased by merchants in these months; (c) the quantity of English coal imported in the same months; (d) the cost per ton of (i) the American and (ii) the English coal imported in each case; (e) the present prices per ton of coal in Cork and Dublin, and (f) whether in view of the small quantity <Col N="292" /> of American coal involved, he has satisfied himself that the present prices are justified in those cities.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report a statement giving particulars requested by the Deputy at (a) to (d) of his question.  The present retail price of coal in both Dublin and Cork is £8 5s. per ton.  As the Deputy is probably aware this price came into operation on 24th March, 1952, and represents a reduction of 15/- per ton on the prices previously ruling.  In fixing the reduced price regard was had to the increased availability of British coal.</P>

      <P>In my statement to the House on 12th March I said that the Government are taking steps to adjust our balance of payments with the dollar area so that the net deficit arising during the second half of 1951-52 will not exceed $16,000,000.  The original estimate for that period of six months amounted to approximately $27,000,000.  The reduction in the original estimate arises mainly from the elimination of imports of American coal and from the contemplated curtailment of purchases of tobacco leaf, oils and fats and sugar, as well as from the consequential reduction in dollar expenditure on freights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards transactions with countries which are outside both the sterling area and the dollar area, I said in my statement that our aim is to reduce the deficit with these countries <Col N="294" /> so that in the latter part of this year the deficit will not be accruing at a rate in excess of £18,000,000 per annum.  The provisional estimate of the balance of payments for 1952 indicated that the deficit with these countries during the second half of the year might be of the order of £14,000,000 and, as stated, we aim at getting a result which we hope will not be materially greater than £9,000,000.  The whole question of the measures that can be taken to achieve that result is under examination and I regret that I am not at present able to give particulars as to the imports from these countries which will show a reduction.</P>

The regulations empower the chief medical officer of a health authority to prohibit the importation and disposal of such food.

The Government were informed of the proposed action in the matter and the reasons for it. After discussion with representatives of the banks the Government felt that, <Col N="309" /> in view of the need for precautionary measures against possible serious loss of deposits and the curtailment of credit that might follow, they could not press further for a modification of the banks' decision.

      <P>When we adjourned on Friday, I was pointing out that there did not seem to be any difference of opinion amongst Opposition Deputies as to whether or not this country is facing a crisis.  Different titles have been given to our financial difficulties here by different speakers on the Opposition Benches, with the exception of Deputy Dillon, who appears to claim that there is no problem or crisis of any kind confronting the country.  It is rather extraordinary that there would appear to be financial difficulties of the nature we are facing and under-production of the nature we are facing and balance of payment difficulties of the nature we are facing in practically every country in Europe, yet Deputy Dillon believes there is no problem here.  He is like the old woman watching the army march past who turned to her neighbour and told her that everybody was out of step but her Johnny.  In the same way, we all seem to be out of step here except our Jimmy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Having made up our minds that there is a problem we must then face the question of getting down to ways and means of meeting our difficulties. It is clear from the Book of Estimates that we have a crisis here.  This Book of Estimates has at all events rendered a service to the nation by giving a true picture of our financial position. We have a true picture of the debit side.  That is something we did not get and were not in a position to judge on the information supplied to us in the last Budget.  There is no faking of these figures.  There is no cooking of the Book of Estimates in connection with these figures.  The nation is now in a position to judge its liability.  It is a matter for argument as to how far the Coalition Government contributed to our present financial difficulties.  It is a matter for this Government and the House to provide ways and means of meeting this colossal bill with which the nation is now faced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very interested to hear Deputy Leary's contribution to our financial difficulties when he comes to speak.  No doubt it will be as illuminating as some of the other speeches we have heard from some of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first problems we must face is the method whereby we can bring about increased agricultural production. In order to do so I believe that both sides will have to come to agreement as to what constitutes a proper agricultural unit.  It is quite clear that those who hold the larger tracts of land, the ranchers, are not prepared to produce food.  It is quite clear to those of us who travel through the Midlands and see farmers around Mullingar, for instance, with 600 or 700 acres of land driving into the nearest town to purchase their vegetables that they are not prepared to utilise the land in the way in which the nation requires it to be utilised. The State and the general taxpayer have gone a good distance in providing certain reliefs for these people, particularly by way of relief of rates on agricultural land, and other measures of <Col N="313" /> that kind which cost the taxpayer a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>It is my submission that these farmers have a certain duty to the nation.  They have a certain duty to produce a certain amount of food on the lands they occupy.  There are unfortunate people under £10 valuation who actually overproduce on the units they hold.  They are compelled by economic necessity to so produce.  If they had more land they would produce even more than they are producing now; and they are producing far in excess of those with larger valuations.</P>
    <P>I think the Government will have to consider what methods they must adopt in order to advance agricultural production.  What methods they can adopt to achieve this end I do not know, but there are many methods that could be adopted.  The Government will have to ensure that there is an efficient unit of production and that that unit is in the hands of those who will utilise it to its fullest extent.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the position at the moment that a number of these people tilled a large amount of conacre during the emergency.  They cannot do so now because those from whom they took the land on the conacre system are now using these lands to produce more and more bullocks and they are not prepared to let them.  During the emergency they were compelled to let in order to comply with the compulsory tillage Order.</P>
    <P>We cannot achieve the unit of production we would like overnight but we can as a temporary measure compel these people to make some portion of their lands available to those who are ready and willing to till and thereby produce more food for the nation.  Notwithstanding all the price inducements given by the present Government the people who happen to control the largest portions of the land are not prepared and will not be prepared to use these lands for the production of the nation's food requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>The Deputy is expressing his-opinion.  I am sure Deputy Davin will also express his opinion. I am quite entitled to express mine on matters of this kind.  The difficulty with the Deputy's Party is that no two of them express a similar view.  We have had different cures from the Labour Party over many years, most of them imported and all of them useless.</P>
      <P>We were told by Deputy Blowick during this debate that there had been a slashing of the amount of money made available for forestry since he left office.  There was a lot of talk and ballyhoo by some Deputies about forestry but very little was done.  We were told by Deputy Blowick when he was Minister that so many trees would be planted.  We were told in the West that that work would absorb all our surplus population there.  Year after year we were waiting expecting forestry work to be done and all that Deputy Blowick got for this State when Minister was barbed wire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>He came down to Louisburgh in my constituency with about 20 Press photographers and about 50 Clann na Talmhan supporters and planted one bush.  That was the extent of the forestry work done there. He told us that he saw a crisis coming when the Korean war started and that he set about ensuring that forestry would go ahead and that there would be plenty of barbed wire in this country. Evidently this was the only national defence provision made by the inter-Party Government.  There might have been difficulties about supplies from outside, but Irish Shipping, Limited, was told not to go ahead.  Deputy Lemass's plans for Irish Shipping were scrapped, but the nation was saved because the question of defence was left to Deputy Blowick who bought more barbed wire.</P>
      <P>There was also the question of the fuel supply.  When the inter-Party Government stopped turf production in the West, we were compelled to stand back and see thousands of people emigrating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The nation might be left without fuel owing to the international crisis, but the nation was saved because Deputy Blowick procured thousands and thousands of pounds' worth of barbed wire.  The Government were not worrying about increasing the Army.  Notwithstanding Deputy Blowick's concern about the war in Korea and the danger of its spreading, and I am sure the sleepless nights he spent worrying about invasion, the rest of the Cabinet did nothing about the Army.  But Deputy Blowick had the situation well in hand and purchased still more barbed wire.  There was sufficient barbed wire purchased by him to construct a concentration camp for every Clann na Talmhan supporter in Ireland.  Barbed wire was purchased but no work was done.  That was a typical instance of the method adopted by the Deputy and his colleagues when in office.  There was plenty of publicity and shouting but very little work done.</P>
      <P>The question of credit has been mentioned, particularly in connection with farming.  Some Deputies, particularly Deputies from my constituency, have been bewailing the fact that the rate of interest for people who have to borrow money is increasing.  But, when we were in opposition and were trying to get the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, to provide some credit for the people in my constituency whose cattle were dying last year owing to the lack of fodder, there were no credit facilities made available by the then Minister.  Although it would appear from Deputy Dillon's statement on this Estimate that he had so many millions of money that he did not know what to do with them, it is extraordinary that these Deputies who purport to represent the farming community could not persuade him to make some of the millions available for the restocking of the land of the unfortunate people in the West, whose cattle had died for want of fodder, due to the messing of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we brought that matter to the then Minister's attention we got <Col N="316" /> nothing but a wave of the hand.  It is amusing to hear these people talking about credit now, the very people who, if they had any influence on behalf of the farming community, as they purported to have, during the period of the Coalition Government, neglected to provide the credit facilities which are now being made available by the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky in his speech in this debate said that he did not think much of his colleagues in the inter-Party Government with the exception of Deputy Dillon.  We listened very patiently to the Deputy singing the praises of Deputy Dillon and telling the House that a monument should be erected to him in view of his services as Minister for Agriculture during the Coalition régime.  I hope that Deputy Cafferky will make a similar speech in his constituency.  If he does, he will find himself again turned out in the cold.  For my part, I would be prepared to join with Deputy Cafferky in providing a suitable monument for Deputy Dillon.  I know that Deputy Dillon would not be satisfied with anything less than an out-size piece of sculpture.  I would be prepared to join in that provided it is carved out of solid Danish butter and has as a base the Irish eggs with which he did not drown the British.  He left a trail of woe amongst the farming community in the West which they never will forget. He told us that as a result of his policy he would soon drown the British in eggs.  He compelled the unfortunate small farmers in the West in a very short time to drown millions of hens. In the County Mayo there are already monuments to him.  The deserted henhouses, the hovers that had to be sold, the tomato scheme in the Gaeltacht and the farm improvements scheme that were scrapped&mdash;all these things will be remembered for Deputy Dillon long after he leaves this House.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cafferky is prepared to hold on to the view that he has as to the progress made by Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, I would advise him in his own interest to keep it secret from the small farming community in Mayo, because they certainly will shed no tears or join in no <Col N="317" /><i>De Profundis</i> for Deputy Dillon's disastrous policy and what it meant to their type of economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that is how Fianna Fáil lost a seat in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They lost no seat in South Mayo.  They gained seats owing very largely to Deputy Dillon's disastrous policy.  Fianna Fáil have now to start off again and make provision for the progress of the nation.  The regrettable thing is that we have been left in such an unfortunate financial position, as is shown by this Book of Estimates.  It was a great tragedy for the nation that the Coalition Government did not hand over the nation to their successors in the same position financially as they got it.  Of course, I am prepared, like everybody else in Ireland, to take a good joke.  We had a lot of entertainment from the Coalition Government while it lasted.  Unfortunately, it is an expensive business and we have to pay for that entertainment now.  I saw advertised in the Dublin papers last week two very well-known American comedians, Abbott and Costello, who were appearing in a film called <i>Hold that Ghost.</i>  It was good entertainment as entertainment goes.  We also had entertainment for three years under the Coalition Government, the Abbott coming from Ballaghaderreen.  We all must pay for that fun now.</P>
      <P>We did not hear any protests during the past three years about the unemployment in the State from the people who are so loud-voiced now about it, and we did not hear one word of protest about the thousands of people particularly in the turf area, who suffered adversely due to the policy pursued by the inter-Party Government. But I suppose it is quite in order in the political game to try now to suggest that the present financial position that is facing this nation is due to the present Government and not due to the disastrous period that the nation has passed through during the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that our problem as a nation is the same as the problem of an individual or a family.  We must <Col N="318" /> try to produce more not alone in agriculture but in every form of industry and particularly in connection with commodities we export.  One of the inducements that I believe has been brought about is that dealing with the congested areas.  There has been a new hope born since the change of Government. Under the Undeveloped Areas Bill a new hope has emerged for the Gaeltacht and congested areas that was never there before.  The people see that now, at all events, they have got a Government that is endeavouring to provide, so far as they can, some future for the congested areas.  If the facilities under the Bill are availed of fully I believe&mdash;and we see signs of it already in the congested areas&mdash;that it will undoubtedly have a very healthy effect on the economy in those areas.</P>
    <P>Some people have suggested that perhaps that Bill has not gone far enough, but at least for a start it is evidence of the good faith of the Government as far as the congested areas are concerned.  It may be that the provisions of that Bill could possibly be extended somewhat further.  Even already, I can assure the House, it is showing results in the congested areas. In North Mayo, the local bogs are a vital problem and a vital part of the economy of that area.  It is most encouraging now that in the northern part of Mayo, which I represent, Bord na Móna have embarked on a major scheme with the turf generating station.  It has held out new hope to the people of Bangor Erris and the turf areas of the western seaboard who have had no hope except the emigrant ship, since the scrapping of the turf scheme, until this scheme was inaugurated.</P>

      <P>We know who inaugurated the turf scheme in this country. We know who sabotaged it and we know who killed it.  The people of Mayo, at all events, know who has <Col N="319" /> resurrected it and, by a strange coincidence, the resurrection of the turf scheme coincided with Deputy de Valera coming back into power.  I do not know how Deputy Sweetman and his pals will get over that, but that is so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The bog was left there by the inter-Party Government and the people on the bog were left there; those who were in a position to do so left the country because that was their only hope.  Some people suggest that this question of the flight from the land has got to such a stage that nothing can be done about it.  I do not believe that.  I believe there is still in our people, particularly the people of the West, a love of the land that no attraction outside the land will destroy. The difficulty of the people to whom I refer is that they have not sufficient land to live on.  But many people who have sufficient land to live on to bring up their family in frugal comfort would prefer that life, I am convinced, if they could get that chance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick said we are driving people from the land.  He said he knew 70 people who were driven from the land.  I could give an instance of how numbers of people were driven from the land by Deputy Blowick, because he has mentioned at least one man who is the Clann na Talmhan Secretary in the town of Castlebar who was driven from the land and into a job under the Pigs and Bacon Commission. That is one way of driving people from the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have another opportunity on a different Vote of dealing with that matter.  From the point of view of obtaining more production, I want to impress this on the Minister that if he wants increased production from the land, the people who are prepared to do that are the <Col N="320" /> people on the lower grade of valuation. If those people get a chance of working the land that God has given us in this country we will not have the problem we have to-day.  Of course we would not have this problem anyhow if we had a different policy pursued by the Department of Agriculture under the inter-Party Government.  We would not have this recession in agricultural production particularly in tillage were it not for the fact that the ranch policy was pursued by the Coalition.  It is no wonder that our people, particularly the farming community, would consider themselves fooled, when they were informed by the very head of the Department that he would not be found dead in a field of wheat or beet.  That kind of encouragement, if you call it encouragement, coming from the top was not very helpful to the people asked to increase production.  This idea was driven so much into our people that we were led to believe that the one and only farming economy and the only proper way was to produce more and more cattle and that anybody in this country who did otherwise was simply a fool in charge of land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is fond of telling us and told us in his last address to this House about the Mayo man who received his training on the groundnut scheme inaugurated by the British Labour Party for Africa and that he came back under Deputy Dillon's policy as a Minister to make a living in this country.  He did not finish the story and tell us that this gentleman having had one look at the Minister decided that he preferred African nuts to the native Irish variety so he promptly left this country again.  There is nobody in his sense believing in a balanced economy for the agricultural community who could have any hope whatsoever under the official policy pursued by Deputy Dillon as Minister. I quite understand that Deputy Dillon is now endeavouring to make the people believe that there is no crisis. It is the best possible hope of Deputy Dillon covering up that disastrous policy he pursued when he was in that vital Ministry of Agriculture in this State.  If Deputy Dillon admitted the balance sheet presented to us now he would be admitting his own failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> However, we have new hope now that we have a Minister who is prepared to adopt a different line of approach with a united lead from our Government. There is new hope for the Gaeltacht areas, one of which I represent, and if we face up to our difficulties in a realistic way we will be in a position to overcome them irrespective of the gravity of the legacy of debt and borrowing that has been left to us by our predecessors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, this debate has been worn threadbare by now.  The greatest evidence we have of that is the contribution to which we have just listened by the last speaker with regard to barbed wire.  I am not going to follow him into all the filthy channels into which he strayed.  I would like to emphasise that I am glad that the last Government purchased barbed wire for the purpose of promoting forestry rather than for any more sinister purpose and they had not to resort either to glass houses or barbed wire to preserve a state of peace in this country such as was never known here prior to their existence.  I sincerely hope that the period of peace to which this country settled down between 1948 and 1951 will continue.  I do not think that a provocative speech of the kind just delivered by Deputy Moran is going to benefit anybody in this country.  I would prefer to hear from the Government Benches and from the Opposition Benches sensible, sincere speeches of a constructive character which might benefit a section of the people.  That should be the aim of every Deputy.  If the Government wants to know what the people in my constituency thought about the inter-Party Government, they got their answer during the recent general election. If I were a member of the Government Party I would ask myself how it was that Fianna Fáil was able to return only one member in County Roscommon? I have no hesitation in saying that the main reason why that took place was owing to one simple act of legislation during the period of office of the inter-Party Government.  I refer specifically to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> In my opinion, the inter-Party Government introduced, by that Act, the greatest piece of legislation for the benefit of the rural community ever entered on the Statute Book of this House.  I firmly believe that the farmers of Roscommon were influenced entirely, when they went to the polls, by the Local Authorities (Works) Act. The main reason I am on my feet in this House now is because the present Government have decided to reduce the Estimate under the Local Authorities (Works) Act by 50 per cent.  I feel that that is the greatest mistake, politically and economically, of which the Government could be guilty.  In every county in Ireland the keenest appreciation was registered about the enactment of this piece of legislation which was conferring untold benefits, benefits yet to be reaped, on the farming community.  Is it not pathetic to find a Minister of the Government going before the farming community to-day and saying: &ldquo;There is a crisis upon us.  We are facing very serious economic problems&rdquo;?  Is it not extraordinary to find a Minister showing such utter indifference to the people who must get him out of that crisis and who must solve that problem&mdash;the people who in every emergency could be relied on to bring this country through?  I am referring to the people who work on the land of Ireland.  Yet, the Minister says: &ldquo;For a paltry saving of a few thousand pounds we are not going to help you to put your land into a better state of productivity.&rdquo; Would it not strike any man in this country that there is an obvious lack of sincerity on the part of such a Minister who tries to convince him of the utter necessity of increased production? I do not want to suggest that there is not a great necessity for increased production.  There is such necessity but, at the same time, I fail to understand the reason for withdrawing the benefits which might accure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and thus prevent the farmers from doing their best to pull this country out of the difficulty in which it finds itself at the present time.</P>
    <P>Many opinions were expressed here with regard to agricultural production. Economists who have no experience <Col N="323" /> whatsoever of work on the land or of what it means have attempted to tell the farmers what they should do in order to produce more food.  Even the humblest farmer in this country knows very well that he has a duty in this regard.  I do not feel that contributions such as those to which we have listened from Deputy Dr. Browne are going to have the effect of inducing the farmer to produce more food. Agricultural production has been described as stagnant.  I certainly do not agree with that, nor do I agree that it is dead.  However, it must be realised that the young men of to-day are not inclined to work on the land. If one compares the aggregate agricultural production with the number of people actually engaged on the land and compares such production with the years prior to now, one will see that agricultural production per head of the people actually engaged on the land has increased, and increased considerably. However, over the past 20 or 30 years there has been a definite flight from the land.  It seems to me that the reasons for this are not economic.  In fact, I would say that the principal reason is not an economic one.  We must admit that other walks of life in this country and elsewhere have been made far more attractive than life on the land.  Over the last few years there has been an improvement in the amenities on the land. The mechanisation of farming is going to make it a more likeable occupation for the young men and, while there may be a lesser number of young men engaged on the land, production will be increased considerably as a result of mechanisation.  However, disregarding mechanisation, I challenge any man to deny that the agricultural output per head of the people actually engaged on the land is greater than it was 20 or 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>One thing struck me very forcibly when listening to some of those economists speaking on agricultural production.  They think agricultural production can be measured by rule and line.  They imagine that if one sows an acre of wheat one must get in return so many bushels of wheat and <Col N="324" /> that if one sows a ton of potatoes one must reproduce so many tons.  That is sheer nonsense and goes to show that the man who makes such statements does not know what he is talking about. In this country we have a most indifferent and a most unreliable climate.  Despite the fact that a man goes out in the spring and tills every acre and puts in the best possible type of seed, a bad harvest may render all his efforts useless so that the nation is not one bit better off for the time and energy expended by him.  That has happened and may continue to happen, because we cannot control the elements.  We should always remember that the farmer has to put up with the factor of climate.  It is quite obvious that those who complain about low agricultural production never take that into consideration at all.  As long as they continue to disregard that they are absolutely toying with the problem. You might be able to do it in America but there is no one in this country who can control the weather to such an extent that he can say that there will be rain to-day and sunshine to-day.  It may happen, too, that a farmer might want rain in one field and sunshine in another for the different crops.</P>
    <P>I think, too, it should not be forgotten that the farmers' sons produced the fuel required by the people in the towns and cities during the emergency. They were taken away from the land to work in the bogs.  I think their contribution in that respect should not be forgotten either.  In passing, I would say that it was rather unwise, at the commencement of the campaign for increased production, to couple it with the campaign for recruiting for the Army, unless it was intended that those men would be made available for the harvest when that period comes. People may argue that those who join the Army would not be employed on the land in a good many cases.  That is so, but they have vacated positions throughout the country which have drawn men from the land thereby rendering the number of people available for farm work less.</P>
    <P>We heard quite a lot last week about the advances of tourism and the pecuniary advantages which the <Col N="325" /> people of this country derive from the tourist industry.  Let me remind those people who talk about tourism that if the farmers of this country had not been doing their job you would not have those tourists.  The people who deride the farmers and say they are useless should remember what the farmers are doing.  They are maintaining the whole community with their breakfast, dinner, tea and supper. They are producing every useful article that is required within the country and which can be produced in the country.  They are maintaining the whole population and are responsible for bringing in that £60,000,000 odd through tourism by providing the best food that those tourists cannot obtain for any money in any other country.  It is still our only valuable export trade.</P>
    <P>I think those three considerations should make any responsible Deputy shy at the idea of suggesting that the farmers of this country are not doing their duty.  I wonder where the country would be if the farmers were not doing their duty?  They are feeding the people.  The farmers' sons, as I pointed out, are producing the fuel for the towns and cities and providing the tourists with good meals.  Yet they are the main export.  When a public man gets up and appeals to the farmer to work harder what he means is that he must produce more.  I do not see why other sections of the community should not be asked to work harder too.  If every other member of the community pulled his weight and did his day's work as well as the farmer I think we would have a more prosperous and progressive country.</P>
    <P>I think there is one item in connection with production that I would like to stress.  It may not appear important to a man unacquainted with the backward parts of this country, but it is very important.  I know places in my county where the tractor or the thresher cannot get near the haggard because there are no suitable roads. For one reason or another my county has an oversupply of culs-de-sac.  I blame the Land Commission.  The Land Commission, or rather the Congested Districts Board, when operating, divided the land in Roscommon <Col N="326" /> and created new townlands and just made a dead-end road as far as the last house in the village.  Those roads have not been touched since the Land Commission put them there 40 years ago.  The Board of Works is not capable of repairing them nor has it the funds to put them into a proper state of repair.  The local authority have no legal right to repair them. Several farmers have complained to me, over the last ten years, that they cannot get a thresher into the haggard because they cannot get down the boreens.  Would not some Government say it is time to do something about those culs-de-sac?  I know that this is not a matter which is confined to my county and that the position is not as serious in some counties as in others but, when we are thinking of production, we should consider every possible aspect of production and remove every obstacle that stands in the way of increased production.</P>
    <P>It would be a very happy day for me and for the country, too, if we produced, within the shores of Ireland, every possible item of food that we need and yet have a surplus to export. Of course, there are others who can increase production.  Industrialists can increase production but what have they done?  I was rather amused the other day to pick up a child's brooch showing an Irish colleen and on the back of it was the caption: &ldquo;Made in England.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another matter is that for the past number of years the shrine at Knock has been visited by people from every county in Ireland and by people from outside Ireland.  If you buy a Knock Cross to-day you will find on the back of it the words: &ldquo;Made in France.&rdquo; I mentioned this to a Deputy in the House the other day and he had another experience.  He bought an ashtray showing the Blarney Castle&mdash; a beautiful thing&mdash;and on the back of it was written: &ldquo;Made in France.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I believe you are right. If we are to have an industrial revival&mdash;and the present Government <Col N="327" /> are the people who boast that they promoted Irish industries&mdash;why in the name of goodness cannot we start to produce the things which are bought at home before we try to talk about an export market?</P>
      <P>A considerable sum of money leaves this country every year on the purchase of items such as I have mentioned.  It would be a definite advantage&mdash;I am sure it might become a dollar earner&mdash; if those crosses could be manufactured at least somewhere in Ireland.  When the Undeveloped Areas Bill gets into its stride, I hope that that will be considered.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say on this Estimate, a Chinn Chomhairle, but I should like the Minister to take serious note of my remarks, particularly in reference to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not know whether, at this stage, it is too late for the Government to reconsider the matter.  I think it is going to make it very difficult to carry on unless land drainage is attended to.</P>
      <P>The drainage of the land of this country has been neglected for a very considerable time past.  There are acres of land which would give a good return if only it were properly drained. I think that in the year 1851 it was estimated that we had 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country.  During the emergency the tillage inspectors deemed every acre of land which was not under bog or water to be arable land and yet it was estimated that we had only 10,500,000 acres of arable land.  What has become of the other 1,500,000 acres in the course of 100 years?  The answer is that that area of land is now flooded. Immediate action should be taken to remedy that situation.  A man on the opposite benches could tell me that such land would not be fit for food production this year but I say that a man should be able to turn his cattle and sheep on that land or till it instead of having to drain it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that little time is left in this debate to enter upon any lengthy argumentative statements or to attempt to reiterate some of the criticism which has been continuously made by members of the Opposition in the course of this debate. I intend to confine myself to a number of proposals which are, I think, related to the present situation which faces this country&mdash;bearing in mind the fact that next week we shall have an opportunity of discussing the Budget and of dealing with the more fiscal aspects of the situation.</P>
      <P>I recall that on a few occasions before the change of Government, when major debates were in progress in this House, the then Opposition were taunted that not only was criticism their proper rôle but that if they were not prepared to accept Government policy, they should put forward their own policy.  I remember very distinctly that on at least two occasions the present Tánaiste, then Deputy Lemass, replied that it was not the responsibility of the Opposition to formulate policy but rather that of the Government. He indicated that the responsibility of the Opposition was to criticise Government policy and to subject it to examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As usual, in respect of most important matters, when Deputy Lemass and his colleagues crossed the floor of the House they changed not merely their seats but their tune.  On a number of occasions in the course of this debate, they have sought declarations of policy from members of the Opposition Parties.  It is obvious that the information available to those of us on the Opposition side of the House is limited compared with the information which is available to the Government.  I feel, however, that the fact that one is in opposition does not entitle a person to confine himself to criticism alone, however effective it may be.  Therefore, I shall try to enumerate, not at length, a number of proposals which, I think, should receive attention.  The fact that these proposals are being made will <Col N="329" /> indicate an attempt to deal with the immediate situation which concerns us.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if we are to have a realistic and practical approach to the economic situation which confronts this country one primary essential is that the Government itself should, in the first instance, make up its mind as to what situation is, in fact, facing the country and in what direction it is likely to develop.  Since July of last year we have heard speeches, both inside and outside this House, by various Government spokesmen and in these speeches a variety of descriptions have been applied to the country's economic situation.  The Minister for Finance, in his speeches, described the situation as &ldquo;a crisis&rdquo;. The Minister for Industry and Commerce expressed the view that the situation was serious&mdash;but he refrained from going quite as far as his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  In an early debate on the Central Bank Report, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs indicated that he took almost as grave a view of the situation as the Minister for Finance.  Then, last week, he came along and warned us that while the situation was serious we should not take precipitate action or any steps that might have serious repercussions.  We heard words such as &ldquo;crisis,&rdquo;&ldquo;depression,&rdquo;&ldquo;business recession&rdquo;&mdash;and now we hear people playing about with the words &ldquo;deflation&rdquo; and &ldquo;inflation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the time of the issue of the Central Bank Report we were warned of inflation.  Many Government spokesmen referred to the dangers of inflation and warned that steps would be necessary to avoid inflation.  We are now told that the danger which is facing us is, possibly, deflation.  All this reminds me of an earlier occasion when exactly the same confusion was manifested by leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were then in opposition.  On one occasion sitting side by side on the benches, Deputy Lemass, the present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, spoke of deflation as being the danger and the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, spoke of inflation as being the danger.  I do not <Col N="330" /> expect individual members of the Government to be more expert on economic affairs than any ordinary citizen.  Perhaps it is well that the affairs of the country are not determined solely by economic experts because they have so often been proved wrong that one is entitled to question their claim to be experts.  We have only to recall that as far back as 1929 the economic experts foretold that the United States of America were entering upon a period of continued prosperity.</P>
    <P>In a matter of months after the making of that prophecy the greatest economic crash that ever befell that country occurred&mdash;a crisis that is still present although covered by the war and by the situation which has arisen in regard to war danger and rearmament. We have had exactly the same experience in our own country.  Therefore, it is not fair to expect from individual members of the Government the expert qualifications to deal with an economic situation which are claimed by economic experts and university professors.  On the other hand we are entitled to expect from them, as a body, collective responsibility.  They have an advantage in so far as they are a single Party Government.  It is reasonable to expect at least agreement amongst themselves as to what terms to apply to the present situation. It is necessary that there should be that agreement so as to give the people of this country some guidance not merely as to the character of the economic set-back which, quite definitely, we are experiencing but also as to the lines that economic set-back may take.  It may get worse or it may start to ease and thus bring about an improved situation.  If we face what is regarded as the danger of inflation we shall have to take entirely different steps from those which would be required to deal with a deflationary situation.  If we are facing a business recession then different remedies are required for that situation from those which would be required for an economic crisis.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks I have heard, on many occasions, business men complaining of the confusion which is apparent in the statements <Col N="331" /> uttered by responsible Government spokesmen.  These statements betray a conflict of policies and a conflict in their outlook on the present situation of the country.  That is apparent from the conflicting descriptions of the problem which has to be tackled&mdash; apart altogether from the different solutions advocated.  From that point of view, the primary responsibility must be accepted by the Government of clarifying its own mind as to the situation that exists so that at least in so far as they speak officially on behalf of the Government and try to give guidance to the country, Government spokesmen will not create further confusion in the minds of our people and particularly those who are charged with responsibility in regard to industry and to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The second point to which I think attention should be directed is the increase which took place last week in the bank rate.  Under existing conditions, it is futile to complain of the bank rate being increased, as we have no power to control it, but we should be aware of what consequences are likely to flow from it.  To the ordinary man the increase in the bank rate means dearer money.  Whatever may be the description we apply to the present situation, it is quite clear that we have a problem which at the least can be referred to as a depression and which in many minds could be regarded as a crisis.  We have considerably increased unemployment.  We have increasing difficulty in the main industries. We have the problem of providing money for our many services and carrying through our general public works programme.  In that situation, it is clear that any steps taken to make money dearer&mdash;and therefore have the increased cost of that money carried right through the whole process either of industry or public works administration, and reflected normally in the prices paid by consumers&mdash;are not going to be helpful.  Secondly, it will have a retarding effect on any steps we may take towards recovery and restoration of the normal level of employment.  To complain of that is at the moment largely a waste of words.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste was speaking to <Col N="332" /> the House and indicated the Government viewpoint on the control of credit and money, he said it must be made available and placed at the service of the community as a whole, subject to suitable safeguards.  The time has arrived when either the present Government or some other Government should seriously consider examining that position, to see if it is possible to introduce legislation that will make available to the Government, whatever Government is in power, the possibility of at least exercising some control in regard to money and credit.  Otherwise, our whole effort to bring about an industrial and agricultural expansion and raise the general economic level will, if not faced with insuperable difficulties, at least have to be carried on under difficulties which otherwise could be avoided.  In so far as that is an approach that cannot be dealt with immediately, while I feel it is one which all the sections of the House would give support, we should have regard to what can be done immediately to try to offset the more dire effects that will flow from an increase in the bank rate.</P>
    <P>While there may be differences of opinion as to how far bank credit has been restricted in the country during the past 12 months, we can at least agree that if the banks are going to charge a higher price for money naturally there is going to be more difficulty in individuals securing that money accommodation from the banks, depending on their individual positions. In passing, I think it is only proper to make the point that, irrespective of what might have been stated by the banks officially in order to secure restriction of credit, the very figures they have themselves published indicative of activity over the past 12 months are merely reflecting not any great increase in bank credit but rather only the increase in the total volume of money and credit necessitated by the general rise is prices.  As far as I can see, if there has not been an actual restriction&mdash;and in my own opinion there has been, as I have heard many expressions of it&mdash;quite clearly there has not been the increased accommodation that the banks are claiming credit for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> If we are going to meet&mdash;and undoubtedly we will have to, in face of the higher bank rate&mdash;this difficulty of businessmen of every type and description finding it more difficult to obtain facilities that they require to enable them to overcome the present industrial difficulties, we should see if it is possible to utilise any of the available machinery that might ease the situation. We have in the Industrial Credit Company and the Industrial Credit Corporation two bodies that the Government could quite readily use, at least to some limited extent, to ease the position, that is going to be created by this dearer money policy.  Even if it required expanded operations by these two bodies on a basis where the same strict regard would not be paid to the question of security as in their normal operation, and even if that should be necessary in the form of assistance from the Government, I think, in the interest of assisting industry in particular to overcome the present difficulties, it is a matter that should be examined to see if there are any possibilities in that direction.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, in so far as the higher bank rate is concerned, we have especially in relation to industry, and particularly the industries most severely hit at the moment&mdash;that is, clothing, textiles and boots and shoes&mdash;a situation where the question of the availability of credit on the lowest reasonable terms will be in many ways a deciding factor as to how long it will take these industries to overcome the present set-back.  In the clothing and textile trade, the general explanation made by the leaders of these industries is that the pipe-line from the manufacturer to the consumer is choked at certain points with an accumulation of high-priced garments and materials.</P>
    <P>For one reason or another, those who are in possession of those high-priced products are reluctant to cut their losses and dispose of them at prices the consumers are prepared to pay. Consequently, the pipe-line is choked and right from the commencement of the industrial cycle there is stagnation, unemployment and short-time working. The general view is that as soon as <Col N="334" /> that block in the pipe-line can be removed we can start to see a return to more normal conditions.  Quite clearly, if the manufacturer, the wholesaler or the retailer has got such an accumulation and is not prepared to take drastic measures to cut his losses and try to relieve himself of the stocks at reduced prices and suffer the loss himself, the only alternative is some form of assistance in the way of credit which would enable him to do so, so that he could spread his losses over a longer period.  Normally, this type of business depression or crisis in our system of society is solved by wholesale bankruptcies and liquidations and by the ordinary crises of the individual manufacturers that we have come across so many times.  On this occasion, that possible solution&mdash;we would all regret it because of its general effect on economy&mdash;is not happening.  Whether it is that the resources available to the various manufacturers and wholesalers have enabled them to withstand that situation, there is a deadlock in industrial production and it is essential to find some way of breaking it.</P>
    <P>As far as the increased figures for unemployment are concerned, they mainly show themselves in regard to two main industries in both of which we have the same problem of accumulation of high-priced stocks that are beyond the capacity of the consumer to buy at the present moment.  If we find ways and means&mdash;and it is a matter that would require very careful examination&mdash;of making money available, particularly in those two industries, and of providing the credit facilities which would enable the industries gradually to relieve themselves of those high-priced stock accumulations, we would assist the restoration of the industrial cycle; and the cost of that measure could be spread over a longer period so as not to throw too great a financial burden on the industries themselves.</P>
    <P>In so far as the higher bank rate is concerned, it is of particular importance that we should examine it in relation to what is generally accepted as one of the main methods of dealing with the type of economic set-back we have in the country at the moment, <Col N="335" /> that is, in the general programme of public works.  Complaints have been made on many occasions about the growing delay in the public works programme and housing activities.  It has been suggested that that delay has shown itself in reduced activity in the building trade and a slowing down in public works employment.  Again I am not concerned with making a case as to whether that is correct or not but it is quite clear that, unless we offset the effect of the higher bank rate so far as the cost of money for public works activity or the housing programme is concerned, we must of necessity have a falling back in the general activity.</P>
    <P>If we accept that in a period of depression and unemployment one of the most valuable ways of offsetting that situation, of not merely priming the economic machine but of providing employment for idle men in particular, is the initiation of a public works programme, quite clearly it is of importance to ensure that our existing public works programme in its broadest aspect should not slow up, particularly at the present time, because the price of money has been increased by factors that at the moment are outside the control of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>There is a number of smaller aspects of the matter that we should try to have examined.  I feel that in regard to industry in particular there is a number of aspects that, from the point of view of the industrialists themselves, should be examined.  Every one of us is familiar with the kind of pyramiding of costings that takes place in industry.  We have the example of the increase, for argument's sake, of 1/- per unit in the cost of raw material and that increase finally being reflected in an increase of 5/- to 6/- in the retail price.  We know the argument that is put forward, that the wholesaler or the retailer working on percentage margins is entitled to receive a percentage on the increased costings.</P>
    <P>In the situation in many of our industries to-day it seems to me unwise, even from the point of view of the manufacturers, to apply that old policy of marking up percentages to the point <Col N="336" /> at which the prices of so many of our goods have gone beyond the capacity of the consumer to pay.  If a particular manufacturer or an agent or retailer is handling a certain volume of goods on which he receives a certain return, if we make allowance for the actual increased cost of handling a greater volume, there is no sound reason why he should automatically expect an increased income merely because the cost of the same volume has increased. I have seen that happening in regard to the boot and shoe trade.  Some time ago there was an adjustment made in regard to the price of cowhides.  It was accepted by the manufacturers that so far as the cost to the manufacturers of a pair of men's shoes was concerned the additional cost might be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1/- or 1/6d.  By the time that additional cost for raw material had shown itself in the retail shop the increase was 4/- or 5/-.  That was the start of a pyramiding in the boot and shoe trade which has led us to the present position in which the manufacturers themselves accept it that they are now holding stocks the price of which is beyond the capacity or the willingness of the consumer to pay.</P>
    <P>No hardship would have been imposed anywhere along the line if the cost had not been pyramided by this system of adding percentages.  I have referred to this matter before as being something into which the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Prices Tribunal might inquire.  At the same time the manufacturers and wholesalers in particular should examine the matter in the hope that by getting prices back to a more realistic basis we may induce a resumption of purchases by the consumers in general.</P>
    <P>We have been urged of late to have regard to our foreign trade position, to the balance of imports and exports. I have already mentioned that I think there could be careful examination of our import list.  So far as the balance of payments is concerned, the import list could be pruned of many high-priced luxury articles without creating the problem that arises from a reduction of imports in general, that is, the <Col N="337" /> creation of pockets of unemployment in many semi-manufacturing and assembling industries.  I imagine that an examination of our import list would reveal a considerable number of articles, small, possibly, in respect of volume and certainly small in respect of their importance in the country, the prices of which have a very marked effect on the total value of our imports. Such an examination could quite readily be put in hand.</P>
    <P>So far as exports are concerned, it has been agreed, and I share in the agreement, that any effort we can make in that direction must naturally flow from the agricultural industry. Our industries are not yet sufficiently developed, although a number of them have been able to enter the export market successfully.  A number of them, particularly the boot and shoe trade, have come up against difficulties on the English market, that have almost closed the door on them. Nevertheless, in so far as clothing and the boot and shoe trade are concerned there is a fairly widely accepted belief that in relation to our consumption we are suffering to some extent from too great productive capacity.  It is necessary to examine the possibility of securing export markets.  In the boot and shoe trade it is well known that, even before the war, on the basis of the number of factories then in existence working at full capacity, they could provide only nine months' work in the year for the total labour force in the industry.  Since then, seven or eight additional factories have been established in the trade.  While I am not one who believes that there can be such a thing as overproduction so long as men and women are in need of footwear and clothes, we can have it as a relevant factor in relation to our present economic standards.  That is the situation that exists, particularly in the boot and shoe trade, and also in the clothing trade.  Therefore, apart altogether from the need to increase exports from the point of view of our balance of payments, there is a need, from the point of view of the domestic situation, in these two industries in particular, to try to find an outlet for their productive capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> Quite clearly, the repeated calls for increased production raise an entirely different problem in our present situation. We have already got in regard to clothing and apparel of all kinds greater production than our people are able to consume at the moment.  We have now the situation that there are more boots and shoes in the country than we can wear, more clothes than the consumers require, having regard to their purchasing capacity.  Increased production, merely from the point of view of an increased volume of goods, will add to the existing problem.</P>
    <P>What must be envisaged in the present situation is lower production costs which will enable us to dispose of our goods in the internal market at prices which our people can pay or to export those goods at competitive prices.  I may be told, of course, that the best way to do that is to reduce wages but, of course, that would be starting a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>What I would suggest is that what has been repeatedly proposed by the trade union movement and by the Labour Party, and which has not been found very readily acceptable by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, might now be given serious attention, that is, the possibility of bringing into direct contact with the problems of production and management the workers engaged in these industries.  We had an approach to that by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce in the previous Fianna Fáil Government in relation to his Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill and there was very wide support for it from the Labour movement as a whole.  There was a certain provision of a very general character which at least represented a commencement of the association of workers with the problems of production and efficiency.  During the period of office of the previous Government, a very definite approach on the same lines was made by the Irish Trade Union Congress, but, while sympathy was expressed, with the hope that the proposals put forward would be voluntarily accepted by employers and manufacturers, the feeling was against any step being taken by the Government to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> In the situation we are facing now something more than mere appeals to the employers is required.  Quite clearly, there must be within the general body of workers in every industry a pool of expert knowledge which can be brought to bear on the daily practical problems that arise in these industries, and on many of the improvements and short cuts that could be given effect to; but if we are going to draw from that pool, somebody has to take the responsibility of giving assurances to these workers that, if results are secured, the results will be shared between the two parties who constitute industry in this country. If there is increased production or if production costs are brought down and there is thereby a gain in various manufacturing units, there must be an assurance that the workers will not receive merely a very polite &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;, with the monetary gains that have been made shown as the profits are shown in this list of company profits which I have before me.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I suggested that steps might be taken to examine the possibility of providing some form of credit which would make possible an easing of the present accumulation of high-priced stocks in industry.  May I suggest in this connection that if we look at the old problem which we have been discussing for so long here, the problem of an excess profits tax, we may find a basis upon which we would be able to repay any credit which might have to be made available for that easement of the present position of a number of industries.  We have conflicting viewpoints with regard to excess profits taxes both in regard to the morality of imposing them and the practicability of collecting them, but in so far as that tax is one which only starts to produce results after the lapse of a certain period, it would provide resources at a time when they could be utilised to meet the debt created by the provision of this credit for industry.</P>
    <P>So far as the morality of imposing them is concerned, an excess profits tax was imposed by the present Government when they were previously in <Col N="340" /> office and certainly, so far as company profits now are concerned, there is, in my opinion, a perfect justification for collecting some of these excess profits. If it is felt that they should not be utilised for a general fiscal purpose, they could at least be applied to the immediate needs of industry itself. When one goes through lists of company reports and finds figures of increases in net profits from £20,000 to £98,000, it is indicative of the fact that there is a situation that requires examination and that there is money surplus to what was regarded as their normal earning capacity which could quite readily be called upon to ease the very difficult situation existing in a number of our industries at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer only very briefly to agriculture.  Like many other Deputies, I have confessed publicly on a number of occasions my ignorance of agriculture. I find, however, that, so far as the formulation of a policy which would bring about an increase in agricultural production&mdash;not productivity, which we have seen has increased&mdash;is concerned, I am in the company of many others in the House, because all Parties and all Governments so far have failed to provide a policy which can show effective results.  While my ignorance cannot be excused, at least it appears to produce no worse results than those who claim to speak from experience but whose experience has not yet provided us with an acceptable policy.</P>
    <P>If we are concerned with the question of increased production of crops which we are at present importing, an increase in our available foodstuffs from native resources, through increased tillage, and, following on from that, the question of employment on the land, we might examine the possibility of tying up our prices with the idea of higher prices for increased production, increased tillage percentage and volume of employment; in other words, if a certain price is given for wheat as a basic price, there can be an added inducement to the farmer who, from his particular piece of land, produces a greater relative volume whether of wheat, sugar beet or any other crop, and who in that production <Col N="341" /> engages in a greater percentage of tillage and employs a greater percentage of labour.</P>
    <P>As one largely outside the problem of agriculture and speaking purely as a city inhabitant, it seems to me that one of the problems we are faced with, with all due respect to Deputy Finan, is that farmers have so many irons in the fire that they are fairly well able to pick and choose, and, while I would be hesitant to criticise the intensity of their work or the effort they are putting into agriculture, it is nevertheless correct that the criticism I have heard from farmers and from members of farmers' families, speaking with firsthand knowledge, is not indicative of that effort being put in that Deputy Finan claims credit for.  There may be very good reasons for that, but I went through the Midlands some days ago and at a quarter to ten in the morning, I discovered that, although I had left the city engaged fully in the commencement of its working day there were many miles of countryside which, as I passed through them, were completely dead.  Nobody was up or moving around.  There may be good reasons for that, but that was the picture and many people have told me that it is not an unusual occurrence.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Dr. Browne last week referred to the social responsibility of farmers to the community in relation to the proper utilisation of their land and his remarks appear to have raised a storm in the dovecotes.  I am one of those who feel that not merely farmers but every other individual member of the community has a social responsibility. Where we are dealing with land which is limited in its extent in this nation, where there is, in fact, as far as the present occupiers are concerned, a form of monopoly&mdash;for land is not freely available to every citizen&mdash;we must of necessity accept that responsibility. Particularly when we recall that those who are and who have been engaged in a process of buying out the land would not have had that opportunity were it not for the nation as a whole, the people of the cities as well as of the countryside, it would not be fit or proper that where a man is not alone not making proper use of his <Col N="342" /> land but abusing it, the community as a whole must stand outside the hedge and allow him to keep on abusing it irrespective of the harm he is doing to the community.</P>
    <P>Having said so much I should like to put a question: If tillage is so important at the present time, if the production of such crops as wheat, sugar beet, barley, oats, etc., is of such importance to our economy, is there any reason why the Government should not undertake some of this work directly on the land?  We build houses and roads directly, we are engaged in the production of steel, we have undertaken the production of electric power, so if we have idle land in the hands of the Land Commission or obtainable on a rent basis, why should it not be obtained by a Government agency and tilled for our people when we do not get enough tillage from the farming community?  I do not see why the Government should not do so.  It may be argued that it would be uneconomic, that the cost would be too high or, as we are always told when we speak of State activity, that the State should keep its hand out of other people's affairs, but if, in the Government's view, the position is as serious as they maintain, then they are not entitled to relieve themselves of the responsibility to produce food on land which at the moment is not being used but which could be used for the benefit of the nation.</P>

      <P>The situation with which we have to deal does not require any technical terms to describe it; it can be stated very simply.  This community is living above its income, spending more than it earns and consuming more than it produces.  We know what would happen in the case of an individual if that position was to continue; it is equally true for a community and for a State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This living above our income is evidenced both in State finances and in the trading activities of the community. We are coming now close to the end of this financial year.  Changes may take place within this week.  We may get some moneys in and there may be some reduction in expenditure but the best estimate given to us a little while ago is that we are likely to end this financial <Col N="343" /> year with a deficit of £4,000,000 on the current account.</P>

      <P>The best estimate given to me&mdash;not for the purpose of deceiving me or anybody else&mdash;was that unless there are some exceptional changes in the week we were likely to end this financial year with a deficit of £4,000,000 on the current side and that is sufficiently serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the capital side, accepting even for argument the view that has been taken about certain capital items by the previous Government, we are going to finish with a deficit of £13,000,000. This £17,000,000 has not been provided for in the year's Estimates but the Minister for Finance has had to meet that £17,000,000 which no amount of rhetoric and no amount of special <Col N="344" /> pleading can conjure away.  The expenditure on the capital side this year was £38,000,000.  To meet that there was, as well as certain other revenue, the £24,000,000 from the Counterpart Fund in connection with the Marshall Aid loan.  That was needed to meet these capital outgoings and we have not got that for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Let me try to look forward into the year ahead, from the figures that are available practically to everybody.  We have in this Book of Estimates the sum of £95,000,000 for the public services for the coming year.  There is in that sum the sum of £9,000,000 odd for what are not accepted by us as being properly capital items at all.  It is probable that not even one-half of the items in that figure would be accepted as capital, but let us concede that for the moment, take it all as capital and put it to the capital side and we will be left with £86,000,000 for our current expenses on the current side.  Now as it happens if you look at the revenue side you will see that in the current year it is running at about £84,000,000 or something over.  Let us concede that it will go up even by £2,000,000&mdash;which may be a very doubtful assumption&mdash;for the coming year at existing rates.</P>
    <P>We have a revenue of £86,000,000 to meet the supply services only and then what about the Central Fund services? The Central Fund services for the coming year have been estimated, as the Minister for Finance has told you, at £13,000,000.  There is nothing in this Book of Estimates to meet that; there is nothing in this revenue of £86,000,000, which would be the probable revenue at the present rate, to meet that; therefore, there is a gap in the current account, even conceding this £9,000,000, of no less than £13,000,000.  That gap has got to be bridged.  How is it to be bridged?</P>
    <P>There is, first of all, the method of cutting down expenditure, or the method of increasing taxation so as to bridge the gap, or a combination of the two.  That is, diminishing expenditure&mdash;where possible or where thought more desirable than increasing taxation &mdash;or else increasing taxation.  Now, there is no way in which you can conjure away that situation.  This House <Col N="345" /> and the community as a whole have got to face up to it, unless we are to continue living and having a good time, as the former Minister for Finance told us to have.  Any waster who inherits a good property can have a good time as long as it lasts but we have not inexhaustible resources in this country to meet such a situation.  We have, as a community, to face up to the responsibility of changing the situation so that we shall get within a reasonable distance, in as short a time as possible, of living within our income.</P>
    <P>We are told we can borrow.  One would imagine that borrowing was a simple matter, that it had no consequences. If you borrow and if you mean to repay the loan, you must at least see that the money that you get by borrowing is applied in a way that will give you a return which will pay for the charges upon it.  That is something which the borrower, whether it is the State or the individual that is concerned, will have to bear in mind. You have got to see that the product of the activities made possible by what you borrow will repay the charges, that is if it is going to be anything like a long-term matter.  Exceptional positions have to be met exceptionally. You can borrow to meet the consequences of a great disaster that happens once and may not be expected to happen again in a generation, to the extent to which you would be able to meet the charges upon the sum borrowed, but you cannot keep on borrowing for recurrent expenditure. There is no sense in it as the annual charges would soon surpass the annual capital expenditure.  There is no point in borrowing for recurrent expenditure.</P>
    <P>We are told we have foreign assets that we can realise.  It is very conveniently forgotten that these foreign assets are at the moment serving a very useful purpose.  They help to bridge the gap between our visible imports and our visible exports&mdash;or portion of the gap.  If you realise these assets, you do away with that income and you diminish reserves which are of great value.  They would be of great value in the case of any individual and they are of tremendous value to the nation.  Again these <Col N="346" /> reserves are limited.  They are not unlimited, as some people would suggest by their arguments.  Borrowing then is something which cannot be lightly resorted to.  Borrowing is not a thing which is always possible.  The individual finds that out very readily.</P>
    <P>If he is credit-worthy, if it is felt that the money that is given to him will be used by him in a productive manner so that the charges can be met, then his credit is good and he can borrow.  If he behaves otherwise, he will be treated differently and he may not be able to borrow.  The State is not relieved from considerations of that kind.  When we have to borrow we have to see first of all whether we can afford to borrow.  Equally we have to see that the money that we borrow and the obligations we incur can properly be met by us.</P>
    <P>Let me come for a moment to the trading position of the community. There has been a good deal of reference, very properly, to this question of the balance of payments.  We gave the figure for 1951, a figure that was given to us by those who are expert and whose business it is to give the best forecast they can of what is likely to be the position in regard to statistical matters.  The figure of £66,000,000 was given to us as a provisional figure&mdash;of course, provisional.  That was the latest figure we had got as the provisional deficit on our balance of payments account.  Now we are told that we need not bother so much about that. It is suggested that we are making too much of it, that we regard it as too serious.  The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the situation is not a serious one but that there is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I think that is simply a matter of words.  The problem would not be there if the situation were not there. A serious problem would not be there if there was not a serious situation there.  That he cannot fail to regard the situation as serious, is evident by the quotation, which was given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, of what Deputy Costello said when he was in the responsible position of head of the Government in 1948.  When there was <Col N="347" /> a deficit of £30,000,000 it was a matter causing the utmost alarm&mdash;in fact it was a cause of dismay.  He surely cannot object to our speaking of the situation as serious when the balance is at least twice as much.  This balance of payments deficit represents consumption, or if I might use the term, represents a using-up or the getting-in from outside of things beyond those which we pay for either by our invisible or visible exports.  That represents a diminution of our net external assets of £66,000,000.  Since the war, if that figure should prove to be accurate ultimately, the £66,000,000 added to the millions in deficit up to 1950, would mean a decrease of £156,000,000 in our net external assets. The greater part of that £156,000,000 occurred in the last few years, since the war.  During the war, because we were not getting in goods that we would otherwise have got in, our external assets increased by about £162,000,000, so that when you take the deficit of £156,000,000 you have practically exhausted whatever increase you had got during the war. That ought to be an indication of what this balance of payments problem means to us.  We are at the moment a creditor nation.  Let that go on for a few years more and we will cease to be a creditor nation and will become a debtor nation with all the dangers and all the disadvantages of such a position.</P>
    <P>As regards our external assets, it is no harm for us to have a look and see what is their amount.  An unofficial estimate which, so far as I know, has not been seriously questioned, was made at the beginning of 1949.  That estimate was that our gross external assets were about £400,000,000.  As against that, there was a claim on us of £175,000,000, leaving a net credit on our side of £225,000,000.  How much of that has been exhausted since?  That £225,000,000 may be regarded, then, as the amount which separated us from being a debtor nation at that time. How much of that has been exhausted since?  Since 1947, there were deficits of £30,000,000, £20,000,000, £10,000,000, £30,000,000 and now £66,000,000.  These <Col N="348" /> make up the £156,000,000 that I have been speaking of as being the total amount of our deficits.  I am wrong in that, inasmuch as I am beginning earlier than the year 1949 in which the calculation of the £225,000,000 was made.  If I begin with the deficit of £10,000,000 in 1949, we have a total deficit of £106,000,000 since 1949.  If we take off that the £6,000,000 that can be attributed to the Marshall Aid grant, we find that there is a net diminution of £100,000,000.  In other words, the amount that separates us to-day and makes us a creditor, instead of being a debtor nation, is £125,000,000.  If we were to continue at any rate like the present rate, with a deficit in the balance of payments of £60,000,000 or £66,000,000, how long would that last? In another couple of years we would have exhausted it, so that we are far from having to deal with what may be called a long-term problem.  We are dealing with an urgent and an immediate problem, one that any Government that took its position seriously would have to set out and remedy and check.</P>
    <P>If we look at how that £66,000,000 is made up, we find that if you take the sterling countries, leaving Britain and the Six Counties out of account, we would have over £20,000,000 on the wrong side.  If you take the non-sterling E.P.U. countries, you find that we are about £28,000,000 on the wrong side.  If you take the dollar area, you find that we are about £23,000,000 on the wrong side.  If you take other countries, you find that we are about £9,000,000 on the wrong side, and that the only place where we have a credit balance is with Britain and the Six Counties.  With Britain and the Six Counties we have a credit of about £14,000,000.  Therefore, if you take the £20,000,000 on the wrong side with the £14,000,000 on the right side, that leaves us with £6,000,000 on the wrong side in regard to the whole of the sterling area.  That is roughly how these figures work out.</P>
    <P>We have to try and remedy the position in the way in which it can best be remedied.  We are told, of course, here that whenever we do anything in our own interests, which happens to be <Col N="349" /> something like the British are doing, we are following the British and that the British are telling us what to do. We used not to be told that on other occasions by some people who are talking about it now.  But if our house should be on fire and we use a fire extinguisher, are we not to use it because the British house is on fire also and they are using a fire extinguisher? We are using the methods, or will use the methods, which seem to us best to meet our own circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have, if I may go into the matter, an interest in sterling.  Our external assets are mainly in sterling.  85 per cent.  of our exports go to the sterling area and are paid for in sterling.  We have an interest in sterling and in the fate of sterling and we would not be wise in our own interests if we did not co-operate in the measures which seem to be necessary to preserve the position of sterling.  We make no excuses whatever for doing it.  We do it in our own interest because it is right and proper that we should do it.  We have, then, in our own interest to try to remedy the position in which we find ourselves with a deficit of £66,000,000 in the balance of payments.  Just as in the case of Exchequer finance, we can do it in two different ways or by a combination of the two, that is by cutting down imports and by increasing exports.  If you can get a better combination, then the thing is to use that combination.  On every occasion on which we have spoken of these remedies we have said that the best way is to increase production and thereby increase our exports and all our energies ought to be directed towards that end.  If the steps we can take in that regard do not seem to be sufficient then we shall have to deal with the other side of the account and try to narrow the gap by cutting out unnecessary imports.  By a combination of these two methods we may achieve our purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance indicated certain steps we propose to take in this regard.  The import list has been carefully examined and he has indicated what he proposes to do in regard to it.  He is cutting down the dollar imports.  In the latter half of the year <Col N="350" /> such imports will work out at an annual rate of about £12,000,000.  In regard to the others, it will work out at an annual rate of not more than £18,000,000 in the second half of 1952. He is examining very carefully the imports from other countries in an effort to find out which of these can be cut out and what would be a fair target at which to aim.  We are doing that in our own interests apart altogether from our interest in sterling, because if that gap were to continue it would in a very short time exhaust our resources.</P>
    <P>Let me return now to borrowing. What are the limits to borrowing?  Are there any limits up to which we can borrow even for productive purposes here?  From the beginning we have made it quite clear that we believe in the full development of our national resources to the extent to which the means of our community will permit. We did not give our programme any high-sounding titles.  We did not talk in technical terms about capital formation and all the rest of it, but all the time we were carefully implementing our programme and carrying out the work.</P>
    <P>From the day on which we first took office our aim has been to develop the resources of our country to the utmost extent.  We still believe in that policy. There is, however, a limit to what is possible.  There is a limit to the capital one can get.  Ordinarily capital development should be financed out of current savings, while current expenditure must be met out of current income. What is the rate of saving of the community generally?  If we take the &ldquo;small&rdquo; savings in the first instance we find the level is somewhere in the region of £6,000,000.  I agree absolutely with the suggestion that there should be a campaign to try to increase savings.  I think it was Deputy Declan Costello who mentioned that matter in particular.  We ought to do everything in our power to increase small savings because they would then be available for capital development.</P>
    <P>I have said that those savings are at the moment running in the region of about £6,000,000 per annum.  That sum will not take us very far on the <Col N="351" /> road to £35,000,000 which seems to be the sum required in the coming year: £26,000,000 below the line and £9,000,000 above give a capital programme of £35,000,000.  As well as the £13,000,000 for current expenditure there is this £35,000,000 to be found for capital purposes.  Now the £6,000,000 representing the &ldquo;small&rdquo; savings of the community will not go very far towards meeting that bill.</P>
    <P>Where then can we go for it?  We have the possibility of a public loan. Remember, there is no more Marshall Aid.  There was some reference to Marshall Aid as if it was something that had not to be repaid.  The words of the previous Taoiseach are the best proof that that is not so.  These moneys are borrowed moneys in every sense. We will not have that money this year to help us to bridge the gap.  We shall, therefore, have to get the money by other means.</P>
    <P>Can we do it by means of a public loan?  What has been the level of our public loans as representing the savings available for Government purposes? There were three loans&mdash;in 1948, 1949 and 1950&mdash;and they averaged less than £9,000,000.  The average subscription was less than £9,000,000 from the ordinary people, leaving the banks out of it altogether.  That was the amount of savings the ordinary people were prepared to hand over for Government purposes.  £9,000,000 and £6,000,000 give a sum of £15,000,000. The level, therefore, of the ordinary savings on which one can rely is less than £20,000,000, even taking a generous figure.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figures available in relation to the balance of payments and so on, and we will find that, from another point of view, that figure is borne out.  It is possible that one will occasionally get exceptional circumstances which will give one an exceptional response when, for instance, there have not been any public issues for a period.  In such circumstances one may get a particularly good response.</P>
    <P>We have been blamed for not seeking a loan last July but last July we <Col N="352" /> had to deal with another operation. That was the conversion of existing loans and it would have been a most unsuitable time at which to float a new loan for public subscription.  I merely deal with that in passing. There are other considerations governing the matter, but I need not go into them at the moment.</P>
    <P>If we were thinking in terms of capital development as something which would continue over a period of years, in our present position something in the region of £20,000,000 would be the limit which we could finance unless we begin to realise&mdash;and, remember, this is always the last resort of people who are put into a corner and asked where the money is to come from&mdash;our external assets.  I have explained to the House the position with regard to our external assets, the extent to which they have been reduced and the reserve that is left to us.  One cannot realise these external assets whenever one wants.  A certain proportion of these must of necessity be kept and they must be retained in a readily available form.  As to the balance, in certain circumstances if you realise them, you have to face a loss. I am told that the Minister for Finance has had to realise assets during the last year at a considerable loss. If then we try to supplement what we can get from current savings by drawing on our past savings&mdash;we will agree with the Opposition or with anybody else who says: &ldquo;There is work to be done in this country which would be productive.  Utilise any resources that we have up to a certain limit&mdash;because certain reserves are necessary&mdash;provided always that the manner in which you use them gives you a return commensurate with the return which you forgo by realising these assets.&rdquo;  As I have said already, when you realise assets you are losing your capital in the first instance, you will never have it again, in that form anyhow, and you are forgoing the income which that capital produces and which is made use of year by year.</P>
    <P>The prospect, therefore, for the coming year for the Government is that they have somehow to meet a gap of £13,000,000 on the current side, again <Col N="353" /> accepting for argument's sake the view that was taken by the Opposition in regard to some of these capital items, and the sum of £35,000,000 has to be got on the capital side.  Towards that £35,000,000 I have shown what are the sums which are likely to be available either by way of public loan or by way of smaller savings.  It does not go half way towards meeting the bill.  If we are to have a programme of capital development which is to be of value, as a rule you have to continue it year after year.  You have to provide sums of almost similar amount each year. Here, as in the case of the current side of our account, we are faced with difficulties.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Opposition, one would imagine that a Government loved to put taxation on the people. You would imagine it was a delight for a Government to tax the people. Everybody knows that, in the case of a democratic Government, going to the people for support and depending on them for popular support, taxing the people is a very distasteful thing for a Government to have to do.  The trouble about it is that Governments shirk their duty in that respect and will not do it when it becomes necessary, when it is in the interest of the public welfare that it should be done. I say that the previous Government did not do it when they should have done it in view of their commitments. This Government will do their duty anyhow.</P>
    <P>I shall not anticipate the work that will have to be done by the Minister for Finance when he introduces the Budget.  A sum of £13,000,000 has got to be met by hook or by crook.  That has to be got on the current side.  Then there is a development programme of £35,000,000 and that will have to be abandoned in part or else the money to finance it will have to be got.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we want the services contained in the Book of Estimates, we have to pay for them and we have to get the money to pay for them.  If we have not got the money and are not prepared to provide the money, we must forgo some of the services.  If we want the services, we must go and get the money.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is a magnificent time <Col N="354" /> for an Opposition.  The Opposition is always able to say whenever there is any question of further public services, that the Government are not going nearly far enough, that they are not spending nearly enough and they should spend more and more.  But, of course, when it comes to paying for these services the Opposition are out at full gallop in the attack telling us that we must not impose taxation on the people, that it is a burden on the people.  Of course we know it is a burden, but it is a burden which must be borne if we are to have the services for which the money is to be provided.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back on some of the statements or the arguments, some of them very silly arguments, that have been put forward in this debate.  I prefer to leave it in the terms in which I have given it, to state the facts and the conclusions. The facts are these deficits both on the current side and the capital side and on the trading side with regard to our external payments.  The conclusion is that we want to get out of that position, to prevent it from deteriorating and becoming really dangerous.  I have told you that it is no long-term problem which we have to deal with in regard to our external payments.  If we do not want these evil consequences to follow we have to face up to it and face the burden.  We must increase our production and diminish, in so far as it is necessary, our consumption; naturally diminished consumption is one of the things we least want to do, whether we regard it in a general way or look at it from the current point of view or from the capital point of view.</P>
    <P>Now that is the position and it is serious enough.  If the position that the former Taoiseach had to deal with was one that he could characterise as one of alarm, although it was quite different from the present situation&mdash; if that was one which he could describe in that way, I do not think he can regard the present situation as one that does not require at least a serious attitude on the part of every member of this House.</P>

Not only does it not look as serious as it was at Christmas time, but it does not look as serious as when the Minister for Finance opened the Vote on Account some few days ago. The deficit was supposed to be £10,000,000.  That was the figure that appeared to be fixed upon.  It is now £4,000,000.  The revenue is supposed to be running at £86,000,000.

Might I ask does the £4,000,000 include £3,000,000 for fuel losses?  There is nobody so crackpot as to believe that that is an item for inclusion in one year's Budget to be met out of savings or the exactions from the taxpayers in a particular year.  Is that true?  I suggest it is.  When we talk about the £4,000,000 or the £86,000,000 revenue, does the £86,000,000 include the £2,000,000 carry-over which I presented to my successor?  What about the economies which the Taoiseach, some time ago, put at £1,500,000 or £2,500,000?  They occur every year because the Departments provide for that at Budget periods.  I said before that I believe when the 31st March comes it will be found that the Budget <Col N="356" /> we have left will be nicely in balance omitting such nonsensical items as the £3,500,000 for fuel losses and counting in for the year only items such as increased pay for the Civil Service, the Gardaí and the teachers.  £100,000 from £2,000,000 is a substantial sum and that is in the kitty.  That has all to be reckoned as some addition to economies when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance talk about £84,000,000 and £86,000,000 revenue. They will not have long to wait to find out&mdash;ten days or so&mdash;until we get those calculations, unless there is trickery in the meantime.  However, trickery in the meantime can be easily detected when the revenue returns for this financial year and the new financial year start coming in.  It will be seen whether there has been any holding back of moneys which should fall into the Exchequer in this particular year.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to general financial matters might I refer to two or three minor points?  Can the Minister for Finance tell us what he is up to in regard to the Civil Service arbitration scheme?  At a meeting which took place yesterday and from stories otherwise heard we hear that the Minister for Finance is trying his best to break up the arbitration scheme which we gave to the civil servants, putting them on a par with industrial workers and other workers throughout the State.  The scheme has been in suspense, I understand, since last May. It was to have been put into operation inside a period of three weeks. That is the period of delay which people in the Civil Service Departments forecast when last I heard about it.  I understand that the Minister is now trying to impose three conditions on the Civil Service in connection with any scheme of arbitration. He has objected to political affiliation. There was a definite agreement which should have been left as it was.</P>

      <P>It has been a considerable source of worry to them for many years that there has not been a fair-minded approach to them, and that they were treated as slaves merely because they were the people nearest to the hand of the Government and on whom that hand could close ruthlessly.  For years in this House people from all Parties, except Fianna Fáil, kept faith with the Civil Service. While the inter-Party Government were in office we gave them a scheme of conciliation and arbitration which should have been continued.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to impose on them conditions with regard to political affiliation.  He has tried to impose upon them very, very narrow terms indeed with regard to agitation.  He could have come to an arrangement with them and there would be no necessity to write it into any scheme.  He could have come to a gentleman's arrangement with them that when a matter was <i>sub judice</i> there would be no question of agitation and that people desiring to have arbitration could pursue it eventually in the Arbitration Court, and agitation could be left out of it until the arbitrator had made an award.  I understand that the Minister is trying to force upon them conditions that awards will not be honoured inside the financial year in which they are made, unless there should be a sufficiency of money to meet them without going to the taxpayer by way of supplementary payment. These are three hopeless conditions and if the civil servant wants any advice from me, I will tell him plainly that he should not accept any of them.  They waited painfully before for deliverance and they are not now going to get the arbitration scheme which was so successfully launched, which had worked so well and which gave the civil servant for the first time satisfaction.  It provided decent relationship between employers and employee and good results were accruing to the community as a result of the satisfactory service civil servants were giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we dealt as a Government with certain increases in pensions we put a ceiling on certain increases.  I believe <Col N="358" /> that ceiling did not affect as many as 50 people.  Personally I was misled, or perhaps I should say I misled myself with regard to the situation of these 50 people.  I bitterly regret having put that ceiling on and I accept the blame for it.  I made up my mind that I would take the earliest possible opportunity of remedying it.  The amount of money for the betterment of these people is infinitesimal and would not amount, I understand, to £5,000 a year. I now ask that some alleviation be made in these people's circumstances even though it may not be retrospective.</P>
    <P>The third thing with which I want to deal is the Grant Counterpart Fund. There appears to be some mystery with regard to that.  There was $18,000,000 in that fund or about to come into it. The plans with regard to the spending of that money had got to the point of very close detail in November, 1950. These plans, as a matter of fact, had been made in concert with the administrator of E.C.A. who was resident in Ireland at the time.  We had his approval for the vast majority of the schemes on which the money was to be expended.  Deputies probably know that, as far as loan money is concerned, this country can spend such money in whatever way it chooses. However, when it comes to grant moneys the object of expenditure has to meet with the approval, naturally, of this country and with the approval of the administration in America, that is to say E.C.A.  That money is now in jeopardy.  We were told by the Minister for Social Welfare the other day that formal proposals were going to be submitted and that he hoped to get approval of these proposals from the American Congress.  The position is that the present Government, having $18,000,000 at their disposal for the asking, were so inefficient that they let the latest day on which they could seek approval for such proposals pass.  They may get the money eventually but, at the moment, it is in jeopardy.  We must await whatever mood the Congress may be in when approval is finally sought for the expenditure of the money in this country on approved schemes or on the schemes which the Minister for Social Welfare will put forward for approval shortly.  This is not a very <Col N="359" /> good criterion of the efficiency of the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with 1947.  That was a strong delegation which the present Minister for Finance attended.  Notwithstanding that it did not produce very good results, it had its net results.  Let us look at this bill that is before us.  We are told that some £17,000,000 has to be found and there is £35,000,000 odd on capital account.  These are the figures that I have made out for myself. Taking the Central Fund services, I am told by the Minister for Finance that they will cost £13,000,000 this year.  I realise there is to be an increase of some £500,000 on account of interest payments with regard to Marshall Aid money.  One of these days, I suppose, we will hear about the £2,000,000 extra of public funds; but <Col N="360" /> we are told, in any event, that there is almost £2.6 million extra on the Central Fund services.  The Book of Estimates that has been given to us gives the bulk total of almost £95,000,000.  A note inside tells us that the amount provided for &ldquo;Capital Services&rdquo;, calculated on the same basis as in the previous Book of Estimates, is £9,250,000.  If we subtract that £9,250,000 from the figure on the face of the Estimates we get about £85,000,000, indicating that this year there is a bill to be met on current account, if all these items are recorded as if for borrowing, of £90,000,000. That seems to show an increase of £17,000,000 on last year.</P>
      <P>It is not what it shows last year that matters.  It is what is the increase over and above expected revenue.  We are told expected revenue this year is £86,000,000, and I suggest to that figure of £86,000,000 we may add the sum of £2,000,000 carry-over, which makes it £88,000,000.  I know well that there will be economies this year; there have been over many years and I am quite certain there will be some this year.  I know also we provided last year £1,500,000 for certain services, and as these services have not been developed there is an extra £1,000,000 of free money in the financial year that is just closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on that account there is £17,000,000 which is a frightening total; in fact, so frightening that the Minister dare not come in with any Budget proposals to raise an extra £17,000,000 this year.  The Estimates are faked, of course, to a high degree. We hear a great deal of talk from two or three people who put themselves forward as Government spokesmen, mainly the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that the food subsidies are a shocking charge on the people of the country, and on every sign that can be read food subsidies are in for a bit of a slashing almost immediately. It seems to be odd that, in a year in which food subsidies are marked out for a cut, the Estimate will show an increase of £2,750,000 for subsidies.  There would be a grand saving to have one of those payable from the £2,750,000 which is put in as an extra amount for subsidies to keep <Col N="361" /> the same amount for subsidies; and we would have a certain amount of bleating from the other side as to the saving that has been made; that is some good system of finance.</P>
    <P>We have to find £17,000,000 and that is a problem that is before the Minister and which has produced all the gloom one sees on the Government side.  If we take the £9,250,000 and contrast it with the £12,000,000 in the Book of Estimates last year for supply services of the capital type it seems to show a saving of £2.8 million.  The greater part of that is saved on grants to local authorities for housing.  We are told there is going to be no saving there.  It just happens to be under a particular heading and the moneys will be advanced under another heading. If so, £9,250,000 will probably be advanced &mdash; perhaps £10,000,000 or £11,000,000&mdash;and there would be no great saving between the capital services carried on the Supply Vote between this year and last year.  The only big saving is the saving of something in the neighbourhood of £600,000 on the Local Authorities (Works) Act. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was first in the field on that.  I suppose one of the difficulties facing the members of the Government is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must be present in the council room when matters are under discussion, and he cannot be stopped from talking about them afterwards.  When he got into the field to speak on this matter he described this local authority grant as a reckless waste of money.  He said there would be pockets of unemployment in many areas through the reduction of the amounts provided, and he brought upon himself the castigation of almost the youngest member of the House for his complacency in regard to unemployment.  I do not suppose that he makes policy but I suppose that when he is allowed to attend the Cabinet meetings he must be allowed to speak in regard to the matters under discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary, must be pleased with these pockets of unemployment.  I gather he takes it to be a great tribute to the Government that people go unemployed <Col N="362" /> and remain on the unemployed list without emigrating.  If that is the best that can be said or if it is the best tribute to the confidence of the people in the immediate restoration of stability, I wish the Deputy would go to some of the places where there is unemployment and compliment the people on their belief in the Government, and see whether he will be as complacent after that.  I wonder would he be as complacent after that as he has been since he removed himself from Cork to an office here in town?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to capital services, the projects on which we spent £42,000,000 were described as folly.  The Minister for Finance has often talked about his predecessor's folly.  The Taoiseach to-day said he did not believe that houses should be properly regarded as objects of capital expenditure.  If that is so, if they are so clear-minded about it, it seems to me to require some further explanation that the note regarding capital services should be couched in this way.</P>
      <P>They say they have decided to drop the designation of particular items in the supply services as &ldquo;capital services&rdquo;. There are three reasons given.  The first is: &ldquo;It is necessary to reconsider the validity of the description &lsquo;capital service&rsquo; in particular cases.&rdquo;  I take that to mean that when the Book of Estimates was being prepared for publication about the end of February the Government's mind was not clear as to which of these services should be properly called capital and which could be described as folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much more time to run because it is certain that before the Budget comes there will have to be a determination.  The second explanation given here &mdash; I do not understand it, and I have not found anybody who does understand it&mdash;is as follows: &ldquo;The extent to which capital expenditure may be met from borrowing can be assessed only in relation to the general economic and financial position, including the outlook in regard <Col N="363" /> to national savings, which will be reviewed in connection with the Budget.&rdquo;  If the figure with regard to national savings represents the outlook given by the Taoiseach, then capital services, I would say, are in for a bad time.  Notwithstanding that, I look at the White Paper&mdash;Receipts and Expenditure for last year&mdash;and I see below the line services estimated to cost £16,000,000.  We are told by the Minister for Finance they are running at over £20,000,000 and next year they will be £26,000,000.  So even if the £12,000,000 be cut, in fact, to £9,250,000 and if the below the line services are thought to be at the rate forecast, the capital expenditure is going to run at the rate of probably £35,250,000, an increase, even if the £2.8 millions saving be maintained on the capital services treated as supply, of almost £6,000,000 this year.</P>
    <P>How is this Budget to be met?  Of course, it is quite fatuous to say that there is a £13,000,000 gap.  There is nothing like it.  If the subsidies are going to be cut there will be an immediate saving of nearly £2,750,000, which is the excess expenditure provided for subsidies this year over last year.  There is extra provision for the Army, but there is not the extra provision one would have thought to have found in the Book of Estimates, having regard to all the talk there was about the recruiting drive.  There is an amount of extra expediture by way of warlike stores that have always been a rather unsubstantial item. There have been moneys put down, and I do not think I ever queried to the nearest £ the moneys asked for in this connection.  Money is now included in the Estimate for warlike stores, and everybody knows they will not be expended, as warlike stores are not open for purchase.  We do not believe that these moneys will be spent.  It is only part of a parade in order to maintain a certain amount of Party prestige and to enable the present Government to maintain their precarious footing.  It represents rather a wish than any real hope that this money will be expended on warlike stores.</P>
    <P>Here and there in the Estimates one <Col N="364" /> can pick up one or two items that appear to be put in as padding so that, when the Budget is read, it will be found that instead of having to find money to the extent of £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 you will only have to impose an extra £5,000,000.  The people will forget the £5,000,000 really imposed. How much worse the situation might have been if earlier prognostications had been correct.</P>
    <P>I am more interested, however, in this capital side.  The Taoiseach lamented to-day that £17,000,000 of a capital development programme had not been provided for.  What did the Taoiseach expect?  Did he expect that before the inter-Party Government left office it would have gone looking for a loan and handed it over to a succeeding Government?  If that is what the Taoiseach expected he is living in a world of dreams.  He had even forgotten his own performance prior to 1948.  The First National Loan that we took for £12,000,000 was spent entirely on meeting the debts that the previous Fianna Fáil Administration had left.  Not a single penny accrued for new commitments.  They paid off the ways and means by borrowing which left ways and means open to me again.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach left me no American money.  He was left £26,000,000, and it is now all gone and the people who tell us it is all gone are the people who protest against our profligacy.  We left them £26,000,000 untouched.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And the commitments, what about them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will hear about them when the Taoiseach gets more clear in his head.  The £26,000,000 is gone.  They were unprovided for.  A Government provides for its own expenditure, either current or capital. The explanation was given to us that last July was not the proper time to go for a loan to the public because the conversion operations were on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the feeling that the present Government are lucky that we had arranged the conversion operations before we left, otherwise they would not have been carried through.  The conversion operations involved over <Col N="365" /> £20,000,000, and that conversion operation was quite successful.  If that £20,000,000 had been transferred to another loan it would have been £20,000,000 floating around looking for a home which it might have found eventually through expenditure on consumption goods or through some other kind of investment.  The Government were lucky that it was carried through before the public received the impact of the whining which was just about starting at that time.</P>
    <P>Why did not the Taoiseach and his merry men look for a loan later in the year?  There were other circumstances. Possibly we will hear of these other circumstances, but I only know of one, and that was that the people who were so merry in getting back to Government became so despondent, when they found the tasks ahead of them, that they could not face up to their liabilities.  They made the people believe that the situation was desperate, that finances were running low, and that there would be no money within a month with which to pay civil servants.  When that clamour was going on, the people who were responsible for the clamour could not act with any confidence and could not go to the folk of this nation and ask for a loan.  The time they were telling everybody that the community was sinking, that they faced bankruptcy and insolvency, was no time to make an appeal to the people for money for constructive purposes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not go for a loan and he now complains that, in respect of the £17,000,000 capital expenditure, that the worst provision that could be provided for was the one that was adopted.  Those American moneys were a very valuable addition to the resources of this country.  Dollars were loaned to this country because this country could not change sterling into dollars.  When the goods which the American dollars bought for us came to the country the sterling proceeds were collected and put into an account in the Central Bank.  They served a useful purpose over two of the three years we were in power.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that the capital development programme that is ahead <Col N="366" /> runs at about £30,000,000 a year and that between small savings and approaches to the people for a loan there was not more than £15,000,000 or £16,000,000 got each year.</P>
    <P>The capital programme was nothing like at that height during these periods. The first loan that was looked for in the inter-Party period was completely filled.  The second required aid of about £4,000,000 from departmental funds and the third, I think, required about the same.  Do not forget that, although in our period of office we approached the people three times for loans, we approached the people under very definitely restricted conditions which we imposed ourselves.  We got the two highest individual subscriptions that were ever received from the people of this country since the State was founded.  The first of the three loans was filled entirely.  That was the biggest individual subscription ever received from the public since this State was founded.  From the third, which was the worst of the three loans, we got the second biggest individual subscription from the public in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>It was no small thing to go to the public year after year, for three years in succession, and to receive such a response&mdash;and it was more particularly successful when one considers the circumstances. We asked the banks to keep away from the matter and certainly not, by overdraft, to make things easy for would-be borrowers. We told them we did not want things pushed too much and certainly not as far as external moneys were concerned. The second loan was taken at a time when the Korean War had broken out and when almost all the financial advice I could get was against the looking for a loan at the time.  Notwithstanding the adverse world circumstances and the fact that three appeals were made, year after year in succession for three years &mdash;and with the restrictive conditions we imposed on the banks &mdash; we got moneys plentifully &mdash; and there were still moneys to be had if the country had been approached in the right way, and at the right time, for them.  The Taoiseach has now to get the moneys. <Col N="367" /> He speaks of the easy position of the waster who inherits money and who can have a good time while the inheritance lasts.  For him that good time is over now.  He succeeded to the inheritance of £26,000,000 Counterpart Funds, and the wastefulness of his period of so many months has ended. He stands now on whatever moneys he can draw from the public.  He will find it a hard task, after the lamentations which he and his group have been guilty of over the past five or six or seven months.</P>
    <P>I looked through the Book of Estimates and I read the speeches made in the course of this debate in an endeavour to discover where there was criticism of the borrowings which we made.  I see that the one big cut in the items is that in respect of moneys under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We have no explanation why these moneys have been cut so savagely except that when that legislation was passing through the Oireachtas the present Government Party, who were then in opposition, exhausted themselves in fighting it, delaying it in all sorts of ways and in bringing forward all sorts of futile objections.  That Act was very severely contested here and I suggest that nothing but a spirit of revenge has marked out that item for the cut which it has received.</P>
    <P>There is one other amazing item. The Minister for Finance said that he was reverting to the earlier practice by which the money paid to the Electricity Supply Board to meet the cost of rural electrification was now being met by a payment of the full amount of the deficiency in the year in which that deficiency arose.  He submitted here for criticism the practice of paying that annuity spread, as he said, over 50 years.  He felt that if he could not attack the item as such he had something of value in saying that it should not be amortised over a period as long as 50 years.  I cannot understand why there is any objection to that annuity payment.  The finances of the Electricity Supply Board are, to a certain degree, under Government control.  The Electricity Supply Board have been asked to take <Col N="368" /> on the burden of rural electrification. They represented that it would not pay &mdash;and it was admitted that rural electrification, in the main, would not pay. The board were told that 50 per cent. of the deficiency between return and expenditure would be met by the State. The Electricity Supply Board asked and were permitted to fund their payment for their half of the deficiency over 50 years.  Therefore, the State allows the Electricity Supply Board to amortise over 50 years their half of the deficiency, yet the State considers it bad finance for the State itself to amortise the equivalent payment over the same period of years as that allowed to the Electricity Supply Board.  I should have thought that if any payment was marked out as good finance, it was that.  One must ask how the payment arises.  It arises in connection with the bringing of cables, poles, and certain items of apparatus which will be consumed in time but which are fairly durable, between certain points in local areas. The State steps back and looks at the Electricity Supply Board, and tells the board that it is good finance for them to meet the deficiency by an annuity payment over 50 years&mdash;and then it says that it, itself, will meet the payment each year.  Possibly, before the debate concludes or at Budget time, we shall be told why the difference is made between finance that is regarded as proper for the Electricity Supply Board and finance that is thought proper for the State.</P>
    <P>Some day the present Government will make up its mind on which of our capital schemes it considers unsuitable for borrowing.  Some day they will tell us that they have either to cut out the expenditure on them or else mark some of them as not proper for borrowing and then put them on the taxpayer's back.  We provided money for houses, schoolhouses, electricity, harbours, telephones, afforestation, fishery development, tourism and the improvement of the land.  Which of these items is not a good capital item? Which of these items is the Government going to cut out as something that it will either drop or else transfer to the shoulders of the taxpayer?  I have asked that question many times <Col N="369" /> during the general election, but since I have not received an answer I have asked the Government to take out a pencil and to cross out whichever of these items it has an objection to as a developmental activity not proper for the process of borrowing, but I have not got an answer to that question yet. I suppose we shall not get an answer to it.</P>
    <P>I had understood that the great trouble with regard to the expenditure by the State, particularly on the capital side, was that it had its reaction on the famous balance of payments.  The deficiency on this year's balance of payments is said to be likely to be about £50,000,000.  Let us ask ourselves, with regard to that £50,000,000 deficiency, if we regard it as a proper figure and if we contemplate it with equanimity. Let us ask ourselves if we regard that figure as a defect in the balance of payments this year and whether we can contemplate with equanimity, or less than equanimity, the continuance of the same figure, or a figure like it, in the balance of payments over a number of years in the future.  Finally, we are asked if it is possible to get the money.  All these matters arose for consideration on the Supply and Services Bill, but they are, apparently, not supposed to have been dealt with satisfactorily yet.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister for Finance, with the Tánaiste, recently travelled to London.  They went to London with a great whoop from the <i>Sunday Press.</i> The <i>Sunday Press</i>, the day before the Minister for Finance went away, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At stake over a conference table in London will be your security, the real value of your wage packet, and your standard of living.  Going there on behalf of the people of Ireland will be Finance Minister Mr. Seán MacEntee.  On the other side of the table will be Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. R.A. Butler.  These finance chiefs of the sterling area meet on uncertain ground.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the measures that were to be taken to protect sterling were already known, and there was speculation as <Col N="370" /> to what was to follow.  The <i>Sunday Press</i> said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The initiative from these talks came from the British, who are up against it.  Mr. MacEntee will certainly give them a careful hearing, but he will undoubtedly tell Mr. Butler that, as far as he is concerned&mdash;however much he sympathises with them in their dilemma&mdash; the interests of the Irish people come first.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He will probably ask Britain bluntly whether she can supply all the machinery and equipment that Ireland needs.  He will probably also demand that we be given adequate supplies of raw materials for industry and agriculture.  And he has some top-rate cards to play.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then three are given.  The first is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland voluntarily gave up her right to her full share of the sterling areas dollar pool in 1948.  We agreed to take Marshall Aid loans and grants instead.  Now they have ended, and we can demand that Britain take these accumulated dollar &lsquo;credits&rsquo; into account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second card was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland is one of Britain's most important suppliers of food.  If we do not get the supplies we require, we will automatically be forced to sell elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is reminiscent of the days when the British market was gone, and gone forever, and it was only childish&mdash;like a child crying for the moon&mdash;to hope it would ever come back.  Notwithstanding all that, the Taoiseach to-day can tell us that the only areas with which we are trading advantageously are Britain and the Six Counties&mdash;the market that had gone forever.  The third card was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland, although a &lsquo;soft currency&rsquo; country, is an important export market for Britain, and there are many non-essential goods we could cut from our import lists if Britain does not co-operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They went across with the three strong cards in their hands to play and they came back; and there has been a pretty <Col N="371" /> definite silence since then as to what happened over there.</P>
    <P>Conan Doyle wrote a detective story which he called <i>The Story of the Dog that Did Not Bark.</i>  That was the clue&mdash;the dog that should have barked and did not, and that led to an examination and to the discovery of certain dirty work that was on.  Our dogs have not barked since they came back. There has been a certain amount of tail wagging by one of them, but there has been no great vociferation as to what happened on the other side.  We do hear, however, that we are going to cut certain items on the dollar side.  We are told to-day the items are oils&mdash;probably including petrol&mdash;and tobacco, fats and sugar.  Coal also has been cut, but it is only a temporary purchase.</P>
    <P>If petrol is going to be cut, the question immediately arises as to whether we are in for new rationing or whether we will ration by price, as the British have done in the last Budget proposals. Regarding tobacco, are the Government pleased to find themselves with almost two years' supply of tobacco in the country, so that they could at least temporarily refrain from making any demand on the British pool of dollars for the purchase of Virginia leaf this year?</P>
    <P>In any event, our Minister went over.  Their presence was heralded by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he spoke on Budget day in England. He said he had come to the conclusion that the whole sterling area must set its sights appreciably higher.  He spoke of the striking manner in which the fellow members of the Commonwealth had answered his further appeals.  He said it reminded him of the moving response in war time.  Then he itemised them.  He said that South Africa's response was immediate and cordial and then the items of that response were given.  Over the week-end, the voice of Australia had rung clear, he said, and added that the United Kingdom must suffer from &ldquo;the drastic effects of Australia's severe and timely action to save an economy swollen by the recent boom in wool prices.&rdquo; Regret was expressed by Mr. Menzies, said the Chancellor, that it was necessary <Col N="372" /> temporarily to restrict imports from the United Kingdom.  Then he went on to say that he had had stirring answers from &ldquo;that stalwart leader, the Prime Minister of New Zealand&rdquo; and from &ldquo;my friends the Finance Ministers of India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Southern Rhodesia.&rdquo;  Each had told the Chancellor of the Exchequer of their special difficulties. Then, with a paragraph to segregate the sterling area leaders of the Commonwealth from the Republic, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have also received a message from the Minister for Finance of the Irish Republic, indicating his Government's appreciation of the gravity of the situation and its determination to play its parts in resolving it.  He will, I understand, be making a statement in his Parliament to-morrow, as I understand some of my colleagues will be making statements in their own time and place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only note we had about that&mdash;I again take this as a Cabinet leakage &mdash;came from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He addressed a meeting and got himself the heading: &ldquo;The Irish Aid in the Fight for the £&rdquo;.  He told us Britain could not remain in a condition approaching bankruptcy and Ireland would have to contribute to the solution of those difficulties.  I wish he would get talkative again and tell us what was Ireland's contribution to the solution of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that people who are very voluble on platforms in the country become stricken dumb when asked a question in the House.  There was to be a contribution from Ireland to the solution of the sterling area difficulties and we were welcomed with cheers and applause in the British House of Commons&mdash;and all we know about it is that we are going to have certain import cuts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance asked about the other conferences in England.  There was one which took place in November, 1947.  The Taoiseach was present at it.  It appears as if the British lack imagination and they go back on the same <Col N="373" /> old things when crises recur.  It was suggested to the Irish representatives on that occasion that they should cut their expenditure from dollar sources to £8,000,000&mdash;that was, £8,000,000 over and above their own earnings. The earnings were about £7,000,000 in those days and the suggestions that came from the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer were, that we should suspend the purchase of tobacco, that we should restrict the purchase of petrol and that we should impose a stricter control of the home consumption of textiles.  After some little talk, our then Finance Minister offered that we would economise in petrol and foreign travel and that we would stop any dollar expenditure on coal and tobacco.  That was in 1947, in November, 1947.  Here we are back again in 1952 and the Government have already announced, as one of their big contributions to the solution of this immediate difficulty, the cutting of foreign travel; and to-day, in answer to Deputy Declan Costello, we are told that tobacco and oils&mdash;which I take to mean petrol&mdash;are to be restricted; so that the same mentality pervades 10 Downing Street as it did in November, 1947.  I suppose that if some day we do get the terms of this promissory note that the Minister for Finance sent the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we will find that it probably contains the same promises as were given in November, 1947.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen after we restrict our imports of these things?  Coal does not matter; as I said, it was only a temporary business.  What is going to happen if there is merely a policy here of physical restriction of imports?  Does it mean we are going to have rationing of petrol, rationing of tobacco and a narrower rationing of sugar than there is at the moment&mdash;or does it mean that the sugar required for the export of chocolate crumb is going to be cut and we will lose the value of that as an export item in our list?</P>
    <P>If there is going to be only a physical control of imports, what is going to happen to the price situation?  This year it is proposed to pour out £35,000,000 on development schemes, where at best we invested £28,000,000. <Col N="374" /> If there is £7,000,000 extra going to be let loose in the hands of the purchasing part of the community this year and imports are going physically to be restricted, who is going to control the upsurge in price that is bound to arise if that extra £7,000,000 is sent chasing the smaller volume of goods that the physical control of these imports will certainly bring about?</P>
    <P>I had understood all the time that the great objection to the investments in this development programme of ours was that it sent so much money into the hands of the people, that when the ports were opened they called for more goods, and that these goods caused this gap in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting move on since our two watchdogs of finance came home.  The last speech the Tánaiste made indicated that, at this stage of his life, he is not very happy about existing legislation in regard to our currency or to the business of banking.  He feels now that it will be necessary to get capital.  If we have to get capital from outside we had better get such capital in the hands of our own people.  Apparently he does not even shudder at the thought of getting foreign capital&mdash;capital that is not owned by our own nationals.</P>
    <P>That is a tremendous change for a man who imposed the controls through the Control of Manufactures Act and who shut out foreign capital from freely percolating in this community and the benefits that we might have got from that.  He is apparently now out to have foreign capital, even, introduced here to aid us even although, in the calculations that were made at the time of the White Paper, if we do get so much capital in, that is equivalent, according to the White Paper, of wiping out so much of the capital that we own abroad.  We were told that it was the net figure that had to be taken and not the gross.  If foreign capital is brought in, and brought in to any quantity, we will probably find ourselves bemoaning the situation, as it will be predicted to us by the British journals on finance that we have on the other side, as meaning the complete dissolution, the disappearance, of our sterling holdings.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that, although it <Col N="375" /> was a brief visit to London, our Ministers did learn something.  What they learnt was something that taught them not any longer to have such amazing faith in the stability of the sterling assets that they used to have. I wonder did they get any assurance from the British with regard to these reserves, or is it possible that, so far from getting any assurance, they got revealed to them such a state of weakness with regard to these marvellous assets that they decided that maybe it was better spending them than to save?  Maybe that is the new line, and may be that is what drove the Tánaiste to say that he is not at all happy about existing legislation in regard to the currency or the business of banking.</P>
    <P>I have introduced into these debates before the name of Mr. Schwartz, who writes every Sunday on certain finance matters.  In February of this year he wrote an article.  The moral to be drawn from it possibly is not the one that I am going to draw immediately, but he did use this phrase in regard to certain items of British expenditure. He said they bought coffee from Western Africa.  They could not pay for it, but they felt that the niggers of Western Africa ought to be satisfied to have sterling balances.  They said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they wanted bicycles instead because that was the need they had at the time.  He said &ldquo;No&rdquo; again.  Instead of getting bicycles for coffee they are going to get sterling balances, and the bright idea is that they should hold these balances until the money that would now buy a complete bicycle will only buy a mudguard.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that we have been facing for many years.  It was recognised that the value of these sterling assets was on the decline. We preached that in this House as far back as 1942.  It was preached again here very specially in 1945, and I will read the response we got on that occasion.  All the time from this side of the House we have been probing and probing away at the folly of piling up so much of our resources in that particular currency, seeing that that particular currency was wasting <Col N="376" /> and showed signs still further of wasting.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the Taoiseach, as far as his speech to-day is concerned, is going to continue with the same old policy&mdash;keep the sterling assets to a certain point.  As they are going down in value, you will have to increase them in volume in order to get even anything like the same value as to-day, but we must break ourselves, if necessary, here in order to get that, and if we do not do that we are going to be held out as being the wasters who are profligately spending the inheritance our fathers piled up for us.</P>
    <P>In the month of July, 1945, on the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach, I personally raised the question of the sterling assets and asked whether it would not be a better thing to do as certain finance journalists in England were then suggesting, that was, to get some independent steering gear financially of our own, and I was subjected in the closing speech to a tirade from the present Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Local Government.  I cannot read all of this but Deputies who are interested will find it in Volume 97, at column about 2035 onwards. We got a lecture about Mr. Churchill.  We were told that Mr. Churchill declared that if the people gave him a majority in England one of the first aims of his Government would be to enhance considerably the purchasing power of the £ sterling.  There were then a few remarks about myself in contrast to Mr. Churchill.  The Minister went on to say that whether Mr. Churchill would succeed in his undertaking to the British, or not, there was one thing certain and one thing of which we might be assured, and that was, that he could not permit sterling or sterling assets to be depreciated by 50 per cent. in value.</P>
    <P>A little lower down the Dáil was asked to accept Mr. Churchill as speaking with far greater authority than I could speak.  The Minister announced his view that Mr. Churchill would do his utmost to secure that the purchasing value of sterling would appreciate.</P>
    <P>He spoke later of freedom in <Col N="377" /> exchange and that freedom in exchange must be substantial.  He talked to such an extent about it that he was eventually brought to an end by Deputy Dillon asking: &ldquo;Will somebody strike up <i>Rule Britannia</i> now and we will all bow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the mood of 1945 and that is the mood, apparently, in which the present Minister for Finance went across to London to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and all we have got by way of reply to our repeated questions is that we merely had an exchange of views&mdash;that there were no commitments.  Yet we find that we have agreed to cut certain imports and that £16,000,000 is our aim with regard to dollar imports and the aim with regard to imports from the non-sterling countries.</P>
    <P>The British have not changed much, it was said, with regard to the demands they put on our people.  Our people have not changed much as between 1947 and 1952 in their responsibilities. Possibly the Minister would enlighten us before we leave this debate as to what is going to happen.  We have had all through these months the repetition of statements as to the terrible state of the national finances.  We are on the verge of desperation.  Irretrievable harm, according to the present Minister, has been done to the country's finances.  He and the Tánaiste spoke week-end after week-end, each reminding the other that there was no time to be lost, that the situation was so bad.  We come here, the last fortnight in the financial year, and the only two pointers we have to any recognition even of urgency is the cut in the travelling allowance from £50 to £25 and the promotion of Budget Day by a month from the month of May to the month of April.  That is the beginning and end of the efforts of the Government. That, and the spending of the £26,000,000 that we left them which could have been used for many years to aid whatever deficiencies there might be in the national financing or the national needs in the way of development. That is all we have got from the Government to date.</P>
    <P>Apparently the £25 cut in the travel allowance was part of the proposals <Col N="378" /> discussed in England.  There may be other matters in regard to the cost of petrol and other things.  The Minister may have a pretty heavy job ahead of him trying to meet new requirements which he has piled up himself. He may find it very hard to get money, although it is not going to be anything like as hard as he imagines, and it would not be at all so hard if he had only shown a little bit of caution and reserve in his language.  Well, he has made his bed and, if it is going to be hard, he is responsible for that himself. While he has these difficulties ahead of him, the one thing of which I do not see any appreciation as yet is that the situation cannot be mended by a mere physical control of imports.  If it is, then this country will wake up to regret the day when it was able to stop such a gap in our balance of trade because that gap enabled it to keep prices under control.  If we stop the gap of £16,000,000 or £17,000,000, and the purchasing power is still left in the hands of the people, then this country will be faced with the greatest tornado it has ever known in the way of an upsurge of prices.  The immediate reaction of the Taoiseach and the Minister is that you must absorb that purchasing power by heavy taxation. That, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, will in itself be a cause of inflation and will only add still further to costs.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to spare time to deal with the matter on which I opened, namely, the matter of the civil servants.  Whether he deals with it here or not, I hope he will deal with it outside the House in a way that will enable civil servants to look forward to that security which we brought into their lives when we were in governmental control, and that he will not try to disturb the excellent scheme which had the goodwill of the vast majority of civil servants. I hope he will again recognise that scheme even though it may cost, from time to time heavy commitments to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters which have cropped up in this debate in regard to which I should like to have some clarification.  Deputy McGilligan has attacked the Government <Col N="379" /> in regard to the position of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Deputy McGilligan last year reduced the Estimate for the Local Authorities (Works) Act by £500,000.  He reduced it on the following grounds as reported in Volume 125, column 1900, of the Dáil Debates of the 2nd May, 1951:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The more urgent works have now been completed and this accounts partly for the lower provision this year.  In framing the Estimate regard was also had to the undesirability of interfering with the supply of labour for turf production.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So when we hear Deputy Davin complaining here about unemployment, we might take into consideration the fact that the Estimate for the Local Authorities (Works) Act was cut by £500,000 by Deputy McGilligan.  It is just as well to be clear on these matters.  I also heard him mention harbour improvements, and he said that a certain capital sum was spent on harbour improvements.  In connection with this matter I asked a question last week of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to portion of my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not from Deputy Keane anyhow.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would state whether he had yet received any report from the inter-departmental committee set up to consider proposals for the extension of the deep-water quay at Cobh Harbour.  The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Proposals in regard to the deep-water quay at Cobh Harbour, which were submitted in 1947, had reached the stage early in 1948 when they were ready for consideration by the inter-departmental committee, but these proposals were not examined by the committee because of a decision taken in 1948 by the then Government that the consideration of all applications for expenditure on harbour improvements should be postponed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> These proposals, which meant a lot to the people of Cobh, were put on the long finger by the then Government. The abeyance policy was in full force and the little town of Cobh paid for the abeyance policy as well as the others.  That quay is badly needed for the purpose of unloading not alone freight but also for tourist traffic.</P>

      <P>I should like to call attention to a statement made by the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, here in 1948, when he said that he was willing to be judged on the number of cattle in this country when he left office.  I am glad to have an opportunity of supplying these figures because it will show just exactly what the position is.  Last year, we had a reduction of 19,000 cows and 33,000 in-calf heifers.  The figures given during this week for the subsequent year show that there was a further reduction of 38,000 cows and something like 14,000 in-calf heifers.  That means that you had a reduction of 104,000 cows in this country during Deputy Dillon's reign in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be conceded that, to-day at least, we had one worthwhile contribution from the Opposition. I refer to the speech which was made by Deputy Larkin.  It was clear from that speech that he, at least, had a real appreciation of the gravity of the position, and was aware of the fact that, whatever Government was in <Col N="381" /> office, the problem would have to be grappled with and solved, I should say in the manner in which this Government will eventually endeavour to reach a solution.  His speech, which was thoughtful, well reasoned and realistic, was in striking contrast to the speech of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan.  I know that Deputy McGilligan was speaking under some difficulty.  There are so many skeletons in his cupboard that he cannot address himself to the merits of any financial problem.  He has left a past behind him in the Department of Finance which does very little credit to him.</P>
      <P>It must have been some subconscious operation of remorse and repentance that caused Deputy McGilligan to make a rather revealing statement in the House to-day.  Those of us who recall the debates and controversies of last May will remember that Deputy Dr. Noel Browne stated that the Estimates for expenditure had been cooked by the Government in which Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance, and written down by no less than £4,000,000.  To-day Deputy McGilligan, with what justification I do not know, alleges that as well as understating the probable expenditure by £4,000,000 he also understated &mdash; he himself understated &mdash; the probable revenue by no less a sum than £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I have no knowledge of how Deputy McGilligan prepared his Estimates. All that I know in regard to the Estimates for revenue which I shall present to the House in due course is this, that I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to make the closest estimate and the best estimate they possibly can and submit it to me.  I shall proceed on the basis of that estimate, and try to formulate the proposals which I will set before the Government in regard to the coming year's Budget.  But Deputy McGilligan, let me emphasise again, has said here in this House that there was a sum of approximately £2,000,000 &mdash; he said £2,000,000 and did not use the word &ldquo;approximately&rdquo;&mdash; that there was a sum of £2,000,000 which he handed over to his successor and, presumably, by that he means that there was a sum <Col N="382" /> of £2,000,000 which was not included in the estimate for the revenue of this year which he submitted to this House. Presumably, since he deceived the House and the country in this way because that is what his statement amounted to&mdash;an admission of deception on the part of the then Minister for Finance when he presented his Budget here in May of last year&mdash;he must also have deceived some or all of his colleagues or else they were parties to, and participated in, the deception which he has now admitted he perpetrated upon the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <P>We know from what he has said himself that he did this to deceive the people.  Whom else was he trying to deceive?  Was it Deputy MacBride who was then Minister for External Affairs, or was it Deputy Norton?  Both of them, I may say, so far as the departmental records go, appear on occasions to have usurped the functions which Deputy McGilligan should have been discharging as Minister for Finance: usurped them to this extent that for weeks the Deputy who has spoken here in this House in such scathing and sarcastic terms went on what one might describe as a lie down strike&mdash; was not in the Department, and was not, in some cases, in the city, and left such very critical questions as the allocation of dollars, which we were borrowing from America, to the tender mercies of the then Minister for External Affairs.</P>

I am referring to the date, weeks afterwards, on which the Minister for External Affairs submitted an independent proposal to the Government requesting the Government to notify all and sundry who had come with outstretched hands begging for some of these dollars which were then being borrowed at the expense of future generations and whose applications had been refused, because they could not be justified on economic grounds, that they should be informed that, if they came before the Lady Bountiful in Government Buildings, the American largesse would be distributed to them to the full extent, to the utmost extent, of their demands.</P>

      <P>There were many individuals in many firms in this city who received this circular letter informing them that if their applications for Marshall Aid, which had been previously rejected, were renewed they would now be granted.  That circular letter went out to so many people that it was manifolded; all they had to do was to fill in the name in writing and out went this offer.</P>
      <P>One may ask why this was done. Deputy Dillon suggested it was done because they knew that there was on the other side of the Atlantic the United States of America which was prepared to lend money on the security that, we being an honourable people, the moneys would eventually be repaid. As he told us in the course of his speech, it would have been a great pity if, with America standing with outstretched hands ready to lend&mdash;not to give, to lend&mdash;we were not prepared to borrow to the utmost extent possible, even though we might not be able to apply these borrowed moneys to any purpose that would yield a permanent economic return to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what Deputy Dillon himself said.  He said our problem was to borrow as much as we possibly could, lest next year the dollars would not be available to us.  &ldquo;The position was such that, in one afternoon,&rdquo; said Deputy Dillon, &ldquo;as Minister for Agriculture, I spent no less than 5,000,000 dollars.&rdquo;  Five million dollars of borrowed money; 5,000,000 dollars which Deputy Costello said he, as Taoiseach and head of the Government, pledged the honour and reputation of the Irish race would be eventually repaid; 5,000,000 dollars <Col N="385" /> which, according to the bond, has not merely to be repaid in money which is the lawful currency of the United States of America, but has also to be repaid with interest; 5,000,000 dollars on which, with the other 128,000,000 dollars borrowed and dissipated in the short space of two years, we will be paying interest this year at the rate of £1,200,000.  In this year we are paying one half year's interest.  It will cost us, at the present rate of exchange, £600,000.  And it cannot be repaid in sterling.  It must be paid in dollars.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal about the discussions which took place in Great Britain between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and some of his colleagues, on the one hand, and the Tánaiste and myself, on the other.  I have said that, in these discussions, there were no agreements made or entered into. There was a frank exchange of views and a full disclosure of facts as they related to the position of the sterling reserve.  There was no pledge asked for and no pledge given.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer made it quite clear that he would not even venture to make any suggestions to us and that he would rely upon our own appreciation of the position, as it had been disclosed to our people here so far back as last June and July.</P>
    <P>In so far as there have been any decisions taken by the Government in regard to this problem of the balance of payments, they are decisions which have been taken freely by us in our own interests and in the interests of our people, but with the full recognition of the fact that our interest in the maintenance of the purchasing value of sterling is second only to that of Great Britain.  In fact, if we were to consider our relative resources, we might nearly say that our interest is even greater than theirs.</P>
    <P>I want to make that point quite clear in answer to all the gibes of Deputy Dillon and in answer to the suggestions of Deputy McGilligan and some other members of the Opposition, who have taken up the attitude that the members of this Government, who fought the economic war and got back the annuities that the Opposition themselves gave away, who freed the people of our country from the shackles of the <Col N="386" /> Treaty and gave them the Constitution under which we live, were prepared to take orders which did not represent the collective will of the Irish people. The gentlemen who talk about instructions given to us by British Chancellors had better look back and see under what circumstances the then Government decided to negotiate the Marshall Aid loan.  At whose instance was a decision which the Government had previously taken, at the instance, I think, of the then Minister for External Affairs, not to apply for that loan reversed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, apparently, the position is this, that the Marshall Aid loan was a sort of spontaneous operation on the part of the American Government, and that it was pressed on us.  Deputy MacBride had better be a little careful in this matter.  I have asked, and I repeat the question: At whose instance was a decision not to seek for a Marshall Aid loan reversed, and at whose instance was a pledge given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage was there a decision not to participate in Marshall Aid or in the O.E.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the then Minister for External Affairs took the line, and apparently convinced his colleagues, that we should not apply for Marshall Aid.  I am not saying whether that was a wise decision or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances of the time, I think it was an unwise decision to this extent, that if we could not get dollars in any other way in order to carry out a constructive programme we would have been justified in borrowing dollars.  But we would not have been justified in borrowing dollars in order to create what can only be described as a &ldquo;slush fund&rdquo; in this country.  We would not be justified in borrowing dollars in order that they would be dissipated in the way they were dissipated during the years 1949 and 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get back to Deputy Dillon's very illuminating speech.  Let me remind <Col N="387" /> you again what Deputy Dillon's boast was&mdash;that their problem was to spend these dollars as quickly as they could get them and, as he said, he spent no less than 5,000,000 of them in one afternoon.  What was behind this urge to spend borrowed money in this fashion, to spend this very hard currency, this money which we had no chance of repaying through the export of our products, in the form at the present moment of sterling, and which we will have to repay in the hard currency of the United States!  The explanation of that was a very simple one.  For every 2.8 dollars that an Irish trader, anxious to procure goods from America, was given permission to procure through his bank, he had to deposit here £1 and, in due course, pounds to the extent, I think, of approximately £46,000,000 were collected in what was known as that Loan Counterpart Fund was entirely under the control of the then Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, our predecessors had here at their disposal for every wild-cat scheme which could be thought of by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture or by any other Minister, £46,000,000 of Irish citizens' money.  It was, therefore, unnecessary for our predecessors, if they wanted to budget for a deficit, to float a loan.  They did float loans from time to time, more as a gesture, so far as one can see, having regard to the developments in 1950 and the early part of 1951.  They did float loans from time to time, as I said, more as a gesture, a gesture which told the public: &ldquo;Look, we want these few millions from you in order to carry out this great programme of capital development.&rdquo;  But all the time, particularly at the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951, the main source from which the then Government drew the moneys to finance the inflationary programme upon which they had embarked was the Loan Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the word &ldquo;inflationary&rdquo; right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at your balance of payments and ask anybody who <Col N="388" /> knows what does it signify.  Here was, as I said, the position.  The Americans were ready to lend us money. They were lending us that money principally on the standing and reputation of our people as an honest people.  They were lending that money and the security which was given was the future labours of our people. The then Government were availing of that to build up this huge Loan Counterpart Fund on which they drew as they wished whenever their financial circumstances demanded it. That is one of the reasons, and I think the principal reason, why this decision &mdash;or at least the original recommendation of the then Minister for External Affairs&mdash;if it was not actually a Government decision, and I think it was, not to borrow was abandoned. The other reason, as everybody knows, was that it was part of the settlement which was made when the then Taoiseach, the then Tánaiste, the then Minister for External Affairs, the then Minister for Agriculture and the then Minister for Finance went over to London and negotiated the agreement in 1948.</P>
      <P>These were the two reasons why this arrangement was entered into and these were the gentlemen who, during this critical period, when it is essential that the Irish people should realise that the problem which we are facing in regard to the balance of payments and in regard to the deficit upon the coming Budget is an Irish problem and not a British problem, have tried to confuse the issues.  It is a problem which, if we do not find a solution for it, will eventuate in widespread hardship and unemployment in this country.  Instead of asking the people to come together and try to consider it, we have had a deliberate attempt by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan to confuse the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the statements which were made by Deputy Dillon, because it is essential that the people should know precisely where we stand in regard to this international obligation which was entered into by our predecessors.  Deputy Dillon, speaking in a different voice from Deputy Costello, said that we <Col N="389" /> were under no obligation to repay the Marshall Aid loan.  The position in that regard is this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such unqualified statement made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, that we are under no obligation to repay the Marshall Aid loan in dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very big difference in that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not say that there was an obligation to pay in dollars when sterling was convertible into dollars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There was and is a solemn undertaking to repay the loan in dollars.  That is part of the bond. The loan must be repaid in dollars; there is nothing in the bond about convertibility of sterling or anything else. Not merely have we to repay the loan but we have to repay it and pay the interest thereon in the lawful money of the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister withdraws his statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That part of the loan must be repaid.  Deputy Dillon's statement was deliberately misleading. I cannot believe that the Deputy who professes to be so <i>au fait</i> with the general procedure under which these moneys were secured could possibly have been under any misapprehension when he made the statement, not merely to the House but to the people. His statement was fantastically misleading. Deputy Costello, on the other hand, when he was speaking, I think, on the 13th March, reminded the House and emphasised to the House that when he was in the United States he said we would pay back in dollars the loan to the last cent&mdash;I think he used the term farthing&mdash;but in any event he declared that we would pay the loan completely and fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to endeavour to minimise the seriousness of the obligations under which we rest in regard to that loan, Deputy Dillon made himself responsible for some very disgraceful statements as to the manner in which we had been treated by the United States.  When Deputy Costello was winding up his speech in this debate on <Col N="390" /> the 13th March he addressed the homily to those who in this country ventured to criticise the American people.  His strictures in that regard are to be found in Volume 129:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been in certain quarters recently criticism of the American people.  I think it is right that it should be put on record that that does not represent the views of the Irish people towards the American people.  I certainly want to dissociate those for whom I speak here from those criticisms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But what did Deputy Dillon have to say in regard to the American people? I quote from column 2217, Volume 129:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In relation to what the United States Government lent us, they made us one grant of £2,000,000 sterling in dollars and the second year&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen to this from Deputy Costello's colleague and former subordinate Minister&mdash;or insubordinate Minister would be a better description:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;they went through the motions of making us a grant of £1,300,000 in dollars.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We owe a great deal to the American people and those of us who look back on the period from 1916 know how much we owe the American people and the American Government and appreciate it.  But we are told by Deputy Dillon that in that year &ldquo;they went through the motions of making us a grant of £1,300,000 in dollars.&rdquo;&ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a grant at all ... the Marshall Aid Act requiring us to carry 50 per cent. of all we bought with American aid in American bottoms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

Of course, there was no truth in Deputy Dillon's wild statements, and he is now trying to get out of them.</P>

      <P>There were no such transactions.  The 3,000,000 dollars which were refunded to the E.C.A. under the shipping provisions were not lost.  They were reprogrammed for other things.  These dollars, as the last Deputy quite correctly admitted, were <Col N="393" /> part of the Marshall Loan, and were never a grant.  The grant aid of 3,000,000 dollars in 1949-50 and the 50,000,000 in 1950-51 had no connection whatever with the shipping refunds.  I do not expect that Deputy Dillon will ever disclose the facts, but at least, when he uses his position here in this House and talks in the manner in which he does in relation to Ireland we know and understand him and ignore him accordingly, but when he is speaking about the American Congress there is no justification for him to use the words &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; and &ldquo;jacking up&rdquo; in regard to any action of the American people.</P>

      <P>We were told by Deputy Dillon with great emphasis, prior to a reply to a parliamentary question which was put down to me a week or ten days ago, that this Government, by reason of its inertia, had lost the Marshall Aid Grant&mdash;that we had lost £6,000,000 by reason of our inertia and our failure to pursue the programme which had been agreed upon by the last Government and the American Administration. There is not a word of truth in that statement.  It is not true to say that any definitive arrangement or agreement was arrived at between Mr. Costello's Coalition Government and E.C.A. in regard to the utilisation of the Marshall Aid Grant funds.</P>

      <P>Some tentative discussions took place in November, 1950, between Deputy Dillon and Mr. Miller. There is a record of those discussions which makes it plain that they were informal and exploratory and that they did not purport to cover exhaustively proposals for the entire utilisation of the Grant Counterpart.  Neither the Government nor E.C.A. were committed to the items under discussion. The fact of the matter is that some of <Col N="394" /> those proposals&mdash;proposals in which Deputy Dillon was himself intimately concerned&mdash;were proposals which the E.C.A. authorities were unwilling to discuss at all.  Among these proposals was one which the E.C.A. definitely rejected long before this Government came into office, and the trouble and difficulty has been to prepare a schedule for the utilisation of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart money which will be acceptable to the E.C.A. authorities.  The real fact of the matter is that, if Deputy Dillon conducted himself at these negotiations with the E.C.A. authorities in the same overbearing manner which he used towards the deputations coming to him in regard to agricultural problems, on this occasion he met people with whom he could not be overbearing and on whom he could not trample.  The whole thing was, in consequence, left in the air because of Deputy Dillon's stubborn insistence on his own point of view.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went over to Britain in 1948 and tried to imitate Mr. Churchill.  Mr. Churchill wears a peculiar and funny hat, so does Mr. Dillon.  Mr. Churchill smokes a cigar; Mr. Dillon smokes a cigarette.  Mr. Churchill speaks in rotund phrases; Mr. Dillon speaks about drowning people in eggs.  The Deputy did not get very far in London. He made himself a figure of fun and was looked upon as the &ldquo;Playboy from the Western World.&rdquo;  He brought his colleagues, and not merely his colleagues but his country, into contempt as a result of his attitudinising in London.  However, let us leave Deputy Dillon.  History will look upon him as a caricature and will make him a figure of fun.  That is what he is, that is what he was in London and what he was in the Department of Agriculture.  That is what he is in opposition.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  There is something else I want to get on with. I was asked by Deputy McGilligan to deal with the present position of the scheme for arbitration and conciliation which was put in operation by our predecessors in the last Government in regard to questions of Civil Service remuneration and conditions.  Of course, Deputy McGilligan likes to have it both ways, but it was quite clear from the terms of that scheme and from the circular letter, which issued to the Civil Service organisations setting out the conditions on which it was going to be applied, that it was intended to operate for a year only, a trial year, and that at the end of that period the position would be reviewed and that such alterations and amendments as the Civil Service organisations, on the one hand, might desire to have made in it and the Minister for Finance&mdash;it is very important that we should not overlook the fact that the Minister for Finance represents the taxpayers&mdash;representing, as I have said, the taxpayers, thought should be made in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a queer thing&mdash;it is a very queer thing&mdash;that, though the trial year had elapsed before the last general election, before there had been any change of Government, there was not, so far as I recollect, any intimation given to the Civil Service that the scheme was <Col N="396" /> going to be permitted to continue in the form in which it had been originally put into operation.  There was, on the contrary, a very definite intimation that the scheme would be suspended until such time as agreement had been reached in regard to the amendment of it.</P>
    <P>In so far as the present Government is concerned I can say this&mdash;it is known that we viewed the application of this principle of arbitration with a great deal of apprehension because we realised that it really meant taking the control of a very important sector of the public expenditure out of the hands of the Government and out of the hands of the Deputies and entrusting it to a private individual who was to be appointed arbitrator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on whose fiat the Government would have to come to the Dáil, as I had to do in June last and ask the Dáil to vote a substantial amount of the taxpayers' money in order to honour the arbitrator's award.  We have always been doubtful about the wisdom of that scheme but, despite that doubt, we indicated that, since the principle of arbitration had been accepted, we were prepared to honour it.  That does not mean to say that if Deputy McGilligan has not been sufficiently careful to preserve and protect the rights of the taxpayers in this or in any other matter, we who have succeeded him are free to wash our hands off his indiscretions and say that, because Deputy McGilligan wished this on the taxpayers, we have got to carry the responsibility for imposing his burden on to the community by honouring the principle of arbitration.  We have, on the contrary, got to say that the interests and the money of the taxpayers will be protected and that to the extent to which the scheme previous in operation failed to provide sufficient safeguards for the taxpayers, we have got to ensure that those defects in it will be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also said that there were three questions at issue.  With regard to one, the question of political affiliations of Civil Service organisations, I can say it was always the <Col N="397" /> aim of the Fianna Fáil Party, from the first day it took office, to try to detach the Civil Service from political Parties.  I do not believe it is in the public interest that Civil Service organisations should be affiliated to political parties.  We have had to make an exception in regard to one organisation which, over a long period of time, might be thought by some to have established a right by prescription.  But we are not going to allow&mdash;and I hope no other Government that succeeds ours will allow&mdash;Civil Service organisations in general to become political machines.  The day that happens it is going to mean the deterioration, the degeneration of the Civil Service, and it is going to mean that this State, instead of remaining a democracy, is going to become a completely totalitarian or bureaucratic State.  That is one of the reasons why we will not have Civil Service organisations with political affiliations.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to say is in regard to this question of public agitation. Who would think, when Deputy McGilligan spoke in the House this <Col N="398" /> evening, that he was the Minister who withdrew recognition from a Civil Service organisation because it had engaged in public agitation during the period when the arbitration and conciliation scheme was in operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given us very much information or <Col N="401" /> deigned in any way to take cognisance of any of the general questions that were put to him with regard to the situation during the last few days. There is one rather important matter to which I should like the Minister to address himself, at any rate, on this Bill, which, I think, gives him power to do the necessary borrowing of the moneys he may require.  The Minister told us during his speech to-day that we are concerned here with an Irish problem and not with a British problem.  There is no person in this House who has addressed himself to this question, if I might exclude, without prejudice, some of the Ministers who have spoken, who does not realise that what we are trying to deal with is an Irish problem.</P>
      <P>We find that what is happening here in dealing with an Irish problem is that the most important part of the policy applied by the British Government to their problem and for the purpose of dealing with conditions in England, is part of the machinery which the Government are accepting here for the purpose of dealing with an Irish problem, which is an entirely different one.  I asked the Minister for Finance to-day whether the new bank rates had been agreed to, whether the Government had an opportunity of considering the matter, what the Government knew about it and whether the Government had concurred in the decision taken.  The Minister explained that the bank rate had been increased and that the reason for the change was the banks' fear of large-scale losses of deposits which would lead to a very severe restriction of credit.  That was the reason given&mdash; that fear of large-scale losses of deposits from the banks here would operate so as to result in a severe restriction of credit.  The Minister said that after discussion with representatives of the banks the Government felt that, in view of the need for precautionary measures against serious loss of deposits and of the curtailment of credit that might follow, they could not press further for a modification of the banks' decision, and that the new rates came into operation on the 20th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British problem to which an <Col N="402" /> increased bank rate has been applied is a situation in which the British want to reduce commercial activity in the normal sphere.  They want to reduce employment in the normal employing agencies; they want to curtail the purchasing power of their people and they want to cut down prices and profits in the more normal activities of the country's life in order that they may have capital, that they may have labour and they may have capital equipment for an economy devoted to a large rearmament problem. Therefore, as I say, over the normal range of a very considerable amount of the country's necessary life they want to reduce employment, to reduce activity and to reduce profits. We here, on the other hand, are concerned with the delayed operation of building up the resources of our country and utilising our capital and credit for that purpose, but through the action of the banks in changing their bank rates we get applied to us, a country where a normal commercial, industrial and agricultural economy remains to be carried on, the particular type of policy that Britain has applied to stop development, to stop employment and to stop providing immediately for a large part of their economy there.</P>
    <P>I say the Government here are acquiescing in the application in a most emphatic way of a policy which can have no effect here except to stop development, to reduce activity in commercial life, to reduce employment and to reduce the profits that should naturally arise in industry.  That is the situation that is being covered up here to-day by all the window-dressing of gibe, sneer and criticism and lack of explanation we have had from the Government Benches.  I listened to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Friday last, hoping that he might bring, with the responsibility that attaches to his Department, some light into this situation, but I never heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce so effectively obscure in his remarks than he was on Friday.</P>
    <P>The bank rate has been increased from the 20th March.  So far as I can understand, the application of that policy here is being pursued with a raw <Col N="403" /> roughness by the banks that is not being applied even in Great Britain itself.  We are asked to acquiesce, without any further information from the Minister or the Government, in the application of these new rates, without any explanation as to the effect in detail that they are likely to have on the various types of loan takers or borrowers, or any review of what the likely effect is going to be on our commercial life or on employment here generally.</P>
    <P>The Government must take it that that is not going to be tolerated and will not be tolerated.  We have sitting here, in every Party in this House, men who have had not only many years of experience of life and work in the Dáil but who have sat as leaders of their various Parties in an Irish Government.  Every Party, therefore, in this Assembly has men sitting here as leaders who have had the responsibility of looking at the facts of Government machinery, of details of administration and the life of the country.  They have had the responsibility of sitting in a Cabinet as Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable that we are going to be asked by the members of the Government to sit quiet while we see a policy pursued of the kind that I have referred to, a policy that, in Great Britain, is intended to choke the normal activities of industry for a large section of the people there in order to force them to provide capital for their rearmament policy and the full operation of such industries as can contribute to their export trade&mdash;to see that policy applied to this country which wants its developments.  If that development is choked here through the bank rate, by a policy which is being pursued in Great Britain, then there will happen to this country what will happen to the choked side of the economy of Great Britain; our workers here will be forced from an economic area here over to Great Britain to take whatever part they can find in the rearmament employment that is there.</P>
    <P>That position cannot be left in the way it is.  All of us, as I say, have a fairly responsible approach to things. <Col N="404" /> We understand what it means to have our currency linked up in the way it is with Great Britain.  When the Central Bank Bill of 1945 was going through the Dáil, Deputy McGilligan, myself and others attempted to see that some kind of machinery would be introduced in it that would enable the Irish £ to be slipped from the British £ if it were necessary.  I do not see, in view of our close connection in trade as well as the volume of trade between the two countries, that it would be any advantage to slip the Irish £ from the British £, but if, under some of the emergencies which Fianna Fáil are capable of seeing in the world, it were advisable and necessary to do so, then there ought to be machinery there so that it could be done without having a wrangle about it at public meetings or at street corners or the crossroads.  We know that there are difficulties there. I am not pressing for anything but the clearest and simplest realisation of what is happening.</P>
    <P>I want to know whether, under the arrangements which have been made by the banks with personal borrowers, their rates on overdrafts or loans have been increased since the 20th March. If they have, then the change in the bank rate policy is being applied here with a rigidity and a brutality that it has not been applied in Great Britain. I want to know whether the new rates are being applied in relation to those people who borrowed for house building and house purchase, and whose borrowing transactions were completed before the 20th March?  Are they being asked to pay the new rates, because, as far as we can understand, the tendency in Great Britain is that they will not be asked to do so.  The Association of Building Societies in Great Britain discussed the matter, and while they agreed, I think, that the new borrowings and the new advances on mortgages would be raised by ½ per cent., they decided it was undesirable that the rates should be increased in respect of mortgages that had already been entered into.  It was left to individual societies to decide whether, in respect of loans already given, the rates would be raised.</P>
    <P>I want to know why, because the British Government wants to choke up <Col N="405" /> or choke down certain of their commercial activities and transfer employment from one economic activity to another, our local authorities are going to be asked to pay in respect of their overdrafts increased charges.  We had the spectacle during the last war of our banks, and the Central Bank, lending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, to Great Britain to finance the war activity which Great Britain was carrying on at that time.  They were lending the money at less than 1 per cent. Our Central Bank was lending money at 1.1 per cent. to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>During the war, while these banks were lending money at less than 1 per cent. to Great Britain, our local authorities were being charged 4 per cent. for moneys which were being utilised to cut emergency turf supplies for our people.  That is symptomatic of what was happening here.  What is there, in the world situation which Britain is faced with, which makes our local authorities have to pay more for their overdrafts?</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister, in respect of this Bill, if he has any idea of how he is going to fulfil what he is empowered to do under it. Section 3 of the Bill provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may borrow from any person and the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister for Finance any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole £44,490,530 and for the purpose of such borrowing the Minister for Finance may create and issue any securities bearing such rate of interest and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption or otherwise as he thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to get from the Minister some idea, and I think the Dáil is entitled to have from him some idea, of what &ldquo;he thinks fit&rdquo; at the present moment.  When the Central Bank Bill of 1945 was before the Dáil, I had occasion to call attention to a fact which had been disclosed a short time before in the report of the inquiry into the housing of the working classes in the City of Dublin. That was in 1939, when the Dublin Corporation were negotiating with the Banks' Standing Committee for the purpose of raising £2,000,000 for housing, <Col N="406" /> and when the banks declined to underwrite a public issue on the grounds as set forth in that report. The reasons given by the Banks' Standing Committee for refusing to underwrite the loan for the Dublin Corporation for the purposes of housing, are set out as follows at page 168 of that report: &ldquo;(1) The uneconomic character of the housing programme, aggravated by the high level of building costs.&rdquo;  That was in 1939; and &ldquo;(2) the magnitude of the sums required by the corporation for a five-year programme of public works.&rdquo; The Banks' Standing Committee&mdash;they were all in it&mdash;was holding up its hands in horror at the time at the idea of the Dublin Corporation proposing to spend a certain amount of capital on housing and other important public works.  Three months passed up to April of that year, and then the banks agreed to underwrite an issue of £1,500,000 on terms.  Negotiations still continued, and in April, 1951, an issue of £1,500,000 of 4 per cent. stock at 96 was put on the market, of which approximately £850,000, including Government investment, was taken up, and the underwriters had to take up the remaining £600,000.  That is at paragraph 495 of the report.</P>
    <P>Now, they did that at a very substantial profit having first injured the credit of the Dublin Corporation in the public mind.  In 1949 we found ourselves in somewhat the same position. The Dublin Corporation was then looking for £5,000,000.  Again the Banks' Standing Committee was refusing to facilitate the corporation, in such circumstances that the Government at the time was compelled to take the matter up with the Banks' Standing Committee and ensure that a certain arrangement was made.</P>
    <P>Actually the Banks' Standing Committee agreed that the Dublin Corporation would be accommodated to the extent of £5,000,000 at 3½ per cent.  I do not want to tie up Deputies in any kind of technical detail but I think it is worth recording here a small sum that can be easily understood for subsequent reference.  When banks give a loan for Government or other work certain things happen both as regards our balance of payments on the one <Col N="407" /> hand and the banks' profit on the other.  When £5,000,000 is advanced for housing by the banks, the housing scheme is put into operation.  Certain materials for housing are imported and it can be taken that one-third of the total amount of money invested in the housing programme is spent on imports. As a result of that when the imports are brought in one-third of £5,000,000 leaves the machinery of the banks and they have to sell some of their investments abroad in order that this country may pay through the proper channels for the materials that are brought in.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in respect of £165,000 the banks have to disinvest themselves of investments to that amount.  Taking it that they have an income of 3 per cent. on that amount, they would lose on that transaction £50,000.  The remaining two-thirds of the loan finds itself current here in money under various guises.  One-seventh of the amount, or approximately £480,000, is available in half-crowns, florins, ten shilling notes and pound notes.  In respect of that money the banks have to pay at the rate of 3 per cent. because they have to lodge securities at the back of that money to the extent of 3 per cent. They lose, therefore, on an investment of that kind something in the region of approximately £15,000.  The rest of the money is purely bank money held in the banks; four-fifths is held on deposit, upon which in the past interest to the extent of 1 per cent. had to be paid.  The other one-fifth is kept in current account in respect of which the banks have to pay no interest of any kind.</P>
    <P>When the £5,000,000 was issued by the Banks' Standing Committee to the Dublin Corporation for the purpose of enabling them to carry out their housing programme and when that transaction was in full swing £1,600,000 had been taken from the banks to pay for imports.  There was new money&mdash; pounds, shillings and pence&mdash;to the extent of £480,000 in circulation.  There was new bank money held in the banks on deposit to the extent of £2,296,000 and there was on current account in <Col N="408" /> the banks £574,000.  That gives a total of £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>On the moneys that were spent abroad the banks suffered a loss of income of £50,000.  On the cash in circulation here the banks had approximately a loss of £15,000, and in respect of the £2,296,000 on deposit in the banks they had to pay 1 per cent. That cost them about £23,000.  In respect of these losses, therefore, the effect of giving a £5,000,000 loan for housing meant that the banks suffered a loss of £88,000, but in loaning the £5,000,000 at 3½ per cent. they had an income of £175,000.  They had a difference, then, of profit, if they had no other expenses in connection with it, of £87,000.  But the banks claim that they have administrative costs in respect of money that is both current and on deposit of about 1 per cent. That would mean that they have administrative expenses of £27,000.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, but I am giving them credit for it.  The net result of the whole business is that on that loan of £5,000,000 to the Dublin Corporation the Irish banks generally made an annual profit of at least £60,000. Prior to that the banks had refused the Dublin Corporation terms on a loan that would have been much more advantageous to the banks and they had pressed on the Government that the terms were not good enough; generally, they wanted this loan to be given at 3¾ per cent. and issued at 99 instead of 100.  That would have brought the banks something like a profit of £73,000, something in the neighbourhood of £70,000 a year, at any rate, as well as giving them a bonus at the end of the term to the extent of 1 per cent., which would amount to something like £50,000.</P>
    <P>That was the position then and we were very anxious to face up to that position and to the use of our country's capital and our country's credit in the general pursuit of our national policy of development.  We had not had an opportunity of bringing these matters around the conference table to a clear understanding.  Speaking for myself, I was in the position that I could not see that the general personnel of the Banks' Standing Committee understood <Col N="409" /> their responsibilities as the creators of credit here or that they even understood their own particular interests.  It seems to me, from my former contact with the problem of the refusal of money for housing here, that if the public subscribed for housing without the banks having to give any contribution, the banking system loses money.  There is the development in the country that, associated with the development of our housing and the building up by our people of the roof over the nation's head, increases the country's prosperity, increases its income and brings the raw material, whatever the raw material of the banks is, to the banking mill to keep the bank mill going.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that they were entirely blind to that.  This is a problem which we have to face here in a constructive way.  It is not a problem which can be discussed and argued out on the side of the road.  It is a problem which it is very necessary to look at properly and to envisage in this Assembly.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, ask the Minister for Finance to tell us what is going to happen in regard to personal loans, what effect the recent increase in the bank rate will have on those people who, through their savings and their capacity to work and to earn and to develop this country by their efforts, are pledging their credit so that they can put a roof over their heads, form a home and be an integral part of the country's wealth and the security for the country's hope of happy, comfortably placed families.  For the moment I take the Minister for Industry and Commerce at his word when he asked, in a not very helpful speech, that Party bantering might at least stop while we discussed, either in arithmetic or in theory, where this country stands with regard to the use of its capital, the use of its credit, and the purposes to which these are to be applied.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many people who would like to haul the Minister for Finance over the coals when talking about the Marshall Aid moneys, where they came from, why they came, and what was done with them.  For the purpose of our discussion to-night and next week, when we face the <Col N="410" /> Budget, I give him a present of all he may say with regard to the squandering of that money.  But I would ask everybody here this question: whatever was done with the money, if it was squandered, has it made this country poorer from the point of view of the condition in which it finds itself to-day? It did not make the country any poorer for the purpose of working, on the one hand, and making use of the resources it has, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>What we are facing in this discussion and in the discussion of the Budget next week is what from the 31st March, 1952, with the resources and opportunities we have, we are going to do with these resources, whether of money, of credit, of land or of our industrial capacity.  Do not tell me that the moneys that were spent, however they were spent, and that came to us by reason of the fact that America gave us loans in order to enable us to continue to trade with them, will make the fabric of this country poorer on the 31st March, 1952. I suggest to the Minister that these are fundamental matters that require to be isolated from any kind of backwash of the bickering that the Minister seems to invite in this House, and that if these problems are not faced up to now, then another opportunity will be bedevilled and destroyed by the antics and the approach of the Government to these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the speech of the Taoiseach this evening and to the speech of the Minister for Finance, I am convinced that we are vainly attempting to fit our needs to a restricted money system instead of fitting our money to our needs.  In introducing the Vote on Account, the Minister for Finance said he hoped Deputy Hickey was listening.  I should like to know would the Minister wish me to be listening to the speech he made about the banks at a Fianna Fáil meeting in May, 1950, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government propose to launch the State on a career of unbridled extravagances in which every public interest and the resources of the industrious, the thrifty and the honest elements were to be sacrificed <Col N="411" /> to the urgent need for political support at any price with the savings of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The screw is to be put on the banks to do what Mr. McGilligan has admitted the public are not prepared to do.  That is the explanation of the cold war which the Coalition Government have been waging on the Irish banks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would expect that statement to come from somebody who was looked upon as an enemy of this country.  Here is the position of our banks.  For the 15 years ending in 1940 the net profits of the ten banks operating in Ireland amounted to £22,406,000 on a paid-up capital of less than £9,000,000.  In that period of 15 years they received more than their paid-up capital in profits. For the 11 years ending 1951, the net profits of the 10 banks amounted to £14,010,036, making a total of £36,416,000.  In the 14 years from 1938 to 1951, the assets increased from £208,163,835 to £455,003,732.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister when replying what will be the increase in the interest on the national debt as a result of the increased bank rate.  Speaking recently in this House, the Taoiseach complained about the extravagance of the previous Government because they had to pay £7,250,000 in interest on the national debt.  That amount is equal to the wages of 35,000 agricultural workers at £3 17s. 6d. per week.  In other words, it would take the earnings of 35,000 agricultural workers to pay these ten banks the £7,250,000 interest for the servicing of the national debt.</P>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Board are mulcted to the extent of £50,000 per year in interest on the money borrowed to develop the port of Cork.  I read a statement in this morning's paper from the general manager of the board that the increase in the bank rate will increase that amount by £3,000.  The Cork Corporation are about to borrow £500,000 for building houses and £100,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  I want to know from the Minister what control we have over the banks.  Is the <Col N="412" /> rate of interest on money to be borrowed to be increased?  The reason I am so keen on knowing that is&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Jack Lynch, will bear me out on it&mdash;that houses are being built at present by Cork Corporation for workers, and the rent of some of these houses is £2 per week.  The occupiers are unskilled workers but, because one or two of their family happen to be working, they have to pay a rent of £2 per week.  The loan charge on a four-roomed house by the Cork Corporation is over £63 per annum, and the loan charge on a five-roomed house is over £73 per annum.  Anybody who can use his intelligence can calculate that the loan charges on houses in Cork average from 23/- to 33/- per week.  This is a matter in which we should interest ourselves seriously.  It surprises me when I hear statements from this, that and the other Minister in which they deliberately try to conceal these facts and by which they endeavour to fool the people.  I have said in this House on other occasions, and I repeat it again, that this problem is very serious. The best brains of the country should be called upon to find a solution for this most important matter.  I cannot understand why any Party or any group of people should try to make capital out of the situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot dispute the fact that there are men, women and children in Cork City rotting and suffocating in slums and hovels, which other people would not use to house their animals, because we cannot get sufficient money to build them proper houses.</P>
    <P>When we floated a loan last April for £500,000, what was the result?  We got from the banks in Cork the sum of £80,000, £75,000 from the insurance companies and £70,000 from the investing public.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told me recently that it did not matter who controlled the banks in Ireland in matters of this kind.  I say now, in all seriousness, that that is a most irresponsible statement.  The banks are controlling our economic life. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce last Friday was asked was he aware that the bank rate was going <Col N="413" /> up he did not seem to have any knowledge of the matter.  We are now told that it is up from the end of the month. Therefore, what is our status here? When I told the Minister in this House last Friday that everybody in the country would stand behind him if he wanted to make the changes necessary, he said it did not matter who controlled the banks in a matter of that kind, unless we were going to establish a Soviet system, under which we could control the life and resources of every individual.  I repudiate the suggestion that I was referring to Sovietism and I would expect something better from the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now about to quote from a speech made by the Taoiseach in 1929.  It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The control of our financial policy still remains with the Bank of England, and through the Bank of England with the British Government, and we may be assured that it will be used in the future, as in the past, without the slightest regard to our interests.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to quote also from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 24th March, 1952.  The particular article is headed: &ldquo;Britain Must Get Aid, U.S. Told,&rdquo; and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless Britain receives American aid she may have to reduce her defence programme or face bankruptcy...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I to be told that we require to go over and consult the British Chancellor of the Exchequer as to how we should do our business?  I am informed both by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I talk a lot of nonsense about this matter.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance and everybody else in the House and in the country that if we in this Parliament decided to pass an Act which would treat the English £1 as non-sterling would a disturbance be caused in the country?  I have as much regard for the people who have money <Col N="414" /> in our banks and in the Post Office Savings Bank, as have both Ministers. If the people had their money under the protection of the State, I am quite satisfied it would be more secure than if invested in foreign securities.</P>
    <P>A lot has been talked about unemployment in this House recently.  I was surprised to hear the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch, treat the unemployment problem as he did during the week.  Does anybody suggest that we are going to recover from our very undesirable financial position while we have 75,000 people in receipt of a paltry weekly income at the moment?  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch, seemed to think that it was a tribute to the Government that people remained unemployed rather than emigrate, and that it showed that they consider the phase of unemployment to be a passing one.  The 10,000 extra unemployed in this country at the moment were, for the most part, in receipt of £7 per week this time last year.  Now they are getting, by way of unemployment benefit, 22/6 per week, 7/6 per week for a wife, and 2/6 per week for each of two children, making a total of 35/- per week.</P>
    <P>Anybody who wishes can divide 35/- by seven and he will see that the allowance per meal, assuming three meals, is 8½d. per person per day.  I am not calculating the cost of light, coal, rent and the expenses of school-going children.  We certainly are not playing our part when we allow a situation of that kind to develop.  I am amazed to think that the Parliamentary Secretary would treat such a matter so lightly.  If the same man falls ill he gets 22/6 per week national health benefit for himself, his wife and two children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the speeches you made last year in Cork during the election campaign, I would not have expected to hear from you statements such as those I heard in this House recently.  This situation is too serious for words.  As I said already, if a man falls ill he only gets <Col N="415" /> 22/6 on which to keep himself for a week as well as a wife and two children.  They are expected to get three meals per day on this paltry sum. I am saying now, not from any Party angle but in an effort to try to bring recognition to the masses of the people, that we are not doing our duty as a Parliament in expecting decent, hardworking people to exist on that weekly income.  I think it is disgraceful, and certainly not a tribute to our civilisation, that so many decent men who would be willing to produce food should be refused the opportunity to work, and then expected to exist on a miserable weekly contribution by way of unemployment assistance to make sure that they would not revolt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to treat our problem in a new light, and we will never make progress until we give up the practice of dealing with effects and get down to fundamental causes.  It disgusts me to see responsible people in this House and others outside the House indulging in personal abuse.  I think we should feel ashamed of the manner in which we waste this House's time by passing insulting remarks.  The sooner we give up that practice the better it will be for the country.  The young men growing up at present will be imbued with new ideas&mdash;not with the ideas that some of us here are trying to uphold. Many people in this House believe that we can operate the present system, and still solve our problems.  We cannot, because the system we are trying to operate broke down in 1914 and was remodelled on the old pattern and is now being shattered beyond repair.  I remember hearing a quotation from Lloyd George, when he lived in the twenties, who said: &ldquo;We are suffering from an abundance of consumable goods.&rdquo;  Mr. Churchill, who is still alive, said: &ldquo;We are suffering from the curse of plenty.&rdquo;  What are we suffering from?  The Taoiseach was here this evening, and he said we must increase production or consume less. When I heard him saying that, he took me back to the speech of the Chancellor of the British Exchequer in introducing his Budget a few weeks ago.  He said that the only way you can strengthen <Col N="416" /> the pound is to make it scarce, and we are doing that.</P>
    <P>The average wage to-day of thousands of our workers who are in employment is £6 or £6 3s. 0d.  That is for the unskilled worker: some of them have £5 18s. 0d.  The agricultural worker has £3 7s. 6d. or £3 8s. 0d.  The highest wage of the county council road worker is £4 per week.  Quite recently it was officially stated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the value of the pound was 9/9.  A wage of £3 10s. 0d. a week at 9/9 is hardly worth 30/- in terms of purchasing power.</P>
    <P>What are we doing for our people in the legislation we are passing here? We are certainly not going to improve the position by trying to patch up the present system.  I suggest that there is no need to waste any further time in that direction.  We must accuse ourselves of not doing justice to the unemployed or to the widows and orphans.  The old age pensioners cannot get any more than a pound, and at its present value of 10/- we all know how much can be purchased for that. We boast about what we have achieved.  We say we have done this and that; that it was we did the whole thing; the plans were there, and so on.  If that is the best we can do for the mass of our people, it is very little.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us to what extent the increase in the bank rate will have effect on housing development and the other matters that must be attended to, and that he will tell us politely and not hurl insults at people by suggesting they do not know what they are talking about.  We can talk about the principles of economics, but those principles will crumble into dust if we cannot provide the people of this country with the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>In regard to the unemployed, I want to say this, not in any partisan way, to Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary: are we satisfied that the unemployed are a class apart from us in the community?  Does anybody ever take the trouble of reading the report of the Revenue Commissioners? I took the trouble of looking <Col N="417" /> up the last report and I discovered that there are 5,229 persons in this country who have an annual income between them of £17,000,000 odd.  Yet we have unemployed men under the restriction that they must not use their labour to produce the things they want for themselves and their children. What kind of a system would you call that?  I always feel that we must accuse ourselves when we see the privations of those decent men who are sick and tired of walking to the labour exchange.  They are trying this, that and the other job without success; then we are told in this House that we must increase production.  What is the meaning of asking us to increase production while we have 72,000 men willing to work and produce the goods who are prevented from working? If we are poor, we could be much richer by enabling those 72,000 people to produce goods and the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>This matter is too serious for any Party politics to be indulged in and I feel that the best brains in the country should be sought to deal with the control of money and credit.  The Government should take courage in their hands and face the issue.  In taking control of the money and credit of this country they will have the backing of the Labour Party, and everyone who is interested in making this country economically free.</P>

      <P>It is rather peculiar for me to hear Deputy Hickey speaking of the large number of unemployed in this country.  I spent the last six or seven weeks travelling from school to school in a portion of my constituency taking lists of men, farmers, who wanted labour for the purpose of harvesting beet.  I find that in order to provide that labour, despite the lists of gentlemen who, we are told, are registering in Cork City for employment, we have to send delegates up to Connemara to employ there the men who previously went to Britain to find employment in each season.  Those men informed us that the terms we were offering them were better than the terms they were getting in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the propaganda and the rather vicious campaign that was carried <Col N="418" /> out right, left and centre throughout the country, against the growing of beet this season in the hope of bringing us to the same position as the inter-Party Government found themselves in last February when they dumped into this country 74,000 tons of foreign sugar, the only difficulty I find in getting farmers to grow beet is the difficulty of labour.  On one side, you have 74,000 men registering at the labour exchange looking for work and being unable to find it; on the other hand, you have the position where labour is required on the land and it cannot be obtained.  That is the position to which I want this Government and other Governments to pay attention. Deputies on these benches, including Deputy Hickey, must accept a share of responsibility for this situation.</P>

      <P>I want to point out the result of what the Deputies opposite did.  When Deputy Dillon first set the ball rolling, he said: &ldquo;I want to be judged by the number of cows and the stock on the land when I am leaving <Col N="420" /> office.&rdquo;  Let us see what the position of this country is now on that basis. We will have to go abroad again and buy foreign butter.  Why?  In 1950-51 you had a reduction of 19,000 cows and 33,000 in-calf heifers.  Let Deputy Dillon have a look at the figures in respect of 1951-52 and he will find that there is a further reduction of 38,800 cows and of 14,000 more in-calf heifers, that is 104,000 odd less milch cattle left in this country now than there were two years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows how wise Deputy Davin is.  That, a Chinn Chomhairle, is one of the problems that we now have to face when we hear of this talk about increased production on the land.  I agree with Deputies Norton and Hickey that you cannot have a position in this country whereby the producer of food will be paid 50 per cent. of the wages of any working man in any other industry.  That is the position.  The Deputies who marched round the Lobby and voted against giving the farmers an economic price for their food are the Deputies who are responsible.</P>
      <P>What is the cause of this unemployment? A couple of months after the very welcome departure of the Deputies opposite from the benches on this side of the House I found an unemployment problem in the town of Midleton. I went down to inquire the cause of it. The information I received there was that in the previous 12 months 7,250,000 yards of foreign cloth were dumped in this country.  Cloth manufactured here amounts to 6,500,000 yards.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is certain to get it&mdash;as Beelzebub.  I will do as much as I can with the clown for Davin. The position, a Chinn Comhairle, is that during the last 12 months there have been dumped in this country 3,500,000 yards more cloth than was required.  I was informed by the manager that the total requirements were 10,500,000 yards; 7,250,000 yards were dumped in the country and 6,500,000 yards are produced here. Until those 3,500,000 yards, which are surplus to our requirements, are exhausted, there will be a shortage of employment in the worsted milling industry in this country.</P>

      <P>Why bring the cloth in? The Deputy should be forever thankful to us for having given new life to his tomatoes.  The Deputy should be forever thankful to us, and he ought to remember that with gratitude.  The dumping of that cloth is one of the reasons why there is unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements were made by Deputy Cafferky, and I noticed that they were very smartly taken up again to-night by Deputy McGilligan, who told us about the reductions in the sum allocated under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Last year, when Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, was moving the Vote on Account, he stated that all urgent schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act were finished, and that that was the reason for the reduction.  That was the reason for the reduction, last year, of more than £530,000 in the amount granted under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That represents <Col N="422" /> over £500,000.  Then Deputy Davin is wondering why there is unemployment in Laois.</P>

I said some time ago that the Opposition Parties reminded me of nothing more than the gentleman who came into town and took furnished rooms.  The first week he sold the chairs to keep him going.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw.  Deputy Sweetman does not go to the bar, he may be too tight.  We have, however, to get down to fundamentals to see if we can succeed in getting a move towards increased production on the <Col N="428" /> land.  I fail completely to see how you can expect one section of the community to produce food, in face of the treatment which they receive from certain quarters.  I heard Deputy Larkin here to-day make statements amounting to threats in regard to the compulsion that has to be used to make farmers produce food.  It is about time that the farmers and the agricultural community were as free as any other section of the community. Until such time as this House realises the problem that is there and acts accordingly, the problem where you had some 60,000 men leaving the land of this country during a period of three years for one reason only&mdash;that they could earn one and a half times as much money in any other employment than they could earn on the land&mdash;you cannot expect any great improvement in the situation.  At the present day you will not get men to work overtime on Sundays, when every other individual in the country is enjoying his day of rest, unless you are prepared to pay them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey complained because a certain section now unemployed were getting only 35/- per week while they were idle.  The small farmers and the agricultural labourers have very little more than that when they are working. On the other hand, you have the position where you are paying the foreigner one and a half times as much for commodities that this land could produce, than our farmers were getting here for the same commodity.  You paid the foreigner last year somewhere between £10 and £12 per ton more for foreign sugar than you paid your own people for the native produce.  You are in practically the same position as regards wheat.  Deputy Dillon informed us that the trouble was to find some way to spend all the E.C.A. funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were plenty of ways in which that money could be utilised that would give permanent employment to the people of this country instead of sending it out to buy Formosan sugar or to buy the muck that was imported here under the name of foreign barley. There were plenty of ways in which that money could be expended to give employment here.  We had a number <Col N="429" /> of industries in which half of the required machinery was lying waiting for the purchase of the balance and it would not be purchased.  Commission after commission was set up here as a smoke-screen to prove that the work could not be done.  Where is the use of talking about unemployment here when you have that condition of affairs?  I know what the position was in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>I know what the condition of affairs was there.  I could see staring me in the face that permanent employment could be found there for 300 or 400 men producing what has to be imported into this country to-day.  But we were told: &ldquo;Oh, it is a serious matter and it must be investigated.&rdquo; After nine or ten replies of that description, we were told that it had been referred to the Industrial Development Authority, which was still talking about it when the gentlemen opposite were removed from office. But three months after that, men were working in setting up that sheet-mill to give more employment to our people.  We did that without waiting for the Industrial Development Authority to inquire into it.  What is the use of coming in here and talking about unemployment when we have these deliberate holds-up which denied constant employment to our people?</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week that there were portions of the machinery for three other mills lying there to be put together.  They were waiting for the portions that were missing to be got across.  We had that policy of abeyance and of deliberate holds-up.  We had Deputy Dillon last week asking where would the money be spent.  He said the whole trouble was, where they were going to spend it&mdash;that it all had to be spent by 31st March each year.  These works were lying there at that time.  The machinery was lying there during the period when the difficulty of getting the balance required from abroad would have been far less than it is to-day and so getting these industries going.  Why was that not done?</P>
    <P>When American dollars were borrowed, I suggest that they would have <Col N="430" /> been far better spent in giving permanent employment to our people and in getting these industries going than in the manner in which they were spent, rushing from one end of the world to the other looking to buy what should be produced here by our own agricultural community.  It is time that we worked down on this and found some means of rectifying that position. If, even now, we can get these mills working we can save money.  I think it is correct to say that there is roughly £1,500,000 worth of tin plate being brought in here.  Portion of the mill that could be utilised for manufacturing that tin plate was lying idle in Haulbowline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not keep the House more than five minutes. I think there was a lot of arrant nonsense talked by Deputy Corry about unemployment, especially in the rural areas.  He charged the last Government with responsibility for that.  At the risk of repeating myself, I want to say that, in 1949, the last Government recognised that there were two problems in the rural areas, one drainage and the second, which was no less important, the problem of unemployment in the rural areas which <Col N="432" /> had been rife for three or four years since the cessation of hostilities. Because there were these two problems, they made money available to carry out schemes under an Act which they introduced and passed in this House, the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The result of that Act, during the latter portion of the régime of the last Government, was such that there was less unemployment in the rural areas than there ever had been in the history of this country.</P>
      <P>The position when the Estimates were being prepared last year was this: there was an effort on the part of the last Government to promote an intensive turf campaign to try to give encouragement to the turf counties to produce the turf requirements for two years.  Money was curtailed, as far as the Local Authorities (Works) Scheme was concerned, but in those counties where turf was not being produced they got the very same amount of money as they had received in the previous year.  Now as far as the last Government and the Minister for Local Government were concerned in respect of schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, money was no object.  Deputy Corry's constituency had experience of that; Deputy Davern's constituency had experience of it, and Meath had experience of it, where, when they ran short of funds in the latter portion of the financial year, there was no trouble at all in getting all the money they wanted from the Department of Local Government. There was a definite understanding, which can be corroborated by the Secretaries of the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government, to the effect that if money were required to carry out drainage schemes and alleviate unemployment, that money would be produced by this House by way of Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance can have that confirmed by their departmental officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the last Government as far as employment in the rural areas is concerned was one of its proudest achievements, and that is the one thing that is annoying Deputy Corry because even his supporters who, down through <Col N="433" /> the 16 years of the Fianna Fáil régime, found themselves dependent on relief schemes two, three or four times a year for three or four weeks at a time, found they could get good steady employment with the inter-Party Government in office.  Call it a Coalition or anything you like, it does not make any difference.  The rural workers know and appreciate that during that three and a-half years there was a near approach to full employment in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy made a very ingenious, but also a very disingenious attempt to face the real issue in regard to the recent changes which have been made <Col N="437" /> by the banks in the interest which they offer to those who have deposits with them and in the interest which they charge for accommodation to their customers.  He endeavoured to create the impression that the banks had taken this action, not with any particular regard to their own local circumstances, but because in some way they were anxious to comply with a policy which had been determined elsewhere. Deputy Mulcahy is not quite as ill-informed and as inexperienced as his speech would indicate he wishes to be regarded.  In fact, he is not as big a fool as he pretends to be.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to this question of the bank rate is a very simple one.  The total deposits, including current accounts which bear interest, in the banks amount to £240,000,000.  A large part of that, I think £35,000,000 or £40,000,000, consists of farmers' deposits.  Another portion of it may be trustee money held for a short term.  Other portions of it may consist of moneys temporarily held in reserve against future purchases.  But a very large part of it consists of deposits of a very substantial value, deposits upon which a failure to secure the maximum interest available would involve their owners in substantial losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our banks are in a peculiar position. The activities of the larger ones amongst them are not confined to the narrow boundaries of this State.  Many of them have branches and a widespread organisation in the Six Counties as well as in the Twenty-Six. One of them even does a substantial business in Great Britain.  It is, therefore, a comparatively easy matter for depositors to change their deposits, to remove their moneys out of our banking system and to place them elsewhere where they can be more remunerative than they might be here. Steps had to be taken to prevent that.  In order that this flow of deposits might not take place, in order that these moneys might remain here and be used to finance our trade and our industries in the Twenty-Six Counties, some steps had to be taken, in view of the fact that elsewhere the rates of interest payable on deposits <Col N="438" /> with the banks have been increased. There is no doubt that if our deposit rates were not increased there would be a substantial risk, if not indeed a positive certainty, that a very large volume of money would leave the Twenty-Six Counties and be placed elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving the Deputy any guarantees.  I want to deal with the points raised by Deputy Mulcahy and I want to say that there is no apprehension at the moment that the change in the bank rates will be reflected in any increase in the interest from the Local Loans Fund.  If and when the Government has to raise money in the open market for the purpose of keeping the Local Loans Fund filled, then naturally, the rates of advances from the fund will be conditioned by the terms upon which the Government has to raise its own money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And strange as it may appear these have not been affected by the change in the bank rates, at least not seriously affected in an adverse way.  On the contrary, since the increase in the Bank of England rate, in so far as there has been any movement in gilt edged securities, including our own, the trend has been slightly upwards.  Therefore, in so far as we will have to offer more <Col N="441" /> attractive terms in respect of the next loan than have been offered in this country since 1933, the change in terms will not have arisen directly out of any change which our banks have made in their rates or which the Central Bank may make in its discount ratio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, but Deputy Byrne got me off my track. Deputy Mulcahy asked was it suggested that this country had been made poorer because of the moneys which had been borrowed under Marshall Aid?  That is a very interesting question and, paradoxical as it may seem, because of the moneys which were secured by way of loan under Marshall Aid the country has been rendered poorer.  That money was not spent on capital projects at all, on re-equipping Irish industry or improving the organisation of Irish agriculture.  How was Marshall Aid spent?  It was spent purchasing wheat and corn which could be grown in this country and which was grown here by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Seventy seven million dollars of borrowed money was spent on the importation of wheat and corn into this country.  We borrowed <Col N="442" /> and spent $35,000,000 importing tobacco.  Five million dollars were borrowed and spent on the purchase of paper pulp and newsprint. Four million dollars were borrowed and spent on motor vehicles.</P>
      <P>The amount of money which was spent in providing this country with manufacturing industries, new plant and equipment, electrical equipment and other constructional equipment amounted only to $6,000,000 out of a total of $128,000,000 of borrowed money.  This $6,000,000 spent by our predecessors represented a trifle more than two years' interest on the Marshall Aid loan.  We are paying this year, as I have already told the House, $1,600,000&mdash;not sterling but dollars&mdash; which will be difficult to procure.  That represents only a half-year's interest. The full year's interest would be $3,200,000.  Two years' interest represents more than was spent on capital equipment from the Marshall Aid moneys by our predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Mulcahy or anybody else in this House asks if the country is poorer as a result of the Marshall loan I say, paradoxical as it may seem, that it is so.  It is so, because every year, for something like 50 years, we shall be paying back, by way of interest rates, $3,200,000 on a loan of $128,000,000, of which loan only $6,000,000 was spent on machinery, industrial equipment, electrical equipment, agricultural equipment and constructional equipment generally.  It ought not to have been that way.  That money was intended to enable this country to reorganise its industry and its agriculture. It ought to have been spent in providing the industries of this country with new plant, new equipment, up-to-date plant and up-to-date equipment which would give us an efficient manufacturing industry and which would enable us to break into the export markets which are now so essential to us if we are going to succeed in maintaining the present standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what should have been done with the loan.  But that is not what <Col N="443" /> was done with it.  Not merely that, but when the then Minister for Finance submitted a proposal to the Government asking them to decide that the Marshall Aid money would only be spent for essential purposes and for capital equipment, what happened?  The Minister for External Affairs torpedoed him.  Insted of that principle being adopted and adhered to by the Government, it was thrown over at the instance of the Minister for External Affairs, who only wanted to have a widespread expenditure of public money which would create an apparent prosperity which was fictitious and which was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The facts are that the Government decided that they would not accept the principles which the then Minister for Finance suggested should be adopted in regard to the allocation of these dollars which had been borrowed from America. They threw over his suggestion, and they actually went out, issued an advertisement in the newspapers, telling all and sundry that they could get the dollars for any purpose whatever, so long as they were prepared to put one pound for every 2.82 dollars that they got, under the control of the then Minister for Finance, so that this money might be scattered widespread throughout the country on every wildcat scheme that could be devised.  So that, as I have said, a fictitious appearance of prosperity might be created, and so that they might go around and say, as they were saying during the past three years: &ldquo;This country never enjoyed living conditions such as we enjoy now.&rdquo;  The people opposite spent the money and now it has to be paid back. The people opposite squandered that money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Instead of facing up to their responsibilities, those opposite now say that a fictitious crisis has been created, that no one need worry about the balance of payments.  They suggest that talk of external assets is unduly alarming.  But if this deficit in the balance of payments is not remedied we shall have no external assets inside two or three years.  That is the position to which the last Government reduced this country&mdash;which, when we left office, was among the stronger creditor countries in the world.  They have brought it almost to the stage at which we would be among the depressed nations. But we will not permit that.  They ran away for three years from their responsibilities in regard to the public finances.  We are prepared to face up to those responsibilities.</P>
