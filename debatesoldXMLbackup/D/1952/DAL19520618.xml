      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will indicate what arrangement will be made for the sale of bread, flour, tea and sugar when rationing ceases on 4th July, 1952, and whether it is intended that creameries will be permitted to engage in the business.</P>

      <P>The Emergency Powers Orders which required retailers of tea and sugar to be licensed by me will be revoked concurrently with the abolition of rationing.  There will then be no question of permission from me being necessary for any person or concern to engage in the retail sale of these commodities. There is no prohibition on anybody engaging in the retail sale of bread or flour.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the general decay of Irish provincial towns, he will indicate if he contemplates any method of solving the problem of trade competition between creameries and towns and also between towns and travelling shops.</P>

      <P>I am unable to accept the implication in the Deputy's question. On the information available to me I do not consider that retail trading as carried on by co-operative creameries necessities any action on my part.  Where travelling shops are concerned I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on the 28th <Col N="1366" /> February, 1952, to a question from him on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I answered a somewhat similar question by the Deputy in Dáil Éireann on 7th November last, I indicated that I had been considering the possibility of fresh mineral surveys in a number of areas, including Allihies, where the mineral indications afford a prospect of profitable development.  At that stage I had in mind the possibility of an exploration scheme with the assistance of E.C.A.  Before the consideration of the matter had been finalised by E.C.A., American economic assistance to this country was terminated. In the altered circumstances, I am considering the matter afresh, but I am not yet in a position to say what steps it may be possible to take to have surveys carried out in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the present system of allocating permits for the supply of potatoes to the alcohol factories which <Col N="1367" /> is followed by Ceimici Teoranta is causing grave dissatisfaction amongst producers; and, if so, if he will endeavour to have the position rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in one area only dissatisfaction has been expressed by some growers at the delay in taking up their potatoes for use in the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  I am informed by Ceimici Teoranta that this delay is unavoidable, and is due to the very substantial quantity of potatoes on offer in this area.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in reply to a somewhat similar question on the 3rd April last, arrangements for the purchase of potatoes intended for use in the industrial alcohol factories are solely the responsibility of Ceimici Teoranta, in which I do not intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cause of the dissatisfaction is not so much the delay in getting the potatoes to the factory, but rather in regard to the issue of permits?  It is known that permits have been issued to people who had applied, say, six weeks ago, and that a second permit may have been issued to the same people, while other people, who had applied three months previously, have not received a permit yet.  That is the real point at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company inform me that its normal practice is to take up tenders in strict rotation, but that that cannot always be followed, although the aim of the company is to do so.  In the particular area which the Deputy has in mind, there are substantial quantities of potatoes on offer to the factory.  It can only take 300 tons per week, and, in fact, in that area an arrangement has already been made to transfer potatoes to other areas, but that can only be done to a limited extent also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board inform me that the Milltown rural area has been considered for development under the rural electrification scheme on a number of occasions, the latest occasion being in April of this year, but so far it has not been successful as its financial return does not compare favourably with that of other areas.  The board state that it is not possible at this stage to say when supply may be extended to the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Briscoe, I take it that the interest on this additional £43,000,000 which the last Government put into sterling assets, was the same amount as was normal.  I have not got the exact particulars, but I think there were answers on that subject given to Deputy MacBride when he accused the present Government of keeping the assets over there instead of investing them in houses here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy O'Donnell, I am afraid that Deputy O'Donnell, being a latecomer into Fine Gael, does not realise that the criticism of the present Government in relation to our external assets is that we have not <Col N="1370" /> spent them all.  He does not realise that this particular answer shows that while the Coalition groups are criticising the Government for keeping any money in external assets they in fact increased them through the Central Bank and through Government funds by £43,000,000 during the three years they were in office.</P>

      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, would the Taoiseach solve the difference of opinion that is quite clear between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for External Affairs, because the Minister for Finance says that the previous Government spent all the external assets and the Minister for External Affairs now says that they increased the external assets?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not quite answered the question I put to him.  Is the Minister aware that, on the one hand, Deputy McGilligan kept indicating to this House that investment in British securities or in British paper was investment in waste paper, and can he say why, holding that view, the Minister for Finance for the Coalition Government increased by £43,000,000 the investment of State-controlled money?</P>

      <P>Further, is the Minister aware that only last night Deputy MacBride in this House accused this Government of withholding from this nation money that could be used for housing, and so on, and that we were, in fact, conducting treasonable activity in giving this money to Britain for war purposes instead of using it for homes and for our own economy?</P>

      <P>Considerable areas of land have been offered for afforestation in South Kerry, but a high proportion is unsuitable for afforestation. A recent offer in the Milltown area may, if the land proves suitable, improve the prospects of opening a new centre in that area.  The opening of a new centre in the Glenbeigh area is expected in the near future, and a recent acquisition of 300 acres in the Sneem area has extended the existing forest of Kenmare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not contemplated the introduction of television programmes as a matter of immediate concern.  Such a development depends on the construction in the first instance of a radio building on the site purchased some years ago and in regard to this there are many problems to be overcome.  In any event, the provision of television can only be considered in relation to the general extension of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Some of the smaller countries in Europe are operating experimental three to seven hour a week services, in some cases connected with the promotion of television manufacturing interests of great importance to the particular country's export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the <Col N="1376" /> cost of television is almost prohibitive for a small State, an hour's live outside broadcasting costing £700 to £1,200 over and above ordinary operating expenses.  In connection with the future of broadcasting as a whole the question of television with a high proportion of recorded outside broadcasts for transmission at fixed hours is being examined with a view to ascertaining maximum and minimum costs but this examination is in the nature of research and does not indicate that any immediate decision is contemplated.</P>
    <P>I should mention that with a view to safeguarding the country's position in the future in regard to wavelengths, the Department's engineering adviser has been sent to a conference at present meeting in Stockholm to take stock of the wavelength position in regard to television and very high frequency broadcasting and to draw up a preliminary plan of allocations, if found to be feasible at such an early stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We had only just started, as well as I recollect, to discuss Section 9.  I think the Minister will agree when I say that this section will mean that in certain counties smaller grants will be given than has been the case up to now.  In these counties which have adopted schemes with higher levels than these, the housing grant is going to be reduced. That is a very retrograde step.  It is, I think, the first time that a housing grant of any sort has ever been reduced.  Quite apart from the type of case which we shall be discussing on amendment No. 22, this section is going to have a tremendously bad psychological effect on housing.  In any of these counties where a scheme is in operation, that scheme is going to be slashed, as the Kildare scheme will be slashed, under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I put before the Minister on the last occasion the comments that I wished to make on the section.  I would seriously ask him to agree to the deletion of the section and to leave the question of the rate of income and the question of the grant to each local authority because quite clearly the figure for income that will suit Kildare and the figure that will suit South Cork will be entirely different.  The valuation of £12 10s. as set out in the section, in Kildare represents a different way of life to the valuation of £12 10s. in Kerry and the Kerry County Council on the one hand and the Kildare County Council on the other are far better able to decide what the appropriate limit income shall be for the purpose of their grants.  To try as this section does for the sake of uniformity to stream-line departmental <Col N="1383" /> provisions of this kind, means that it will have a very adverse effect, an effect which we would all be long sorry to see, in these counties that have already adopted schemes.  On this section, it is purely a question of means and I do not want to enter into any discussion at this stage on the question of current buildings which can more easily be argued on Section 22.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember that on the Second Reading I suggested that it was unfair even as between two farmers with the same valuation to treat a farmer who has lower overheads on the same basis as the farmer with higher overheads.  Perhaps it might be better to discuss this question on amendment No. 12, because it equally arises when a farmer has an overdraft or is indebted to the bank in connection with a mortgage.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should like to ask one specific question.  Where you have a farm held by two or more joint owners, if the farm is, say, one of £24 valuation and is in the name as joint owners of two brothers, does it mean under this section that the valuation is £12 for each of them or is the valuation to be £24?  In other words do you divide the number of joint owners into the valuation before you arrive at your figure?  In the other sections, where there is an income level, you add in the family income, but so far as I can see you do not necessarily follow the same procedure in the case of the valuation.  If there are two joint owners are you to divide the total valuation by the number of joint owners in order to arrive at the figure which is to be considered in connection with sub-section (1)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the section be deleted.  The Minister has already deleted Section 8 and he would be doing a good job if he deleted Section 9 as well.  Up to this county councils and other local authorities had a free hand as to what amount of grants they would give.  Some county councils felt it was good business to encourage people to build houses, and they gave the full grant.  Others felt that the county council could not afford to give any grant, and did not give any grant. It was up to the county council in each area to decide for themselves what they should do about it.  I think the Minister is becoming a kind of dictator when he says: &ldquo;No you do not decide for yourselves.  I will decide for you.&rdquo;  I object to the principle of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other cases where a county council gave a reduced letting grant to banks the Minister was not very long about telling them: &ldquo;You will not give a reduced grant; you must give the full letting grant to the banks.&rdquo;  In Kilkenny one bank applied in regard to two houses for a letting grant of £400. <Col N="1385" /> The council gave them a grant of £4 per year for ten years, or £40.  I was not in favour of that.  I was in favour of giving about £200, as I regarded it as an enterprise on the part of the bank.  This bank had not the courtesy to write to the county council and ask them to reconsider their previous decision and increase the grant.  They went over the head of the county council and wrote to the Minister to look into the matter.  I understand the Minister can decide the matter when there is a dispute, but in that case I hold that there was no dispute. Instead of writing to the county council about the matter the Minister sent down word that they were to give the bank £400.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in Killarney. I read in the papers where the Kerry County Council gave a bank a letting grant of 10/- per house and the Minister said: &ldquo;You will not give a letting grant of 10/- but a grant of £400 per house.&rdquo;  Is the Minister the Minister for banks or for the ordinary people of the country?  When it comes to banks, the Minister gives them £400, the full letting grant, but when he comes to deal with farmers he says: &ldquo;You must stay in the thatched house you were in always.  You are not fit for a new house.  It is only bankers we want to see getting new houses.&rdquo;  The Minister should have some regard for the farming community who have been working for a very small income for many years.  It is only within the last few years that some of them have come out of the mire.  They are anxious to improve their dwellings.  When the Minister gets the opportunity he will not tell the farmers to build houses and get decent dwellings. He says: &ldquo;If your holding is under £12 valuation you can get the full grant, but if it is higher than that you will not get the full grant.&rdquo;  I regard a farmer in my county, at any rate, with a holding of £40 valuation and a large family as a reasonably small farmer.</P>
    <P>I think we should give encouragement to these people and I ask the Minister to delete this section.  The Minister came to Kilkenny to open a <Col N="1386" /> housing scheme and we all welcomed him.  He assured us that he had the greatest confidence in the people and that he would show by his future actions the confidence he had in the urban authorities and the county councils, being a member of a council himself.  He said: &ldquo;I will give you more powers in this new Bill,&rdquo; but he has not done that.  My opinion is that the Minister should abolish the county councils if he has not confidence in them.  County councils have a sense of responsibility.  The councillors are ratepayers and they will not throw away money for the sake of throwing it away.  If the Minister wants to show any confidence in them he will delete this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in this difficulty.  I fully agree with the Minister that there should be some restriction on county councils.  I do not think it is correct that the ratepayers' money should be handed out to all and sundry. Where I disagree with him is that I am not prepared to admit that this is a suitable method.  I take it that selecting rateable valuation is a way of arriving at means.  I am not prepared to admit that rateable valuation is an indication of means.  It is quite possible that a man who would qualify under the Bill by being under £12 valuation would be very much better off than a farmer with a valuation of £40.  Then when you add to that the fact that the rateable valuations in the different counties do not necessarily bear any relation to each other, you find that this section will have different effects in different counties.  That is very unwise.  I should like the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Crotty with regard to the county councils.  The theory that we are all responsible ratepayers is only a theory, and does not always work out in practice.  It is unwise that ratepayers' money should be freely distributed by the local authorities alone, that is assuming that this service is one which is properly applicable to county councils at all.  My own view is that this matter of housing is a national matter and that the cost should be borne entirely on the <Col N="1387" /> Central Funds and that no part of the burden should be put on the county councils.  I admit that that is a wide matter to bring up in Committee. Feeling that county councils should not be burdened with this at all and that the rateable valuation is a very bad yardstick to use, I find myself in some difficulty.  Having those views, I still believe some restriction should be put on the county council.  It is easy to find fault with the suggested remedy and the only thing I can suggest is that other circumstances should also be taken into consideration.  The term &ldquo;farm&rdquo; is loosely used here.  &ldquo;Charity covers a multitude of sins,&rdquo; but what exactly does the Minister mean by &ldquo;farm&rdquo;?  There are people who are in occupation of agricultural holdings, who work those holdings but who have other means.  Will they be excluded? Where will the dividing line be drawn?</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that it is quite possible for a man to have a small holding and be engaged to a considerable extent in cattle dealing.  He may be a very wealthy man.  I take it that under this section he will be able to apply successfully to the county council for a 100 per cent. grant whereas a small farmer who has no other means and who farms land with a rateable valuation of £40 cannot get one red cent.  I would like the Minister to reconsider that position.  I think he will realise that rateable valuation is a very bad yardstick and that there is no real relationship between rateable valuations in County Donegal and those in counties like Meath and Kildare. What may be perfectly fair and just in one county might be very unjust and unfair in another county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the principle underlying Section 10 and I feel that the same principle underlies this section.  Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Sheldon and Deputy Crotty have referred to the different valuations in different counties.  Added to that is the fact that one man may use his holding for purposes other than farming and may be a very wealthy man.  There are various reasons governing <Col N="1388" /> the matter.  That brings us to the inescapable conclusion that there is no perfect method of assessing to whom a grant should be given.  Apparently the Minister is not satisfied with the methods adopted by county councils in the past.  I do not say that he has found evidence of any glaring anomalies but he evidently considers this a better method.  In the short time that has been devoted to the section I think it is quite obvious that anomalies will arise as the section stands.  For that reason I feel there is no perfect way of assessing who should receive the full grant and who should receive a lesser portion of such a grant.  The only conclusion then is that we should do away altogether with the means test, and give the grant to all and sundry.  I think that is the only just way because otherwise some will get the grant while others will be refused and in that way injustice may be done.  It is no injustice if everybody gets it.  It is unjust if a rich man gets it and a poor man does not.  Under the section as it stands that will undoubtedly happen and I do not believe anybody here, including the Minister, wishes that situation to arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon touched on a very important point in relation to this section.  The provision in the existing Act enabling county councils to give a grant equivalent to that given by the State represents in effect an attempt on the part of the State to pass over to local authorities a burden which local authorities were never asked to bear in the past.  I think it is an attempt, too, on the part of the central Government to be generous at the expense of the county councils and the local ratepayers rather than at their own expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the local authority is getting a rateable asset in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The asset has to be considered as against the liability that is imposed.  The 1947 Act represented a very far-reaching advance in the provision of grants for housing.  Under that Act the <Col N="1389" /> grant was raised to £270.  Prior to that it was only about £45 in the majority of cases.  That was a step forward but I think the attempt to outdo that by providing a similar grant at the expense of the ratepayers was not altogether a carefully considered reform.  I know the difficulties in which county councils find themselves in trying to decide who should and who should not benefit by this provision.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to say that all comers should get the 100 per cent. grant.  That is a simple solution of the problem.  If a county council, with its very limited finances, is expected to provide £270 for every house that is built a very, very substantial burden will be imposed on the ratepayers of that county. Deputy Crotty spoke very sympathetically about the farmers.  It must be remembered that the majority of the substantial ratepayers in most counties consists of farmers and it is upon them that the main portion of the burden will fall.  Instead of being generous to the farmers, therefore, Deputy Crotty was proposing to put upon their shoulders a very, very substantial burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this provision was first made it was conveyed to county councils that it represented an attempt at relieving the burden of work on county councils by assisting private individuals to build houses for themselves. I think our purpose in providing a contribution out of the rates should be to provide that contribution for those who would otherwise be a charge on the rates&mdash;the people with the small incomes and the low valuations for whom the county councils and the ratepayers are under statutory obligation to provide houses.  I think there is need for some restriction in relation to the manner in which these grants will be allocated.  I think this represents a cautions approach to the problem.  It may not be an entirely satisfactory solution but it is better than leaving it open to county councils to give a 100 per cent. grant to every person intending to build a house.  While it is true that the State gives a similar grant to every person proposing to build a house, it must also be acknowledged <Col N="1390" /> that the finances of local authorities are much more restricted than those of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell raised a question as to the extent to which ratepayers might recoup themselves by the establishment of new houses by an addition to the rateable valuation of the county.  I think if anyone worked the matter out carefully&mdash;I have not done so&mdash;I think he would find that the amount that would be collected in rates from a house provided under this scheme would be very far short of the amount that would have to be granted.  It from an applicant for a new house the £275 which it is proposed should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in passing strictures on this section.  In effect, the section, as has been pointed out, seeks to introduce into the financial provisions of the <Col N="1391" /> Housing Acts a means test.  The question of a means test has been a matter of controversial politics in relation to other matters.  Therefore, I do not think we should passively consider the new introduction of a means test under Section 9 without very careful examination. All of us can agree with what Deputy Sheldon has said, that it is, of course, desirable that no assistance should be given to those who, in fact, do not require assistance.  There has always been that good sense on the part of those who advocate a means test in relation to any particular thing. The trouble, however, arises when one seeks to put that into practice.</P>
      <P>In Section 9, the Minister, in order to put into force a means test, makes use of the easy method of poor law valuation.  He asks the House to pass a section which ties to the valuation of a holding the amount, if any, of the financial assistance which the housing authority may confer.  I think that is asking this House to legislate without any regard to what the facts are.  Valuation in this country is an antiquated and cumbersome system of valuing property, and has no regard to modern circumstances.  In many parts of the country, holdings have been valued in the past because of a certain amount of local pride on the part of landholders some 50 or 60 years ago.  In my own constituency, we have the mountainy area of Wolfhill tenanted by farmers with high valuations, of men who qualify for the full old age pension.  They have valuations of over £20.  These people are amongst the poorest of the poor.  I am certain that the same thing applies in many other rural constituencies.  Their position is that they have land which is valued as highly as land in the Counties of Kildare or Meath.  Under this crude means test suggested by the Minister these people are going to be penalised very severely.  I do not think that is a method of applying a means test which should recommend itself to this House. I think it betrays very hasty and illconsidered action on behalf of the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I might be prepared to concede the desirability, in certain circumstances, <Col N="1392" /> of some test as to means, I do not think this is the correct way of doing it.  Here the Minister seeks to apply a means test to the money that is being spent, not by the Minister, but by the housing authorities throughout the country.  He is seeking to control the money raised by them, money which they may or may not desire to spend by way of grants to certain people, and he is applying this test to the valuation.  I think if that is desirable at all, it can only be successful as a means test if a proper effort is made to find what the exact means are.</P>
    <P>The valuation of a holding of 20 or 30 acres, in my experience, does not represent the value of that holding to the owner.  The only way of finding the value of that holding as means to the owner is by assessing the market value of the holding.  I seriously suggest to the Minister, and I suggest it to him particularly as a representative of Laoighis-Offaly where this problem arises in a very acute form, that if he is anxious to introduce a means test he should do it by some method based on the actual value of the property owned by the farmer-applicant referred to in the section.  It should not be too difficult to provide in a section of this kind that, where a farmer applies for a grant, a market valuation should be carried out on his property, and that if the property exceeds the market value of, say, £400 or £500, he shall be entitled to a grant on a large scale, with a reduction as the value of his property increases.  That, I know, is open to objection.  It is not a perfect way of applying a means test, but at least it is more in accordance with the facts than the crude method of valuation applied by the section.  If the section is applied I can see impoverished farmers in parts of my constituency debarred for all time from any assistance from the Laoighis County Council by way of grant under this section.  I think that the Minister and his advisers are aware that that problem of high valuation on poor land exists in many counties throughout the country, and, knowing that, it is legislating with our heads in the clouds if we just apply this antiquated method <Col N="1393" /> of valuation in a housing Bill in 1952. That is what I want to say about valuation.</P>
    <P>I would like to agree completely with what Deputy Sheldon has said in connection with the lack of definition of a farmer under this section.  I am sorry to say that Deputy Sweetman has pointed out that Deputy Sheldon appears to be completely wrong because the farmer is defined in the definition section as a person &ldquo;who derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have to depart as an ally from Deputy Sheldon. It does seem to me that the definition does cover the point made by Deputy Sheldon.  But I do say to the Minister that if he wants a means test&mdash;and, mind you, the Minister's colleague in another Department was against a means test&mdash;he should try to introduce some method which will not make more difficult the conditions of certain landholders throughout this country who are struggling against high valuations on their lands imposed 60 or 70 years ago, when it was a great thing to have a high valuation; it qualified one for the grand jury, and so on.  Many landholders in parts of my constituency 60 or 70 years ago actually went out of their way to have their land highly valued, and to-day we find unfortunate holders of land who are owners of bits of mountain, very poor pasture land, having to pay for the vanity of people who went before them 60 or 70 years ago.  They are going to be penalised by a section of this kind.  In view of the objections that have been expressed by Deputies in the House I ask the Minister to reconsider the section and to devise some other method for the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the objections raised by the previous speakers to this section.  We all know that if we had sufficient money we could give grants to everybody <Col N="1394" /> looking for them but taking into account the fact that we have only limited funds available, I believe it is an admirable section and one that should be retained.  I also believe that the Minister's advisers who formulated this section should be congratulated.  This section gives to small farmers who own a house the opportunity of getting a supplementary grant.  We all know that the lot of small farmers is not a very happy one and these supplementary grants would be very welcome.  I cannot see for the life of me why there should be objection to the system by which it is proposed to give these grants.  Surely the valuation system is the best system that one could arrive at.  What better method is there?  In 95 per cent. of cases the valuation of a farm gives a true indication of the wealth of the owner.  There are very few farmers, possibly not 3 per cent., below the £12 10s. valuation who are men of affluence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon says that in the case of people with whom farming is only a side line and who engage in some other occupation, they could, so to speak, obtain a grant under false pretences. Will they not be precluded from benefiting under Section 10?  If a school teacher, say, has a small farm the valuation of which is £9 or £10, he cannot get a grant because under Section 10, if his income exceeds a certain amount, he will be precluded from benefiting.  Therefore, taking everything into account I believe this section is a good one, the best that could be designed under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only amendment I would suggest is in sub-section (4), that if the figure of £35 were increased to £50 it would meet the situation.  It is all very fine for Deputies from the Midland counties to speak about the position of farmers living in those areas with £50 or £60 valuation.  Travelling through the Midland counties I see the type of land these people own and, comparing it with the land that is generally owned by the people that this section will benefit, there is a vast difference.  If these people are not sufficiently well off to provide themselves <Col N="1395" /> with a house, seeing that they will be entitled to a State grant, it is more their own fault than anyone else's if they do not receive the benefit.  I want to repeat that I entirely agree with this section.  As I say, the only amendment I would suggest is that in sub-section (4) £35 should read £50.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with this matter in regard to the definition of a farmer.  Deputy O'Higgins was very easily scared off by Deputy Sweetman.  Have they never heard of conacre?

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins was following me and agreeing with me; then he was scared off.  Deputy Michael Murphy spoke about school teachers who might have farming as a side line.  There are all sorts of vague cases which will require definition. Conacre is one; cattle dealing is another.  There are quite a number of small cattle dealers and it is going to be very difficult for the local authority or the Department to decide just what is meant by &ldquo;mainly derived from agriculture&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose the amendment.  There is nothing dictatorial in this section.  I know county councils who have not adopted the Act and are not contributing towards the erection of houses by farmers in any way.  I see no reason why the Minister should be asked to withdraw this particular section.  There are benefits in it.  I agree with Deputy Sheldon when he points out the difficulties about the farmer deriving his actual <Col N="1396" /> living from the land.  These are the people it is intended here to assist.  I suggest to the Minister that the inclusion of one simple line would remove a lot of the difficulties.  That particular line would be: &ldquo;farmers other than farmers engaged in any other commercial pursuit&rdquo;.  If the Minister would take steps to cover himself in that way in the section, that would be fair and just because it would not be right that a farmer-cum-publican or farmer-cumany other industrial pursuit should have the same right as the man who is getting his living from the land only. These are the people who should benefit under it and not people who are also engaged in industry and commercial enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section is rather unfortunate.  Deputy Murphy attempted to inject class distinction into the discussion of this matter.  That should not be done. Those of us who have an idea of valuations as a result of handling old age pension cases know that valuations in this country are so ununiform and so dependent on the people that made the valuations that there is a terrible anomaly.  The figures in this section were taken quite arbitrarily.  The section says (i) if the rateable valuation does not exceed £12 10s., 100 per cent. of the relevant grant; (ii) if the rateable valuation exceeds £12 10s. but does not exceed £20, 66? per cent. of the relevant grant.  How in fact and reality and in practice can you draw a distinction between those two types of valuation?  They are really in the same group.  That distinction will create enormous hardship on people who will be caught and will be outside these valuations.  If the Minister had taken a whole group of a valuation of, say, £30 and under, I would be prepared to accept it because when you have got to that figure then you are coming on to an economic farm.  Even at present, there are a lot of these people who, because of one circumstance or another, the cost of labour, the cost of producing crops, find themselves in pretty tight financial circumstances. This Bill is an attempt to help people to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a district where, perhaps, the <Col N="1397" /> valuations were made by two different valuers, 60, 70 or 100 years ago.  The land of a man who gets a 100 per cent. grant under this Bill may adjoin that of a man who will get only 66? per cent. and the latter will feel aggrieved, particularly having regard to the cost of building materials.  That is a real problem.  It is a nightmare.</P>
    <P>If we intend to do this job and to make any attempt to solve the problem we should err on the generous side in this matter.  I would appeal to the Minister to recast this section.  I certainly would include an entire group of, say, £25 valuation and give the local authority an opportunity of giving them 100 per cent. grant.  Then there should be very little room for grousing at this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>To take a valuation of £12 10s. is taking a very low valuation when one considers that the building of a house is a really serious problem.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a man might have considered three rooms sufficient accommodation for his needs.  He may have got married and find to-day that the accommodation is too small for the family and that it is necessary to increase it, and his valuation would be increased proportionately.  The minimum of £12 10s. is too low.  I would include a whole group under a higher figure of, say, £20, £25 or £30.  That would include those who would be struggling between being poor, middling poor and not quite so poor. I certainly do not like the minimum figure set out in this Bill.  It will involve hardship.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I would ask him to take the figure of £25, get a whole group into that and give them 100 per cent. That would abolish any of the grievances that might otherwise exist.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the marked differences in valuations. Those who have handled old age pension cases have come across cases of quite small farms having a very high valuation because of the district in which they are and because of the person who made the valuations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> These people are really poor.  Deputy Murphy attempted to inject into this matter the question of their comparable position.  The people who are labourers and tradesmen nowadays are much better off than these men are. Let us be quite frank.  There is no use pulling wool over our eyes and deceiving ourselves.  A lot of farmers under £20 or even £25 valuation are really poor people.  Tradesmen to-day are much better off than these men are. When will such a farmer see £5 or £8 per week coming into him?  Never in his life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy attempts to draw a distinction and to hold these men up to us as persons who do not require and should not receive any consideration. I think they should.  They are the backbone of this country.  They have been, they are and they will continue to be.  Therefore, generous consideration should be given to them.</P>
    <P>I feel that the variation in valuations makes it imperative to include in one group all valuations under, say, £30, £25 or at least £20 and sub-sections (i) and (ii) should be modified to that extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If sub-section (iv) were altered to make the figure of £27 10s. £50 or even £60 and to make the figure of 33? per cent., 40 per cent. or at least a minimum of £100 grant, it would go a long way to meet this case.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Murphy that a person who would then be getting a grant of £350 or £375 will not be doing too badly. For the man with the low valuation there is provision for 100 per cent. of the relevant grant.  In my experience of Cork County Council and I am sure in Deputy Murphy's experience of it, there would be no chance in the world of getting them to agree to a 100 per cent. grant even under sub-section (iv).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to correct one matter referred to by Deputy Murphy.  He seems to be under a misapprehension with regard to the point I made in connection with the effect of the valuation test on land that I know of in my constituency and on land about which I have heard in other areas in the country.  I am speaking on behalf of the poor man whose land is poor and who has not twopence to rattle in his pocket.  His is one of the most impoverished sections of the community.  I am speaking particularly of people living in certain parts of Laois, in the coal belt from Castlecomer across to Athy, and the man who lives in the area of Wolfhill whose holding is incapable of producing even the poorest kind of grass.  Such men own land that is highly valued.  It is so highly valued and so worthless that a man with the valuation of £22 qualified for the full old age pension.  I am merely pointing out to the Minister in these circumstances that if this section is put into operation it is going to regard those landholders as amongst the rich classes.  They are not.  They are the poorest of the poor.  I see here, according to sub-section (3) of Section 9, that a landholder with a valuation of £22 in that area of Laois will qualify only for a 50 per cent. grant from the Laois housing authority. That is an injustice&mdash;a considerable injustice. At present a person of that class who seeks to build a house in Wolfhill area would be regarded as a most deserving applicant, as one who should get assistance from the housing authority, but if this section is put into operation the housing authority cannot help him.  I suggest to the Minister, who is obviously without any means of <Col N="1400" /> testing that, that that is a great injustice and one that should be carefully examined by him.  It is the Minister who has to make a case for it because as things are at the moment this double grant is working out pretty well.  Housing authorities who adopted Section 7 of the other Act, in fact, exercise a very sound discretion in regard to the people who are to get grants.  They do not give a full grant to a person who has a valuation of £50 or £60.</P>

      <P>I think there is room for discussion and even for dissension between Parties on this particular section.  It is a very difficult and complicated matter but we still can work out a system which would be absolutely fair.  I think that Deputy Hughes will agree with me that in the county council of which we are both members we had, first, to prepare a scheme and we had to revise that scheme at least once in the short time that the other Act was in operation. It is not true, as Deputy O'Higgins says, that county councils can discriminate between one applicant and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be quite wrong because in discriminating by giving one particular applicant £150 and another £200 there would be a completely chaotic condition brought about in the affairs of the country. What a county council has to do is to prepare a scheme and administer that scheme as fairly as possible.  Just as we are in difficulty here in preparing a scheme that is absolutely fair, so the county councils are even in greater difficulties.  It would be no harm, therefore, if the central body were to lay down standing rules in regard to the manner in which these grants are to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just a question of simply saying that everyone who is building a house is a person with low means. Very often it is wealthy persons who build houses.  They would not build houses if they were not able to build them.  Deputy Sweetman referred to the fact that the building of a house increases the valuation of a county. In many cases the building of a new house means that the old house has been demolished and that offsets to a certain extent the increase in the valuation.  There is also a difficulty in regard to the question of deciding <Col N="1402" /> whether a person is deriving his living solely or mainly from farming.  It is very hard to know in the case of a cattle dealer how much money he makes out of his ordinary farming operations and how much money he makes as a middleman, carrying on commercial operations between one farmer and another.  We have had in this House men, even Ministers, who claimed to be farmers&mdash;I do not include present company&mdash;and saying that they derive their living mainly from farming.  It is a very difficult question to decide but at the same time we have got to decide it.  I do not think honestly that any Deputy in this House can suggest or has suggested any improvement on this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin referred to the hardship on a person with a valuation of slightly over £12 10s., who would not get the full grant but it must be remembered that such a person will get a grant of 75 per cent. and then there is a graded scale up to a valuation of £35.  I would be in agreement with the suggestion of Deputy McGrath that the upper limit might be raised somewhat but there will always be border line cases.  Even if we were to adopt Deputy McMenamin's suggestion of a £30 limit, we would always have the person with the valuation of £30 5s. who would feel a grievance.  In this question we have got to try to do what is fair and I think this section has been very carefully considered.  I think this is the nearest approach to something fair which we can get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this point of view forward, that in respect of the grant which the Minister himself gives there is no means test; there is only the stipulation that the house have a floor area of 1,400 feet.  That grant can go to prince or pauper, irrespective of his valuation and his annual income.  My opinion is that the assistance and the facilities given both by the State and the local authority are very generous.  Deputy Cogan suggested that in the last Act there was some sort of compulsion on the local authorities to give 100 per cent. grant.  There was no such compulsion, <Col N="1403" /> because in my own county the county council decided that they would not give a penny in addition to the grant given by the Minister.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that point because I have heard divergent views about it in the House.  I merely want to suggest to him that if there is no means test attached to the grant which he gives the whole question should be left to the county councils to decide whether or not they will give the full grant of 30 per cent. or a grant of 20 per cent. or 50 per cent. or whether they will give nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is a very necessary one.  There are a number of local authorities who have not yet adopted any scheme for the augmentation of the grant given by the Government.  In most cases the reason possibly was that they could not arrive at an equitable scheme.  This is a suggestion to them by the Minister.  There is nothing compulsory about it.  A local authority is not compelled to adopt this scheme, but, if it does adopt the scheme, there is a maximum figure to which it can go by way of grant and I suppose that has been worked out in the Minister's Department on as equitable a basis as possible.  For that reason I consider that this is a very useful provision as a guidance to local authorities who are prepared to augment the Government grant by a local grant to people who will be affected.  There is one particular section of the community which I should like to help, namely, the small farmers and I think most of them will be treated fairly if the scheme is adopted.  Anything that we can do here or that the local authorities can do to help to house the small farming community should be done as they are deserving of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be far easier for me and for everybody if I were to retain a section like Section 7 of the 1950 Act and meet the point of view expressed by Deputy Dockrell when, in criticising the limitations suggested here, he said it would be more just <Col N="1404" /> to leave this matter open to everybody. But I have to ask myself when a section of this nature is being framed what we are trying to achieve by it.  Having answered that question, I have to ask myself if the section is likely to achieve that purpose.  In fact I have to ask myself a lot of questions and these have relation to the experience we have had of the operation of Section 7 of the 1950 Act.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested here that the valuation basis is faulty and unjust. It has been said that a man with a small valuation could be engaged in a number of other occupations, that he could be a cattle dealer or a horse dealer, that he could be dealing in eggs and many other things, and still be entitled to describe himself as a farmer with a valuation of under £12 10s. and, therefore, entitled under this scheme to receive the maximum grant if the local council were to adopt this scheme. I am well aware of all these snags. The Department and myself have examined the schemes which have been formulated from time to time by the local authorities who did adopt that Section 7.  We have seen schemes coming up in which a means test applied.  We have seen amendments proposed by local authorities widening the scope of these schemes.  We have seen them changed and switched around from day to day.  All these things demonstrated that local authorities were having great difficulties in operating schemes, at least a limited number out of the total number who adopted schemes under Section 7 of the 1950 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for Deputy Crotty to talk as if there were no difficulties. Of course there were difficulties.  Even in one of the local authorities of which he is a member such difficulties arose. As a matter of fact, it was only on the 3rd March, 1952, 28 days before the Act was about to expire, although Section 7 of the 1950 Act was in operation for nearly two years, that the Kilkenny Corporation adopted the scheme.  Is it suggested, then, if this Section 7 of the Act of 1950 was embraced with the enthusiasm with which Deputy Crotty would have us believe to-day it was embraced that <Col N="1405" /> it would have taken the local body of which he is a member two years to make up its mind as to whether or not it should adopt it.  In matters of this kind I think we should try to be reasonable.  In the course of my contacts with local authorities I have been able to discover that in those counties where the scheme was not adopted&mdash;Clare, Wexford, Sligo, Louth and, I think, Dublin&mdash;they were able to put forward very excellent reasons for not adopting the scheme.  They said that if they started to discuss the formulation of a scheme in which a means test would be stipulated, whether it was a means test designed to meet the position of farmers or of the position of those who worked for wages, some member of the county council would immediately argue, as has been argued by Deputies here to-day, that such a limitation was unjust.  Members of the county council would raise specific cases and it would be pointed out that a farmer with a valuation of £45 was actually much poorer and found it more difficult to live and rear his family than others adjoining him with valuations of £25. These are cases that have arisen all down the years and will continue to arise in the future.</P>
    <P>My idea in saying that it would be an easy matter for me to disregard all these considerations and agree with Deputy Dockrell to provide a section giving local authorities every freedom to adopt any scheme they liked would be that I could then wash my hands of the whole thing and tell the local bodies that if they did not adopt the scheme it would be their own fault. But I do not think that is the proper approach.  I think the proper approach is to recognise the difficulties members of local authorities have.  They are men who give their services voluntarily and they should not be asked to segregate their neighbours in the way in which it would be necessary to segregate them so that the local authority as a body would accept the idea that underlies this section.</P>
    <P>I assume that the adoption of a scheme such as this is desirable.  I believe it would be good for everybody. If we are satisfied that a scheme such <Col N="1406" /> as that proposed here is a good scheme and would serve the country, then with the co-operation of the House I must take on myself the undesirable, if you like, task of formulating for local bodies something that I regard it as fair to ask local bodies to do for themselves.  If one asks local bodies they will probably say that, rather than have to carry out this task, they will wash their hands of it entirely.</P>
    <P>I have a list of counties here in which schemes were adopted.  In every case the local bodies made some effort&mdash;in many cases more than one effort&mdash;to limit the expenditure to which they were committed under Section 7. They stipulated a valuation limit.  In the case of employees, they stipulated an income limit.  Fearing that would not be sufficient, they actually tried to stipulate the amount of money they would borrow for that purpose.  Some said £10,000, some said £15,000, some £20,000 and some £25,000.  It is quite easy to see that these bodies had in mind in adopting a scheme under that section some danger and they took steps, however feeble they proved to be ultimately, to save themselves from the open free-for-all approach that was recommended to-day by Deputy M.E. Dockrell.</P>
    <P>I have to ask myself where will these local authorities get the money to finance a scheme such as that outlined here.  Section 7 of the Act of 1950 crept into that Act on the Committee Stage.  I think it came in as an amendment by some members of the Labour Party.  When a section such as that is inserted in a Bill it is the duty of somebody to follow up the effects of the section.  Certainly I would consider it my duty to do so.  If the Kildare County Council adopt a scheme it is sent to me for sanction. I then receive, following on my approval of the scheme, an application to borrow money in order to implement the scheme.  Before sanctioning the scheme I would consider it my duty to consider what I could do in relation to that second request.  I found that while 14 or 15 schemes were approved under Section 7 of the 1950 Act no provision was made at all as to where local authorities would get the money <Col N="1407" /> to finance these schemes.  It was only when these bodies proceeded to look for the money that they discovered the Local Loans Fund would not be made available to them on this free-for-all basis.  If I were asked to argue in favour of making the Local Loans Fund available for such a purpose I confess I could not make any argument for it.</P>
    <P>In thinking in terms of a scheme in substitution for Section 7, therefore, I naturally not only thought of a scheme likely to be acceptable from the point of view of its conservatism but also of the availability of money to finance the scheme at a certain rate of interest so that local bodies would not have to travel from one insurance company to another or from one bank to another, all the time scraping the pot in order to provide the necessary finances.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to look upon this section as a piece of machinery that can be operated by the Department of Local Government.  It is a piece of machinery designed for the use of local authorities, if they desire to use it. Having regard to the criticisms we have heard levelled against different schemes by local authorities we are substituting what we believe to be their objective under the previous method.  Since all of us, apparently, have decided that it is desirable that a scheme of this nature should be operated by the local bodies, is it not better for us that we should go as far along the road as it is possible for us to go and bring with us those whom it is essential to take if we are to make any progress at all, and that is the local bodies?  The limits may be low. They are £12 10s., £20 to £27 10s. and £35 10s.  Deputy Sweetman has made the case that these valuations would rule out an enormous number of people in his constituency.  I am sure Deputy Sweetman is better aware of it than I am that 50 per cent. of the holdings in County Kildare are under £10 valuation. I take it that the maximum limit prescribed here of £35 10s. will probably cover 70 to 75 per cent. of all the holdings in Kildare and will easily <Col N="1408" /> cover 85 per cent. of all the holdings in the country.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that one could talk about the niceties of valuation until the cows come home.  But a valuation limit has been accepted in Housing Acts in this country over the past 20 years.  There is such a limit in regard to reconstruction.  There was a valuation limit in the 1932 Housing Act and in Housing Acts ever since. Under a recent piece of legislation dealing with a means test in regard to old age pensions, and in relation to a number of other matters, there are valuation limits.  Deputies are talking to the converted when they try to prove to me how unjust a valuation limit can be in certain circumstances. I know all that as well as any other Deputy&mdash;perhaps even better than quite a few.  The fact, however, is that talking about the niceties of valuation is not going to get us anywhere.  Let us keep in the back of our minds this fact: that the machinery here is devised to be used by local authorities that are free.  It may be that they will have their prejudices and, if you like, may be conservative.  That, I suggest, is not an undesirable characteristic&mdash; a certain amount of it.  I would ask Deputies to realise that.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McMenamin who suggested that this scheme was lightly thought of.  That is not so. When I was appointed Minister for Local Government the first question I asked the secretary to my Department when I opened the door of my room was: &ldquo;What provision has been made for financing the scheme that has been adopted under Section 7 of the 1950 Act?&rdquo; That section was inserted when I was a member of the Opposition.  I was aware, of course, of the discussions that had taken place on it here and of discussions at meetings of the county council in my own county and in other counties.  I saw that the thing was altogether too loose, and that it was not fair to ask county councillors to do what I have already suggested, namely, to set themselves against their neighbour and segregate them, as it were, into categories, having regard to the valuations of their holdings.  I felt that, if there was any unpopularity <Col N="1409" /> to be incurred, it is the Minister who is responsible for introducing legislation like this who should try and find out just what the limitations were which local bodies would like to impose and should set them out as I have set them out here.  It should be his responsibility to say that is the maximum: that if they wanted to adopt a scheme, that was the maximum, but that they could make it less themselves. That is the mental approach of the person who is responsible for this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy and Deputy McGrath suggested that I should make it £60. Of course, one could make it £60, £70 or even £100.  It would be the simplest thing in the world for me to accede to any request of that nature, but that would be no answer to the question which I have posed: is it desirable that we should have a scheme of this nature generally applied?  If it is, and if we think it is likely to be taken up by local bodies and if it is fairly conservative, is that not better than that we should say to the local bodies that we throw every door open to them to do what they like, and then find in a couple of years' time that only half of them or perhaps none of them had adopted a scheme.  That might be the approach of some people to this problem, but it is not mine.  I have discussed this with members of councils, and following my discussions I have no doubt at all that what I am proposing here, even with all the defects that there are undoubtedly in it, will be found to represent the majority view of members of local authorities in all parts of the country. With regard to the point that was raised by Deputy Corish, we could, of course, decide here to give any grant that we thought fit and proper, but we are not taking upon ourselves the responsibility of saying to local bodies: &ldquo;You must do likewise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe that Section 9 is an excellent section.  If I were a member of a council I might, perhaps, feel inclined to be conservative.  I think it might not be a bad investment, even from the point of view of a council, to borrow money for the purpose of enabling people who are covered by <Col N="1410" /> the section to build houses for themselves. Taking the long distance view, the council perhaps might not stand to lose anything by that.  There are people who would contend that the council would benefit over, say, a period of 50 years.  I must confess that I have not gone into that with anyone very seriously as to whether a council would or would not benefit.  My inclination would be to think that a council would not benefit, but even if it did not benefit, I think that a scheme adopted by local bodies for the people who are covered here would be advantageous.  I invite them to see the defects in this proposal as I see them, to have some regard to the realities of the situation and to see that it is better for us to go along in this conservative way and see how we do. After two years if somebody finds that we can go further it will be possible to improve upon this.  It is much better, I would say, to start in this conservative way and advance from it than to throw the gates open and then find that you have to retreat from the whole position.  I am recommending that course to the House and I believe it is a course that will be understood and accepted by the local bodies for whom we are trying to devise this scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Minister referred to Kildare when he was speaking, might I ask him if he discussed with any of the members of the Kildare County Council the day he was opening the new housing scheme in Kildare the operation of the scheme under Section 7?  I will be interested to know the reactions he received on that occasion.  As a matter of fact, as Deputy Harris will remember, when the original Kildare scheme came into the Council of Kildare, and was proposed by me, it was a member of the Minister's Party who proposed that the limits of the valuation and the income limits we had on the scheme we were putting before the council should be extended, so that at least the Minister must, talking from the Kildare angle, exculpate me from merely trying to be political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the Deputy himself.  It was a Fianna Fáil councillor.  On another occasion when the increase was proposed it was, in fact, the director of elections of Fianna Fáil who eventually sealed the bargain between that council and myself. He made me agree to a recommendation and he came down on his side a little bit in the limits proposed. I mention that so as to show that I do not want to discuss this matter in any political spirit.</P>
      <P>The real difficulty in regard to the building of houses for people of any valuation is the initial money required. It is the amount of the initial fund that a lot of people do not like either borrowing from the Small Dwellings Act or otherwise.  They had a certain amount of money put aside and this second grant enabled them to go ahead with the building.  If the Minister said that that was imposing a burden that was heavier than the local authorities could bear, I think there would have been a case for him to come to the House then and to say that the grants would be given but that the people could not get supplementary grants and get remissions.</P>
      <P>I think that if a person were forced to choose between a remission, on the one hand, and a supplementary grant on the other hand, he would choose the supplementary grant because it is that that would enable him to start off.  As I understand the case that the Minister has made for this section it is that, unless he puts the restrictive limits in the section that he has put, he will not be able to bring the reluctant county councils along with him.  I do not think I am being unfair in paraphrasing the Minister's views in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister's point of view in bringing in this section is that he feels that these are the only limits upon which he could <Col N="1412" /> ask the housing authorities to come along with him.  That may be his problem and I am not prepared to argue from the point of view of any housing authority other than the one I know.  In so doing he is excluding those who may wish to travel a little further.  I do not accept the viewpoint that there should not be responsibility placed on local authorities of taking a decision as regards means or income limits and so forth.  The Minister's line is that he does not want local authorities to have to decide this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not want it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think those of us who are in local authorities should face up to our responsibilities, accept the responsibility that is there and take the decisions.  In the case of Kildare we faced up to our responsibilities and took the decisions.  As I understand the Minister's viewpoint now it is because some local authorities will not face up to that responsibility that those who are prepared to come voluntarily are to be prohibited.  That does not appear to me to be the right line.  If this was a mandatory section I could quite understand the Minister saying that for this section to be any good, and to operate generally throughout the country, &ldquo;I must make it mandatory and I am not prepared to make it mandatory on all housing authorities to go beyond a certain point&rdquo;; then I would see very easily the strength of his argument but I do not think that argument arises when the section is still only a permissive section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any reason why the local authorities should not be allowed, if we are going to keep them at all and not abolish them, to judge in this respect what is the best for each area.  I certainly think that Deputy Allen and Deputy Corish would know much more what would be for the benefit of the Wexford housing authority than I would know.  As I said on a previous occasion I would not for one second dare to intervene between Deputy Murphy, Deputy Desmond, and Deputy McGrath as to what would be a sound scheme for <Col N="1413" /> Cork.  I have too much respect for my skin.  Similarly, the section is not being made mandatory.  If the Minister were trying to make it mandatory on everyone I could quite understand him saying that you have to strike an even line and that he is prepared to force people to go a certain distance.  He is not doing that.  He is saying that it is permissive for people to go.  In these circumstances there is an unanswerable case to allow local authorities to judge what suits their own area best.  The case that the Minister has made is not at all a case for the section but a case for the section as it would be if the first line read: &ldquo;A housing authority shall make...&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely against this section.  I agree with a lot of what the Minister said but there is one thing on which I do not agree with him, that is, as to whether or not the members of local authorities were prepared to face up to their responsibilities in devising schemes, in this case, a scheme such as is outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear and recognised &mdash;by the Minister more than by most people in this House&mdash;that the valuation system is all screwy.  The Minister knows that.  Every Deputy knows it. Deputy Sweetman and other Deputies have said that a £20 valuation in Wexford would not be at all what a £20 valuation would be in Cork or even in Wicklow.  Certainly it would not be the same as in Donegal, Galway or Mayo.  For that reason I would suggest to the Minister that on Report Stage he would bring in an amendment which would enable local authorities to formulate their own schemes, those schemes to be subject to the approval of the Minister.  Then if the Minister wants to take responsibility, if he wants to be helpful, as I am sure he does, to the local authorities, he can decide whether or not in his opinion the scheme proposed by each council is an equitable scheme for the county.  I suggest that because, as everybody agrees, the valuation system is so screwy, so lopsided, so unfair in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that course would be <Col N="1414" /> unusual.  In respect of the same things different councils have different schemes.  The Minister has to consider on their merits particular purchase schemes sent up by local authorities. He had to consider many circumstances with regard to grants from the Transitional Development Fund to local authorities for housing in order to enable him to determine what was the proper grant.  There were many things to be considered there.  The grant given in respect of a £1,000 house in Wexford need not necessarily be the same amount that would be given in respect of a house in Donegal, Kildare or any other county.  The grants varied from place to place because there were different sets of circumstances which the Minister had to take into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I would suggest that the Minister would consider including in this Bill a section which would enable local authorities to formulate their own scheme, such scheme to be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has put this section into the Bill because Kerry County Council was, I think, the first council to adopt a scheme under Section 7 of the 1950 Act and we have been operating it for two years.  First of all, we had a restricted scheme.  Then we had a free-for-all. We then found that we could not borrow the money and we restricted it again.  We found ourselves in great difficulties.  Kerry County Council is grateful for this scheme.  There may be other county councils who are grateful that the Minister is giving us a headline that we can follow and not have this free-for-all that we found we could not operate at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows quite well the grave hardship that will take place under this section.  A person whose <Col N="1415" /> valuation is £12 10s. will get 100 per cent. grant.  His neighbour whose valuation is £13 will get a grant reduced by 33? per cent.  How can we justify that?  How can anybody justify it?  You could not do that at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be far better to go to a figure that would include a whole group of people? Under Section 11 a person, not in the lower income class, can get a grant equal to 50 per cent. of the relevant grant if he is a person entitled to be housed by a local authority.  I have known a person with an income of £1,000 a year to be living in a council house.  Are such people to be compared with people whose valuations are £13 and £14, whom the Minister knows of, who have not a penny?  I am sure there are hundreds of them in his own constituency.  How can he defend that? Is it just?</P>
      <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to recast this section and to adopt the line suggested by Deputy Corish and Deputy Sweetman.  My own suggestion would be to include a group whose valuations are up to £25 or, on the other hand, to leave it to the discretion of the local authority as to how they would treat it.  As the section stands, it is gravely and seriously objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that several counties did not adopt the scheme.  I do not know if it is a matter for discussion as to why we did or did not.  One of the reasons why Wexford County Council did not adopt the scheme was that they knew that if they provided these grants outside the boundary of urban towns immediately new towns would grow up and the people who earn their livelihood in those towns would provide themselves with cheap houses, cheaper houses than the local authority could provide, just on the borderline or in a ring around the town.  We saw it happening in the middle '30's when loans under the Local Loans Fund became available for the first time. <Col N="1416" /> People got loans from the county council, who were the only authority in the county that adopted the Small Dwellings Act, and built houses on the border of existing towns.  These people were earning their livelihood in the towns.  They were well-off people. They were paying no rates in the town in which they were getting their livelihood. They were creating problems for the local county authority in respect of sanitation and water.</P>
      <P>There are many good reasons why some local authorities did not adopt the scheme at all.  Wexford, taking the urban and the local authority, have housed about two-thirds of the population of that county and are paying out of the rates substantial sums each year to subsidise those houses.  They felt that if they were to take on the burden of housing the remaining one-third or contributing to that object the burden would be greater than they could bear.  That was a second reason. One very strong reason was that the county council knew that the urban authorities were not likely to adopt this scheme.  They could if they wished.  Many of them have not sites on the boundary and they felt their finances would not stand it.  The county council was going to be burdened right away with a ring around the urban towns which absorbed the people living in these towns, people who earned their livelihood there but who wanted to get away from bearing their just portion of the charges in these towns.  The Wexford County Council thought that that was a bad development and that anything that could be done to prevent it should be done.</P>
      <P>I suppose we can discuss Sections 9, 10 and 11 together because they are all interrelated.  I notice that the term &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; is not defined.  I should like the Minister to define what a farmer is.  A farmer should be defined as a person who derives his living solely from farming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Persons with experience as members of local authorities for a <Col N="1417" /> number of years will know that in the matter of scholarships, they often had a headache in defining different classes.  We well remember that before the coming into operation of the County Management Act, local authorities had to differentiate between different classes of persons resident in the county who qualified for scholarships. It often gave us headaches and one felt that it was not a matter that one liked to have anything to do with at all.  If a local authority wants to adopt the Act, and they are not prepared to have a free-for-all scheme, the Minister's proposals are a step in the right direction.  Unless the local authority is satisfied to adopt a free-for-all scheme and give grants without exception to everybody, what is laid down here will be a help to local authorities because if local authorities have to differentiate as between Citizen A and Citizen B&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I take it that the Minister thinks that this question of defining what is a farmer would be a reserve function.  I hope the Minister will answer that.  The question of whether the council will adopt Section 7 is a reserve function.  If the councils had a say in that it would be adopted all over the place.  Taking the section by and large it will help local authorities and it will clear the air.  I have read discussions of the way in which local authorities put this scheme into operation and I can see the other point of view and the argument put up by <Col N="1419" /> Deputy Sweetman that every ratepayer in the county, wherever he may be, will help to pay these grants and he should be entitled to get a grant if he wants one.  I can see the force of that argument.  On the other side it can be argued that the smallest ratepayer in the county is contributing his proportion to grants for houses for wealthy persons.  The labouring man in County Wexford and County Kildare may object very strongly towards contributing to grants for the erection of houses for large farmers. With justification certain businessmen can claim that they are large ratepayers and that they are contributing towards the erection of houses for everybody else and that, therefore, these other people should help them. It is very hard to have a perfect scheme.  Personally I thought at the time that this section was inserted in the 1950 Act that there was no necessity for it because the local authorities and ratepayers all over Ireland were doing a great job in housing. They will have housed, before they are finished, three-fourths of the population of this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister made one welcome statement.  We now know that we shall have money to finance these grants and that no longer we shall have to go to banks, to pawnbrokers or to insurance companies.  We know where to get the money.  The Minister must realise, however, that farmers for years past have been paying 2/- in the £ towards subsidising housing in the country.  By this Bill they are being given an opportunity of getting a grant for themselves.  Up to this every Housing Act brought in improved the conditions under which people got grants.  There is no doubt that every Housing Act brought in was an improvement and this is the first Housing Bill which did not improve the conditions which bitherto existed. In fact it worsens existing conditions. I think that is a retrograde step.  In 1952 we should be going forward and not backwards.  The valuations which the Minister mentions may be all right in County Cavan, where there are many farmers with low valuations, but <Col N="1420" /> I know, speaking for my own county, that there are farmers with valuations up to £40 and £50 who have already built and have got grants for building houses.  Hundreds of other farmers, whose valuations are only £25 each, will be entitled now to a grant of only 50 per cent.  That is very hard on them.  I think if the Minister is not prepared to give the responsibility of grading them to the local authorities, he should accept that responsibility himself.  The Minister said that the local authority will not grade applicants as between one neighbour and another neighbour.  They are not really going between neighbours; they are going between two sections of different valuations.  It is not a matter of deciding between neighbours.  If a man is prepared to go on a local authority, he should not be afraid to face up to that responsibility.  The Minister threw out the challenge to me, if the local authority were so enamoured about the Act, why did the Kilkenny Corporation not adopt it until a month or so ago?  There is a reason for that.  The Kilkenny Corporation are a very small rateable authority.  Our total valuation is very low.  For a long time we felt that giving any grant would be a hardship.  In fact, there was a grant suggested and we found that it would increase the rates by 5d., 6d., or 7d. in the £.  That is why we held our hands for so long.</P>

For a long time we considered whether we should give these grants or not as 1d. in the £ on the rates only realises about £100. That was the main reason.  This Bill will be no help to us to give a bigger grant as the Minister is not contributing any more.  The only way it will help is because the Minister tells us that we can get the money from the Local Loans Fund.</P>

      <P>I want to raise one point with the Minister with regard to the highest valuation here, the £35 valuation as against the maximum income of £416 mentioned in the next section. As Deputy Crotty pointed out, the maximum valuation would be a rather low valuation in Leinster.  Many farmers with a £50 or £60 valuation are hard set to carry on.  There are very few farmers with a £35 valuation who will have a net income of £416. There is an anomaly there.</P>

      <P>I agree with the point of view expressed by Deputy Allen in regard to the two comparisons and for that reason I was rather surprised to see some amendments put in to the limits in Section 10 but none to the limits in Section 9.  If one was increasing the limits in Section 10 it seemed to me that there was a much stronger case to increase the limits in Section 9 with regard to the farmer. Deputy McGrath put it into Section 10 but left it out in regard to Section 9.</P>
      <P>I want it to be quite clear, so far as I was concerned, that my first line with the Minister was to get him to withdraw the section, but my second line, if he will not withdraw the section, will be to amend the limits on Report, and on that we can discuss the relative figures between Sections 9 and 10.  I want to answer the speech made by Deputy Allen.  Surely the whole justification or basis upon which this grant is made is the fact that it will increase the valuation of the area in which the house is put up.</P>

      <P>Then the Deputy and I must part company.  The reason for the grant is to help the person to get himself a home.

      <P>You get from the Local Loans Fund at present the necessary loan at such a figure that it approximately works out at 3¾ per cent. for interest and redemption.  I am prepared to take the figures given by Deputy Cogan.  The house which gets a grant of from £225 to £275, with the exception of the first seven years during which the rates are remitted, will show a profit to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the position in the individual county.  If one takes the view that the house will be built in any case, then I think you go very much towards the line that the local authority should be left the discretion in each county.  Deputy Cogan when talking about increasing the valuation suggested that the old house would be knocked down.  I suggest that that is not a true picture, that we are not dealing with urban houses but farmers' houses in Section 9.  The much more general picture is that the dwelling-house is kept in some type of repair and used as an out-office. That would be a far truer picture than the picture suggested by Deputy Cogan.</P>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's comment that he means that the wording of Section 12 is such as to make it mandatory on the Department to make the money available from the Local Loans Fund.  I do not think it is mandatory. Even though the powers of borrowing are given, I think it is optional and discretionary.</P>

      <P>That is what I want to be clear about.  I think the Minister said it was in the Bill.  I do not think it is in the Bill, but that it is within the ministerial powers to direct it by regulation.  If we know that, however, it is something and we can deal with a variation in the limits on the Report Stage.  As a matter of fact, I had originally drafted an amendment for the Committee Stage to double all the limits in the Minister's section.  I came to the conclusion that it would be better to have the discussion on the Committee Stage on the section as it was without any limit and to deal with the question of increasing the limits purely on the Report Stage, because I must confess I had very little hope of being able to persuade the Minister to withdraw the section altogether.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (i), line 9, to delete &ldquo;£208&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£600&rdquo; and to delete all words after &ldquo;grant&rdquo; in line 10 to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we agree that it is beneficial to give a grant to a person desirous of building his own house, we are faced with the problem of discovering first of all what particular type of person will be in a position to do so.  Under the section as it stands a sum of £208 is taken as the income for the year in order to qualify a man for a 100 per cent. grant from the local authority. Spread over the 12 months that represents a relatively low wage, taking into consideration the present wage levels in the rural areas and in the <Col N="1424" /> towns.  It may be that in a particular area adjoining Cork City there may be a family with the father as the principal wage earner but with three or four members of the family also bringing in wages.</P>
    <P>Under the section as it stands such a family will be debarred from taking advantage of the proposal to make a grant available from the local authority.  Surely it cannot be suggested that an agricultural labourer or a road worker will avail of this grant. We must face the problem, therefore, of deciding what the ceiling should be. When these people reside in houses that are condemned by the local authority medical officer there is an obligation on that authority to rehouse them.  We know that the rents charged in such cases are not economic rents. They have to be subsidised through the medium of the rates.  There is, therefore, a financial problem facing those who are called upon to pay rates.</P>
    <P>If we make the ceiling £208 as is suggested here no one will be able to take advantage of the grant.  The only thing then is to amend the section and make the ceiling £600, deleting the following sub-sections.  If we can succeed in inducing the people with an income of £600 per annum to build their own houses we will ease the burden on the local authorities; £600 per annum amounts roughly to £11 10s. 9d. per week.  Some people may regard that as a high wage if they look at it merely from the narrow parochial point of view.  It must be remembered that that wage is not earned by just one member of the family but represents the combined wages of the father and three or four children.</P>
    <P>If the income coming into the home is roughly £8 0s. 5d. per week advantage cannot be taken of this grant. That wage represents £416 per annum. I think it would be a more satisfactory system if we raised the ceiling to £600 and leave it to the local authority to decide whether or not a grant should be given so long as the total earnings of the family remain under that figure.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the difficulty, then, that though we may make provision here, certain local authorities <Col N="1425" /> may not agree to accept what is provided. We cannot help that.  We cannot compel them to accept it.  There are local authorities who will be prepared to accept it.  The Minister said on the previous section that there was something to be said for conservatism. I believe there is very little to be said for it.  Possibly local authorities have to be conservative in relation to some matters.  When we come to providing homes for our people it is unfortunate that conservatism should be allowed to enter into the matter.  Every house that local authorities build represents added income to the local authorities by way of rates and the saving on the amount to be provided annually in the estimates to make up the uneconomic rents.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  By means of it local authorities would be in a position to offer people certain advantages in building their own homes and if the people take advantage of that offer local authorities will be relieved of some of the burden placed upon them in relation to the provision of houses.</P>

      <P>This Estimate, moved by the Minister, is one that gives everybody in this House considerable difficulty.  I regret that the Minister, in moving it, did not elaborate a little bit more on the administration of the Act itself, that he did not break down, as they are broken down in the Estimate, the amounts paid by the State under the various heads.  In this Vote you have the pensions for the Regular Army personnel; you have the pensions for the widows and orphans of previous members of the Defence Forces; you have special allowances; you have military service pensions under the 1924 Act and under the 1934 Act. While it is clear from the Book of Estimates how the gross sum is made up, I think that, at the same time, the Minister should have given, in his opening statement, the various sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing myself to the administration of this Vote it is not easy to keep strictly to the rules of order but I will do the best I can and avoid the question of policy.  The Vote was not referred back.  Therefore I am confined to rather narrow limits.  First, let me say that I am not satisfied with the present system of awarding military service certificates.  The Act of 1949 reopened a number of cases that had already been decided, and the Referee who had operated the Act until its close prior to 1949 is now the Referee operating again.  I want it to be clearly understood that I have the highest regard and opinion of the Referee and that whatever I say is not to be taken as in any way reflecting upon him.  But he is rehearing appeals from judgments that he himself has already given.  He decided certain cases and he is now hearing appeals from his own decisions.  That, in my <Col N="1427" /> opinion, is contrary to natural justice. I do not care how good he is or how impartial he may try to be, the fact that he is rehearing cases that he has already decided does, in my opinion, prejudice the claimants' chances and opportunities.</P>
    <P>Therefore I suggest that in the administration of the Act a new Referee be appointed.  The Government can take a judge off the bench to act as Referee and appoint a temporary judge while these cases are going on.  In that way you would have a person of judicial standing in whom everybody would have confidence operating the Act.  There would be a sense of fair play.  At the moment, no matter how correctly the Referee may reject an application, if he rejected the same case before there is the feeling that the applicant did not get a fair do.  I do not want to stress that any further except to say that I think the Government itself, the Minister, the applicants and everybody concerned, would be well served by having a change of Referee.</P>
    <P>Time is passing on.  It is now over 35 years since some of the episodes occurred which qualify persons for military service pensions.  I am informed to-day that questions are being put to applicants which are very difficult to answer.  For instance, I have been informed that an applicant has been asked when he said that such a thing happened, what sort of a day it was, was it a wet day or a dry day. I think that is straining the thing a bit too far.  Again, I do not want to refer to or to belittle in any way what anybody did, but if you take Easter Week itself and asked an applicant what he did on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of that week it would be very difficult for him to answer.  I venture to say, without disrespect, that if you were to ask the Taoiseach to-day who was in charge of Boland's Mills, what he did on Sunday, what he did exactly on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday he would find it extremely difficult to say, especially if he was on <Col N="1428" /> his oath.  It would be almost impossible to answer that, while, of course, everybody knows he was there for the week.  That, in itself, is supposed to be ample, but it is not.  When you apply that principle to another person, to myself for instance, as to what I did on the 1st November, 1920, what I did on the 28th January, 1919, what sort of a day it was, while my memory is fairly good, just as good as anybody else's, I certainly do not know that. It is unreasonable to ask that.  When the inter-Party Government re-established this board they decided to appoint a person as Referee who had a very wide and varied experience of all that period.  They appointed the late Judge Art O'Connor as Referee.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody will agree that he was a person eminently suited to discharge the obligations put upon him.  The Parliament here having failed to define &ldquo;active service&rdquo; or what would constitute active service, when he proceeded to discharge these duties he drew up a set of rules which in his opinion was a definition of active service.  Unfortunately, before he was able to operate them, he passed away from us.  I am aware that his successor adopted these rules as to what would constitute active service.  In a survey at the time they came to the conclusion, having looked over a number of the appeals and of the original forms, that so many thousand people would qualify, that there was a certain number on the border line and that there was a certain number that clearly did not come within its scope.  It is obvious from the Minister's statement that the Referee and the board have examined a certain number of the files, that 16,540 people applied and that the advisory committee have examined and graded 11,707 cases to date and have selected for hearing by the Referee 7,267.  Therefore, out of the 16,000 they have dealt with 11,000 cases, and <i>prima facie</i>, these people are entitled to a service certificate.  Of this number there is no doubt whatever that there is a very large proportion on which the present Referee adjudicated and he will review his own decision.  The Minister says that the Referee has actually heard 1,700 claims.  I take it <Col N="1429" /> that that number of claims includes not only the number that this Referee has heard but those of his predecessor also.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking it as such.  That is why I think the Minister should have been a little more specific so that we would understand what exactly was happening in this case. This is 1952 and the Act was passed in 1949.  Only 1,700 cases have been dealt with in slightly over two and a half years.  There are 11,000 graded.  When will the remainder be dealt with? When will those which have not been graded be heard?  As I say, time is passing on.  The youngest of us is no longer young.  It is clear from the Minister's statement that out of 1,700 claims that have been heard, 713 people qualified.  Is it not a very grave hardship, assuming that no one else qualifies, that 713 people who are entitled to a certificate of service have been deprived of it since 1934, or, if you like, since the 1924 Act was passed. I am trying to approach this not in any partisan or political way; I am trying to get justice done for my comrades and I do not care which side of the House they are on, and since the Acts of 1924 or 1934 were passed I have tried to live up to that principle.</P>
      <P>Therefore I am appealing for speedier decisions.  I am asking the Minister to get somebody who can read through the files quickly and if there is sufficient evidence to justify the award to make the award and let the applicant then know that an award has been made to him.  If he regards that as insufficient let him appeal and let his case come up for hearing so that the matter will be dealt with speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into matters relating to the administration of the Act.  The idea of travelling around the various centers is a wise one and I want to commend the Government for the continuation of that system which I believe is right.  There is, of course, the difficulty of obtaining witnesses. If a claimant says that So-and-so is in a position to certify service for him and if that person does not come up <Col N="1430" /> voluntarily with the claimant the Referee should issue a summons to him and compel his attendance at the hearing. Of course, there is an argument against that, that the State would have to pay that witness's expenses, but if it was found that the witness had material evidence in support of the applicant, then I would fine the witness for his failure to attend in the first instance.  If the case should arise that the witness had no evidence he could be let off with a caution.</P>
    <P>On the question of the amounts, I do not want to go to the trouble of repeating at length my arguments here before.  When a person is found to qualify there should be a minimum standing pension and that that is what he must get.  Let me give this example. A Black and Tan who joined the R.I.C. on the 9th July, 1921, two days before the truce and is demobilised in December, 1921, has a standard pension of £52 per annum.  Now with the increased pensions in Britain he has about £90.  He is getting a pension for a trip to Ireland.  Of course, I admit that when he was coming he did not know but that it might be a prolonged stay in the country.</P>

      <P>He might be set in Martin Corry's garden or in somebody's backyard.  We will leave that be; there is a possibility that he would not enjoy his pension.  That is what was done for these men.  The Black and Tans who had longer service from their initiation here have pensions as high as £350 a year and the officers of them substantially more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at the moment the total amount involved in military service pensions is the miserable figure of slightly over £400,000.  Under the 1924 Act the total payment for 1952-53 is £145,932 and, under the 1934 Act, £263,930, a gross total of £409,000.  To hear people talking one would think that there was a vast sum paid to the Old I.R.A. and to the people who served the country in its hour of need.  When the Minister added them all together and put them into this figure he was hardly <Col N="1431" /> fair to the members who are in receipt of military service pensions.  £409,000 is the gross total.  Yet, about 300 Black and Tans&mdash;whom we beat and knocked spots off&mdash;for very short service, have a pension for that service alone of over £1,500,000.  You may argue that the British Government are wealthy and that they could pay.  If that is the case, let that argument be made.</P>
    <P>There is the most extraordinary situation that you can have, a person who is in receipt of that Black and Tan pension employed in a Government Department and in the same office there may be a person who is in receipt of a military service pension under the 1924 Act or under the 1934 Act.  One person receives his pension in full from the British Government and the person who is in receipt of a pension under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act, who served his country and is continuing to serve his country, suffers an abatement of his military service pension. Is there any sense of fair play or equity in that?  None whatever.</P>
    <P>Of course we can have the argument, &ldquo;why did you not do something about it during your three and a half years of office?&rdquo; I can see Deputy McGrath just simply hopping.  Why did we not? The fact that I did not does not make it right to continue.  It was wrong before.  It was wrong during our term of office and it is wrong afterwards. It is wrong all the time.  The longer it is left wrong the worse it becomes.</P>
    <P>I do not argue the case on any merit but that it is inequitable and that that provision was inserted at a time when there was very severe financial restriction. I do not want to defend it. There were people in this House at that time who thought that no one of us, no matter how well he served in those days, was entitled to anything. I regret to say that people on the benches opposite, in the Government Benches now, played a very big part in that campaign.  I know they regret it now.  I shall not quote their speeches against military service pensions, nor shall I quote what they said about abolishing them when they would get into office, but there was a situation <Col N="1432" /> created in this country that every person who was in receipt of a military service pension under the 1924 Act was nearly a highwayman, that he was getting something that he was not entitled to and that it was a shame and a disgrace.  Remember, that operates under the 1934 Act.  There are people who are jealous and who hate to see anyone of that period getting any recognition.</P>
    <P>I urge that the first thing that should be done in relation to military service pensions is that a standard minimum pension be struck; that if you establish service, if you establish that you took part in the defence of the country, the Government and the people at that time, there is a minimum rate.  When the cost of living goes up, you can then face the problem of giving increases, and so on, that may arise.</P>
    <P>I have received deputations, both as a Deputy and as a Minister, from the Old I.R.A.  They made representation for an increase in their pensions owing to the cost of living.  It is true that they are entitled to it.  Of what use is it to talk about the cost of living in respect of a pension of £7 10s. a year? Where is the use in saying that you will increase that by 100 per cent. because, at best, what would that mean? &mdash;£15.  I would suggest that this minimum rate be struck.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister can argue that there is the special allowance arrangement that when a person becomes unable to support himself or his family there is provision for that, that there is a minimum, that there is a special allowance arrangement by which that person can get fair treatment; that we will give him a decent standard&mdash; not as much as we would like to give him&mdash;but a standard of living that will keep him from the poorhouse or from being a mendicant or a burden on his people.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the special allowance arrangement, I want to deal with the abatement.  I appeal, as I appealed as a Deputy and as a Minister, to have that clause eliminated.  The total amount involved this year and last year is the miserable figure, to the Government, of £39,000.  I admit that as certificates are granted, if they are <Col N="1433" /> granted to people who are in the State service, that might increase but, having regard to the number of applicants who succeed and the number that die each year in the State service, the figure will not increase very much. Everybody knows that in ten or 15 years' time that portion of this Vote will be very tiny.  It is very difficult to say what the figure will be.  If such people continue to die at the same rate as they died last year, it appears to me that the number will be very small.</P>
    <P>There were 700 pensions, roughly, granted last year or since the Act was passed.  Strange as it may seem, it does not increase the Vote by one shilling.  That means that since 1949, 700 men who had pensions have died and that the 700 new pensioners that came in barely filled the vacancy. That being so, the abatements would fall in the same way.  I do not want, as I say, to score any debating points. That figure relating to the abatements is very little to the Government but it is a very grave matter for the people who should receive the money.  I would say to the Government: &ldquo;Do the generous thing right away and abolish that completely.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>On the question of special allowances, I know that the means test is a very difficult matter.  I know that fraud is likely to arise but the number of fraudulent cases are so few that it is hardly wise to punish offenders so severely.  Where an applicant has a wife, even though the wife has money, she does not give it to him and he is still poor.  Where the applicant is a person in receipt of national health insurance and living in a labourer's cottage or some such abode, I am sometimes astounded to learn what transpires when an investigation officer <Col N="1434" /> makes his report.  Of course, I have to absolve the Department of Defence and the Minister from this charge but again there must be some way of getting over it.  The investigation officer represents the Department of Finance and I find that in a certain case in which he reports to the Minister that the person is in receipt of national health insurance he makes this astounding assessment: &ldquo;Earnings from his son under 18 years of age, over £232.&rdquo;  The son who is described as a stone-mason is only serving his time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>He is only serving his time, and there is no money whatever coming from that source.  The Act lays it down, unfortunately, that where a decision is given, even upon what is clearly a wrong assessment, the case cannot be reopened for 12 months.  I know that the Department of Defence has a very able staff of officials, but why one of them would let a thing like that pass without querying it&mdash;the statement that a young fellow under 18 was earning this sum of money&mdash;passes my comprehension. I submit that the regulation relating to that 12-months' period should be re-examined, and that every effort should be made, where there is evidence available to show that a miscarriage of justice has taken place, to have a reassessment, no matter when the original assessment was made. Mind you, if it is a case where an applicant has succeeded and it is found that he has made a false statement, that is investigated very quickly and he is taken off.  I say that where hardship has been imposed, it should be relieved at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to he next group which I think are the most harshly treated of all.  I refer to the widows and orphans of officers, N.C.O.s and men of the Old I.R.A. who are living on very meagre pensions&mdash;some of them on no pensions at all.  Under certain sections of the Act when an officer or Volunteer having either a military service pension or a disability pension dies, both die with <Col N="1435" /> him.  There is no provision whatever made for the widow or the family of such a man and the result is that the old comrades and their friends&mdash;I am glad to say there are a good many of them&mdash;have to pass round the hat or, in other words, to make a collection to relieve that hardship.  I regret to say that it is true that a great number of us have not made provisions for our dependents.  That is due to many causes; I am not going into them. Everybody knows that we have been generous with what we had at all times, and if one of us had a shilling in his pocket I suppose it would burn a hole in it if he kept it.  There is no provision made for these widows and orphans.  Too often it has come about that a collection has to be made, even in some cases to pay the funeral expenses.  The number, as I say, is getting fewer.  There are now only remain the widows because the mothers have practically all passed on.  Where there was a mother dependent, it was only right that she should get the allowance.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a regulation should be made governing the payment of pensions to the widows of these people, particularly the widows of those who had disability pensions and, if possible, covering the widows of those who had either a disability or military service pension.  That is necessary in order to preserve the widow from hardship and to give her something better than is provided for her under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts which, of course, are good, but in my opinion, some little better provision should be made for these particular widows.</P>
    <P>Then I come to the question of the date from which this Bill will be operative.  I have always held the view that if a person is entitled to a military pension now he was entitled to it from the beginning.  When Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was Minister for Defence, the present Minister was very strong on the point that the pension should be paid from the passing of the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act, whichever the person qualified under.  He was more insistent, however, on the 1934 Act.  As reported in column 636, <Col N="1436" /> Volume 118, of the Official Reports, the present Minister for Defence advocated that the Bill should be made retrospective to the 1st October, 1934.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no vote on it.  I will admit that his argument was countered by his predecessor simply saying: &ldquo;We are an improvement upon you.  You gave them nothing.  We are giving them something now anyway.&rdquo;  I do not think that either of the two approaches was the right one.  The thing was to see who was entitled to it, and then let us have a non-Party vote by which justice would be done to those on either side of the civil war and those who did not take part in it.  I appeal to the Minister, therefore, because he is fortified by the fact that he advocated when that Bill was going through that it should be made retrospective.  I ask him to utilise that, and to see to it that what he supported in the House the Government of which he is now a member will support him in carrying out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My appeal to the Minister is approximately that which was made to him by the Old I.R.A. Association.  He has got a copy of the representations made to him and he has received deputations from that body, and I will not do anything that will make it more difficult for him to grant the requests made by them.  I do appeal to the Minister, however, to examine the points I have made and that they made in that document and see that effect is given to them at the earliest possible moment.  I appeal to him to have a referee appointed who cannot be charged, perhaps unfairly, I will admit, with being a partisan so far as his own decisions are concerned, not a partisan in a political sense or anything like that.  If, having already decided a case, on hearing the evidence again, he reverses his decision, I respectfully submit that that is contrary to natural justice.  I put it to the Minister that he can be appointed as a temporary judge while another judge is taken from the bench to do this work.  I do not propose to comment on anything else relating to <Col N="1437" /> that except to say that you can have full confidence in that person for another type of work, but not for the type of work he is doing.</P>
    <P>I must say that I do not like a number of things the Referee does.  He is a very decent and very able man, but at the same time he does not display the wisdom that a person in his position should display.  He should not accost witnesses outside his court.  I say that the place in which he hears a case is, to all intents and purposes, his court, and that whatever he has to say to an applicant or a witness should be said inside the court, and that he should not accost them outside and issue an ultimatum.  He is not being fair to himself when he does that and he gives a bad impression.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not make an alteration in regard to that, there will be still a very large number of applicants who will think that they did not get justice and that they will never get it.  Therefore, I am appealing for speedy action so that those who will qualify will be able to get some benefit from it now while they are in a position to make some use of it.  They do not want it as a memorial over their graves.  They want it at the time when it can be of greatest use to them, when it can be of the greatest benefit to the people who served Ireland in her hour of need.</P>
    <P>The next point is the military service pensions for serving personnel.  Why have serving personnel who retire to wait for three, six, nine or 12 months before what they are entitled to under the statute is paid to them?  I know there is a defence regulation that such persons must get a clearance certificate. How are these persons to live during the interval?  I say that they should not be discharged, that they should be kept on the pay roll until inquiries have been made as to what shortages there may be.  All that should be expedited and then, when you show that you are treating those who have served well, you can with confidence ask for the new recruits, for the younger fellows to come up.  One of the most deadly factors against recruiting is seeing those who have served being harshly and badly <Col N="1438" /> treated.  There is only one thing worse and that is sneering at some member of the Defence Forces.  I do not care who the person is.  I do not care what the rank is.  Any man who served in the Army of this country in any capacity whatsoever has done something of which he can be proud.  He holds an honour that can be proudly borne and sneering and insulting references should not be made about such a man by those who were not perhaps as courageous as he was when the opportunity was afforded them.  I hope the Minister will give the appeal I have made sympathetic and urgent consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Running right through Deputy General MacEoin's speech was a suggestion in relation to the Referee.  There might be some substance in his remarks were the rehearings on the basis of a rehearing by way of appeal.  As I understand the position, this reopening provision was not brought in on the basis that there was any deficiency in the hearing or the decision arrived at.  The Deputy and others were very free in their comments in regard to the fairness and efficiency of all those concerned.  I understand that the position was that new facts or new evidence had become available, facts and evidence which were not available to the applicant in the first instance thereby depriving him of the opportunity of presenting his case properly and precluding him by the terms of the statute from having his case dealt with again when he was in a position to plead it.  I think that is the basis upon which the provisions in relation to reopening were put before us and the basis upon which the subsequent steps were taken.  If that is so, there is no substance in the objections that have been made by Deputy General MacEoin.  There is nothing prejudicial in having a man hear a case or hear new evidence.  In fact it is perhaps that very man who will be most likely to give the case the most sympathetic consideration.  I do not think there is a great deal in the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of abatement and special allowances has been raised. One does feel on examination that the <Col N="1439" /> advantage to the State in relation to abatement is not in fact as great as purely theoretical considerations might lead one to believe.  I am wondering whether, when everything is weighted up, the adjustment sought by and large is not more expensive for the State than the present arrangement. I know that Deputy Colley and others are ready to deal with these matters. They have much more detailed knowledge of them than I have and will probably deal with them far more competently so I shall leave the matter to their expert understanding.</P>
    <P>I want now to raise a matter under the heading of Army Pensions, though in its essence and nature it is more a question of insurance really.  I think it is time that we considered making adequate provision for personnel who are killed in the discharge of their duties in the Army under circumstances, to use the phrase in the Workmen's Compensation Act, &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of their employment&rdquo;. In that respect the State appears to lag behind the times.  In many big industries to-day there are insurance schemes for employees.  In the case of the Army there is no adequate provision.  I am reminded of a very bad accident that occurred here by reading about one to-day in England. Consider the case of a soldier killed in the course of his training in the use of explosives.  That is a very peculiar and special risk of his employment which operates in such a way as to make his own personal insurance a matter of some little difficulty.  The fact that such an accident only happens rarely is no argument for not doing anything about it.  Indeed, it should be a very strong argument for the State doing something since the potential commitment will be relatively small.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I want to make it quite clear that I think the matter of adequate insurance of military personnel in the restricted sense of meeting that liability in relation to a fatal accident in the course of their duty should be covered.  In the case of the Air Corps, there is a specific need for that.  The present provisions are completely <Col N="1440" /> inadequate.  They may be adequate if one regards them merely as some kind of compensation, but when one considers the situation that has to be met the position is very unsatisfactory. Fortunately, the number of cases is relatively few and the potential burden on the State is not likely to be great.  Air Force accidents would probably provide the greater bulk of the cases in which compensation would have to be paid in peace time.  The widow of an Air Force officer receives a pension of £90 a year with an allowance of £16 for each child up to the age of 16 years.  There are certain provisions for education.</P>
    <P>One asks oneself: what is the position of such a widow?  Very often these widows are young.  We have one very tragic case of a widow with a number of children who finds herself in this dilemma&mdash;I do not want to refer to anyone personally, but we have an example&mdash;that she must provide herself with an income of a size sufficient to allow her to rear her family.  In order to do that, she must go out and earn not only enough to rear her family, but also sufficient to pay someone to mind her children while she is earning.  Whatever arguments may be made in regard to pensions, this is not a question of a pension.  It is a question of insurance really.  It is a question of somebody killed off early in his career and leaving dependents.  It is not a question of somebody having served through and getting a pension, but of somebody being killed and of other people being left destitute.  It is primarily a question, therefore, of insurance.</P>
    <P>Now, on the question of the amounts, can anybody seriously suggest that £16 per child is going to support a child? I ask the Deputies to face that from the point of view in which I have already put it.  The widow has either to go out and earn not only enough for her family, but enough to pay somebody to mind the family while she is earning, or else she will need to have an income to enable her to rear the family, and if it is a family of young children, to give them the care <Col N="1441" /> and upbringing to which they are entitled, and which they would have had if their father had not been killed in the service of the State.  I had tried to get figures for the support of children in public institutions.  I have been informed recently that it may be possible to get that figure.  In any event, it is considerably in excess of the figure on which it is possible to support a child, even where there is the benefit of pooling overheads for a number of children.  There is also an indicator in the income-tax allowance granted for children.  But, by any yardstick, the £16 is certainly too little.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which I would make to the Minister, apart from the widow herself who is entitled to consideration, is that the allowance for supporting the children should be considerably increased.  That proposal has the merit also of adjusting the expenses involved according to the burden.  I know the answer will be made, why did they not insure?  There will be the suggestion, in the case of the Air Corps, that flying pay was meant to provide insurance.  The Minister gave me a number of answers to some questions in respect of proficiency in flying pay.  I do not want to detain the House now, but I have pleaded with the Minister already in this matter.  He is not unsympathetic by any means.  It is unnecessary for me to go into detail except to say that flying pay is in every way a matter of proficiency, apart from the risk to the person concerned.  Quite apart from provision for the family, it is straining it and wrong historically to suggest that it was meant to be a provision to allow them to insure.  I know of one case during the emergency where risk pay was given to personnel who were engaged on work which carried certain personal risks.  There was no suggestion whatever that that was for insurance. The point made was &ldquo;we cannot ask men to take these extra risks to themselves, over and above the risks inherent in their ordinary duty unless we compensate them for them&rdquo;.  That is the basis on which this pay was given.  I think it is simply case-making to suggest that flying pay is in the nature of risk pay. <Col N="1442" /> One can stand over the case that a man in peace time, in the course of his profession in the Army, is taking a greater risk than his comrades in other categories, and therefore, is entitled to compensation in regard to his own personal risk quite apart from the insurance question.  In so far as there is any question of risk in flying pay, I think it must be equated in that way.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is another element in it, that it is sometimes forgotten by the official suggestion that flying pay and similar qualification pay should be in the nature of risk pay, flying pay particularly.  One of the basis upon which officers in certain categories, including the flying corps, were given additional pay was by virtue of the fact that they were specialists in the corps, and that a limited number would be virtually confined to that corps for the duration of their Army career, and so would not have the same advantages in the race for promotion as they would have in other corps where there would be a wider number of vacancies.  From one point of view, that is about the only basis upon which you can justify pay of that nature, because, in fact, the General Staff officer, the infantry officer, the cavalry officer and the artillery officer are all professional specialists.  When one looks at it in that way, there is very little basis for paying the ordnance officer or the flying officer additional pay.  The reason for paying them is because the general service officer has a wider field and, on the odds, better chances of promotion.  A higher number of vacancies are available to him than to the others.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this at length.  I anticipated that one answer made would be that flying pay is meant to cover insurance, and that that is what it is given for.  I would go so far as to say that it was given for no such purpose and should not be so regarded. The next thing that is suggested is that the total amount of the remuneration of officers in that category nowadays when compared with certain civilian employment, is reasonably good, and that such officers should be expected adequately to insure themselves, just as the prudent <Col N="1443" /> civilian would, and that if they do not, and fail their responsibility, it is just too bad for themselves and their families. The answer to that is that the person with whom the equation is made is not subject to the same risks.  In other words, the risks which a civil servant or even an infantry or artillery officer of comparable salary runs are very different from the risks which are part of the duty of a flying officer, certainly under certain operational conditions, bad weather, and so on.  The question of adequate insurance then is another story.  I leave out the question of the actual risk.  The question of how much and in how short a space of time he can provide for himself comes in, and I think a strong case has to be made, particularly when one has regard to the following fact into which I have made some inquiries personally; I will not say that an officer flying in the Air Crops is uninsurable, but the premiums are prohibitive.  He can insure himself, yes, excluding an accident of that nature, but that is the type of accident that is involved.  He can certainly get insurance of that nature excluding this particular risk, but if this risk is included the premium is absolutely prohibitive. That is why, I think, the State should do in one way or the other what big air companies do and what, I understand, Aer Lingus does, that is, provide a form of insurance for the personnel who are running this risk and a percentage of whom&mdash;fortunately a small percentage and, please God, an ever decreasing percentage&mdash;will, in fact, be cases for consideration afterwards. These air companies do make provision for their employees.</P>
    <P>There is one comparison that could be made and I am not going to go any further than this.  During a period of a little more than 12 months past, there have been two fatal accidents, one in the Army and one in an air line.  It would be very interesting for the Minister to compare&mdash;and he should be readily able to get the figures&mdash;as to what benefits the dependents of the Army officer were entitled to and what benefits the dependents of the officer of the air line were entitled to.  This is a case where the State should, in <Col N="1444" /> some form or other, insure its employees for that type of accident.  I am strictly limiting it to that type of case where a man is killed in the course of or arising out of his employment.  I would not seek to extend it any further.  Whether it is done by way of pension, as is more or less provided at the moment, or whether it is done by means of some insurance scheme is really immaterial provided it is done.</P>
    <P>There is at least one case, and it has been hanging for a long time, although it is not for want of attention in the Minister's Department; I certainly hasten to add that because I know it from personal knowledge and I know that the Minister himself has been interested in the case.  However, the matter is still undecided and more than 12 months have passed since the accident.  It would do a great deal for the morale of the Army and would be also something to the credit of the State if this matter could be speedily adjusted and adequate insurance in some form or other provided to cover cases of the nature to which I have referred.  I would ask the Minister to take up that matter very vigorously without further delay.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the case that has been made here this evening by Deputy General MacEoin, and the further and special case that has been made by Deputy Major de Valera.  Listening to the speeches that have been made, I feel that it is a cause for deep regret that our legislation dealing with military service and Army pensions has not been taken out of the sphere of political discussion.  It is true, of course, that in regard to the major matters that have been mentioned there is really no disagreement and that Deputies on all sides of the House support the case that has been made for increased pensions for members of the Old I.R.A. and increased pensions for widows of men who served in the I.R.A. and in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking right through the Acts governing pensions we find that they have their basis round about 1923.  At that period we had very little experience in dealing with legislation at all and we had certainly very little experience in <Col N="1445" /> dealing with pensions.  This Parliament then had no Irish basis on which to calculate pensions and it seemed to base them entirely on the cost of living at the time, disability pensions at any rate.  In looking through the Acts we find that in 1923 the widow of a man killed or who died of wounds received on active service was entitled to a pension of 17/6 a week.  That pension has not since been altered. Undoubtedly if those pensions were being fixed now a much higher rate would be determined upon, but in 1923 our legislators had a much different idea from what they have now.  Consequently, the whole pension code has been governed by what I would describe and term as a mean and miserable mentality.  Many of the defects that are now being pointed out, many of the defects of which the Minister is personally aware, and to which the Minister himself drew attention a short time ago when he was leading off the Opposition on the discussion of this Estimate, arise from the approach, the mean approach that was made to this matter of pensions 30 years ago.  If this idea of 17/6 a week for a widow was based on some idea of the cost of living in 1923, it is not a satisfactory basis to-day.  Arising out of those Acts, in 1923, a rate of two guineas per week was fixed for total disability.  That has crept up to £2 10s. to-day.  Obviously, there is no comparison between the value of £2 2s. 30 years ago and £2 10s. to-day. We must completely change our ideas. We must change the whole basis on which the structure of pensions legislation is built.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to a military service pension of £6 or £7 a year. It is very difficult to follow the mentality behind the granting of a pension of £6 or £7 a year.  Deputy General MacEoin made a very good suggestion, certainly one that I would support, that there ought to be a minimum pension for service.  That minimum pension should be one that would indicate the regard in which this country holds the men who were prepared to sacrifice their lives for it.</P>
    <P>Like many Deputies, I have been brought up in the tradition that the best service one could render to this <Col N="1446" /> State or to any other State was service in arms.  The military profession was always held out, and I always regarded it, as a very noble profession, the noblest of professions.  The conceptions or ideas that our politicians have, as enshrined in the legislation passed in this House over 30 years, would not suggest that military service was held in the high honour that it ought to be.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that, just a couple of years ago, the then Government brought in legislation to increase pensions for everybody except members of the Old I.R.A.  The most heartening thing that I have heard in this House in recent weeks was the very definite declaration made by the Minister for Finance, on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, that the present Government would not neglect the Old I.R.A.  I know the House knows, and members representing the various Old I.R.A. organisations that have interviewed the Minister know, how sympathetic the Minister is to their claims. The general view amongst those Old I.R.A. organisations is that, if it were within the Minister's power to increase the pensions and remove causes of grievance, the Minister would do it right away.</P>
    <P>We all know the complexities of government.  We all understand the grip and influence of the Department of Finance.  That is why it was most heartening to have that declaration a week or so ago from the Minister for Finance that the present Government would not neglect the Old I.R.A.  If I interpret that rightly, it could only mean one thing.  I hope I am right in my interpretation that, in the very near future, we will have a declaration from the Government that there will be substantial increases in the pensions awarded to the Old I.R.A., to the widows of the Old I.R.A., and particularly to those soldiers of the Old I.R.A. who are incapacitated as a result of their service.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of points that have been made to me by representatives of the Old I.R.A., but they have been already made to the Minister.  They are incorporated in the pamphlet to which Deputy General <Col N="1447" /> MacEoin has referred, and I know they have been sympathetically considered by the Minister.  Consequently, there is no necessity for me to go into these matters in detail, but there are a few outstanding matters to which I would like to refer.</P>
    <P>Deputy General MacEoin and Deputy Major de Valera have referred to the question of the abatement of military service pensions.  That has been a source of annoyance since 1924.  Under the system as operated since 1924, if a person is in receipt of a military service pension and serves this State in any other capacity, either in the Civil Service or in the local government service, a proportion of his military service pension is abated because of that.  A person who served in the I.R.A. and who is, at present, in a Civil Service department or in a local government department suffers a deduction in his pension simply because he is in receipt of money from a Government or local government source.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>My particular concern is the fishermen of this country. Most fishermen are not farmers and their gross income is sometimes out of all proportion to their net income. Under a recent Act passed by the Oireachtas, all fish must be sold through the successor to the Sea Fisheries Association.  In other words, local authorities and Government authorities have an opportunity of finding out what the gross income of a fisherman is, and it is, as I say, out of all proportion to his net income.  May I quote an example?  Take, say, a herring drift-fishing boat.  The gross takings of that boat may be £900 for the season but possibly in the last week of the season the entire trawl of nets is lost, and a trawl of nets may cost anything up to £600.  If it were the net income that was contemplated by this section, I would have no objection at all to the section as it stands. It is most important from the small fisherman's point of view.  Again, take salmon net-fishing.  To rig out a small fleet of drift salmon nets costs approximately £600.  The income derived for the season may be anything <Col N="1449" /> from £600 to £700, but the net income is much less.  I am particularly interested in fishermen so far as this section is concerned.  I am anxious to see that they shall derive the same benefits of this section that any other non-farmer would derive.  If I can get an assurance from the Minister that the section merely refers to the net income of such applicants, I shall be satisfied.  I think the House will agree that the section, as it stands, if it were to refer to gross income, would completely deny the ordinary small fishermen of this country of the benefits of the section.  It is a matter to which I would ask the Minister to give careful consideration because it affects a considerable number of people in the constituency which I represent&mdash;West Donegal.</P>
      <P>Again, we are throwing the onus on local authorities to investigate and find out the income of applicants.  Somebody said the other day in discussing the Finance Bill, that the entertainments tax was an incitement to dishonesty, but how do we expect local authorities to investigate and find out the income of a migratory labourer? Again if it were a question of the net income, it might be reasonable but his gross income may be obtained from the Ministry of National Labour in Britain and it is out of all proportion to his net income.  We all know that in Britain income-tax is paid as you earn and all employers return the earnings of migrants to the income-tax authorities&mdash;that is their gross earnings.  We forget that possibly for six or seven months they are idle and that they are drawing unemployment assistance in this country.  We forget the expense they incur when travelling to Britain and seeking employment there.  We forget that while they are over there they must keep two homes.  If the Minister could say that the section applies to the net income of the applicant or his family, then I personally would be satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy Ted O'Sullivan and I have down a couple of amendments to this section too.  We propose that the ceiling be raised to £600 and that the smallest grant would be 40 per cent. <Col N="1450" /> of the relevant grant, in other words, that in the case of the £275 grant, £110 would be the minimum grant by a housing authority and that persons in receipt of up to £600 a year would qualify for such a grant.  We have heard some talk about a man with an income of £208 building a house.  I can assure the Minister that he would not build it in Cork anyhow, because he would get no advance from the county manager, who would say that he was not in a position to repay the loan.  He said that in the case of men with far bigger incomes than £208. He has said it in the case of a man earning up to £7 10s. a week, that it was placing a burden on the man that he could not discharge and he would not give him a grant.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy and myself know of the case of one particular man to whom he agreed to give a grant only because he got an increase of 7/6 a week in his weekly salary, bringing it from £7 10s. up to £7 17s. 6d.  That was the deciding factor which influenced the manager in giving him an advance. I do not know what they would do in other parts of the country, but I think the idea of a man with an income of £4 a week, especially a man with a wife and family, building a house in Cork is absurd, and I do not think his application would be considered at all.</P>
      <P>My opinion is that an income of £600 is the least upon which a man should attempt to build a house, if he does not want to be saddled with a loan which he would not be able to bear.  The ceiling in the Social Welfare Bill is £600, and I think that should be the ceiling here also.  A man earning £4 a week who has a daughter working in the woollen mills in Cork and a son working in a factory both earning £2 a week, bringing the family income to £8 a week or £416 a year, could not attempt to get a house built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the amendment tabled by Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy O'Sullivan and myself is a reasonable one, that the income ceiling should be £600 and that a man with an income of £600 should at least get a grant of £110, or 40 per cent. instead of 33? per cent. as suggested here for a man with £416. We have a fairly good experience of <Col N="1451" /> people looking for loans in Cork, and we know that the city manager or the county manager would not give a loan without considering very seriously a man's ability to repay it.  They would not attempt to consider giving a loan to a man with a low income.  Surely a man with a family should get some extra consideration.  There should be an extra allowance for the man with a family to enable him to get a house built.</P>
    <P>This section, in my opinion, if left as the Minister framed it, will be the means of stopping a very large amount of building under the Small Dwellings Act because people with an income of £208 a year could not attempt to get a house built and will have to be housed by the local authority.  In any place close to a city I think that £365 is not sufficient at all, and in that case the Minister is only suggesting a 50 per cent. grant.  I do not mind what per cent. of the grant people get.  What I am concerned with is that I consider that a ceiling of £600 is little enough. If a man with a smaller income proposes to get a house built, I would be in favour of giving him more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that, in Section 10 and many other parts of the Bill, opportunity was not taken to give local authorities more power and more freedom when dealing with these grants rather than increasing the central control over their activities.  I agree with the last speaker, and I think that, apart from the desirability of increasing the amount of freedom and giving extra powers to local authorities, it is impossible to make general rules for all the local authorities throughout the country to administer the grant because the conditions which local authorities have to deal with are entirely different in each county.  The conditions which Deputy McGrath speaks of in Cork are very different from the conditions in Dublin and the conditions which Deputy Sweetman referred to in Kildare.  Therefore, general regulations for local authorities under a Bill like this will be quite unworkable. I fail to understand why the Minister should not have allowed local <Col N="1452" /> authorities to draw up their own regulations in this respect.  I am sure Deputy Byrne will agree with me that, as far as Dublin is concerned, to give a grant to a man with less than £4 a week income is perfectly ridiculous.  It simply would not arise.</P>
      <P>As far as Section 10 (1) (iv) is concerned, there again the ceiling of £416 is much too low.  I think that the suggestion in the amendment to increase it to £600 will go a long way towards making the section more workable, and that the substitution of 40 per cent. for 33? per cent. will be a great help.  It is a pity in this connection that the Minister would not allow local authorities to draw up their own regulations for the administration of these sections.  After all, the local authorities are run by people who are elected locally, who know the local conditions, and to try to make general regulations for the whole country will make the administration of the Bill very difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those who in these amendments, are in effect objecting to the provisions of this section.  I stated my objection on general grounds to Section 9, and the same objection applies here.  I think that £600 a year is the minimum income.  In fact, I do not like the limit on the income at all.  A better method to deal with this question would be to limit the size of the house to, say, 1,150 square feet.  Then you would automatically bring in a certain type of means test.  I am in difficulty in discussing the amendment because I really dislike the whole section.  But, if the section is to stand, I should like to see it amended.  Therefore, I support the £600 a year proposal as being a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say to the Minister that certain builders have already built houses in the expectation of their clients getting a grant, that these clients have refused to take the houses, and that they are now left on the builders' hands.  One builder told me that he has had six houses left on his hands.  I do not know what the Minister proposes to do in such cases.  I would support a minimum of £600 if the section stands, but I would prefer to see the section deleted altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath, Deputy O'Sullivan and some other Deputies considered this matter very carefully before putting down an amendment.  The position is that the rural worker with an average wage of £4 per week has no opportunity whatever of getting a grant to build a house because the county manager when making advances for house building has laid it down that he must get two securities.  Where will a man earning £4 a week get two securities?  Even if he should happen to get these securities and a loan, the smallest rent he would be asked to pay would be £1 per week to cover the repayment of loan and interest charges.  Indeed, it might be more than £1 per week.  How could a man earning £4 per week pay that rent and support his wife and children out of what is left?  Will he not bring on himself commitments that he can never hope to meet?  The most he can do is lease the cottage in which he may be living.</P>
      <P>Take, then, the man working in the city in receipt of a wage of a little over £6 per week and with a son or a daughter earning £2 per week.  That man is over the ceiling and he cannot build a house because he cannot take advantage of the loans or grants mentioned here.  I think it is absurd to have different ceilings in different Acts.  We have a ceiling of £600 under the Social Welfare Act.  We have a ceiling of £416 here.  We will have some other ceiling in another Act.  If £600 is the ceiling under the Social Welfare Act, why not make it the same here?  We believe that as the section is framed it will be ineffective in operation and I appeal to the Minister to consider the matter and alter the section on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows quite well that will not happen in practice. At the present cost of living there would not be a penny left for a man out of £600 for the support of his wife and children.  I think Deputy M. E. Dockrell's suggestion is worthy of consideration.  One could indirectly apply a means test by limiting the size of the house to 1,160 square feet.  That would exclude the people who wanted a bigger and a better house.  I think the section is utterly useless.  The people who come within these categories will never build houses.  There may be some exceptions where people might be lucky enough to get some money from a relative or in some other way.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell is very innocent in pressing the Minister for an answer as to whether this is net or gross income. We all know it is gross income, calculated on the date on which the inquiry is made.  Assuming that some members of the family might be earning on the date of the inquiry, the income is calculated on that basis even though the following week a son or a daughter might get married and the father would be left handicapped with the assessment that was made when the income was first calculated.  This section is very objectionable.  It leads nowhere.  I commend Deputy M.E. Dockrell's suggestion to the Minister, since it would cause no embarrassment and no unnecessary inquiry as to every penny coming into the house.  Inquiries in regard to income always place people in the position of attempting to conceal what they can from whoever is making the inquiry.  I think the limitation of the floor space is the best idea and that would exclude those who would not be entitled to a grant, because if people have a decent income there is no reason why they should be subsidised by the ratepayers.  Indeed, I would be the first to object to such subsidisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I voiced my appreciation of Section 9.  I think I am now entitled to voice my objection to this section.  The framing of the section reflects very little credit on the Minister or his advisers.  The people in the categories referred to will never <Col N="1455" /> build houses and the Minister has wasted public time by introducing such a frivolous section into the Bill.  It is stated in sub-section (2) of Section 10 that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In calculating the family income of a person applying for a grant under this section in respect of a house, it shall be taken to include the income received during the year ending on the date of such application by such person and by every member of such person's family who resided with him during that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to have from the Minister a detailed explanation of that sub-section. On what grounds will he refuse an application for a grant from a single man with an income of £3 per week living with his father, who is in receipt of a wage of £5 per week, or two brothers each in receipt of a wage of £3 per week?  On what grounds can he refuse such a man an application for a grant if he decides to build a house?  We know that the £ to-day is only worth 9/- as compared with 1939, and so far as Cork is concerned there are very few people there with incomes of less than £600 per year who would ever dream of building houses.  If Deputy Desmond's suggestion is accepted it will relieve local authorities of the responsibility of providing houses for people for whom they are at present obliged to provide houses.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing houses is a fairly substantial burden on local authorities in view of the fact that it has increased enormously of late.  The latest figure before our local authority was round about £1,700.  I think it would be good business to give to those people the maximum grant, to allow the local authority to give them the maximum grant of £275 to build the house rather than provide the £1,700 to build a house for themselves.  In view of the statements which the Minister has heard on this section, I think he should withdraw it and substitute one that would be acceptable to the House and to the local authorities. This type of section would not be acceptable to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the wording of this section, it is intended to <Col N="1456" /> give as little as possible in the form of a housing grant.  It is ridiculous to suggest that a person with an income that does not exceed £4 per week could in present circumstances qualify for a 100 per cent. housing grant.  Nobody with an income as low as that will attempt to build a house in view of present-day costs.  There is no prospect that these costs will come down or that the cost of living will come down.  These are two facts to be taken into consideration when the question of a person's income arises in connection with qualifying for the grant.  In my opinion this section is simply window-dressing.  It may encourage people to believe that perhaps, by hook or by crook, they can qualify, but when they come to consider the facts, they will find that they will not be able to do so.</P>
      <P>Some previous speaker mentioned that someone with a small income may be lucky enough to get a sum of money from the sweepstakes or from a relative under a will and can then proceed to build a house, even though he is only earning £4 per week and in that way can qualify for the 100 per cent. grant. It was also mentioned that perhaps a single man with £4, £5 or £6 a week could attempt to build a house.  I do not think there is much point in that. If he intends to get married he will have to face the prospect of paying back the loan made available for the building of the house in respect of which he qualified for the grant.  I think that would only encourage speculation. I believe myself that such a thing is unlikely and very remote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputies that, in arguing with me about this section, it is not a matter of convincing me that the limits prescribed here are low.  I know and admit they are.  I am prepared to go as far as to say that, perhaps, I would not achieve very much in the way of enabling people, covered by the section, to build houses for themselves.  I am trying to do what Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll said I should not do, but what experience has taught me I should do.  It is all very well for the Deputy to say that these matters can <Col N="1457" /> be left to the local bodies.  That is all very good, but they had their chance. If the local bodies have had the opportunity which the Deputy thinks they should have, and have not made use of it, is not that a reason why we should try and devise a general plan for them that would be likely to be acceptable and would be adopted by them?</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy has made the case that it is a waste of time to be discussing this section.  Deputy Murphy and Deputy Desmond are members of the Cork County Council, and the freedom which Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll suggests local bodies should have in respect of this matter was available to the Cork County Council under Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  What income did the Cork County Council, with all its wisdom and knowledge, stipulate in regard to these classes?  When I set out limits up to £416, I am castigated by Deputy Murphy, and told that we are wasting the time of the House.  The scheme suggested by the Cork County Council provided a limit for family incomes up to £325.  I am going as far as £416.  Yet, we hear all this talk about the freedom which the local bodies should have.</P>
      <P>When Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll speaks on this and thinks in terms of the sort of a housing problem that you have in and around the City of Dublin, he is thinking of a problem that is as different as day is from night&mdash;of what a man may be able to do in the way of providing himself with a house with assistance from the State and the local authority.  I am not saying that this will apply to a man with a small income.  I know too well that he could not attempt to build a house for himself in view of present-day costs.  But where is the use of my providing a very magnificent scale, let it be a floor-space scale or a high income level if, by doing so, I am just merely putting a barrier in the way of local bodies adopting any scheme at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Sweetman to tell us about the moral courage which members of local authorities have, and how, say, they would not mind segregating a man from his neighbours or hesitate about determining income or valuation limits.  It is <Col N="1458" /> all very well for people to demonstrate that they possess that degree of bravery or moral courage.  We know, however, from experience that when you ask a local body to fix a limit on these matters that one member will propose that it should be £5 per week, another member will propose an amendment to the effect that it should be £6, and, finally, they will agree on £7.  Having done that, the scheme will be drafted on that basis.  Then some member of the council who said nothing at the meeting goes home and finds that his neighbour is earning £8 per week.  The two of them will discuss the matter.  The neighbour will say that it is unfair that, because he is earning £8 per week, he should be ruled out.  The member of the council he had the conversation with will return to the next meeting of the county council and put down a motion to rescind the previous decision.  His proposal will be to raise the income limit to £8 or over.  That kind of thing will go on until they finally reach the stage when the whole thing will be thrown over, and they will have no scheme at all.  It is all very well for Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll to say: &ldquo;Why not leave it to us local boys.&rdquo; I say it has been left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If any house is to be erected under this section by labouring men in rural parts, I am thinking of a very simple, inexpensive cottage that would not reach 1,100 square feet at all. You cannot make a decision on the basis of the floor space.  I would not regard that suggestion as worthy of any consideration in so far as this particular problem is concerned.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made here of the gross income and the net income.  Of course, there has been handed over to local bodies in this matter a difficult problem, but then, take local bodies who have the responsibility of governing a differential renting system.  They have to determine these questions.  I am not saying that they do not find it difficult, but it is no more difficult in those cases than it is in the one with which we are dealing.  Deputy McMenamin was speaking of the case of a man who was employed for wages and members of whose family were also employed for wages.  Deputy O'Donnell was speaking about fishermen who were self-employed.  In the case of men who are self-employed, the local authority could have regard to the expenses a man would incur in following whatever occupation he was engaged in.  However, when he states the case of the loss of nets, I do not know whether that could be regarded as a charge that could be deducted from annual earnings, because I think you can insure against the loss of nets. I do not know what attitude a local body would take towards a problem of that nature, but I would scarcely think, at first sight, it was the type of overhead that a local body could have regard to in arriving at the income of the man who was an applicant for a grant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy mentioned the case of a single man who secures a site in his own name and proceeds to build a house.  The house is his and it is his income that will determine the amount of the grant he should get.  No other considerations can arise in the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We can keep on concluding and replying for a long time. I do not want to stifle discussion in any way but I want Deputies to appreciate that Sections 9, 10 and 11 are sections about which we can have the same kind of argument.  Deputies can talk at the Minister as if they were trying to convince the Minister of something of which the Minister is perfectly conscious. If he is conscious of these things, he is also conscious of the fact that county councils and urban councils have been very sceptical about this whole matter and, as a result of my contacts with members of local bodies who spoke to me, I took it, very openly, freely and honestly, I believe that in what I am doing in these three sections I am representing, not what is in every one of their minds, I am sure, but what is in the minds of the majority of members of local bodies.  I have no hesitation at all in making that claim.</P>
      <P>I am asking Deputies, if they have remarks to address to these sections, not to address them to me as if I did not realise that these income limits are low.  I admit that.  I admit that the valuations stipulated in regard to other classes are very low.  I admit all these things but I feel that it is better that we should have a scheme set out here that is likely to be uniformly accepted and applied and that it is better that we should do at least a half justice rather than refuse to do justice at all in any shape or form until we get complete justice.  That is my case and that is my plea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find in the course of time that what I have claimed here is not far from the mark. If the Deputy has read some of the discussions that took place in these councils where they adopted the free for all schemes, and if he had read of the alarm they expressed because of the amount of money required to meet the commitments in respect of them, he would have a view that would be <Col N="1463" /> very closely related to mine.  All I am asking Deputies is, in whatever further remarks they have to make, to have some regard to the fact that we must finish this discussion some time.  While I am prepared to go so far as saying that these are very, very low figures, they are in my view the best that we can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that members of the Cork County Council who&mdash;I will not say have been attacked &mdash;but who have been referred to by the Minister as making cases based on our own individual opinions, should state that that is entirely wrong.  I want to point out to the Minister that any remarks we make are nothing personal to the Minister, but refer to the Bill.  The Cork County Council sent up schemes to the Department of Local Government, in which £600 was the income level.  They had a very much higher valuation than the Minister has in his scheme.  That was sent up unanimously by the Cork County Council&mdash;South, North and West Cork.  It was sent back by the Minister's Department for some trivial thing such as the question as to whether utility societies should come under this or whether an individual who was having a house built by a utility society should come under it. The matter was referred to a sub-committee who, I will admit, were just as conservative as the Minister is in the terms of this Bill.  That sub-committee reported after this Housing Bill had been introduced, and nobody bothered upsetting it, because the Housing Bill had been introduced.  If the Minister or his officials will look up the scheme sent up by the Cork County Council, in the first instance, it will be seen that it was the unanimous decision of the council and that the figures were very much higher than the figures in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy McGrath, I should like to correct the Minister. I should much prefer that we would discuss this matter from a national point of view rather than adopt a county versus county attitude.  As the Minister has given the impression to <Col N="1464" /> members of the House from other counties that Cork may be acting as a collective body in this, it is well, as Deputy McGrath has mentioned, to lay emphasis on the fact that the figures as quoted by the Minister are not correct, in so far as, when we were dealing with Section 7 of the previous Bill in the South Cork Board of Health, of which Deputy McGrath, Deputy MacCarthy and others of us are members, we agreed unanimously that the amount would be £600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <P>100 per cent. grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Unfortunately, a difficulty confronted us that was not foreseen by the local authority but was pointed out by the Department. It was the fact that in parts of County Cork many of the applicants were getting the Government grant through local public utility societies and that meant that, legally, there was a doubt as to whether these applicants would be eligible for the local grant from the council.  The records of that are in the Minister's Department.  Let the Minister check up and he will find that, whatever the faults of the Cork County Council may be, these matters were dealt with.  If the legal difficulty had not confronted the Cork County Council, the amount which was fixed unanimously by that body would have justified our claims in this amendment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the matter mentioned by the Minister as coming from the county council, it is well again to draw attention to the fact which Deputy McGrath has mentioned that a sub-committee of the council was set up to discuss that matter.  Their findings were not passed unanimously by the Cork County Council because, when the findings of that sub-committee were reported back, this Bill had been introduced.  We were discussing this Bill and, because we believed that we were not in a position at that stage to send up a final scheme of our own, considering that the Minister had introduced this Bill, the matter was left in abeyance.  Not for one moment can we leave the Minister under the impression that collectively <Col N="1465" /> the members of the local authority in Cork agreed to these figures.</P>
    <P>If that matter is clear, all I would say regarding the statement made by the Minister is that I can see two difficulties. First of all, the Minister states&mdash;and it is, perhaps, some consolation to him to know&mdash;that a single man may be entitled to the grant under Section 10.  Our main difficulty, as members of the local authority, is to house people who have families.  If we cannot give them the advantages of a grant under this Bill we will be compelled, more or less, by law, by the report of our county medical officer, if we build houses in any township or village and if these people apply for them, to give them to the married people with young children who are living in condemned houses.  The Minister knows&mdash;he has stated quite clearly in his reply here that the section is far short of the requirements&mdash; that we can never utilise this section to the advantage of any of these applicants. I would like to see single men also getting grants, if possible, but we must start at least by saying that the married man with a family must come first and our first obligation must be to him.</P>
    <P>The other point stressed by the Minister was similar to the point raised on Section 9.  I did not enter into the discussion on Section 9.  The Minister put up the same case on Section 10, that is, the worry that will be involved on the part of individual members of local authorities in case they offend their neighbour.  We should not be in public life just to be able to facilitate our friends and neighbours.</P>
    <P>If these sub-sections of Section 10 are passed and become law in their present form, they provide the easiest way in the world of offending neighbours and friends who may be looking for a grant.  How can any member of this House say to a man who is in receipt of £417 a year: &ldquo;Unfortunately you can get nothing&rdquo;?  How can he say to an applicant who may have an income of £313 a year: &ldquo;All you will get is 50 per cent. of the grant, but if you had £1 10s. a year less, you would get 66? per cent. of a grant&rdquo;? The very fact that this section was <Col N="1466" /> broken into so many parts is, I believe, an incentive to would-be applicants to do all in their power to justify their assertion that they are in receipt of a lower wage than may be coming into the home.  Deputy Murphy mentioned the difficulty of other members, and I believe he was perfectly right in doing so.  If an inspector of a local authority visits a home to ascertain the income of the family, he will base it on what the family earned in the previous 12 months, but there is no guarantee that the same income will be coming into the home for the following 12 months. I believe that, no matter how the Minister tries to get over this, it is fantastic to think that the section can be made operative in its present form. There is no possible alternative to the amendment.  The Minister did say, of course, that he had in mind the small type of house that would not cost more than £1,100.  Surely the Minister will have to admit that the smaller the house, the smaller will be the Government grant and, incidentally, the local authority grant.  It still means that the applicant, because the grant is smaller, is committed to finding a large sum of money himself.  I honestly believe that the Minister has put forward no justification for the section in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Will persons to whom Section 9 is intended to apply be entitled to take advantage of the provisions of Section 10 instead, if they so desire?  Instead of being assessed on their valuations, if they have a little bit of land, will they be allowed to take advantage of Section 10?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly would be an improvement and it would answer a lot of questions.  The House adopted Section 9 which provided grants for people who owned land but, to my mind, Section 10 is much more liberal altogether.  The people who will pay for most of the grants given under Section 10 are the people whom Section 9 is supposed to cover, but they themselves will be getting less on the <Col N="1467" /> basis of their income.  I want to point out to the representatives of the farmers on the Cork County Council that they should be a little bit careful inasmuch as they are the people who are going to pay most of the money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask is the Minister serious in suggesting that a house can be built out of a family income of £4 per week, because that is what is suggested in this section? Remember it is the family income, not the income of the head of the family nor any single member of it, but the total family income.  It is suggested seriously in this piece of legislation that a house can be built out of such a family income of £4.  You would not build a henhouse out of such an income.  I think Deputy Murphy has brought an important point to the notice of the House in regard to sub-section (2) of this section.  It is well to read it over again:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In calculating the family income of a person applying for a grant <Col N="1468" /> under this section in respect of a house, it shall be taken to include the income received during the year ending on the date of such an application by such person and by every member of such person's family who resided with him during that year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to suggest that if a young man who is a member of a family gets a plot for the building of a house, the total family income in his case will not be taken into account but only the income of the young man who is the applicant for the grant.  If that is intended, it is definitely not provided in that sub-section.  We all know from our experience of various local authorities throughout the country that if such a case did arise and some young man were to apply for a grant in order to build a house, if we had a certain type of conservative law agent, such as many of us have experience of, that sub-section could be interpreted to mean that the total family income must be assessed and the young man would be completely ruled out.  The sub-section in itself is completely objectionable in so far as the income limits are concerned.  To think of a man with an income of £4 building a house is just nonsensical.  Whoever was responsible for putting that suggestion in the Bill, that an applicant would try to build a house out of an income of £4 a week, does not live in the country.  He might live in the Custom House but he has no contact with the country.  To build a house out of a family income of even £6 a week would be very difficult. There is a slight possibility that a person whose total family income is £8 a week might avail of the grant.</P>
    <P>In my own area of County Dublin this section of the Housing Act, 1950, was not made operative.  It may be some day.  The majority of the council did not feel that they should make it operative.  My opinion was that they should have.  Perhaps some day they may make it operative.  If they ever do, anybody who is applying for a Small Dwellings Act loan under this Bill, will be deprived of the benefit of a grant, because there is a regulation that nobody will be provided with a Small Dwellings Act loan in County <Col N="1469" /> Dublin unless he has a minimum income of £7 a week.  In County Dublin, under the Small Dwellings Act, we have built to the extent of about £4,500,000 already, and we expect to go almost as high again.  I suppose we are entitled in County Dublin to receive equal treatment with the Cork people.  That is a very high aspiration, but we consider that, in time, we may get similar treatment.  These are my views, but, as everybody in the House seems to be agreed as to the undesirability of this section as it stands, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say again, as one of those responsible for putting down the amendments, that these scalings are entirely too low.  If a low-income man wants to build a house he has to look for a loan, and his ability to repay that is considered by any local authority, building society or insurance company which may be inclined to advance money.  When these low-income men cannot get a loan, the question of giving a grant will never apply.  In the suggestions made by the Cork County Council subcommittee after this Bill was introduced, £325 was for the full grant.  The Minister has now, rightly or wrongly, suggested a scaling above that, and we suggest £600 as the very minimum.</P>
      <P>It is considered by many people that one-eighth of a person's income is what should be applied to housing.  Under the differential rents scheme it is under one-sixth.  But surely with £4 a week or thereabouts a person cannot attempt to do any of the things which the Minister has in mind.  He wants to encourage people to build houses for themselves, even people with a moderate income.  But his lower scale is far too low and so is the top scale in sub-section (4).  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the matter on the Report Stage and amend these figures.</P>

He now turns round and tells this House that the fishermen can recoup themselves for loss of gear at sea by insuring the gear. I maintain that the gross income of fishermen is completely out of proportion to their net income.  They may fish for a season and make a gross income of a certain amount, but at the end of the season they may lose their gear or even their boat, thereby reducing the net income to something nominal.  The Minister's answer to what I said was that the fishermen had a remedy, that they could insure their gear and their boats.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister, as a former Minister for Agriculture who had charge of the fisheries of this country, can he tell me the name of an insurance company in this country which will insure a fisherman's gear.  I defy him to give me the name of one insurance company that will do that.  Even the vessel itself can only be insured against total loss and that total loss must occur in certain circumstances specifically laid down in the insurance policy.  A fisherman's gear in many instances is not lost through inclement weather but through the action of a tramp steamer cutting the trawl of a fisherman or through a glut of fish in the nets which weighs them to the bottom and in many other ways.  There is no method of insuring against that loss.  If the Minister would define what he means by family income and say the net income I personally would be satisfied, but to say that the fishermen can insure against these losses is, I submit, absurd.  I press the Minister again to define what he means by family income.</P>

      <P>I said when the Bill was introduced that with these low amounts here you are only leading men into temptation.  If they borrowed money to build a house they could not possibly make the repayments out of an income of £208 a year or even the top one, £416 or £8 a week. I cannot see how they would get a <Col N="1471" /> loan from any local authority or insurance company.  I strongly recommend the Minister to consider the amount suggested in the amendment by Deputies MacCarthy, O'Sullivan and McGrath.  If a person applied to the Dublin Corporation for a loan and his total income was £416 a year, our city manager would not consider it. Deputy O'Donnell was worrying about the definition of family income.  I think Deputy Byrne will bear me out when I say that the Dublin Corporation consider the income of the head of the family and the income of sons and daughters who are earning.  That is the only way you can do it and that is what is in the Bill.  Section 10 (2) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In calculating the family income of a person applying for a grant under this section in respect of a house, it shall be taken to include the income received during the year ending on the date of such application by such person and by every member of such person's family who resided with him during that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that &ldquo;such person&rdquo; means the father.  It says &ldquo;every member of such person's family&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is the applicant all one can do is take his income. I take it the Minister meant the father and his family in the same way as we interpret it in the Dublin Corporation. If the son is getting married and he is the applicant, then I agree with the Minister one would take only his income.  It could be interpreted by saying &ldquo;every member of such person's family&rdquo;.  I want to substantiate what I said when this Bill was first introduced. I think the figures mentioned here are far too low, and unless an individual has a little cash to put down he will have no hope of getting a loan anywhere.  I think the Minister should favourably consider the suggestion put <Col N="1472" /> forward.  Any person with only £416 per year is merely being led into temptation.  If he fails to meet his repayments the sheriff goes in with an order, and we will then have to give him a corporation house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I have listened to the debate on these amendments with a certain amount of amusement.  It is amusing to see the Minister getting flayed from his left by Deputy McGrath and Deputy MacCarthy, and see the <i>entente cordiale</i> somewhat disturbed by the Minister attacking Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll. The peculiar thing is that in the discussion on this section the only contribution that appears to me to have any validity is that made by Deputy Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the only contribution that has any relevancy at all.  Unfortunately, when I was opposing Section 9.  Deputy Allen did not give me any help.  I was against Section 9.  I thought the income limits far too low.  I think the income limits in this section are also far too low.  I agree with Deputy Allen &mdash; and I intimated at the end of the discussion on Section 9 that I intended to put down an amendment in respect of the farmers' income limits on the Report Stage&mdash;that as between the two the limits under Section 9 are even more restricted than those under Section 10.</P>
      <P>I find some difficulty in understanding the viewpoint put forward by Deputy Murphy from Cork.  He said he was in favour of Section 9 and he said Section 10 was a very bad section. If one is in favour of Section 9, I believe one is bound to be equally in favour of Section 10.  I think both sections are wrong.  I think there is an overwhelming case for the point of view that I put forward on Section 9 and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll put forward on Section 10 for leaving the matter to the discretion of each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reply made by the Minister to Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll on this section was that he was thinking of a <Col N="1473" /> problem in respect of Dublin and that Dublin's was a peculiar problem, and the rest of the country could not be considered on the same lines and that there must be complete uniformity everywhere.  The Minister seems to have forgotten that, in this Bill which he has introduced, there are six different provisions in relation to Dublin as compared with the rest of the country.  If different provisions are relevant for Dublin and Cork&mdash;though I have already explained that I do not enter into discussions in connection with Cork&mdash;in this Bill, if there is a separate provision in regard to the small dwellings limits in Part VI for county boroughs, as apart from the rest of the country, and if it was proper for the Minister to introduce a separate provision in regard to small dwellings applications as set out in Part VI, why would it not be equally proper to sub-divide the limits as between people in the county boroughs and those in the country areas?  We all know it costs more to erect a house in a county borough than it does in a rural area.  The site costs a great deal more in a county borough.</P>
    <P>The more discussion that went on on this section and on these amendments the more it became perfectly clear that the case made against Section 9 was a good case and that the Minister should have accepted it just as I think he should accept the case now made in relation to Section 10.  Deputy O'Donnell raised a point that we have been discussing privately in relation to family income.  I do not know what sub-section (2) of Section 10 means. I am sure that if the Minister were to send that sub-section to the legal advisers of the various housing authorities that will draw up schemes under this Bill, all 27 of the county council legal advisers&mdash;to ignore for the moment urban councils and so forth&mdash; would give varying opinions as to what constitutes a family.  Is a family different from a household?  On one interpretation a family could be described as a unit living together in a home. If a man was a widower living with a son and intends to go into a new house with that son I think one could make a case under the wording of the section <Col N="1474" /> for including both the father's income and the son's income.  I do not think that is what we mean to do. The drafting is too loose.  If there is a young man living with his sister in a flat in Dublin and he intends to get married and wants to build a house of his own, under the section as it stands it would be possible to construe it as meaning that not merely should his income be taken into consideration on the date of the application but that his sister's income should also be calculated. The question arises then as to whether it is net or gross income.</P>
    <P>Taking the income limits in the section, £416 per annum is approximately £8 per week.  It is not exactly £8 per week because the Minister has taken a rough figure of 52 weeks and has overlooked the fact in his computation that there are 52 weeks and three days in a year.  Therefore, the £4 per week man does not go into the 100 per cent. grant.  He goes into the 62? per cent. grant.  Taking the man with £8 per week, one man earning that salary may be living at home with no expenses except travelling by bus to and from the city.</P>
    <P>You have another man who in order to earn £8 a week, has to travel around and spend a substantial sum in the way of expenses out of his £8.  Is it fair that these two people should be equated?  Surely the expenses which a man has to pay in travelling are a fair and proper deduction.  He can say, for example, as he can under the Income-tax Acts, that it is net income that should be counted when he is being considered for a supplemental grant under this section.</P>
    <P>It was suggested, by way of a remark that was passed across the House, that it was desirable to leave these things fairly loose for local authorities.  They are not being left loose for local authorities which are being tied up by this section.  It is the interpretation that is put on the section, and not the interpretation which a local authority may wish to put on it, that is going to govern the allocation of the grants.  I submit that it is entirely relevant to the discussion of amendment No. 9 to know what is meant by sub-section (2).  I would <Col N="1475" /> suggest that the proper way of dealing with sub-section (2) would be to include this in it, that income should be assessed in the same manner as it is assessed for the purposes of the Income-tax Acts.  If that were done, then whatever limit is ultimately arrived at, would have the effect of equating the case of the man who has no expenses in order to earn his living, with the man who has very heavy expenses, such as a traveller, in order to earn a living.  Some travellers are paid on a salary plus expenses basis, while others are paid upon an all-in total figure.  I want to ensure that they will be enabled to make a deduction that will meet their case.</P>
    <P>Let me put a simpler case to the Minister.  Will contributions to superannuation funds be taken into account when calculating income, or will it be the gross amount?  In the case of Córas Iompair Éireann men, there is a deduction at the source in respect of superannuation.  Will these men be entitled to take the superannuation figure off their income before they know whether they qualify for a grant under a local authority scheme under this section?  I want to know, further, will local authorities be entitled to make further restrictions if they wish, not by way of income but by way, for example, of residence?  Will a local authority be entitled to say that the scheme will be only open to residents in the local authority area?  If we could have an answer to that it would solve one of the troubles that was mentioned by Deputy Allen.  These are things which should have been put with greater clarity by the Minister in the Bill.  If they had been, then, while we might have differed on figures, at least we would have known what we were differing about, but at present it is impossible to understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter before the Report Stage.  We are pretty worried about the ceiling, not so much about the amount of the grants.  We are worried about the ceiling because it will be of no use at all <Col N="1476" /> in places like Cork City and suburbs. In view of the opinions which have been expressed, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter before the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would appeal to the Minister to reconsider it.  There is no hope at all of anyone with £4 or £6 or even £8 a week getting a loan to build a house.  In the County Kilkenny, the county secretary has to mind his own position and, unless he thinks a person will be able to repay a loan, he is not going to sanction it. The lowest income he is prepared to consider is £9 a week.  If a person cannot get a loan, there is no point in his getting the grant.  A man could not hope to build a house with the grant alone.  The Minister has stated himself that he feels these figures are too low.  If we all feel that way, it is only common sense to suggest that the Minister should amend the section on the lines suggested by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I think he should accept the general wish of the House on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne pointed out that he was a member of a local authority that had not adopted this scheme, and yet it had succeeded in lending over £4,000,000 to people in the County Dublin.  That would look as if, in some parts of the country, the building of houses by private persons was not influenced very much by this grant at all.  The argument has been made here that no person, under the scales set out, would qualify to get a loan under the Small Dwellings Acts. I know people who got loans under that Act, and they are not earning more than £4 a week.  I can prove that they were entitled to get the loan under that Act, and that their rents will be lower than if they had got a local authority house.  The argument has been made that these people would not be regarded as security by a county manager to get a grant under this.  The peculiar thing is that you have some of these people earning £4, £5 and £8 per week, and they are put into local authority houses at 25/- a week.  The local authority will collect the rent off them, and yet some <Col N="1477" /> Deputies argue that the same local authority or the county manager, would not regard them as security for a grant and would not give them a loan.</P>
      <P>When local authorities take the same responsibility for the ownership of houses built on the loans which they advanced under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, as they do for the houses built by themselves, there should be no difficulty about this. Deputies here were telling the House that there is no one on this scale who will get a loan.  No local authority would get a loan under the Small Dwellings Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe what Deputy Dunne has pointed out, that the County Dublin local authority has succeeded in advancing over £4,000,000 under the Small Dwellings Act, without the aid of any grant.  It shows there is little or no demand for these grants from local authorities at all.  In my long number of years in this House I never saw such a large number of Deputies anxious to put a burden on their own local authorities as I did this evening.</P>

      <P>Apart altogether from the limits imposed and whether or not they should be increased, no matter what the figure is, there is this objection.  I doubt if this system of the means test in the section will be workable for a loan.  I do not think it is fair to put such a tremendous administrative responsibility upon a local authority.  They are overburdened as it is.  The staffing question is becoming very acute in local authorities and to put anything of this nature on them would be intolerable. In rural areas it is very difficult in many cases to determine what the limits of the family income are, because they are spasmodic.  I cannot see it working at all.  There has been a discussion here as to whether or not loans come into it but anyone with a family income of less than £180 is bound to need a loan for the balance of the cost of the house, and I must say I am in agreement with the Deputies that it would be quite impossible for these persons to get a loan.  They would never get sureties which would be accepted. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 does not mean a thing as far as the building of a house is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to say in this section. First of all, as far as I can see, it is an attempt to repeal certain sections of the 1951 Act that were proved to be quite unworkable.  I know that in County Cork we tried to devise a scheme under these sections of the 1950 Act.  First of all, in regard to the scheme we devised we found it was so expensive that it was very difficult to operate it and the Minister and the Department refused to accept it.  To be quite honest we were quite glad that the <Col N="1479" /> Minister and the Department refused to accept it.  However, there should be a State grant for housing and if there is to be a grant for housing it should be a State grant and should begin and end with that.</P>
      <P>If the State believe that a supplementary grant should be given to certain classes of the community, then the State should include that in their original proposal and not say: &ldquo;This is what we are going to give to A, B, C and D, but if the local authority likes to do something else they can do it.&rdquo;  I believe that the subsidisation or the grants given for housing should be given from one authority and not make the whole position complicated and expensive in its administration.  It should be done from one centre and from one authority only.  That is a suggestion I would make to the Minister in regard to this section.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the Cork problem and I am trying to relieve myself of a charge that has been levelled against me that I refused to sanction the Cork Corporation or the Cork County Council scheme because of the amount of money involved or for any consideration other than a purely legal one.  That is why the Cork Corporation and the Cork County Council could not agree on this residence problem. The Cork County Council in their scheme stipulated that any applicant would have to be resident for at least six months in the county council area before he would be entitled to get a supplementary grant from the county council, with the result that you have this seesaw between the two authorities. Of course, while that situation lasted I could do nothing to solve the problem.  Since that is the position, there is no use in trying to pass it over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as if I were responsible for bringing that situation about. Deputy O'Donnell showed himself to be interested in a particular class of people who could be affected under Section 10.  I suggested to him that if he had remained to hear what I had to say on that point, and had not depended on what he was told by somebody else, he would perhaps have got a clearer view of what was in my mind. I did suggest that there might be the possibility of insurance.  I also suggested that in the case of self-employed persons the local body to which they <Col N="1481" /> had applied for a grant had a good deal of freedom in arriving at the items of income that could be properly regarded for the purpose of determining the amount of grant, if any, that each applicant should receive.  It is perhaps giving the local bodies a difficult task.  When Deputy Sweetman suggests that I should clarify this position, Deputy Sweetman should be one of the first to realise that perhaps it is better to leave it as it is than attempt to clarify something that would not be easy to clarify.  The local bodies, in regard to persons who are employed for wages, will have little difficulty. They will have some in regard to those who are self-employed.  I am conscious of what these difficulties are, but it is better that they should have that sort of general overriding discretion in determining questions of that nature.</P>

      <P>They are approaching this in a fairly liberal fashion and I think it is better that we should leave it at that.  My claim in regard to this section is exactly the same as I have made in regard to Section 9.  It is a conservative section.  Deputy Gallagher and other Deputies talk here&mdash; I have no objection to their talking&mdash; in terms of people who are building houses through the assistance of lending organisations of one kind or another. Some Deputies can only think in terms of building through loans. They seem to forget that there are people, even poor people, even when the grants were £80, who without loans at all, erected simple cottages.  There were simple cottages erected by people <Col N="1482" /> of the labouring class&mdash;not many, but some&mdash;without any loans at all.  Deputy Gallagher and those who think in terms of building houses through public utility societies and large advances, seem to forget that there are small farmers who, if you gave them the option of applying for a loan to the Land Commission towards the erection of a house or to the county council, through the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, that rather than charge their holding in that respect, they would scramble in one way or another and, with the assistance of a State grant plus a grant from a local authority, and the credit that they would obtain from traders who would know them, would endeavour to build the type of house that we have seen going up all over the country for the last 25 or 30 years.  I am not claiming that this will be done in any wholesale fashion. I know men on £4 a week who will do it.  To hear some Deputies speak on this matter you would think that we were removed, I do not know how far, from the problems of these rural people.</P>
      <P>What is contained in this section will be of no interest at all in Cork City, I am sure.  It will be of no interest to the type of men that Deputy McGrath, Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and other Deputies have in mind, but Sections 9, 10 and 11 will have some bearing, at any rate, upon the problem that we know in the rural parts.  Monaghan County Council, for instance, which is a neighbouring county of my own county, stipulate an income level of £4 a week for a man. The people who stipulated that income limit knew the problem with which they were dealing.  They knew that many of these people would not get a loan.  They knew that some of them would not, in fact, seek a loan but that they might get a site from some relative or other for nothing and that they might be able to put in a certain amount of their own labour.  The ways and means that can be adopted by country people with initiative and who are not, if you like, spoiled by this whole idea of loans and advances of that nature, are surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not claiming for this section anything more than it is.  I should <Col N="1483" /> have stated that the £4 which I have mentioned was stipulated as the amount earned by a man who would apply for a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.</P>
    <P>I am not recommending this section in the sense that it is a cure-all.  I can quite see that some Deputies, looking at this problem as it affects them in their own immediate locality, may find some disappointments in it.  I am trying not to look at it from the point of view of Cork City or Dublin City because in these big centres the problems to be contended with are not problems that can be solved by these sections at all.  Therefore, I regard these sections as designed and suitable only for a rural problem.</P>

      <P>I am admitting that.  I am saying Cork County the same as any other county, but I am talking about Dublin, Cork City, Limerick City and other big centres of population. I could not see in what way Section 10 would be of any use to the people who have to be catered for there.  The numbers who will be covered by this section are very small as compared with the numbers that will be covered by Section 11 or Section 9. We will come to Section 11 later.</P>
      <P>I must resist all these pleas that are being made to me to raise this limit and that limit.  I say that Section 9 is conservative.  I say that Section 10 is at least as generous to the classes that are catered for by it as is Section 9.  Taking the three sections as a whole, they are designed in that, if you like, conservative fashion in the hope that the different local authorities who adopted schemes under Section 7 of the 1950 Act, and who would not adopt schemes again, will be induced to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a position, as Minister, to say that a number of local authorities who adopted schemes under Section 7 of the Act of 1950 would not adopt schemes in future if an open section, such as Section 7 of the Act of 1950, <Col N="1484" /> was here included in this Bill.  I am sure that if such local authorities would not adopt a scheme, the councils who refused to adopt a scheme under Section 7 of the Act of 1950 would certainly not adopt a scheme under the conditions which it is sought to insert in this section.  The attitude of these local authorities is: Let the scheme, however conservative it is, be one under which we know the amount we shall have to provide and the amount of money we shall have to borrow each year in order to implement the scheme. Having regard to the knowledge I have of the attitude of bodies who adopted the scheme under Section 7 of the Act of 1950, and also of the attitude of councils who refused to adopt that scheme, I recommend these sections to the House, conservative and all as they may be, because I know that, by doing so, I am likely to get the framework of a scheme that will be acceptable to all.  At a later stage, in a year or two, if local authorities think that they should go a little further, this scheme can be amended and improved upon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned that this was a retrograde step.  The Deputy must remember that in this substitute for Section 7, I am providing for the payment of a supplementary grant in respect of the reconstruction of houses as well as for the erection of new houses.  That will also apply to the classes of people covered by Section 9 and those covered by Sections 10 and 11&mdash;the case of a man, say, who would buy out his cottage from a county council.  If his cottage requires improvement he can add a room to it.  If it is a three-roomed cottage, he will receive an £80 grant, a four-roomed cottage a £100 grant and five-roomed cottage a £120 grant, and the councils will be free to give him a supplementary grant as well.  That will apply to members of the working classes who are owners or tenants of houses all over the country.  That was not provided for in the section which this scheme is designed to replace.  It also covers the water supplies and sewerage provisions of this Bill.  Local authorities can also give an equivalent of the State grant to the classes mentioned here if they so desire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> Deputy Lehane has given expression to the view that it is not right that the grants should be divided up in this fashion and that whatever they are, they should be given by the one authority.  I suppose there is something to be said for that point of view, but there is also a good deal to be said for the point of view that the State in its efforts to encourage housing decides upon giving grants to all those who erect houses for themselves, irrespective of the classes to which they belong, or irrespective of the earning capacity of the people concerned.  It does that, not because it believes that all of them require that sort of assistance but in order to stimulate the provision of housing and as a general proof of the desire of the State to promote housing.  That need not be the approach of the local body.  The local body is nearer to the people it serves, and it can say: &ldquo;We can still take a step in that direction but we shall not go so far as the State has gone.  We shall provide only for those who, but for the State's generosity, would not be able to erect houses for themselves.  We will go a certain length towards assisting certain classes.&rdquo;  I do say that, while there does appear to be a case for the point of view of the State, there is on the other hand a very good argument for the other line of thought.</P>
    <P>I am not apologising for those sections at all even with all their limitations.  I am not saying that they will achieve wonders.  I do not think anything of the kind, especially in regard to the people who are covered by Section 10, because it is a little more generous in one way than Section 9 is in relation to the class for which it caters.  At the same time, I believe that the people covered by Section 9 will have somewhat better opportunities of taking advantage of the provisions of the section.  I do think, however, that I shall be able to convince local authorities&mdash;and they need to be convinced&mdash;that they are not being let in for something that would impose an almost intolerable burden on them.  We must establish that fact.  If we were to provide a wide open section saying that the income limit should be say £10,000, we <Col N="1486" /> could do all these things quite easily and wash our hands of the whole thing by saying to the local authorities: &ldquo;Did we not give you all the powers you wanted?&rdquo; If we wanted to wash our hands of the problem in that way, I could do it very easily, and get out of the House in about half the time we have spent on this Bill, but I do not think that would be the right thing to do.  It is because of that, and because I see other people's points of view, that I must insist upon the general scheme of things as outlined here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the length of the discussion on this section.  We were up against this problem in the Dublin Corporation and we decided that we would not make any grant at all.  We made no grant specially from the Dublin Corporation towards the building of houses.  The grant that is given in Dublin is the grant given by the Government.  One of the questions that we were afraid of when we discussed the problem was this: &ldquo;If we decide to pay £ for £ with the central authority and are going to give a grant of £275, who is going to benefit by it?&rdquo; We came to the conclusion, as a city council, representing all sections of the people, that the person who would benefit would not be the person whose house was being built, but the person who built the house for him.  We were very much afraid that, if we were to give a grant of £275 from the Dublin Corporation, that would go right into the pockets of the builders.  I think that was a reasonable point of view for the city council to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old Bill there was provision for this £ for a £ to be paid by local authorities.  It is interesting, however, to examine how many local authorities have failed to do that, how <Col N="1487" /> many local authorities have found that it is a successful way of dealing with it.  As the Minister says, there are two aspects.  I admit that I do not understand the Cork problem.  There may be a problem there peculiar to Cork. I do understand the problem so far as Dublin is concerned and so far as the ordinary rural area is concerned. Under the provisions of the Small Dwellings Act, 90 per cent. of the value of the house can be granted by way of loan if the house is value for the money, and if there is a Government grant of £275 and provision for a loan of 90 per cent. of the value the person whose house is being built need not put down one penny piece.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act, it is 90 per cent. of the value of the house. I am not concerned about how it is interpreted by certain local authorities or certain local engineers.  I am concerned about what the law is and the law says 90 per cent. of the value of the house, and our trouble is the question of value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. I do not know how value is determined, but I do know that if we are to give out money from the central authority and to give out £ for £ from the local authority somebody will get value out of it, but it is not the owner of the house.  That is what I am afraid of. As I say, in Dublin City we decided that if houses are built and are good value for the money paid for them, and if there is a Government grant of £275 and a 90 per cent. advance under the Small Dwellings Act, no money at all should be paid by the individual in cash for the house.  I have always maintained that in Dublin it is desirable that the person whose house is being built, who is getting a Government grant of £275 and a 90 per cent. advance under the Small Dwellings <Col N="1488" /> Act should have some little stake in that house to the extent of £75, £100 or £150.</P>
      <P>If we look at the problem in a reasonable way we will find that within this section there is an effort to prevent what one might term avoidable waste.  That is what I see in the section. It might be better if, instead of putting it in the way it is in the section, the Minister said that the local authority may grant a sum not exceeding £125 in addition to the Government grant under such conditions as they may prescribe themselves. On reading the section, I considered that the idea behind it was to have some sort of uniformity right through the country, some sort of guidance, some encouragement to certain local authorities who are providing nothing at all to give some additional grant.  That is the way I read the section.  I thought it was the Minister's intention to bring about some system of uniformity and to encourage councils who did not provide money to provide it.  If that is so, then it is undoubtedly desirable.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the problem of the house built in the rural areas which is not built in the way a house is built in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or any other city, where a man and his relatives or friends help to build it.  In parts of the country that I know of, under the suggestion made here, with the Government grant and a local authority grant, a house can be erected in that way which would not cost a penny piece to the individual.</P>

If the house is good and proper value the applicant can get 90 per cent. of a loan under that Act.  If the applicant gets £275 from the local authority he has not to pay one penny piece for the purpose of becoming the owner of that house, and he pays the 90 per cent. back in instalments over a period of 35 years. There is nothing unreasonable in that.</P>

      <P>I, too, am a member of a local authority, the Dublin Corporation.  That local authority has had to face this problem.  It is a big problem.  We said we would not grant one penny piece other than the £275 given by the central authority and nobody can say that that is holding up house building in Dublin.  What is really wanted in relation to this matter is a little bit of common sense.  The Minister has told us the difficulties he had with local authorities in Cork and elsewhere.  He is endeavouring here to get some uniformity and to encourage local authorities to give a grant in addition to the relevant grant described in the Act.  I think that is desirable.  I think the Minister ought to get an opportunity of testing it by experience.  What the amendment seeks to do is really to go back to the provision in the last Act of giving £275, a provision that was not availed of by local authorities and <Col N="1491" /> was in fact a complete and utter failure.</P>

      <P>I am sorry this debate has been so protracted but I cannot leave it without referring to the attitude adopted by Deputy Captain Cowan.  He is a member of the Dublin Corporation.  I give that body full credit for doing their work in their own excellent way.  There is no necessity, however, for Deputy Captain Cowan to come in here and try to tell other members of local authorities, who are also trying to do their best, that they do not understand what they are doing or try to put legal implications into amendments that are far removed from such implications in actual reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan came in here to defend the Minister.  He does not have to do that.  We had a very interesting discussion prior to Deputy Captain Cowan's entry into the debate and we listened to each other's viewpoint patiently and attentively.  Deputy Captain Cowan found this a suitable opportunity to adopt the rôle of leading counsel for the defence.  Even under the 1950 Act local authorities were not compelled to give a grant equivalent to the Government grant. The phrase used was that they may make such a grant.  They were not compelled to make it.  We are not now asking that they should be compelled to make it.  Deputies should consider the attitude of a member who tells us about the lovely houses he saw in the West of Ireland which were built <Col N="1492" /> through neighbourly love and the comrades coming together after their day's work was done to build the houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that in order to qualify for the grant of £275 the applicant must build the house to a certain standard and the house must conform to certain specifications. Is it right for a Deputy to suggest that neighbours coming together in their spare time in the evening can build a house which will be in conformity with the standards required by the Department in order to qualify for a grant?  I know of cases where neighbours co-operated to build a cottage. One will travel long distances in the country before one will find a sufficient number of trained operatives to build a house in conformity with the standards set.</P>
      <P>This amendment gives full freedom to the local authority to give 100 per cent. grant if it wishes.  If there is a Government grant of £200 the local authority may give a grant of £200.  They are not compelled to give it.  Day after day in the rural areas we hear complaints of lack of initiative and restrictions on local government.  Give us local government. Give local authorities the freedom they ask for.  It will not be abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a discussion on the limits.  Can we get down to sub-section (2) to try to see if we can evolve something which means more or that expresses better what is in our minds than the phrase that is here in the sub-section?  I pointed out to the Minister earlier the different ways and the possibilities of the different ways in which this sub-section could be construed and could be interpreted by different local authorities and their advisers throughout the country.  The Minister's answer to that is that it is better to give freedom. The sub-section does not give freedom.  It is not the way in which the members of the local authorities want to interpret it which is going to count but the way in which the particular legal adviser construes the words.  We have heard time and time again from the non-legal members of this House that it is very undesirable to make difficulties which the legal gentlemen have to be brought in to solve.  It is a good principle when that case is put forward and it should be put forward in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, all that it is going to do is to raise complications, raise ambiguities, raise doubts.  It is a section that can be drafted quite simply.  First of all, we want to discover what number of persons earning money the Minister intends to include.  The second thing we want to discover is whether it is to be gross income or net income.  I put specific cases to the Minister before; for instance, the case of the man who, as a commercial traveller, has to pay very heavy travelling expenses, who is paid, perhaps, on a flat commission basis, which commission includes his earnings in the ordinary lay sense of the term, <Col N="1495" /> plus the expenses that he has to pay going through the country, the expenses of his motor, his petrol, oil and so forth, and his hotel expenses.  Some travellers are paid by way of salary and expenses; others are paid by way of one gross salary figure, which is intended to cover both expenses and earnings.  Which is going to be taken in this case?  Which does the Minister wish to be taken in this case? Personally, I feel it would be much better, whether we agree or disagree about the actual figure of the limit, that we should take the net limit of the person's income, because, generally, you will be fairly equating all people within the ambit of any scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as the family income is concerned, we should make it clear beyond question that what we are considering is purely the incomes of the person who is buying the house and his wife.  In considering the limits that are laid down by this section, I do not think it is right that a father who has a grown-up son who is about to be married, and who is living with the father at the date of the application, earning wages at the date of the application, should have his son's wages added to his income if the father is making application to build a house for himself.  When the house comes to be built, that young man would probably be going off to make his own home elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What we ought really to consider is the income of the people that are going to the new home.  The income that is going to be received in that way is the income that is going to be available for the repayment of the loan, for the repayment of the expenses in the building of the house.  We might have correct knowledge of the means as assessed on a particular date, and within a week or a month the means change altogether.  Clearly in an application like this we must take the date of the application; there is nothing in this section to suggest what date should be taken.  You could either take the date of the application, the date on which the house was commenced, the date upon which the <Col N="1496" /> departmental grant was allocated, or you could almost take any other date that you wish up to the date on which the grant was ready to be paid.  That is an example of bad drafting.  The Minister will say that he wants to leave those things to county councils.  Under the section, as drafted, I do not think the housing authority can contravene the terms of the section, and you come back again, therefore, to getting one of my fraternity to determine for each of the county councils what the section permits the local authority to do.  If you want to leave all these things such as what &ldquo;family&rdquo; means, such as what &ldquo;income&rdquo; means, such as what date is relevant, to the particular housing authority, you have a very simple way of doing it, and that is, to substitute instead of sub-section (2), as it stands here, something to the effect that the family income, relevant date, and so forth, are such as shall be determined by the housing authority in the scheme which it draws up.  Then each housing authority can do it in their own way, in their own scheme, and nobody can come along and say afterwards that what they have done is in contravention of this section and is, therefore, something that has made the scheme void or invalid.</P>
    <P>Certainly, as it is, it does not achieve what the Minister has stated he wants to achieve, to leave freedom to the local authority.  If that is what he wants to do, then let us put a sub-section in the section giving that freedom and it will save, as I say, a lot of heartburnings and a lot of decisions in different areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this section is concerned, I agree with its general principles, that it is desirable to protect both the local authority and the local ratepayer from what might be an excessive charge.  The scheme, as we know, under the 1950 Act, did not operate successfully and there is a reasonable attempt made here to bring in a scheme that will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as sub-section (2) is concerned, it would not be desirable to leave too much pickings to the legal profession.  I would like the Minister to look carefully into it, but I do not entirely agree with Deputy Sweetman <Col N="1497" /> that it is not quite clear, as far as the date is concerned.  As I read it, it provides for the family income for the year ending on the date of such application, so that the year will date back from the date of the application.  With regard to the question of family, it is quite clear that the meaning is the family of the applicant, that is, his wife and sons and daughters.  It might be no harm to clarify it to a certain extent to avoid difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman is, perhaps, overemphasising this matter.  Some similar problems arise for local authorities in assessing income under other schemes. For example, there is a scholarship scheme in practically all counties which is based on a means test and for which there is a qualification in regard to income.  The local authority or the officials of the local authority have to ascertain the income of the applicant or, in the case of a scholarship, the income of the applicant's parents.  So far as I know, they have not had any great legal difficulty in arriving at the income in these cases.  I admit that there may be more money involved in regard to schemes under this section, but the same principle operates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also disagree with this section.  It is nearly impossible to set forth conditions which will be fair to everybody.  As I said earlier, in those circumstances the fairest way to deal with this matter is to throw it wide open to everybody.  At present, there is great anxiety to have better <Col N="1498" /> houses and more houses built.  That is one of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill.  Every house that is built adds to the existing pool of houses.  We have a housing shortage.  Where it is so difficult to assess the exact contribution that the local authority should make to the individual, justice is best served by giving an over-all payment. In that connection, if the section is to stand, £204 is far too small an amount. It should be a larger amount.</P>
      <P>In connection with the section as a whole, I mentioned earlier that I thought a fairer way of dealing with the question of differentiation between various persons applying for the grant would be to do it on the basis of square feet.  I suggested 1,150 square feet&mdash; that any house over that would come in either for a smaller grant or for no grant at all.  I would ask the Minister to examine that suggestion.  I am seriously thinking of introducing an amendment on the Report Stage on those lines, but I would like the Minister to consider it.  It would shut out the higher income groups, who look for a larger house, from the full benefits of the grant, that is, if the Minister thinks such a differentiation is advisable. Personally, I do not think so, but I object to the section and am opposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell is objecting to this section on grounds that have already been decided by a vote of the House.  I have no objection, since the general question is being decided now as to income limits, to re-examining this section, especially sub-section (2).  It has been very carefully gone into.  We appreciate that it is something that it is not easy to provide for clearly.  We feel that the sub-section leaves with the local body, as it is right it should leave, the responsibility.  It does not give it to them definitely nor does it debar them from using that responsibility and determining these questions in their own way.  It is not any more difficult than, in fact, it is not as difficult as, the operation of a differential renting system.  I am not saying that that may be an argument in its favour, but I am saying that, if they can operate from week to week and month to month, a <Col N="1499" /> difficult renting system, I do not see why they should not be able to operate this also.  I have no hesitation in giving the House the assurance that I will have this examined again.</P>
      <P>I do not see any possibility of mentioning a net or gross income, because I think there are dangers in doing either.  For example, I see that there are certain things that a local body would want to make allowance for.  In the case of a traveller who has certain expenses, the local authority should have regard to those expenses in determining the man's income, but there are other expenses, mentioned by Deputy Sweetman, that, in my view, the local authority should not take into account in the same way.</P>

I do not think that should be regarded as an item that should be deducted.  It is dangerous to mention either gross or net and, no matter what examination is made here, Deputies will find that it is best to leave it, difficult as it is, to the local authority itself.</P>
      <P>They have to decide many cases that are equally difficult and I have no doubt they will be able to come to a decision in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that I regret the necessity of having to raise this matter on the Adjournment and to bring <Col N="1500" /> the Minister for Agriculture in here at this late hour.  I know he is a busy man and he has a big Department to look after, but this is a matter of very great importance which has aroused the deepest interest amongst all sections of the community.  It is because I wish to put certain facts and points of view before the Minister and before our people that I have taken this step.  I think the Minister has said that he has not seen the necessity for ordering a cessation or a prohibition of this trade.  I shall just briefly go over some of the facts which have come to light.</P>
      <P>In February, 1951, the s.s. <i>Clarina</i> left Limerick for Birkenhead carrying 71 horses on board.  When it arrived at Birkenhead 21 horses had died on board, seven had to be shot and one died on the quayside.  That is 29 horses out of 71 died as a result of the voyage.  That aroused wide public interest and indignation at the time. Unfortunately that is not an isolated instance.  Many other instances have occurred.  During the winter months on every voyage some horses have died.  I say without fear of contradiction that you cannot transport horses across water, especially during the winter time without causing them cruelty.  Horses, when they become seasick cannot vomit and apparently suffer very greatly as a result.  Then when they arrive at foreign ports they are subjected in many cases to rough handling.  They are spoken to, first of all, in a language they do not understand. Perhaps that does not involve very great cruelty or hardship but still it is something that is not very pleasant for these animals, nearly all of which are accustomed to being gently cared for and well handled.  Irish folk generally are kind to their animals and many of them are very great horse lovers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases these horses are herded into trucks on arrival at foreign ports.  I might cite one case where a consignment of horses was brought to Paris, and eye-witnesses saw the trucks being opened up.  The very unpleasent conditions inside these trucks have been graphically described by one gentleman.  He saw a stallion on the ground with a number of other horses <Col N="1501" /> on top of it and milling about.  The animal was beaten to its feet, and it was seen that its hindquarters were severely damaged.  These cases have been attested, and the details have appeared in the <i>Manchester Guardian.</i> At the present moment a series of articles in regard to the same matter are appearing in the <i>Irish Times.</i> Similar testimoney has been given by a number of other people, for instance, by a Mrs. Edkins, who went across and described the conditions there, and a Mr. Crowe, who also saw what happened. These witnesses have testified to the rough handling and cruelty to which the horses were subjected.  Then the conditions in the abattoir at Vaugirard baffle description.  Mares in foal have been brought in there and killed.  Photographs were taken, one of which showed the foetus of a foal lying on the ground.  We do not know whether that belonged to an Irish animal, but we know that Irish horses have been brought there.  We know from that photograph and other photographs that the authorities at Vaugirard are not so squeamish or soft-hearted as to refuse to slaughter mares in foal.  These conditions have been attested.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister himself recognised last July that hardship and cruelty existed because he brought in an Order that ships carrying horses were not to sail in rough weather, that mares in foal were not to go, and that the animals were to have the shoes taken from their hind feet so that they would not injure one another.  That in itself shows, in the first place, that the Minister is more soft-hearted in this matter than perhaps he realises himself, and also that he and his officials recognise that a certain amelioration of the conditions is necessary.  I would add in connection with these reports which have shocked so many people, that one particular case related to an incident in an abattoir outside London, where an electric pump was used on half-killed horses.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised in the House of Commons, and the Minister for Food, Major Lloyd George, did not deny it.  That, in itself, is an indication of the accuracy of the statements in these <Col N="1502" /> articles.  It is very difficult to get complete proof of anything but when you have a number of people testifying to the same thing and when you have a Minister standing up in his own Parliament accepting statements made in a series of parliamentary questions, it is a very great pointer to the fact that the statements in those articles are accurate.</P>
    <P>What is the remedy for this condition? The remedy is to stop the export of live horses for slaughter.  I would not be foolish enough to ask the Minister to take a step like that if it meant an enormous loss in revenue to this country, but I do not believe that there will be any loss of revenue.  On the contrary, I believe that the present method of exporting horses on the hoof is not only cruel but is extremely wasteful.  I see no reason, and those engaged in the trade itself see no reason, why we should not set up a dressed carcase trade in Ireland.  Then we could see that our horses are slaughtered in a proper condition under our own control and we could make the necessary regulations to see that the meat is dealt with properly and exported labelled plainly as horse meat.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture seem to have the idea that if we had a dressed carcase trade in horse meat it would interfere with the beef trade.  I fail to see that.  The continental buyers in the meat trade know perfectly well the difference between beef and horse flesh, even if there were people dishonest enough to attempt to sell horse flesh as beef.  When you look at the retail end of the trade, in France and Belgium horse flesh is sold in special shops so that the likelihood of its damaging our beef trade is quite unlikely.  Then there is the further fact that in sending horses on the hoof we lose the valuable by-products that that trade would bring us.  It has been said in fact that we are extremely foolish not to do this trade ourselves.</P>
    <P>People are asking why a trade which is so abhorrent to the great majority of our country folk should be carried on.  I think it started with inertia, then vested interests, then the fear of interfering with any of our other meat trades.  This is held by <Col N="1503" /> competent people in the food business as being something which would not occur.  At any rate, this trade is going on at the rate of 700 horses a week.  The country is being denuded of horses and there is a very real danger that we may find ourselves without sufficient horses, which would be a very serious matter if another war broke out.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of money being made out of this trade. I understand that there is a non-national of this country making over £1,000 a week out of it.  I do not mind anybody making £1,000 a week but I do not think the fair name of this country should be taken away for the sake of a handful of people who are making money when really a large amount of employment could be given if the trade were handled in a logical as well as in a humane fashion. That is the way I should like the Minister to deal with this matter, to encourage the setting up of a dressed meat trade and bring in an Order somewhat on the lines of the Order in other countries prohibiting the export of horses under £80 in value and horses over 15 years of age.  That is one method of dealing with it, but it is only a partial method.</P>
    <P>This is not an agitation by a number of cranks.  It has really reached serious proportions.  Animal lovers feel very deeply on this subject.  The matter has been raised in other countries as well as here.  We do run the risk of losing our reputation for the sake of a trade which we do not really agree with and which none of us feel is right.  I ask the Minister to bear my plea in mind and to realise that this feeling is very widespread all over Ireland.  It is not a matter of an agitation by a few Dublin people. Every part of Ireland is concerned in this and all our people will thank the Minister if he will put an end to this horrible trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the fact that the officials of this country are doing their job in an efficient manner in examining the animals going out of the country, but I should like to draw the <Col N="1504" /> Minister's attention to the fact that once these horses are shipped the officials have no further control over the conditions which they have to go through before they are finally slaughtered.  Surely the articles which have been published were not written without having some foundation in fact?  The export of 700 horses a week out of Ireland will leave us in a critical condition if we are faced with an emergency in which we will be unable to get oils and petrol, etc., to run machinery. The Minister should stop the export of these horses.</P>
      <P>In the light of the evidence, we must accept the fact that there is considerable cruelty in the slaughter of these horses on the Continent.  If we are to sell horses for the purpose of human consumption, and the consumption of horse fiesh is not a new thing in Europe, why not slaughter them at home?  They can be slaughtered here under the eyes of the departmental inspectors in humane conditions without taking a shilling out of the pocket of any Irish citizen.  If we had a factory here for the dressing of horse meat, the horse dealers who are buying these horses for export would still have to buy the horses just as the pig dealers buy pigs for the bacon factories.  I can see no reason why we should not have a factory here, and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  After all, it would give employment here, the by-products would be useful, and it would put an end to what we all feel is to a certain extent against the wishes of the Irish people.  Anyone who has been in any way associated with horses has a high regard and a great love for them. We have a tradition for breeding the best horses in the world.  The draught blood is the real blood behind the hunter and our hunters are famous throughout the world.  That draught blood is now being exported out of the country every week.  I would ask the Minister to stop the export of horses and arrange to have them slaughtered here instead.</P>

      <P>The ground has been very adequately covered by the Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  There is one point I would <Col N="1505" /> like to emphasise.  Public indignation is not merely demanding the cessation of this trade.  It is suggesting that the Government should ensure that a perfectly sound reasonable commercial alternative is adopted.  Let there be no mistake about it.  If the continental countries are prepared to pay us £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 a year for our horses, they are making a great deal more profit over and above that sum. That profit can be made here.</P>
      <P>I believe that the root of this whole problem is a misunderstanding of it and a fear in relation to our beef trade, a fear that is wholly unjustified.  We have been fortunate enough so far in this country not to have found it necessary to eat horse flesh.  Horse flesh on the Continent is an established fact, and I have here a price list from France which shows that first-quality horse flesh is sold at a higher price than is beef at the present time.  We could definitely establish this trade ourselves. That could be done without any danger whatsoever to our beef trade.</P>

      <P>I doubt very much if I can go into this question as fully as I would like to in the time at my disposal. There has been a certain agitation here for a number of years in relation to the export of horses, and certain people have voiced objections to such an export.  I wonder if those who object to that export can really put forward a reasonable case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the articles that appeared in the <i>Manchester Guardian.</i> So far as I know there was no evidence of cruelty either on board or on rail, no more cruelty that can be witnessed at any fair down the country.  One animal was described as coming in a lorry from Galway.  A description was given of her being loaded on the boat, taken to Dieppe, placed in a railway wagon there in the very same way in which the animal would have been treated if it had been travelling by rail here.  This particular case has been held out as evidence of cruelty. <Col N="1506" /> I wonder what is behind all this.  On several occasions during the past 12 months questions have been addressed to me in relation to the export of horses.  I have answered those questions. I want to know what the objecttions are.  Is it an objection to the transport of the horses?  Is it an objection as to alleged cruelty in the boats?</P>

Once these horses leave the country we have no further responsibility for them just as we have no responsibility for our sheep and cattle shipped to other countries. Are certain people trying to place horses in a higher sphere as compared with sheep or cattle?  That is something with which I would never agree. I have heard of &ldquo;Minstrel Girl&rdquo;.  I have also heard of &ldquo;Mary's lamb&rdquo;. Is there any difference between the two?  Which is the greater pet?  You have lovers of horses, lovers of cows, lovers of sheep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested at all.  I am talking about the cruelty, we are told, exists in the transport of <Col N="1507" /> horses.  We have been told there is cruelty in France.  We have heard nothing about cruelty in England, but I saw an article in this morning's paper stating that an electric pump is used on horses in England.  Yet, France is the only country held up to us by these horror-stricken people, because of the way horses are slaughtered there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the people who are talking here that are concerned. It is the farmers down the country who, if the export of horses is stopped, will lose £30 or £40 per animal.  My concern is for the farmer and not for anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the argument they used when they sold slaves during the slave trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Dockrell compare a horse to a slave, a human being?  If he does, then that clarifies the position.  Is there any difference between a horse, cow or a sheep?  Let us be clear about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are exporting cattle, and at times we have greater losses in cattle in exportation than we have in horses.  The same is true of sheep. But there is no one to stand up here and make a protest in relation to those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger of a dressed meat trade in relation to horses is that we have over a number of years built up an export trade for our cattle and for carcase and processed meat.  There is nothing to prevent an evil-minded <Col N="1508" /> person, if we go into the horse-dressed meat trade, producing horse meat and selling it in continental countries, or even in Britain, as prime Irish beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter whether she would or would not.  We will not run the risk, just because there are people here who believe that there is unnecessary cruelty in relation to horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been among horses for 40 years.  I have met good horses and bad horses.  I have met as many horses as one could possibly meet.  I have a great regard for them, but I have no greater regard for them than I have for the cow.  To me they are both animals, and people who try to place one in a different category from the other leave me with very little regard for what they say.  If there is cruelty in the transport of horses there is also cruelty in the transport of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Stop the cruelty then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been established that there is cruelty.  It has been agreed here, even by Deputy Dockrell, that, in one case, there were 28 casualties on a particular boat.  That boat, the <i>Clarina,</i> should have been at sea for 24 hours.  Because of a storm, she was at sea for 70 hours.  I have shown that the mortality statistics are very low.  It seems strange that we should adopt this attitude in relation to horses, but not in relation to other animals or to human beings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not send human beings away for slaughter.  We merely send them away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a way of dealing with this matter.  If certain people believe there is cruelty in the slaughter of horses why do they not make representations through their own organisation to the French <Col N="1509" /> authorities in order to have that cruelty minimised if it does exist?  As Minister for Agriculture I am responsible for seeing that the farmers get the best prices they can, and I will certainly not do something which would reduce the prices they are getting for their horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that there is even now a shortage of horses and the small farmer finds it very difficult to buy an ordinary working horse and he has to pay a great deal more for such an animal than he did in the past.  The Minister's argument, therefore, cuts both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that for every tractor that comes into the country three horses go off the land.  Farmers <Col N="1510" /> are not in a position to keep tractors and horses at the same time and the tendency is to go in more for mechanisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be sorry for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but that is the tendency.  Even our small farmers are going in for mechanisation. Will any Deputy get up here and say that the farmer must take a lesser price for his horses than he is getting at the present time?  If the export of horses is stopped the price of horses will be reduced from £45 to £30 and less.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19th June, 1952.</P>
