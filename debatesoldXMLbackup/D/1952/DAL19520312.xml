The selection of the Rahan area for development under the scheme has been considered by the board on a number of occasions.  The area has not so far been selected for development as its financial return is low in comparison with that of other areas. It is not possible at this stage to say when the development of the area is likely to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information other than that given in the Press reports of the meeting to which the Deputy has referred.  The gentleman concerned is actively engaged in hotel operation and his membership of the Irish Tourist Board is on a part-time basis.  The Irish Tourist Board, as such, has no function in the matter of relations between hoteliers and their employees.  It does not appear that the member concerned spoke as a member of the board or attempted to convey that the views expressed by him were shared by the board.  In these circumstances, I do not consider that I am obliged to take official notice of his remarks.</P>

On this matter generally I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of 27th February last and, in particular, to the last paragraph thereof in which I stressed that in many cases the provisions made by way of Supplementary Estimate are drawn upon only in the final weeks of the financial year.  It is, in fact, only within a day or two of the close of the financial year that the total amount to be issued from each Vote can be accurately assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the sum of £200,000 appears as a charge against Exchequer tax revenue for the year 1951-52 in the recently published Estimates for Public Services, 1952-53 (Vote 27, sub-head M (10), in view of the Government's decision to defray whatever charge might come in course of payment in the financial year 1951-52 in respect of this service out of the $1,000,000 grant counterpart moneys, pursuant to the project put forward by the Government to the E.C.A. and publicly endorsed by Mr. Millar, E.C.A. Administrator in Ireland, early in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Projects involving the utilisation of grant counterpart require the approval of the United States Government in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the Economic Co-operation Agreement between Ireland and the United States of America.  Approval has not yet been obtained for the use of grant counterpart for the payment of ground limestone subsidy and, accordingly, the cost of the scheme in 1951/52 has fallen directly upon the Exchequer.  Approval of the scheme by the United States authorities will enable the cost to be recovered from grant counterpart, which will be brought to account as an Extra Exchequer Receipt.  Acceptance of the project by the United States authorities will not obviate the necessity for making provision for it in the Estimate for Agriculture, as has been done in the 1952/53 Volume of Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know why an item of £200,000 is made to appear in the Book of Estimates as a charge against tax revenue in respect of the year 1951-52.  The answer is that the United States Government has not yet consented to make available money which would render the insertion of this charge in that place unnecessary. I am asking the Minister, and I think I am entitled to know, whether the failure to get that approbation from the United States Government is due to any laziness on our part or any dilatoriness on the part of the United States E.C.A. administration.  Further, in view of the legislation of January 8th passed by the United States Congress terminating E.C.A., is it now possible to get the consent of E.C.A. to the project submitted by the Irish Government inasmuch as E.C.A. is no longer in existence?

      <P>The amount of pay and allowances payable at the time of his death to Captain William Ryan was £692 per annum, plus 5/- a day flying pay, plus 1/- a day children's allowance, making a total of £801 10s. 0d. per annum.  An annual uniform allowance of £30 was also payable.</P>
      <P>Allowances of £90 per annum for herself and £16 per annum for each of her six children, that is £186 in all, are now payable under the Army Pensions Acts to his widow, who also received a gratuity of £340 under the Defence Forces pensions scheme.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that if any progress is to be made with business it will be necessary for the House to meet on Tuesdays, and that the Government could not agree to any arrangement which did not involve Tuesday meetings.  The only question that requires to be decided is whether the hours of meeting on Thursdays should be the normal hours from 3 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., or whether they should be 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.  So far as that question is concerned, while the members of the Government would normally find it more convenient to meet from 3 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., an investigation carried out by our Whips suggested that the great majority of Deputies <Col N="1915" /> would prefer to meet on Thursdays from 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.  We are prepared to agree to that, but there is no possibility of forgoing the meetings on Tuesdays.</P>

      <P>If progress is not made on a Friday, then I cannot understand how it can be made on the same hours on a Thursday.  This proposal is put before the House without any explanation being given to the House in an orderly and systematic way as to what the reasons are for sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday instead of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I submit that, while the <Col N="1916" /> Tánaiste may be a little bit innocent in regard to his ideas of progress, the fact is that it does not suit Deputies coming from the country to come up here on a Tuesday.  It means that they have to start on a Monday and that, instead of being able to discharge an amount of their business in the early part of the week, they have to come up here and then try to get back in time to wind up the work which they had to break off on Monday.  This matter has been very carefully considered by our Party, and we are entirely of the view that, except a four days' sitting is required by Government business, we should not sit on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies understand, of course, that under Standing Orders the House should meet on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of every week.  Normally, when business does not warrant it, we do not meet on a Tuesday, but no motion is required to get the House to meet on a Tuesday or Friday.  This motion arises because there was a general view that if we were going to meet on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday it would be preferable to meet during the hours set out in the motion than during the hours prescribed by Standing Orders. So far as the Government is concerned, they are prepared to let that matter be settled by a majority of the House&mdash; that is the hours of meeting on Thursday. Our inquiry elicited the information that a very substantial majority of Deputies would prefer to meet during those hours on Thursday rather than the hours prescribed by Standing Orders.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Act, 1952&mdash;First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Act, 1951, sets out to provide that an agricultural worker will get a half-holiday in each week; that <Col N="1919" /> he will not suffer any financial loss as a result of getting the half-holiday and that if he is willing to remain at work instead of taking the half-holiday, he will receive fair compensation.  The Act, however, in attempting to secure the attainment of these objects, creates a number of difficulties.  I will not go into detail about all these difficulties but I will mention one of them in particular; it is that the Act prescribes minimum rates of half-holiday remuneration both in respect of and in lieu of a half-holiday but it makes no attempt to reconcile these rates with the existing practice in regard to the payment of wages and overtime.  Since the Act came into operation, I know that it has caused a lot of confusion in the minds of both workers and employers as to what exactly their rights and obligations are under it.  I propose, therefore, to introduce very soon a new Bill which will, I hope, remove the confusion and the difficulties.  I also intend to make the Agricultural Wages Board responsible for the administration of the Act.  The present Act.  I might mention, confers no power on the board in regard to its enforcement beyond the dubious power of prescribing rates of half-holiday remuneration, dubious because one section of the Act itself sets about doing the same thing in Section 2, sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>I might remark that when this Bill was introduced on an earlier occasion there was nobody to take responsibility for it.  The Minister who should have taken responsibility ran away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, just wait a minute. If I am going to be blamed I am joining in this.  All that is permissible is a short statement on the Bill.  That poor yokel sat on the Front Bench and he was afraid to either go up or go down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon refused to take responsibility with the result that there was nobody to move the Money Resolution.  The Bill was consequently inoperative.  Of course, the Labour Party went ahead with it.  That shows the futility of private members introducing a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  The Minister has spoken here of the futility of private members introducing Bills.  Surely it is the privilege of members to introduce Bills. Surely that remark is out of order as well as the content of the Minister's statement, which is not in accordance with Standing Orders dealing with a speech on the First Reading of a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister disapproves of Private Deputies introducing Bills, the matter does not arise on this and he can express himself on it in some other way on another occasion.  He should confine himself at the moment specifically to a statement on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the point that was raised, I think the Minister's reference was obviously to the futility of a private member introducing a Bill which requires a Money Resolution for its implementation, a Money Resolution which can only be moved by a Minister.</P>

    <P>As the House is aware the Dáil is asked for a Vote on Account each year in order that Government Services should not be brought to a standstill for want of funds.  Moneys granted by the Dáil are granted only for the service of a particular financial year and, therefore, are not available for use the following year.  Accordingly, until such time as the Estimates for 1952-53 have been examined and passed by the House, there must be some arrangement for the carrying on of the necessary business of the Government.  It is the practice, therefore, to obtain by way of Vote on Account enough money to enable the public services to be carried on from the 1st April until about 31st July by which date it is anticipated that the Appropriation Act will have been passed.</P>
    <P>The amount we provide in the Vote on Account is roughly one third of the total of the Estimates.  This is subject, however, to variation in individual cases according as to whether payments are expected to be heavier or lighter in the part of the year covered by the Vote on Account.  This year the amount asked for is, as I have said, £33,140,340.  The total amount, however, of the Estimates for the Supply Services for the coming year is £94,871,623.  The amount originally provided for the Supply Services, according to the volume of Estimates for last year, 1951-52, was £83,036,048.  This year's figure accordingly shows an increase of £11,835,575.  As I proceed, however, I hope that I shall satisfy the Dáil that the actual cost of the services for the coming year as compared with this current one will be much less than that figure and that the true explanation for the apparent increase is to be found in the fact that the provision for the public services, contained in the volume of Estimates submitted to the Dáil and the people by our predecessors in Government, was greatly inadequate and, I am bound to say, in my view, deliberately misleading.</P>
    <P>To avoid confusion in discussing this question, I shall continue to compare <Col N="1929" /> the original Estimate for 1951-1952 with those in the new volume but, as I go along, I shall qualify this in individual cases by referring to the Supplementary Estimates taken during this year.  I shall begin by referring to the major increases and explain how they have come about.  The largest increase is one of £3,857,000 on the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  The principal elements in this increase are food subsidies which are responsible for £2,737,000.  The figure for Bord na Móna is £377,000 and that for Foras Tionscal £250,000.  The £450,000 included for rural electrification in this year's volume of Estimates is due to a reversion to the procedure abandoned by our predecessors of discharging the subsidy for rural electrification according as it arose.</P>
    <P>The previous Government thought fit to meet this subsidy by way of an annuity charge over 50 years.  Since it is believed that at least 50 per cent. of the expenditure on rural electrification will never be remunerative, there is no justification for spreading that fraction of the cost of this work over half a century.  Moreover, even if the expenditure were fully remunerative, sound engineering economics, based on the practical experience of the probable lifetime of the works and structures involved, would require the cost to be amortised within a very much shorter period.</P>
    <P>The comparisons I have made are with the original Estimate for Industry and Commerce for 1951-52.  This was found inadequate, however, in relation to requirements that it was necessary to introduce first a Supplementary Estimate for £3,079,995 to meet undischarged fuel losses.  As the Dáil is aware, by far the greater portion of these losses arose in the years preceding this year.  These losses ought to have been discharged from year to year as they accrued.  One consequence of the failure to deal with the problem in this straightforward way was that when the Supplementary Estimate was introduced by the present Government it was found necessary to include in it &mdash;I hope Deputy Hickey is listening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;no less than £371,957 to cover bank interest.  Later we had a Supplementary Estimate for £650,000 in respect of flour subsidy pay ments.  Two hundred thousand pounds of this £650,000 provided by the Supplementary Estimate was required to cover the deficiency on the original provision which was occasioned by the increase in the price payable for homegrown wheat.  The balance, £450,000, was necessitated by the failure of our predecessors to provide fully for the cost of imported wheat and freight thereon.  When these Supplementary Estimates are taken into account, the net increase this year for the Department of Industry and Commerce, over 1951-52, is reduced to £59,000.</P>
      <P>Transport and Marine Services are up by £1,698,000, the main increases being in respect of Córas Iompair Éireann, for which a sum of £1,300,000 is included; the Great Northern Railway, for which £200,000 is included, and grants for harbours amounting to £218,000.  Here again, further regard must be had to the Supplementary Estimates which we found it necessary to introduce.  Nothing was provided last year in the original Estimate to cover the losses which were inevitably bound to arise in the working of Córas Iompair Éireann and it was necessary to take a Supplementary Estimate for £2,230,000 for this purpose.  That figure of £2,230,000 included no less than £433,000 in respect of advances made to the undertaking to enable it to meet interest payments on transport stock in 1951-52.  As there was every reason to fear and believe that the Exchequer would be called upon to provide this £433,000 during the current year, it is difficult to appreciate why this sum was not provided for in the original Estimates submitted to this House.  A second supplementary for £120,000 was needed to meet the guarantee in respect of losses arising on the working of the Great Northern Railway system. Allowing, again, for these supplementaries, the Vote for Transport and Marine Services, as a whole, shows a decrease of £653,000 for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Estimate is up by £1,426,000.  It reflects partly the in-taries <Col N="1931" /> crease in pay granted to members of the Defence Forces and partly the expansion of the services which has been necessitated by the international situation. Supplementary provision to the extent of £339,000 in respect of higher pay for the Defence Forces had to be made in 1951-2.  This arose directly out of the need to apply the principles of the Civil Service arbitration award to the forces.  A further £20,000 was also provided to finance the humanitarian work of the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Health is another Estimate which shows an increase.  In this case, the increase is of £1,193,000 over last year.  Again, in this case, it was necessary during the year to take a Supplementary Estimate for no less a sum than £835,000&mdash;so that the net increase for this service in this year as compared with last year is £338,000.  In view of the very large amount of this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;amounting, let me repeat, to £835,000&mdash;which the present Government had to ask for in order to meet the charges on this Vote, it is difficult to appreciate why my predecessor in his Budget Statement did not mention that this very large additional sum would be demanded in the course of the year.  The fact that he did not do so, and that the ministerial Orders which eventuated for this additional expenditure were made almost immediately after his Budget Statement&mdash;within, in fact, five days thereafter&mdash;is highly suggestive.  It would appear as if the Minister were more concerned with political expediency than with financial rectitude.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Old Age Pensions is increased by £1,050,000.  The increase is consequent upon the Social Welfare Act which was passed by the Oireachtas last July.  Deputies, in that connection, will remember that a Supplementary Estimate for £337,000 has already been taken this year.</P>
    <P>The Education Estimates are up some £1,312,000 more than in 1951-2, the increase, in this case, being due mainly to the higher pay secured by primary, secondary and vocational schoolteachers last year.  These increases again arose from the application of the <Col N="1932" /> Civil Service arbitration terms to the teaching profession and is another case where a supplementary provision had to be made during the year 1951-2, the amount of the provision being £1,070,000.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Agriculture also is up&mdash;up by £936,000, the main increases being in respect of the butter subsidy for which £953,000 will be required and the ground limestone subsidy for which the Dáil is being asked to provide £300,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going on to say that Deputies should bear in mind that the figures I have quoted hitherto refer to amounts which have been transferred from the special Supplementary Estimates to the general Estimates and that the figures in relation to Civil Service remuneration have been taken into account before arriving at the net figure for the increase in respect of any particular service.</P>
      <P>I come now to the decreases in the Estimates.  The largest decrease is in the Vote for the Department of Local Government, being an apparent decrease of £2,293,000 on the original provision for 1951-52.  I have seen some curious references in the newspapers recently to the sub-head under which the greater part of this decrease arises, namely, sub-head I (7).  The references suggest that considerable confusion exists in the minds of the public men who made them.  I shall endeavour to clear the situation up for them.  The sub-head in question, as its wording clearly indicates to any person who took the trouble to read the Estimate, relates mainly to balances due to local authorities in respect of grants allocated to them out of the Transition Development Fund prior to the 1st November, 1950.  I would ask the House, and Deputy MacEoin in particular, to mark the date&mdash;the 1st November, 1950, the date before which allocations were made.  That date is actually set out in the Estimate, showing that the provision did not relate to future houses, to freshly projected houses, but to houses which were built or in course of building.</P>
      <P>The new sub-head, in fact, was necessitated by the decision of my predecessor to wind up the Transition Development Fund as at the 31st March last. In order to do this it was necessary to make provision for certain commitments previously entered into.  With this purpose a special sub-head, the sub-head to which I have referred, sub-head I (7), was opened in the Local Government Estimate for 1951-52&mdash;purely as a transitory provision&mdash;and it is under this sub-head that our predecessors' hypothecations of the Transition Development Fund will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> In this as in other matters they pledged, but we pay; they promised and we pay.  Even though it inflated by £2,000,000 the figure which appeared in the Local Government Estimate every local authority knew that the arrangement represented no additional provision whatever; but it was a remarkably tricky piece of financial window dressing all the same.  The fall in the 1952-53 provision for grants is an automatic consequence of this change in the method of subsidisation and implies no reduction, let me emphasise, in State aid for local authority housing.  The other large decrease on the Local Government Estimate is in respect of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.  The decrease under this head, however, will be compensated for by increased expenditure on road works of permanent value, carried out for the public benefit solely, and financed from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>The Vote for forestry shows a reduction of £201,000 on the original Estimate for 1951-52.  The 1951-52 Estimate, however, made provision for reserve stocks to the extent of £193,000 and no provision has been made for that particular item in 1952-53.  I wish to emphasise this, for I notice that Deputy MacBride with his customary disingenuousness has been muddying the waters by suggesting in the Press that less is being provided for the actual afforestation programme in the coming year.  There is no justification for misleading the public in this fashion.  The truth of the matter is that the reserve stocks which were considered necessary have been built up &mdash;our predecessors should never have allowed them to run down&mdash;so that there is no need to continue to accumulate them.</P>

As I pointed out, we have built up the required reserve stock. Having done that what else does Deputy MacBride want us to do?  To continue to buy and to spend the taxpayers' money on barbed-wire and stakes and call it afforestation.</P>

      <P>So much for the main increases and decreases as between the volume of Estimates for the coming year and the Supply Estimates which were originally presented to the House for 1951-52.  It is, of course, with the Estimates for the coming year that we are now concerned. They represent by far the greater part of the bill which we shall have to meet next year.  In round figures the Supply Services covered by these Estimates will cost £95,000,000. The figure is meant to cover existing services only.  It does not take account of additions during the year for new services, nor even with these will it constitute the whole bill.  We have also to bring into account the cost of <Col N="1936" /> Central Fund Services.  This year the Central Fund Services will require something of the order of £13,000,000 which is £2,600,000 more than last year. It arises mainly because of increased debt charges including the first half year's interest on Marshall Aid Loan now completely spent which will require £600,000 worth of dollars because that interest must be paid according to the terms of the bond in the local currency of the United States. But even the Supply Services and the Central Fund Services do not represent the whole tale of Government expenditure. We have still to take into consideration what are known as &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; issues, expenditure which is represented by advances to the Electricity Supply Board, to Bord na Móna, to the Local Loans Fund or incurred for such purposes as our share of the purchase price of the Great Northern Railway Company undertaking.  In this year, issues of this kind will amount to about £22,000,000, and in the coming year, the year 1952-53, are likely to be of the order of £26,000,000. Making every allowance for sayings on these Votes, and for so much of the expected expenditure as may not, in fact, be realised, a conservative estimate of the total expenditure under all these heads would be about £135,000,000.</P>
      <P>On the assumption that the revenue from existing taxes and other sources remains unabated, the gap between our prospective income and this forecast of expenditure looks like being of the order of £50,000,000.  No matter how it be regarded, no matter on what ground it may be justified and no matter for-what purpose it is provided, this, I think it will be admitted, is an enormous sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me emphasise, however, that it arises almost entirely out of the cost of maintaining our present services and continuing our present programme. With the exception of the additional amount which was provided last year for old age pensioners and the additional provision for defence, social welfare, health and tourism which are included in the Estimates, or will arise <Col N="1937" /> in due course, it does not include any new service, any new channel of expenditure which was not inherited from our predecessors.</P>
    <P>The basic difference between this year's figures and last year's lies in the fact that the figures which I now present to the Dáil give a compreheasive picture of the true and real position.</P>
    <P>There has been no cutting down, no doctoring of the figures, merely to preserve appearances.  The true bill is being presented to the people.  The problem which they have to face, and which this House in particular has to face, is whether, and, if so, how can this gap be bridged, and at the same time, stability restored in our economic and financial affairs.  This problem is urgent and pressing; it grows graver and more acute day by day.  The nation cannot afford to procrastinate or delay in dealing with it.  Accordingly, the Government proposes that the Budget should be taken at the earliest possible date after the close of the current financial year, that is to say, on Wednesday, the 2nd April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Closely interlinked with this budgetary problem there is another problem of equal gravity to which I now propose to refer.  It arises from the deficit which we ran, not only last year but in several preceding years and are continuing to run this year in our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the House nor the country has been left in ignorance of the anxiety, the heavy anxiety, with which the Government have viewed this problem.  Within a very short time after we took office I reviewed at length in this House the financial situation of the State.  In that review, I drew attention to the balance of payments deficit and emphasised the menace which it constituted to our credit and solvency.  I again warned the House of the gravity of the position last July and once again last November.  The Taoiseach himself, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Health, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Posts <Col N="1938" /> and Telegraphs, the Minister for Justice, and each and every one of the remainder of my colleagues has referred to this problem time and time again and emphasised its gravity, its seriousness and its significance.  Further in order to bring it more emphatically home to the public mind and to set the position categorically before the people the Government published a special White Paper dealing with the balance of payments.  Unfortunately the Government's warnings in this regard were scoffed at and derided by those public men who appear to have induced themselves to believe that disputation and controversy on this important matter would be accepted by our foreign creditors in settlement of our debts with them.</P>
    <P>Our people were told, and it has been recently repeated, that we were creating a false scare, that the balance of payments deficit was in no sense as grave or as large as we pretended it to be.  The Leader of the Opposition in fact went so far as to pledge his reputation as statistician that the turn of the year would show that the deficit was not any larger than £50,000,000.  The fact is that, according to the provisional estimate which has been prepared for me by the Central Statistics Office, from data now available to it, the deficit for the calendar year 1951 is over £66,000,000.</P>

      <P>I am quoting my authority, the Central Statistics Office, which is available for the purpose of supplying members of the Government with data relating to their particular Departments necessary to enable them to discharge the business of their Departments and their business to this House.  The Central Statistics Office has calculated&mdash;provisionally, of course, because the official figures will not emerge in the last decimal place until some time later in the year&mdash;that the deficit on the data now available will be in the region of £66,000,000.  I may say that the data is very full data but I am not saying how much more the deficit will be.  I am taking the figure of £66,000,000 and I am leaving out of consideration the fact that it may be somewhat larger.  We will take the nice round figure of £66,000,000 and contrast it with Deputy Costello's pledged word that it would not exceed £50,000,000 in respect of the last calendar year.</P>
      <P>Despite all the ballyhoo that we read in the newspapers and in certain editorials the estimate which was published in White Paper was very much closer to the mark than the ridiculous understatement for which Deputy Costello made himself responsible. The estimate which was published in October had naturally been prepared some weeks before that.  It fixed the deficit at about £70,000,000.  Deputy Costello, with the whole basis of the calculation before him in the White Paper, said that it would not be more than £50,000,000. The actual fact is that that deficit has turned out to be £66,000,000.  All I say in regard to that is, and I think it has a moral for our people and a moral for those who sit behind Deputy Costello, that the Government's statisticians are much better estimators and much more accurate judges of our financial and economic situation than Deputy Costello has shown himself to be.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may take a minute or two to remind the Dáil how this balance of payments problem arises and how it goes to the very heart of our economic health and well-being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due undoubtedly to the fact that <Col N="1944" /> the balance of payments, whether for or against a country, expresses itself in millions of pounds, people in general are prone to look at it as a mere abstraction which does not impinge in any concrete or vital way upon their own welfare.  There could scarcely be a graver misconception.  A country's position in regard to its balance of payments reacts decisively and intensively upon a country's credit, the purchasing power of its currency, its ability to pay, its ability to buy.</P>
    <P>If the balance of payments position of a country is grossly and continuously adverse over a prolonged period, if the deficit is at a level beyond anything which the country's external reserves can continue to support, its credit will be destroyed, its currency will be depreciated, its economy will be disrupted and those of its industries which depend on foreign supplies will be destroyed.  As everybody will understand, foreign suppliers will not accept its money in exchange for their goods, raw materials will be denied to it and its employers and employees alike will be impoverished.</P>
    <P>In every year since and including 1947 this country has had deficits of varying magnitude, the cumulative total of which has now reached £155,000,000.</P>
    <P>It has been urged that this accumulation represents a repatriation of external assets.</P>
    <P>This was largely true in the year 1947; it is much less true in regard to the deficits which were incurred over the intervening years.</P>
    <P>No one can contend that the heavy sums spent over those years on imported wheat, coarse grains, or foreign butter represented a repatriation of external assets.</P>
    <P>On the contrary these represented a consumption, a wasteful and final consumption, of external assets, a consumption which could easily have been avoided if a far-sighted economic policy had been pursued.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that from 1947 to 1951 inclusive we incurred deficits on <Col N="1945" /> our balance of payments amounting to £155,000,000 in all.</P>
    <P>It is a startling fact that £96,000,000 of this huge total was realised in the two years 1950 and 1951.</P>
    <P>Perhaps those whose policy was responsible for this will be good enough to point out for us where in the Twenty-Six Counties are the tangible, income-producing assets which they claim are represented by that £96,000,000.</P>
    <P>We shall, for the present at any rate, leave that sorrowful past behind and turn now to consider the future, or at least that part of it which is represented by the balance of the current calendar year.</P>
    <P>According to the best estimate that we have been able to frame on the basis of present trends and future expectations, we shall, if these trends remain unchanged, close the present year with a balance of payments deficit of the order of £50,000,000.</P>
    <P>Comprised in that figure there is an estimated deficit of £22,000,000 with the dollar area and an estimated deficit of £28,000,000 with other non-sterling area countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And, as I was saying, because, of course, it is necessary that the House should keep continuously in mind the whole picture, £22,000,000 of that deficit on present trends is expected to arise in regard to transactions with the dollar area and the balance of £28,000,000 is expected to arise in relation to transactions with other non-sterling area countries.  I wish to say that this is a development which cannot be permitted.</P>
      <P>Unless steps be taken now to prevent it, we shall eventually have widespread unemployment and want in consequence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> The position, therefore, is highly critical and must be corrected by direct action if necessary.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that we are not in a unique position in having a problem of this kind.</P>
    <P>In the non-sterling world, several countries have major balance of payments difficulties and others are only emerging from such difficulties as a result of strenuous effort and sacrifices.</P>
    <P>In our case, however, the problem arises in a twofold way.</P>
    <P>First of all we are immediately and directly concerned to maintain our own credit with our own suppliers outside the sterling area.</P>
    <P>This involves our ability to meet our obligations to them in a currency which they will accept.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the bulk of our trade is with Great Britain to whom we sell for sterling.</P>
    <P>But though we buy a great deal from the non-sterling area, we sell very little to it; so that the deficit in our balance of payments arises almost wholly in respect of transactions with countries outside the sterling area to whom we can offer nothing except sterling in settlement.</P>
    <P>Because of this fact we are of necessity vitally concerned in the fortunes of sterling as an international currency; for the purchasing power of our own currency in non-sterling markets is dependent on the exchange value of our holdings of sterling.</P>
    <P>As the general pattern of our trade now exists we can only pay our way in the world in so far as we retain adequate sterling resources and in so far as the international position of sterling as a means of exchange is maintained.</P>
    <P>It is certain that unless there is a radical alteration in the pattern of our trade, we shall not have the means to pay for non-sterling imports if we continue to import them at the present level.</P>
    <P>The proper and most effective way of remedying this position would be to expand our exports to these non-sterling <Col N="1947" /> areas and every effort is being made to do this, but, naturally, it will take time to produce results.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments problem, on the other hand, is urgent and must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, have no option but to strive to secure a reduction in this country's imports from non-sterling sources to the least possible value, without disturbing our economy so seriously as to jeopardise our prospect of achieving an over-all balance within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we are taking steps to adjust our balance of payments with the dollar area so that the net deficit during the second half of 1951-1952 will not exceed 16,000,000 dollars.</P>

      <P>I was saying, Sir, that we are intensively examining the problem of our imports from non-sterling and non-dollar sources and that we propose to announce, in due course, the steps which we are going to take in order to secure a reduction in the deficit which arises in respect of these items.  We shall, in fact, aim at so reducing it that in the latter part of this year it will not be accruing at a rate in excess of £18,000,000 per annum.  One source of foreign expenditure with which we can deal directly and immediately is the holiday allowance for foreign travel.  During the last few years&mdash;I notice this is going to hurt Deputy MacBride&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall be permitted to make this speech, which has at least some importance for the people of the country even if the people opposite have no regard for it.  I was saying that one source of foreign expenditure which we can immediately and directly control is the holiday allowance for foreign travel.  During the last few years, considerable numbers <Col N="1949" /> of our people have been spending their holidays abroad and this outgoing adds to the strain of our balance of payments.  As transactions with the European countries which are the destination of our travellers presently involve settlement of deficits in gold or dollars through the E.P.U. clearing, it is of great importance that we should make a saving wherever possible.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided, therefore, to reduce with early effect the basic allowance for holiday travel abroad during the ensuing 12 months to £25.</P>

I hope, therefore, that I shall be permitted to continue without these interruptions from the bear garden.  The decisions which I have announced will impose a great measure of restraint upon us all.  They will result in a certain amount of inconvenience, but they are unavoidable and inevitable if the credit and stability of our currency is to be preserved and if our economy is not to be so seriously dislocated, our credit so injured that great hardship would be inflicted upon great numbers of our people.  I am sure that it will be recongnised and accepted that only the dire need of the hour, the stark realities of our economic situation compel us to resort to them.</P>

But that in itself is not enough to aim at.  We must have a long-term objective and do our utmost to achieve it.  Our purpose must be to make our economy more nearly self-supporting in relation to the non-sterling world.  If we wish to continue to import at existing levels we must produce more and export more of what we produce.  Production and not restriction is the solution for our problem.</P>

      <P>Until it is and the free convertibility of sterling is restored we shall have the ever present danger of payments difficulties with the non-sterling world which will place <Col N="1951" /> our economy and the standard of living of our people in continuous jeopardy So long as the present position obtains we shall live under the risk that one day our non-sterling suppliers will not give their goods for the payments we tender.  The only way we can be sure of avoiding that risk is to increase our exports to them.  We cannot do that, however, unless we produce the goods that they want at terms which will be attractive to them.</P>
      <P>Our manufacturers cannot permit themselves to be contented with the home market.  They must make every effort to find export outlets for their products.  Indeed, under present circumstances neither they nor their workers can have any assurance that the home market will of itself be in a position to maintain them.  We would appear in short to be entering upon a new chapter in our industrial history, a chapter during which our industries must export or decay.  Furthermore, the export drive cannot be confined to manufactured goods or industrial products. Developments since the war have shown that agriculture may play even a predominant part in solving this problem.</P>

For many years we have been living on the savings of our fathers or on moneys borrowed from abroad.  That chapter must now be regarded as closed.  Henceforward we must rely more and more on ourselves; more and more on our own labours to supply the food we eat, the things we wear and the luxuries we desire.  We do not necessarily have to produce all these things for ourselves but if we want to have them we must produce and export sufficient goods to pay for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We learned from the radio last evening that the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, sent a message to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the British Parliament; that the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the British Parliament that he had received from our Minister for Finance something in the nature of an assurance that he was going to weigh in with them on some unspecified measures to deal with the situation which confronted Great Britain, and that the Minister was going to make a statement in the Dáil to-day.  I had occasion to enter a protest in this House on another occasion against that type of procedure.  We learned from the British radio that our Minister for Finance was going to London to take counsel and consideration with his opposite number there, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The Irish Parliament and the Irish people got that information from the British radio.  We now learn that our Minister for Finance has sent a letter to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer but we were not told to-day what was in that letter.  We are <Col N="1953" /> entitled to know the contents of that letter which the Minister for Finance sent to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;a letter dealing with matters which must be of vital import to the people of this country and to the plans which he has for the imposition of an austerity programme upon them which we do not believe to be justified or necessary.</P>
    <P>A particular writer in one of to-day's newspapers interpreted the sending of the letter by our Minister for Finance to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;though nobody but the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister himself knows the contents or the purport of that letter&mdash; as follows: &ldquo;The Minister, in framing his Budget, might be guided by the British Budget especially as he appears to have given a written undertaking concerning aspects of Irish financial and economic policy to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.&rdquo;  Has the Minister given such an undertaking in writing?  If he has not, I think we are entitled to know the contents of that letter and to what extent this State is bound by the undertakings given in that letter.  We are entitled to ascertain what took place at the London Conference.  The Taoiseach told us that it was nothing but an exchange of views.  We accepted that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we took no further steps in the belief that when the financial motions and financial business would fall to be dealt with by this House in the course of the next few months, from to-day onwards, we would get some indication as to what views were exchanged at that conference.  The Minister has sat down to-day without giving us the slightest indication of what those views were&mdash; of whether there was any agreement in the letter, which the British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the British Parliament that he had received from him, as to the steps that ought to be taken in reference to the shoring-up of sterling.  We are entitled to ask for at least some indication of the nature of these views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The departure of the Minister for <Col N="1954" /> London was heralded by publicity in his own Press and it was given a considerable degree of publicity in newspapers that are not so tied to his Party as the <i>Irish Press</i> or the <i>Sunday Press.</i>  We were told that it was our pound that was in jeopardy and we were told by the <i>Sunday Press</i> that the Minister went over to London with powerful cards in his hands to play.  Then we found that he was accompained by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce took the high road and the Minister for Finance took the low road.  The Minister for Finance went by boat and the Minister for Industry and Commerce went by plane.  They arrived at the same time but they did not go together.  That is symbolic of the division that exists on financial and Government policy, if we are to take account of the utterances of Ministers in recent times.  We have the restrictionist policy of the Minister for Finance and the expansionist policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We know, from his own utterances in this House in the first year of the inter-Party Government, what the present Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;Deputy Lemass as he then was&mdash;thought of the Department of Finance, namely, that every worthwhile project ever sent to the Department of Finance was killed and buried there and he warned the Fine Gael Deputies of that time not to be caught in the grips of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that where capital expenditure is provided for, in the Budget or elsewhere&mdash;whether it is above or below the line and whether the jargon of the old out-of-date economists is continued and the revisions which we started discarded&mdash; that whatever the Minister for Finance may say of difficulties to the verge of desperation, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will go on expending moneys and not bothering about the method of getting the money.  He will get the money and spend it and he will not bother how that money is to be got.  That is one of the great dangers that is inherent in the change of policy that is indicated <Col N="1955" /> by the very simple change that has been made on the cover of the Book of Estimates this year.  The inter-Party Government, in 1951, for the first time divided the financial affairs of this country into two parts, the first part dealing with capital account and the other part dealing with current account.  The policy enshrined in that change was given effect to by means of the double Budget.  That is the fundamental change that has been made in the Book of Estimates we are dealing with here to-day.  Not one single word was stated by the Minister for Finance in the course of his observations either to explain or to justify that change.  We know now&mdash;if I may borrow or adapt a phrase from a rather more defunct poetic confrére of the Minister himself, the late William Wordsworth&mdash;that the Minister was suckled in a creed outworn.  He was suckled in a creed outworn since the day when Gladstone died.  It is obvious from the policy adumbrated by the Minister to-day&mdash;so far as any policy is demonstrated in the Book of Estimates&mdash;that Deputy McGilligan's plans, when he was Minister for Finance, for the development of this country have been set aside in favour of the Victorian concepts of economy and that the officials of the Department of Finance have triumphed over progress.</P>
    <P>We are faced to-day, as a result of the policy carried out by the present Government, with unemployment on an ever-increasing scale.  We have uncertainty in business and unrest in agriculture.  The Minister for Finance, in his platitudes to-day, spoke about production, more production, and the necessity for exports.  It is perfectly true that manufacturers will produce more, if they can sell it, but the difficulty at the moment is that what they can produce they cannot sell.  The farmers will produce more for home consumption and for export if a proper agricultural policy is adopted and the necessary impetus given them to produce what is so urgently required. Can we solve that problem by talk about the balance of payments about which the Minister appears to be <Col N="1956" /> obsessed?  Uncertainty and confusion have been brought into the affairs of this country since the present Government came into office&mdash;uncertainty and confusion deliberately intended, I believe, to be brought about by the change in policy and the change in the form of the Estimates which were typified by the segregation of capital from current items in the dual Budget. That confusion exists in this Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated that there is likely to be not less than a £50,000,000 deficit on our accounts. How could anybody check that in the Book of Estimates?  I might remark that it is not a mere coincidence that a short time ago that very same figure of £50,000,000 appeared in one of the political publications of the <i>Irish Press.</i> How are we to check that?  There is nothing but confusion in this Book of Estimates this year.  The Minister, both by the tone of his speech and the content of his remarks, indicated that he is far more concerned in trying to cast aspersions on his predecessor's financial policies and in trying to suggest that the last Government had deliberately misled the Irish people in connection with their financial policy, than he is with providing them with a decent financial policy of his own.  He is far more concerned with making points against Deputy McGilligan and the last Government than he is with dealing with the very grave problems with which we have to deal.  He and his colleagues have shown in the last nine or ten months that they are prepared to besmirch the credit of this country in order to make political capital against their political opponents. We have the spectacle of Sir Basil Brooke rejoicing at the Minister's utterances.  We have to realise that, in the certain knowledge that this country is relatively speaking one of the most prosperous countries of the world, if our opportunities are availed of.  I do not care whether the officials of the Department of Finance or of the Central Bank propound theories that were in existence 50 years ago.  We are proud of the innovations we made in financial matters and of the policy of the capital Budget of which it was the instrument.  It was possible for Mr. <Col N="1957" /> Foster, head of E.C.A., to say at the end of three years of inter-Party Government that this was one of the most prosperous countries in the world.  Is it still possible to say that to-day after our experience of the last ten months?</P>
    <P>We had speeches from the Minister for Finance alleging that the country was faced with difficulties bordering upon desperation.  He spoke to-day about the balance of payments problem and what had happened during the debate on the White Paper published by his Department.  At that time it was a &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; that was facing the country.  The Government, led by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, veered rapidly away from the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and accepted my description of conditions as being those, not of a crisis, but of a problem.  They have never been able to get over that and nobody in this country with any independence of thought will now accept anything from the Minister for Finance as a true view of the financial position because he has cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; too often.</P>
    <P>There is confusion and uncertainty in the country.  It is at least some satisfaction to us to know that there will be some end to the uncertainty by the early Budget which the Minister for Finance to-day announced his intention of introducing.  There has been uncertainty in the country which has brought about widespread unemployment and depression.  That uncertainty has been the result of Government policy in the last eight or nine months.  It has done far more damage and caused greater suffering than any gap in the balance of payment we have had to suffer or are likely to suffer in the near future. The greatest problem that we may have to face in connection with the balance of payments is that, according to the Minister, there will be a gap of £66,000,000.  I mentioned £50,000,000 here before.  The Minister said I staked my reputation on that.  But whatever the figure is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever the gap may be it was sustained in an exceptional period and under more difficult circumstances that are unlikely to occur <Col N="1958" /> again.  I assert that while we have always known and asserted that there is a problem in the balance of payments, it is a long-term one and it is not a problem such as was adumbrated by the Minister in his speech to-day.</P>
      <P>May I in passing refer to the Minister's remark about me?  I do not care what the Minister says one way or another about me.  His remarks are all on a par with the kind of cheap gibes with which apparently the Minister intersperses his observations, even on serious subjects.  He said that I pledged myself as a statistician to a figure of £50,000,000 as representing the gap in the balance payments.  May I direct his attention to the fact that I said that even a statistician&mdash;I do not claim to be one; I never did&mdash;would be unable, even after a lapse of six or seven months beyond the close of the financial year, to give anything but an approximation of what the gap in the balance of payments might be?  May I refer the House to a statement which I made on the 7th November last as reported in Volume 127, No. 2, column 359?  I then stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even at the end of six months after the close of the year when the experienced and expert statisticians of the Central Statistics Office have all the available information before them, even then they, experts as they are, are not able to give anything other than what is an approximate estimate.  Yet it is only a guess for eight months, not for 12 months.  It takes no account of the effects on the balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having given an example last evening of a release from the Irish News Agency which gained world-wide publicity, and having read for the House excerpts from that remarkable document, I think the House will agree that if the news agency is to develop along proper lines and is to have any national significance, or at least significance for national good, it will have to be made clear as a matter of fundamental policy that its journalistic efforts must rise above the explorations of fairy tales and the exploitations of fairy tales.</P>
      <P>In case there might be any misunderstanding or misrepresentation in regard to my reading of the report in question, I would like to say that the statements in that report, which were attributed to prominent public men and officials in Limerick City and County, had no foundation whatsoever, in fact.  I understand that extraordinary to the publication of that extraordinary report was the dismissal of some misguided individual who supplied the report.  I am not concerned with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the motives that inspired the supplying of the report in the first instance, but I want to inquire what sort of officials we have that passed such a report for publication in Dublin and in London.  I do so in the knowledge that it is probably necessary that Irish news for consumption abroad must be presented in a certain fashion. Journalistic tradition, perhaps, in other countries requires that news which emanates from this country must be presented in what is described as a saleable fashion, but, in my view, there is a very obvious medium, and there is a very obvious limit, beyond which <Col N="1962" /> journalists should not be allowed to transgress.  That limit is indicated when the national good and the good name of the country are liable to be affected in any way by reports.  Nobody can say that the type of report which I instanced here last night could have done anything except to bring the Irish people, as a whole, and Irish public officials and Irish public representatives into contempt in the eyes of the world because such a report could not but convey to outsiders that this nation was composed, at its highest levels of administration, of people whose superstitions led them to believe in the existance of hobgoblins, leprechauns and fairies.</P>
    <P>I believe, as I said, that the news agency is an essential instrument for the propagation of Irish news in a proper fashion but, having said that and this House having expressed itself in a majority some years ago as being of that view, it does not flow from that that <i>carte blanche</i> must be given any person to paint whatever picture he likes to outside countries of our own country in order that news will sell. If the saleability of news is going to be the only yardstick by which the material supplied by the news agency is to be measured, then our standards of journalism in this country, judged by the report to which I have referred, would fall very low.  Very often a good deal of lip-service is paid to our standards of journalism.  Nobody can deny that, by and large, the standards of our journalists are of a very high order from the point of view of both unbiassed reporting and the ability of the men to do the work, always excluding, of course, the gutter journalism we read in the so-called political columns of the <i>Irish Press,</i> columns in which the inanities of every Fianna Fáil supporter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was time someone made a reference to it.  I shall refer to it in greater detail when a more favourable opportunity presents itself.  When this agency was brought into existence the then Minister for External Affairs stated expressly that it was not his intention that this agency would compete in the distribution of what is described as &ldquo;hot news&rdquo; in the technical jargon of the trade, and that that would form no part of its function.  Unfortunately that policy does not seem to have been adhered to within the last six or eight months.  I am interested in the matter because I think it is essential that the continuity of employment of journalists not directly employed by the agency should be safeguarded.  There is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that any suspicion of competition in &ldquo;hot news&rdquo; which may affect the volume of employment in ordinary journalistic circles shall not be permitted and any attempt at such should be strongly deprecated and prevented.</P>
      <P>I think there should be an investigation to find out how much competition there has been recently.  It would be interesting to know if the agency quite recently secured photographs of what was regarded as a very important event in England and had these photographs rushed to Dublin for insertion in one evening paper while the other evening paper had allegedly no knowledge whatsoever of what was happening. Rumour has it that these things have occured.  If they have occured, those who were responsible for them have merited the censure of the Minister and of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed in both the usefulness and the desirability of the agency.  I do not know what the attitude of the Government is towards the agency.  We all remember the statement of the present Tánaiste, then deputy leader of the Opposition, when he expressed his profound disagreement with the plan to have an agency at all and described it as a fraud and a joke.  That was a partisan political view and it has proved to be completely unfounded.  Every nation of any importance endeavours at some stage of its development to provide <Col N="1964" /> against misrepresentation.  The late Arthur Griffith deemed the finding of some method of overcoming what he described as &ldquo;the paper wall&rdquo; as one of the most urgent and pressing national tasks.  There is still a &ldquo;paper wall&rdquo; around this country.  It must be surmounted.  It will not be surmounted if the wrong type of news is allowed to issue from here.  It will rather be strengthened and consolidated.</P>
    <P>With proper direction and a proper presentation of the facts&mdash;not of the fancies of irresponsible people&mdash;a great deal of good can be done by the agency.  I expect the Minister, now that he is no longer in opposition, will agree as to the agency's usefulness. During the short time in which he will occupy his present office I would appeal to him to ensure that the policy of the agency will be so directed as to raise this country's good name amongst the other nations of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Government on having the moral courage to come here for a Supplementary Estimate for the news agency.  It is often difficult, once one has taken up a certain attitude, to alter that attitude subsequently.  I hope this is an indication that the Government appreciates the absolute necessity of our maintaining an independent news agency.  It is not possible on this Supplementary Estimate to indulge in a detailed discussion on the agency itself, but I would like to point out that every time a question is asked about the agency or a debate takes place concerning the agency damage is done to it.</P>
      <P>The prospect of the news agency becoming a solvent business proposition is being retarded by every irresponsible statement made in this House concerning the news agency. Deputies should bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no hope of the news agency becoming a solvent business proposition in less than five years.  Five years may be an optimistic estimate.  I do not think that this House would have expected the Electricity Supply Board, for instance, or the Turf Board or any of the other State corporations that we <Col N="1965" /> have created in the course of the last 25 or 30 years, to start paying dividends within a lesser period of time.</P>
    <P>It is natural that during the intervening period the news agency will require from time to time financial assistance to enable it to succeed but I do hope that in the meanwhile Deputies will refrain from asking questions or discussing the workings of the news agency in the House because each time they do so they damage the business prospects of the agency.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, mistakes will happen. Inevitably, reports will be sent out by the news agency that may not meet with unanimous approval in the House. I am sure that every day, even we are newspapers with whose views we are in complete agreement, we see reports published that we do not like, that we would not publish if we were responsible for the editing.  That is inevitable.  Having been a journalist for a number of years, I know how easily mistakes will happen.  Indeed, Deputies should be the first to realise how often mistakes can be made by all of us, particularly when working against time.  How often do we in this House make statements that are very far from being accurate?  The instance taken by Deputy Dunne is of little or no import.  Mistakes of that kind occur day in and day out.</P>
    <P>I hope the news agency will make satisfactory progress.  Again I would like to compliment the Minister and the Government on bringing in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I view with considerable uneasiness the proposal to grant additional money for the purposes of the Irish News Agency.  It is a highly dangerous thing to use public money to subsidise any particular form of journalism.  That in itself constitutes a danger to the freedom of the Press inasmuch as it means that all those engaged in the newspaper business who have to compete against the State subsidised institution are in danger of having their business completely destroyed if the Government is foolish enough to keep throwing money into this institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> There ought to be definite decision on the part of the Government that the Irish News Agency should stand on its own feet and pay its way or get out. If it can succeed in paying its way as an ordinary commercial operation without any Government aid or subvention, it will justify itself.  We cannot have the Irish News Agency, which is State-financed and State-subsidised, competing against ordinary journalists.</P>
    <P>One of the most surprising and, in my opinion, one of the most disgusting exhibitions witnessed in this House was the attack made by Deputy Cosgrave on the Irish News Agency and, incidentally, on the News Agency Act, which he and the Government with which he was associated supported. That attack may be said to mark the end of the alliance between Fine Gael and Clann na Poblachta.  Clann na Poblachta, like other parties which aided Fine Gael in the past, is now being thrown on the scrap-heap and the brain child of Deputy MacBride, the Irish News Agency, is being publicly denounced from the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party.  In this the Fine Gael Party is running true to form. Their path is strewn with the naked corpses of political Parties which tried to aid them&mdash;the old Farmers' Party, the National Centre Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Clann na Poblachta Party are now being discarded and the Irish News Agency, which they promoted and which was the only tangible industry which they succeeded in establishing, is now being denounced by the chief opposition Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make up our minds that grants of this kind must cease.  I appreciate the action of the Government in not terminating the agency, although it was very strongly condemned by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and other members of the present Government when they were in opposition.  I <Col N="1967" /> think they are right to give this agency a chance to prove itself.  I am satisfied that if the news agency is able to meet ordinary competition without State assistance of any kind and to hold its own it will justify itself, but we are taking a very great risk in regard to freedom of expression and freedom of the Press if we continue subsidising an institution of this kind.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Dunne on having drawn attention to one particular incident in the activities of the Irish News Agency and also on having escape the vengeance of the &ldquo;good people&rdquo; for having held them up to public ridicule.</P>
    <P>I have another serious complaint to make in regard to the manner in which news has been circulated by this so-called news agency.  During the past year I had occasion to inspect a file of news items transmitted by the Irish News Agency to newspapers in the United States of America.  Nearly every page in that series of reports reflected nothing but discredit on this country and on the news agency which issued them.  I will give only one instance of the kind of news which was sent out in that particular series.  A Wicklow farmer who had lived all his life peacefully in the Wicklow mountains was accused in a report sent to the American papers of having disinherited his grandson because that young man had joined the L.D.F.</P>
    <P>It was stated that the poor farmer was a Partitionist.  That is only one portion of the series of reports that were sent out under the heading of &ldquo;The Battle of Baltinglass&rdquo;.  It is absolutely necessary that when we, as a national Parliament, provide money for the upkeep of an agency of this kind at the taxpayer's expense, we should be very careful to see that the news that is sent abroad concerning this country is news that reflects credit upon our nation and not news, such as Deputy Dunne has quoted and such as I have referred to, which reflects nothing but discredit and ridicule upon our nation.</P>
    <P>It may be said&mdash;it will be said&mdash;that news items which this Parliament provides are probably the type of news items which sell best in foreign <Col N="1968" /> countries.  If that is to be the standard which will guide the operations of this Irish News Agency, the sooner it is closed down the better.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not pressing the Minister to discontinue this agency.  I think he has shown tolerance and goodwill in allowing it to continue, especially in view of the fact that it was established against the will of his Party by his own political opponents. However, I think he ought to make it clear to those who are managing this agency that they cannot expect, in the future, to have their operations financed out of the public purse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the main Estimate would have been a more appropriate occasion on which to discuss the policy and the whole idea of the news agency, but some things have been said in this debate to which I must reply, and information has been asked for which I must give.</P>
      <P>I am quite aware of all that was said during the debate when the Act establishing this news agency went through the House.  I think it is wrong for Deputy Cosgrave to say that no one thought that the news agency was going to deal with what is called &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news.  At that time Deputy Cosgrave was a Parliamentary Secretary. He was, I understand, secretary to the Cabinet and saw all the documents. There was one document in connection with the foundation of the news agency of which he should have had knowledge.  That document was the articles of association of the news agency.  In it it is stated that one of the objects of the company was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) To carry on the business of a news agency in all its branches and to ensure the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news, intelligence and photographs inside and outside Ireland and for these purposes to use any telephone, telegraph or wireless system or any other means of communication.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a document that was passed by the Government and it was signed by a number of very senior civil servants. It was quite clear from that document that it was anticipated that <Col N="1969" /> the news agency would deal with &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news.  That action of the Government was somewhat different from the statement made by the then Minister who piloted the Bill through the Dáil.  The fact is that the agency to the knowledge and with the consent of the Government was given the power to deal with &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news. When this present Government came into office, we had to deal with the situation as we found it.  The news agency was operating a news service, and a fair amount of public money had been spent in building up that organisation. Hopes had been aroused that it would be a success and in spite of the fact that a number of members of our Party, and the Party as a whole, were against the organisation proposed for the news agency, we were determined that we would do everything we could to make it a success if it could be made a success.</P>
    <P>I encouraged the directors to get into contact with foreign news agencies and to try and link up with them so that there would be an exchange of Irish news for foreign news in order that we might have a good chance of doing what it was hoped would be done by the agency, which was to give foreign newspapers Irish sources of Irish news rather than have Irish news collected and disseminated by foreign news agencies.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Cosgrave recommended that we should close the whole thing down.  He said it was a complete failure.  I am not in a position to confirm what Deputy Cosgrave said. Certain contacts have been made by the news agency which in the course of time will help it to fulfil the functions of conveying Irish news abroad and help it also to earn some cash.</P>
    <P>It was at my urgent request that the chairman of the news agency opened up negotiations with an American news agency (the International News Service) in order to make contact whereby they would get news from that service, and that service would be under contract to take Irish news and deliver it to American newspapers. That contract was signed last year. The result will be that the Irish News <Col N="1970" /> Agency will get the service of the International News Service, and at the same time the International News Service will deliver to the New York desk so many words per day given to it by the Irish News Agency.  Similarly, exchange contracts have been made with Press agencies in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and with certain other news agencies.  I have no means yet of knowing what exactly the news agency's balance sheets will reveal next year or in the years ahead.  When the exchange contract between the news agency and the International News Service&mdash;the American news agency&mdash;is in operation for some months we shall be able to see how the arrangement works out.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride made one very true statement to-night and that is, that every question asked about the news agency in this House and every statement made about it postpones the day when it will earn a profit.  For that reason I should have preferred to see the present organisation much further away from, and independent of, Government and Government Departments. However, we had not to deal with a clean sheet of paper.  We took over an organisation and it was up to the Minister who had responsibility to the Dáil for it to do the best he could with the organisation that was there.  One of the things that one learns in life is that too much chopping and changing is bad and that it is sometimes better to make the best use of an organisation that is not 100 per cent. perfect than to spend too much time and energy on perfecting a new organisation.</P>
    <P>I took over what I candidly said in this House I did not believe to be the best type of organisation to do the work which every Irishman would like to see done, but our predecessors had organised it on that basis and it was up to us to make it a success.  I have tried to tell the House that the agency has been successful in getting contracts with foreign agencies.  It has been successful in getting items of Irish news into the continental and British and American papers.  I hope it will be still further successful in that <Col N="1971" /> respect.  I hope, when the main Estimate is before the House, to discuss the matter more fully.  The members can make up their minds at that time, after hearing every aspect of the case, whether they want to see the news agency go ahead or brought to an end.</P>
    <P>When the time came for the election of new directors or the reappointment of existing directors to the board, in order to give the agency every chance and so that nobody could possibly allege that politics were being played in connection with the news agency, I reappointed the four directors who were available for reappointment. These were men who believed in the news agency and who had experience of its difficulties.  I reappointed them and gave them every possible help I could to ensure the success of the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to competition with journalists.  Before Christmas he raised the matter of a statement which was made by the National Union of Journalists to the effect that the livelihood of the working journalist was being jeopardised by the activities of the news agency.  I promised Deputy Cogan then that we would try to settle that dispute with the board of the news agency and the National Union of Journalists.  Very shortly afterwards the members of the board met the members of the executive of this union and came to complete agreement.  Shortly after the meeting an announcement was published in the Press to the effect that complete agreement had been reached between the Union and the Irish News Agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne referred to a gross error which was made by an employee of the news agency in connection with an official of Limerick City.  I answered a question put by Deputy Dunne during the year on that matter and explained how the error occurred. I also pointed out that the official of Limerick City who had been misrepresented had been approached by the officers of the Irish News Agency who expressed their regret to him. This officer of the City of Limerick said: &ldquo;The Irish News Agency have apologised and I am satisfied that it <Col N="1972" /> was not really their fault.  They have since acted in a most gentlemanly manner in regard to the matter and I am quite satisfied.&rdquo;  He was the one man who had a grievance about that particular story.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of two offices&mdash;one in Fleet Street and the other in Grafton Street.  He said that the news agency started in Fleet Street and then went to premises in Grafton Street.  That is not the actual position.  The news agency started in Grafton Street.  They then found that the premises were too small to enable them to expand into the photographic business and they took premises in a basement in Fleet Street.  Although those premises are located in a basement they are quite healthy, being well-ventilated and well-lighted though not palatial.  I think that they are functionally good for the work the news agency has to do and that they are very centrally situated.</P>
    <P>They are situated close to the newspaper offices and to the offices of a number of journalists who work in that area.  Deputy Cosgrave asks how many people are employed by the news agencies.  There are at headquarters in Dublin, including typists, messengers and everybody else, 43; in London, nine; and in Belfast, two.  That is 54 in all, including the officers of the organisation, typists and messengers. Deputy Cosgrave asks whether news agency matter was availed of by foreign correspondents.  News agency material, of course, is, as I said, sent out to the various foreign agencies I enumerated at the beginning of my speech.  It is also available for correspondents here and for correspondents of foreign papers.  Of course, if a foreign news agency is looking for a report, I do not suppose that they get it very quickly if the Irish News Agency can sell it themselves.  I think it is a source of grievance with some foreign news agencies that the Irish News Agency do not do all their work for them.  Deputy Cosgrave said that there was no real justification for continuing this expenditure.  I wish Deputy Cosgrave had expressed that opinion before the news agency started and got the matter more thoroughly <Col N="1973" /> thrashed out than it seems to have been by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Bill here in this House everybody thought that the scheme had been thoroughly examined and that it had the unanimous support of all the sections of which the last Government was composed.  We are discovering now regarding this news agency as in regard to a number of other matters that there was in fact no real unity amongst the Government and that they could not do very effective work.  I have to come here to-night looking for £20,000 simply because the last Government did not make the provision that the directors asked them for.  When the Estimates for the present financial year were being prepared the directors pointed out that £37,000 would be required to keep the news agency in being for the financial year.  The previous Government however in spite of the fact that they were told that it would cost £37,000, made provision in the Estimates only for £25,000.  We have to meet the deficit on the working year and it is for that deficit I am asking the Dáil to provide by this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking last night, I referred to some objections which I had to this Bill.  In the first place, I objected because I considered it to be wrong in principle to hand this industry over to a State controlled body.  I am convinced that no Government Department can run a business successfully.  It can run it all right, but it cannot run it successfully. The method under which the board is to be appointed, for a period of two years, clearly indicates that there is to be no serious attempt to build up a skilled and trained body of men who would be competent to deal with the matter.  One could understand them spending a period of apprenticeship, but here we have an organisation dealing with what should be a great industry <Col N="1974" /> and it will be changed every second year.</P>
      <P>I would say that even at the end of two years no man appointed to this board would have a full grasp of the organisation, management, control and erection of an industry of this kind. Of course it is impossible to think that this body, recruited every two years, could make a success of the industry. They will be mere apprentices, each and every one of them.  That is the first weak link in this proposal, that they are mere apprentices and never can get a grasp of the industry.  This body, whether a private body or a body nominated by the Minister, would require two things, one a short-term policy from which it could move successfully into a long-term policy.  We shall be told of course that these men, after they have been in office for two years, can be re-nominated.  They can, of course, but will that happen?  We shall have changes of Government, and after two years has expired the Government in office will appoint its own nominees.  I had to refer to this Bill last night in language that I do not like using.  I made a deliberate charge of political bias in nominating these men.  The remarkable thing about this Bill is that there is no section dealing with disqualification so far as this Government-controlled body is concerned.  That creates a sinister feeling towards the Bill.  I could not avoid the conclusion that the omission of such a section was done for the deliberate purpose of giving a political slant to the Bill, that it was done so as to leave it open for politicians to be appointed to the board.  If that were done, it would, in my opinion, be a shocking thing.  This House would be wanting in its duty to those who are dependent on this industry if we consented to do anything like that. It would mean disaster right away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every other Bill passed in this House since the foundation of this State, under which a statutory body was being set up&mdash;controlled by the Government as it were or by a Government Department&mdash;there was a disqualification clause in it.  It was effective up to the point that no active <Col N="1975" /> politician could become a member of the board.  Was the omission of such a clause in this Bill deliberate or accidental?  One can hardly imagine that those responsible for the promotion of the Bill could have been guilty of such an oversight.  I expressed regret about that last night, and I had to use strong language.  I will never wince as regards the expression of my views or in the doing of my duty in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>One has to think of the many people and the many families throughout the west, south and the east who had hoped to get a good livelihood out of this industry.  It will mean the wrecking of the entire industry and that the people who have been making a living out of it will have to emigrate unless we set up such machinery as will have inherent in it the prospects of success.  If this body is going to be directly controlled politically there will be no hope of that.  I hope that, on the Committee Stage, the Parliamentary Secretary will be prepared to accept an amendment calculated to eliminate any suspicion as regards bringing this organisation directly into politics and of having it politically controlled.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary is substantially acquainted with the way the industry is run at present.  He will know that men all around the coast of Ireland have put money into this industry in a small way but in a big way for them.  They are not wealthy men but they have put their savings into the provision and building of boats.  Locally they give continuous employment to quite a number of men.  They have built up their own organisation.  When fish are landed they deal with the fishermen. Some of the fish is sold locally and the balance is sent to Dublin or, perhaps, to England.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what he proposes to do with those men.  We cannot summarily dismiss them and wreck their careers.  I hope the House will not be guilty of an outrage such as that.  On the Committee Stage I hope to take steps to ensure that the interests of those men will be protected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> I regret, again, that this industry has not been handed over to private enterprise.  I fail to understand why it is now to be State controlled in view of the fact that some months ago we had the Undeveloped Areas Bill which to a large extent deals with the very same areas.  Under that Bill the principle of private enterprise was asserted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He absolutely refused to play any part in setting up State industries in the areas embraced under his Bill. I believe that if this were handed over to private enterprise it would lead to success.  I see no future for the industry under this Bill.  It will be a drag on the taxpayers.  They will be called upon to keep the thing struggling along, and we will never get anywhere. The men appointed on the board will not have the knowledge or experience or the time to get a grip of the job that is envisaged in the Bill and to make a success of it.  I think that the whole structure outlined in the Bill is bad and is definitely bound to fail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very early days of this State, in fact even before we had a Government acting as a <i>de facto</i> Government under the First or Second Dáil, the importance of the fishing industry for this island was regarded as being of the highest importance. It was realised then that it would demand a big effort on the part of the Government to develop it.  In fact, it was looked upon with such importance that the Government under the First Dáil appointed a Minister for Fisheries who would devote all his time to the development of the industry.  In the course of time, that ministerial position was wiped out.  I am glad to see, however, that the Government is making an effort to revert to that position to which I have alluded by delegating a Parliamentary Secretary to look after the interests of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes those of us who can remember 45 and 50 years ago that the amount of fish available in the market for a number of years has been very small.  Forty and 50 years ago teams of horses and carts, or vans, went out from the different provincial towns to the fishing centres and brought back <Col N="1977" /> to those towns quantities of fish for distribution in the markets.  Fish was indeed a very common dish in certain areas in those days.  In the more remote inland towns I admit fish was not so common, but a large section of our people had a frequent opportunity of providing themselves with fish.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why the quantity of fish has declined.  I have heard complaints from fishermen that fish are becoming scarcer every year.  They put forward their own views as to the reason for that scarcity.  Whether it is due to those who are responsible for the industry from a governmental point of view or to some other cause the fact is that fish is not available to-day in anything like the same quantity as it was 30, 40 and 50 years ago. Are less fish coming into our waters? Is there some other reason why our fishermen can no longer get the same volume of fish as they did 40 and 45 years ago?</P>
    <P>One Deputy made no bones last night about throwing responsibility for the scarcity of fish on those responsible for the industry since the establishment of our own State.  I do not know whether or not he can support his charges with facts.  I have been a member of a harbour board for many years, and I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Sea Fisheries Association in appreciation of the work that body has done.  On any occasion on which an appeal has been made to them they have done everything they possibly could in order to help in providing adequate landing facilities, repairing harbours or making some other amenities available for our fishermen.  In and around Arklow and Wicklow they have always met their obligations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as something that will help to bring about a change in the old order of things.  I am not prepared at the moment to discuss whether the old system was a good one or a bad one.  Fishermen on parts of the east coast complain that the industry is a dying one and, in proof of that, they point to the fact that many families made a good living out of the fishing industry in years gone by, while to-day only a very limited <Col N="1978" /> number are engaged in it, because there is no longer any living to be found in it.  Anything that will help to change the present position is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The new body established under this measure will be in a position to provide for the distribution of fish all over the country.  On a few occassion, in the town of Wicklow, when the herring season started and a few good catches had been made, the fishermen were advised, even though there were herrings out in the bay for the taking away, not to go out any more because there would be no market for their catch.  If this Bill improves that position in the future, it will be a good Bill and a welcome Bill.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will use his influence with the new board to take the necessary steps to ensure that a situation such as I have outlined will not again arise.  Where there is a plentiful supply of fish available, the fishermen should know that, if they are prepared to catch it, the authority responsible through this board will see to it that the fish is disposed of in the interest of the fishermen and of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary, who has a deep knowledge of the fishing industry, will, by this Bill, put an end to those matters that have prevented the development of the industry and, at the same time, will provide for the people in every part of the country an adequate supply of fish.</P>
    <P>The next question to which I wish to refer is the cost of boats.  Deputy Joseph Brennan also referred to that matter.  Complaints are made to me constantly, first of all, in regard to the cost of boats and, secondly, in respect of the percentage that must be paid before a boat is supplied.  I know that any person who would be provided with a boat and gear for the purpose of engaging in the fishing industry should be prepared to show his enthusiasm by paying a certain amount of money as a guarantee that he is a person to whom a boat should be issued and who will honour his obligation. It has been put to me that the percentage that must be deposited is <Col N="1979" /> a heavy burden on the individual.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will bear that in mind and will try to meet the fishermen in the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because of the financial provisions contained in it.  I hope that, as a result of the operation of the Bill, the fishing industry will be placed in its proper position and will receive the support it merits both from the general public and the responsible authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are very few Deputies who are as familiar as the Parliamentary Secretary with the problems which face the country in connection with the revival of the fishing industry.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary feels really happy and satisfied that this Bill will accomplish what he so ardently desires and what the country as a whole would like to see taking place?</P>
      <P>Much as I regret to have to say it, I think it is only right that we should all be clear on one point so far as the fishing industry as a whole is concerned, and that is, that the real decline in the fishing industry took place in this country as soon as the people of the Twenty-Six Counties got control of that portion of our land.  It is regrettable that that should be the case, that that decline commenced when the British were kicked out of this part of the country and has continued down the years.</P>
      <P>It may be that those men who were responsible for the Government of this country since it achieved the measure of political freedom which we have to-day were busy on other matters such as painting our letter-boxes green or dealing with matters of a political nature rather than with the serious economic matters such as our fishing industry and agriculture.  It is an extraordinary thing that the fishing industry, which should be to-day second only to that of agriculture, is now something that has only those Deputies to a great extent, at any rate, who come from seaboard areas interest themselves to speak on this important matter.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported, I was dealing with the gibe which the Minister for Finance had seen fit to throw at me for the suggested figure of £50,000,000 as the adverse trade balance of last year.  I had quoted exactly what I had said in the debate on the White Paper on the Supplies and Services Bill.  It is interesting, however, to note the manner in which the £66,000,000 that was referred to this afternoon by the Minister for Finance has been come by.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 28 of the White Paper, which was issued last year by the Department of Finance, they arrived, after making certain assumptions, at the view that the import surplus for the whole year would, on these assumptions, amount to £129,000,000. Having arrived at that total for the import surplus, the White Paper proceeds, in the following paragraph, to deal with items on invisible account, invisible exports as they are called, emigrant remittances, tourism and other matters of that kind.  That paragraph reaches the conclusion that the total of these invisible exports for the year 1950 would be £56.8 million.  In a further part of the same paragraph, having again made certain assumptions and calculations, the White Paper comes to the conclusion that the items on invisible account, invisible exports for the year in question, 1951, would be £60,000,000, a little over £1,000,000 greater than the year 1950.  Accordingly, deducting from the import surplus of £129,000,000 the £60,000,000 on invisible account the item of £69,00,000 was reached as the estimated deficit.  In paragraph 30 they have rounded up the figure to bring it in the region of £70,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When accurate figures and statistics were available, it transpired, in fact, that those responsible for the compilation of the White Paper had made a little error of £6,000,000 in their estimate of the import surplus for the year 1951 and that the import surplus, instead of being £129,000,000, was, in fact, £123,000,000.  If the deduction <Col N="1981" /> which they had made in the White Paper of £60,000,000 for invisible items was made, the deficit would be £63,000,000.  It was coming down very drastically from the sum of £70,000,000 but it did not suit the Minister or his advisers.  What did they do?  Instead of deducting on their own figure of £60,000,000 for the estimated items of invisible exports they deducted the figure for 1950 which they had stated in the White Paper at paragraph 28 as £56.8 million and they reached the figure of £66.2 million.  £66,000,000 is the figure that the Minister mentioned to-day.</P>
    <P>That is no reliable estimate because what, in fact, was done, as I have demonstrated, was that the Department of Finance, its officials or whoever it was compiled the figure of £129,000,000 for the import surplus, having been proved wrong with the estimate of £6,000,000, tried to cover up this error and get a bigger deficit in the £63,000,000 by taking the 1950 figure instead of their own figure for 1951.</P>
    <P>Of course, in any event, these figures for balance of payments and balance of trade are only estimates at best as I indicated in a speech I made last November on the Supplies and Services Bill and which I quoted to-day. They are not made with any degree approaching accuracy until six or eight months after the close of the financial year.  We will await with interest final figures by our own independent statistics office when they are in the position to do it independently and on their own.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in the opening part of his statement to-day, tried to cast aspersions on the financial probity of his predecessor, Mr. McGilligan, the Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government.  He tried to show this volume of Estimates we are discussing on this Vote on Account really shows a startling decrease in expenditure and, of course, nobody is to bother about the fact that, whereas both capital items and ordinary supply and other services amounted, in the year 1951-52, as disclosed on the outside of the Book of Estimates for that financial year, to the sum of £81,361,000, the figure for this year is £94,871,623, and that that <Col N="1982" /> startling increase of something over £13,500,000 is not really an increase at all because they are savings really that are explicable by the financial trickery of the last Government.</P>
    <P>Before this debate is over, it will be established again what was established before in the course of the debate on the Supply and Services Bill and the White Paper that Deputy McGilligan's last Budget of his last year would not merely balance but would probably show a surplus.  Every effort that has been made, every device that can be employed will not conceal that fact.  I have the figures before me to prove it, but as I have other matters to speak about to-night I do not want to take up the time of the House too long. Deputy McGilligan demonstrated last year, on the Supplies and Services Bill, that his Budget would balance and that every suggestion of financial trickery that was made by the Minister for Finance at that time was false, untrue and disproved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce replied on that debate and this is a significant fact, he is no mean debater.  All the Minister for Industry and Commerce could say about the figures that were produced at that time by Deputy McGillian in defence of his financial policy and in proof of the fact that his Budget balanced and was framed and devised on strictly correct financial principles was that he was not going to deal with figures.  Before this debate runs its course, these figures will again be brought before the House and every allegation of trickery so easily made by the present Minister for Finance and so falsely put forward will again be demonstrated to be untrue. We have had experience that it is very difficult to catch up on a lie.  That allegation against my colleague.  Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, has been repeated over and over again throughout the country notwithstanding the fact that at last we have got it into the heads of the people that the present Minister is more concerned with casting aspersions on the financial policy of Deputy McGilligan than he is in safeguarding the credit and the interests of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> May I just refer to one or two matters to demonstrate the confusion that has been caused by the method adopted in the Book of Estimates for the coming financial year?  I shall have occasion later to deal with the abandonment of the policy of the segregation of the items of capital and current account.  There is only one figure on the face of the Book of Estimates for this year and an effort is made throughout the book to suggest that the only real increase over last year's bill that was presented to the taxpayers and that ultimately had to be paid by them either in the original Book of Estimates or in the Supplementary Estimates was a comparatively small sum of something over £600,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance glibly talks about financial tricks.  I do not like to use these expressions but I use one on this occasion.  I say that it is little less than a trick on the part of those who are responsible for the compilation of this Book of Estimates to put in, as part of our Estimates for last year&mdash;as an item that ought to have been dealt with in one year, and that last year&mdash;the figure for the fuel subsidy to which reference was made by the Minister for Finance in his opening statement to-day.  The House and the country have already got the history of that subsidy and of the appalling burden it signified when we came into office in 1948.  At that time it was something over £5,000,000.  It was reduced. There were some losses involved by reason of the fact that some portions of the fuel dumps could not be sold at any price and would not even be taken away for nothing.  Because of the shortage of British coal, a certain salvage was made towards the end of our term of office.  Here, however, the sum of £3,080,000 appears, if you please, as an item that was in our Book of Estimates for one year, and that last year.  There is no justification, even from the mouldy principles of officialdom in the Department of Finance, for putting that item there.  To adopt the phraseology of the Minister for Finance, it is financial trickery.  That £3,080,000 represents the residue of a <i>damnosa haereditas</i><Col N="1984" /> that was foisted upon us by the previous Fianna Fáil Government, and, from over £5,000,000, it was reduced to a little over £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in this House&mdash; and he has been charged with it repeatedly and has not denied it&mdash;that it was not an item that should be paid out of current taxation.  &ldquo;Put it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as part of the national debt, and you will be well out of it and the country will be better out of the war than any other country in the world.&rdquo; Of course, it was part of the national debt, and Deputy McGilligan intended it to become part of the national debt when he had salvaged as much as he could out of sales and so forth.  But it is put in here by way of a reduction of their Estimates this year and to show how careful they have been in their estimating this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to-day to the provision with reference to housing in the Local Government Vote.  As he said himself, that was only an apparent decrease.  It was quite apparent that it was only an apparent decrease, but it was brought in here in order to delude those people who are trying to find out the real truth behind that volume of Estimates into thinking that there was a reduction in the Minister's Bill.  It was our policy&mdash;and we had started to take the initial steps and even to bring them very near to completion&mdash;to recast the entire finances of the housing programme.  What is happening here is that, surreptitiously, the present Government are carrying out our housing financial policy, which is part of our capital programme.  They are really carrying out our capital programme and hiding it by a device of an apparent decrease in the Book of Estimates.  Similarly with regard to the land rehabilitation scheme.  From the figures in this Book of Estimates it would appear that more money was being provided this year for the land rehabilitation scheme than was provided by Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, last year, and that, therefore, there is a reduction in the Bill which is being presented to the taxpayers under this heading.  That is not the fact at all.  It is done by juggling <Col N="1985" /> the figures into another Estimate&mdash;the Agricultural Estimate, I believe.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the £200,000 for, I think, the ground limestone subsidy. That appears as an account in the Book of Estimates.  Of course, that was part of the Marshall Aid grant. It was never intended or designed to be a tax on the taxpayers at all.  That £200,000 was part of the moneys that were coming to us as a credit grant from the people of the United States. It was agreed between the then Minister for Agriculture (Deputy Dillon) and Mr. Millar, who was the head of the E.C.A. Administration in this country, that, in anticipation of the schemes which would be ratified between this country and the United States with reference to the expenditure of that grant, £200,000 would be allocated to lime subsidy for the farmers.  That was to go as a free grant to the Irish farmers from the people of the United States.  I shall have occasion later on to speak about the Minister's handling of the Marshall Aid funds, and of this fund in particular. That sum of £200,000 should not appear in these accounts at all.  It was never intended to be paid by the taxpayer, either as an annual sum or as a capital item.  It was a free grant to the Irish people but in order to delude, deceive and confuse those people who wish to understand the scope of these Estimates&mdash;what is behind them and if any policy is behind them&mdash;that item is dragged in.</P>
    <P>I take just these few items as an indication of the manner in which this Book of Estimates has been presented to the public and as indicating the policy behind the financial efforts of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues. The sole purpose and desire of it, as I said earlier, is to score politically off their political opponents and to try and make it appear to the people of the country&mdash;even at the expense of destroying our credit, both at home and abroad&mdash;that there is something fundamentally wrong with the credit and the financial structure of this State.  That procedure has done almost irreparable harm.  That is a slight indication of the confusion which <Col N="1986" /> is intended to be brought about by this Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, almost copying the jargon that has become fashionable in British financial circles, spoke about the dreary picture of austerity we would have to put up with in order to secure that prosperity which is supposed always to be around the corner.  So far, whatever schemes the Minister may have in view further to depress this country and to prevent that development of its resources which is the real answer to our difficulties, and not the nonsense that is coming from the Minister for Finance and his antediluvian advisers, the only contribution we have been told about is the reduction of the travel allowance to £25.  I want to make a protest against that reduction, and I assert here that, if we were in office, we would not have allowed that reduction. This reduction in the travel allowance will give practically no help towards the solution of whatever problems the Minister has or thinks he has, whatever problems have been created in his mind by the fevered imagination of officials of the Department of Finance, officials who think that Ministers who are charged with a certain responsibility are not capable of doing their job, and that a gloomy picture must be always kept before them in case they expend a few pounds on the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>I protest against this reduction.  I describe it as a symbol of the step by step policy which the Minister for Finance has initiated and is carrying into effect&mdash;step by step with Britain. This is a symbol of our financial dependence on Britain.  We had fixed £100 as our travel allowance.  The British reduced that by £50, and within a few days our allowance was reduced by £50.  The British recently reduced theirs to £25.  It would not have looked too well for the Government perhaps if ours were reduced as quickly as the previous allowance had been reduced, but it was reported in the newspapers, and correctly reported as it now transpires, that it was intended to reduce further the travel allowance here to £25.  Whether that was done following upon the Minister's <Col N="1987" /> exchange with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, or whether it was for the purpose of bolstering up the gloomy prognostications with which he has flooded the country in the last few months, or for other reasons, I cannot say, but out he comes with it as a contribution towards the strenthening of the £.  His colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in a recent speech, spoke about our contribution to the strengthening of the British £.</P>
    <P>This is our contribution so far to the sacred cow of sterling.  I protest against it as a retrograde step.  Our young people have been deprived through wars and through difficulties caused by this war-peace, from the educational facilities that they require, from the acquistion of the culture that they need in order to fertilise our own country and our own ideas.  The Minister for Finance threw the gibe across the House at Deputy Dillon that it was only the rich people who took advantage of these travel allowances.  If the Minister for Finance would get himself out of the false and artificial atmosphere engendered in his Department and would get down the country now and again, he would know that it is not rich people only who go away to the Continent.  It is the ordinary people who save money out of their wages and salaries in order to go to Lourdes and Rome and, incidentally, to see other places on the Continent, to educate themselves and to broaden their intellects.</P>
    <P>It would be a very good thing for the people of this country if foreign travel were put more within their scope.  Our outlook would be different; our ideas would be broadened.  Contact with people abroad would show us how much more contended we should be and how happier we are than many people on the Continent of Europe.  I think that, apart from the spiritual benefits that flowed to numerous people in this country who went to Rome during the Holy Year, and who took advantage of the pilgrimage to see other parts of the Continent, great benefit accrued to this country from the fact that so <Col N="1988" /> many people were able to see the circumstances in Italy, the hard work that the Italian people had to put in to rehabilitate themselves after the damage and havoc caused by the war and even by the peace.  They were enabled to see the problems of France and Germany and to see the conditions under which even the British people who won the war had to subsist.</P>
    <P>We do not want to be dependent upon British culture alone.  I have the greatest respect for English literature, art, poetry and the English way of life. I think it is a very good thing that we should know of these things but we have every facility for getting to Britain, indeed far too many facilities. It is on behalf of the ordinary working people, the middle-class people, who want to go away to see for themselves what the conditions are in Europe, to broaden their mental horizons and to enrich their cultural aspirations, that I think this mouldy conception should be set aside.  Certainly, so far as I am concerned, I enter the strongest possible protest against it.  We are supposed to be relying as one of the great factors in reducing the gap in the balance of payments, which is an obsession of the Minister for Finance, on tourists to this country.  How can we expect to attract tourists from abroad when we take the retrograde step of preventing our own people from becoming tourists in other countries?  How do we expect that our young people growing up can broaden their mental horizons and can gain that breadth of vision which is so essential to this country if it is not to sink into that state of insularity into which it is in danger of sinking, if our young people do not travel?  I think that this particular item, small as it is, is merely an indication of the obsession of the Minister for Finance in regard to the problems which he thinks confronts this country.  There are problems, serious problems, facing us, but are they the same kind of problems, requiring precisely the same type of solution as the problems which confront Great Britain?  I have repeatedly emphasised in speeches which I have made recently that there are fundamental differences between the ills which afflict our <Col N="1989" /> economy and those which are eating into the economic and financial structure of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Our problem is the problem of the development of our resources.  Our problem is the fact that we have suffered here in this country for years from this: that we have large resources in men and land underdeveloped and awaiting development. That is our problem.  That is what we have to face, and that is what the Minister will not face.  We say that it is the height of folly for any Irish Government to initiate and to apply to the circumstances in this country, which are entirely different from those in Great Britain, techniques which the British in their dire distress have to apply in the solution of their own British problems.  I think we may express not merely a passing admiration but a sincere few words of genuine admiration for the courage with which the British have faced the problems which confront them, and for the ordinary people of Great Britain who have suffered so long since the last war with very little hope of prosperity round the corner.</P>
    <P>I want here again very shortly to indicate in this House and to repeat what I have already said in the country, so that it may be clear to everybody's mind, the principal distinctions between this country's problems and those of Great Britain.  As I have said before to-day, we have a problem in the balance of payments.  There was a crisis with the Minister for Finance last year.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, sought to solve it down to a problem.  It is an obsession with the present Minister for Finance.  The long-term problem with us, a problem that requires to be carefully watched, a problem which does not and ought not to obtrude itself as it is obtruding itself too much in the consideration of our financial and economic difficulties, is development.</P>
    <P>The British problem is different. We are a creditor country.  Great Britain is a debtor country&mdash;perhaps the greatest debtor country in the entire world.  Britain's debt amounts to five times her external assets. <Col N="1990" /> Ireland's external assets amount to a very considerable sum and will remain at that figure for a very considerable period in spite of the horrors which the Minister for Finance and his colleagues have tried to conjure up in the last few months.  Our external assets will remain for very many years, even though we have a policy to put into operation, a policy to put apparently to be put into the limbo of forgotten things, a policy for the repatriation of our external assets.  The gap in the balance of our payments, as I pointed out before, is merely a method of getting what we ought to have got during the war&mdash;goods in return for our produce that we sent to Britain during the war and for which we only got depreciated and depreciating British sterling.</P>
    <P>Great Britain is hungry for foreign capital and it cannot get it.  Foreign capital is seeping in here pretty gradually and pretty steadily but it is frowned upon, certainly by the policy of the present Ministers and their advisers.  The national debt of Great Britain is two and a half times its national income.  Our national debt is half our national income.  We could multiply by five that national debt, and if we did so in relation to our national income we would not be any worse off than Britain is at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I have said that our problem is development. Great Britain has reached a degree of productivity that it will take us years, if not centuries, to reach.  Great Britain is an economically mature country.  Our country is under-developed.  It is crying out for development and for capital expenditure. That capital expenditure is being denied by the change in policy which is shown in the Book of Estimates this year.  We can get here in this country a greater yield and a better return for capital expenditure upon our development than Great Britain can upon her investments.  We are perhaps the only country in Western Europe that has not got an investment trust.  Great Britain was the money market of the world for years and is replete with financial institutions of the kind I have referred to.</P>
    <P>We all know the policy of our <Col N="1991" /> present bankers and banking systems. We know that they want to keep their liquid reserves in Great Britain instead of investing them in this country.  The banking system of this country is based on taking in the deposits of our farmers and the savings of the people and of sending them to England to invest them in English securities, mostly trustee securities.  Instead of investing them here in this country, they invest them in trustee or other securities abroad.  That is not what Britain does with any loose money that may be available to her.</P>
    <P>We are a food-producing country. Great Britain is an industrial country in a world that is starving for food and that is crying out for agricultural produce.  If we take the proper steps, we have unlimited markets before us. We have unlimited capacity for production and for the sale of our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his plaitudinous peroration this afternoon, spoke about the necessity for more production and more exports. We have been listening to that for months.  What is wanted is not appeals to the farmers to work harder.  That is irritating talk.  The farmers work very hard.  As I said in Carlow last Sunday, they work too hard, having regard to the conditions under which they have to work.  Mere talk about production is not sufficient.  What is wanted is a policy for production, and that is not forthcoming from the present Government.</P>
    <P>We have here in this country hopes which we trust will be fulfilled for the further development of our tourist industry.  Does anybody think that such an industry can be developed and fostered and brought to the point where we would wish to have it, and where the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, said he wished it to be the other evening&mdash;second to our agricultural industry?  In fact, he would even like to see it producing more money than our agricultural industry, if one is to read between the lines of his utterances.  Can such an industry be developed under austerity conditions? The British Industries Fair was a <Col N="1992" /> failure because of the austerity conditions under which it was held.  How are we going to gain that huge amount of money which we trust will come our way if tourists from abroad are to find themselves faced with austerity conditions in this country&mdash;unemployment, unrest, uncertainty and confusion such as exist to-day?</P>
    <P>May I again revert to the Minister's bogey, the gap in the balance of payments, and his horror of our policy for the repatriation of external assets and the dark and gloomy conditions caused by last year's deficit?  If, as we all hope, there will be a large influx of tourists into this country this year, then we will be thanking God and, incidentally, the last Government, for that gap in our balance of payments of which such complaint is made now.  At the present moment, industrialists are producing more goods and cannot sell them.  The merchants have their shops stocked with goods.  That was brought about by the policy that resulted in portion of this gap, by stockpiling.  If the tourists come in their millions, as we hope they will, these goods will be there for them to buy in foreign currencies that we need so badly.  If the austerity programme that the Minister for Finance wishes to impose unnecessarily upon the people is given its full scope from where will the goods come with which we hope to lure the foreign currency out of the pockets of the tourists?</P>
    <P>We have had a spate of oratory, addresses and talks about the dangers of inflation here.  No words were too picturesque to paint the dangers facing us from this evil of inflation.  Of course we have inflation here, as everybody knows who has felt upon him and his family the impact of the cost of living.  Of course, there is inflation in Great Britain.  Last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer got something like £500,000,000 sterling as a surplus on his Budget.  He budgeted through taxation on the people of Great Britain to produce to the Exchequer something in the region of £500,000,000 sterling.  That was not enough to deal with the situation then and the economists were crying out that that was not enough and that there should be <Col N="1993" /> more.  Yesterday's British Budget was the answer to that&mdash;more austerity and more taxation in order to produce a greater surplus still than that colossal surplus of revenue over expenditure in the region of £500,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is the old tag of too much money chasing too little goods.  There is too much money in Great Britain because of the rearmament policy and because of the policy of restriction on imports. That is what is causing inflation and bringing about all the evils that such a type of inflation is bound to bring about.</P>
    <P>We have not got that type of inflation here.  If one asks any business man here are there too many people with too much money looking for too few goods he will laugh in your face: there are too many goods and too little money here at the present moment. One of the results of the so-called financial policy of the Minister for Finance and of his speeches over the last eight or nine months has been to create in the people here a sales resistance; they will not buy goods and they are forcing prices down to a point where shopkeepers and business concerns are losing money.  That is not the same type of inflation as exists in England.  The Minister for Finance wants to get away with the idea that inflation is such an evil, such a terror and such a danger to the poorer sections of our community he must tax. He will try to get away with it on the excuse that in order to save the people from the evils of inflation we must tax and the people must put up with increased taxation.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for additional taxation here by reason of the type of inflation from which we are suffering.  It is a cost inflation largely imported from abroad but to some considerable extent of our own creation, too, because of tariff policies and tariffs and because of decreasing production to a certain extent, and the failure to produce sufficient to meet even the requirements of the home market.  It is a cost inflation.  It is not a type of inflation that can be cured by increased taxation.  It will only be exacerbated by that.  Increased <Col N="1994" /> taxation will increase the cost of living; it will increase the price of goods and materials and it will create again the vicious spiral with a demand for higher wages chasing higher costs. Instead of easing that particular type of inflation taxation, which is apparently appropriate for the British type of inflation and for the British problems, is entirely out of place in our economy and for our purpose.</P>
    <P>I have given some indications of the difference between our problems because practically every day I see indications that the present Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, are obsessed with British conditions and British methods and with British political and financial theories.  They seem to think that because there is that problem of inflation in England there is a danger in our touching the £ and we must therefore do something that the British are doing.  I emphasise once more that our problems are different and, therefore, our approach must be different.  I assert that the approach of the Minister for Finance, as demonstrated by his speeches and by his policy, so far as one can find a policy, in the Book of Estimates for the year 1952-53, is one that is based upon British financial theories, British conditions and outworn economic concepts.</P>
    <P>Economic policy is indivisible.  This Book of Estimates as it is framed and presented to us contains a jumble of supply services and capital projects. There is no way in which anyone examining that document can dissect its contents in order to arrive with any degree of accuracy at a segregation of those items which are properly appropriate to current expenditure from those properly appropriate to capital expenditure.  We cannot really discuss this Book of Estimates and the policy that is supposed to be enshrined in it when our energies and our minds are diverted from what we should really be considering and discussing.</P>
    <P>This Book of Estimates represents a radical departure from the policy enshrined in the Book of Estimates for the two previous years.  We segregated items appropriate for current expenditure from items appropriate for capital <Col N="1995" /> expenditure and we indicated in each of these two books what items we intended as appropriate for financing through taxation in the current financial year, and we showed separately and in particular detail the items we considered appropriate to be dealt with through the medium of asking our people to give us, as a Government, their free savings for investment in Irish capital development projects.</P>
    <P>Capital items in a Budget ought to be the same as capital items in a Book of Estimates dealing with the supply services.  There is no difference between them, and when we are discussing here on this Vote on Account the financial policy of the Government, as enshrined in the Book of Estimates, we ought to be in a position to say that that, that, that and that are capital items and the remainder are appropriate for Government to discharge out of taxation in the current year.  The ordinary Book of Estimates and the annual Budget deal with only about one-fifth of the country's economic activity.  We believed that it was accepted economic theory that it was the Government's responsibility, not only to treat the people as taxpayers, but also as producers and consumers, and that each year's Budget should not merely allocate part of its public finances to its current yearly housekeeping expenses, but should also ensure that, as a matter of policy, the resources of the nation should be developed in the manner that best suits our own needs and requirements.</P>
    <P>To give effect to that policy, we initiated the segregation in the Estimates of items of capital account and current account, and followed it with the double Budget.  We then told Deputies and the people through this House: &ldquo;There is what we propose to spend capital moneys on; that is what we say should be paid out of taxation.&rdquo;  We asked and invited criticism on each and every particular item that we said was apt for capital expenditure, and we never got a single criticism of any item that we proposed to finance, not out of the ordinary taxation, but out of the free savings of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> That policy has been reversed in this year's annual Estimates.  It has been reversed, not because anything has been proved to have been wrong with that policy of the dual Budget or with capital expenditure on development of the nation's resources but because the present Government would not admit that there was something good in the policy that had been initiated and devised by their predecessors, and for that reason alone.</P>
    <P>What we should be doing here to-day is, not talking about our balance of payments in the way the Minister talked about it to-day, but finding a policy for it, not painting the gloomy picture which had been unnecessarily done by the Minister but finding means by which our undoubted existing problems can properly and adequately be dealt with.  The problem of the balance of payments should not obtrude itself in the way that the Minister has allowed it to obtrude in the last few months.  We should not be dominated in our consideration of our financial and economic position and policy by that one single item.</P>
    <P>If increased production, particularly increased agricultural production, can be brought about, we will have gone very far on the way to rid ourselves of this spectre of the gap in our balance of payments and if we can find some policy for production, both in our agricultural sector and in our industrial sector, then we need not be talking in these melodramatic phrases which come so trippingly off the tongue of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We are suffering from unemployment of men and unemployment of resources, particularly on the land.  We cannot get the increased agricultural production that everybody admits is so urgently required unless there is a proper policy devised for that production. We can get that production that the Minister is calling for only by a proper policy for home investment and that proper policy for home investment can be got either from private savings or from public investment.  You will not get in this country investment of a private character by private individuals as long as the uncertainty which exists in this country to-day continues, an uncertainty, I repeat, <Col N="1997" /> which has been brought about by the efforts of the present Minister and his colleagues, who have been painting an unnecessarily gloomy picture of the finances and prospects of this country, as if we were living in post-war England.  The private investor is afraid of additional taxation.  There has been talk of nothing else since the present Government came into office but additional taxation.</P>
    <P>It was the policy of the inter-Party Government to reduce taxation because we knew that increased taxation lent its weight to increasing the cost of living, and to making worse the problems of inflation and the unemployment position.  We reached a condition in which we were able to say without contradiction that we had attained the nearest point to full employment that had ever been reached in this country.</P>
    <P>Now we have the position where there is uncertainty in business, unrest in agriculture, confusion generally, and unemployment mounting.  Is that the time for a fundamental change in financial policy merely for the purpose of scoring off the policy of the Government's predecessors?</P>
    <P>Public investment cannot be secured unless the necessary moneys are forthcoming. Because of all the talk that there has been about high taxation, because of the fact that the Minister and his colleagues announced months ago that they were going to reverse our policy of productive capital expenditure, and particularly because the Government failed in their public duty and their solemn trust to go to the public for a loan to finance the necessary projects of productive capital expenditure, it would be very difficult now to continue any policy of productive public investment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan announced in his Budget last year that it was his intention, if returned to office, immediately to go for a loan from the people.  In the course of his administration as Minister for Finance, he adopted principles of strict financial probity. Three times he came to the Irish public asking for their savings.  In the matter of public investment the Government of which he was Finance Minister <Col N="1998" /> financed those projects of productive capital expenditure, first, by means of the free savings of the people lodged in trustee savings banks, in post office savings banks and in Savings Certificates. Those moneys, significant in amount as they undoubtedly were, were not sufficient for the purposes of public investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance went to the people for a loan and told the people what he wanted their money for, and he thereby secured two things of very fundamental importance to the financial economy and stability of the country. There was loose money knocking around, moneys uninvested.  By asking the people for those savings and getting them as he did get them from the people, he mopped up that loose money which would otherwise or might otherwise have gone into consumer goods. He did something else&mdash;he got the people used and growingly accustomed to the notion of investment in Irish productive enterprises.  He was getting that into their minds.  It is now stopped and impeded by the financial policy of the present Government.  On the first loan that he went for he told the banks to keep out of it.  He wanted money. He wanted the ordinary people who had savings to give them to the Irish Government in order to put them into the development of Irish resources, capital expenditure and Irish enterprises. He got the money from them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second loan he went for, he told the banks not to give any overdrafts, and told them not to allow any realisation or cashing of sterling assets, and to get in as much as they could of free savings that were otherwise not in use.  He got the money from them.  He assisted in keeping in check any such problem of inflation as afflicts the British economy at the present moment.</P>
    <P>In respect of the third loan, which was his last and biggest loan, he procured the biggest individual subscription from the Irish people that was ever got by any Government or by any Minister for Finance in this country. He told the banks to keep out of it, but if they wanted to they could let in a certain amount of their own sterling assets from abroad.  Ultimately, he would have gone last year <Col N="1999" /> for another loan, and had the present Minister for Finance sought a loan last July, as he ought to have done before the market crashed, he would have certainly got it from the people. We would certainly have co-operated with him and helped him, little as we thought of him and his policy.  Had the Minister for Finance sought this loan, he would have got, on far more advantageous conditions than ever he will get again, the savings of the Irish people, but he will never get anything like the money he wants at the present time under such favourable conditions. The failure of the Minister for Finance to go for a loan last year is a sort of financial crime against this country and uncertainty has been created by the reversal of the financial policy of the present Government.  This talk about an artificial crisis has nearly brought about a real crisis and it will adversely affect the chances of the present Minister for Finance if he ever goes to the country for a loan.  That talk about an artificial crisis had disastrous effects on the finances of this country.  The Minister for Finance said to-day that every penny of the £26,000,000 of the Marshall Aid that the previous Government left behind is gone.</P>

      <P>With that particular outlook on financial and economic matters how could the Government hope for any stability or confidence if they were to seek a loan at the moment?  What is wanted is a clear-cut policy which we had and which the present Government has not got.  That policy was based, when we had charge of it, upon the recognition of the necessity for inculcating into our people the habit of savings.  We recognise&mdash;the present Government does not do so&mdash;that there can be no real investment policy for this country unless it is based upon the savings of the people. We appealed to the people for their free savings and got them, and when they were not enough we asked them to save more.</P>
      <P>We initiated plans last year, as part of our budgetary policy, for a nationwide campaign for more savings and the encouragement of savings.  What has become of that policy?  It was a policy that was not favoured by the officialdom of the Department of Finance, who have no figures for savings later than the year 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the official view.  Everybody knows that there is an official view in every Department.  It is put up as an official view by the officials themselves.  I am speaking of that view.  Certainly, I may say in passing, that extraordinary institution, the Central Bank, never crossed my mind since I stood up to speak to-day.  The official view, if I may say so, would be pressed upon any Minister no matter what Government he might belong to.  It would be the duty of every official to give that view. That is what civil servants are for.  It is for the Minister to make up his mind.  A Minister will get the official view whether it be the policy of the Government or not.  I am contrasting the policy which we had in reference to savings as against the official view.  The official view was against the policy of savings.  That is indicated by the fact that there are no figures for savings, that I know of, later than the year 1949.  It is very convenient that, in this note inside the Book of Estimates where they speak of savings, the reference to savings is in a threatening form &mdash;a factor which might hereafter be employed to justify recourse to finance capital projects through annual taxation.</P>
      <P>This Government has done nothing about getting a national loan.  It has done nothing about encouraging people to give them their savings.  I have no doubt that, before the end of this year's financial discussions, the fact that the 1951 year's estimate&mdash;it can be nothing else&mdash;of the amount of savings was so small will be used as an excuse for additional taxation.</P>
      <P>I have said earlier in my remarks that we are one of the few countries in Western Europe with no institution of the nature of an investment trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated our policy of going for small savings in the Post Office Savings Bank and in savings certificates, and then of going for a loan.  As the development of our resources continues&mdash;as it ought to continue and be continued&mdash;all these sources will not be sufficient to finance the development of land and other projects in the manner in which they ought to be developed. It is quite clear that our policy could <Col N="2004" /> not have been met out of the current savings of the people.  The policy of the present Government, apparently, is that there are not sufficient savings by the people. &ldquo;We are opposed,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;to the notion of repatriating our external assets and to a gap in our balance of payments.  Therefore, we tax.&rdquo;  We, on this side of the House, repudiate that policy and say: &ldquo;Get the savings of the people either through savings certificates or the Post Office Savings Bank or trustee banks or loans.  If you cannot do that then repatriate your sterling assets.  Bring back some of your standing army that is lying idle in Britain.&rdquo;  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to our external assets as &ldquo;a standing army of reserves in Britain&rdquo;.  Let us be very careful that these reserves are not Dunkirked and that we shall not have to salvage, as at Dunkirk, what portion we can while the going is good.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, we have ample reserves abroad&mdash;reserves which need not be exhausted and which, with a proper policy, can be husbanded.  But if there is going to be a further depreciation in sterling then the sooner we get our standing army of reserves out of Britain the better, and bring that money home here and increase the nation's productive capacity.  Certainly, in present world financial circumstances, it should not be our policy to hang on to reserves of sterling assets until the last depreciated assets has gone its sepreciated way.  We never had any particular concern or fear about repatriating our external assets because we had a prudent policy for it, and safeguards for the dangers that lay inherent in that policy, and we laid them down and made them public. We still believe that it is better policy prudently to repatriate such portion of our external assets as we may require for productive enterprise in Ireland than to allow them to depreciate further in Britain.  We realise that a necessary reserve must be maintained there to sustain our currency so long as it is linked with sterling, but what that particular standard of safety must be or should be is a matter of opinion.  We do not agree with the chairman of the Central Bank that we <Col N="2005" /> must maintain such a degree of liquidity as will meet a situation in which every person on the one single day and at the one single time will walk into the Bank of England and demand a British £ for an Irish £.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been very active in his constituency in making pronouncements on economic matters.  He referred to what he called &ldquo;our contribution towards strengthening the position of sterling on the international money market.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Minister for Finance indicated in his letter to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer what that contribution is going to be. He did not speak about it at all to-day.  What was the British Chancellor of the Exchequer told and what was the Minister for Finance told during that exchange of views?  Was the Minister for Finance told that there was going to be further devaluation or that the £ was going to be put on the free market in accordance with traditional Treasury policy?</P>
    <P>What was he told?  What is our position at the moment in regard to that £ with which we are so vitally concerned?  It is a remarkable fact that the Minister did not make a single reference throughout his entire speech to the position of sterling or to the steps that were being taken to bring about a position whereby sterling would be freely convertible again. What does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs mean when he refers to our contribution to that problem?  We are vitally interested in it, as everybody knows, because we are linked with sterling and because our standing army of reserves is depreciating over there. Before the outbreak of war in 1939 sterling was a great international convertible currency.  It had to its credit a very notable history.  Even in the period between the two wars, when there were so many international crises, it proved itself a match for every international currency.  While that was the position there was no real reason why we should have any misgivings about our close association and link with sterling.</P>
    <P>I take it that we established that link with sterling because it suited our <Col N="2006" /> interests to do so.  If it were established for any other reason it would be certainly deplorable.  I assume it was done because it suited our interests. Whether we shall continue that link with sterling entirely depends on whether it suits our interests or not. Therefore it is vital for us to know is it in accordance with our interests as a nation that we should continue that link in existing circumstances with the dangers that threaten the British £? We want to know the facts because we shall have to judge the effects on our interests of these facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Our interests are undoubtedly very closely identified with the sterling system.  What we have to ensure&mdash;I wonder what is the Minister's contribution to ensuring it?&mdash;is that that depreciating foreign investment can be best utilised to suit our own requirements.  Whatever the future of sterling may be, whether it is in accordance with our own vital financial interests to maintain the link with sterling or whether we should bring back our &ldquo;standing army&rdquo; and break the link with sterling&mdash;whatever be the final result, there is no question that what is wanted here is productive investment.  The contribution of the present Government to that method of solving our problems&mdash;without austerity, without the nonsense that has been going on for the last nine months&mdash;the contribution which this Book of Estimates gives is merely to prepare the way for the abandonment of the programme of capital expenditure and to provide for heavy taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made out a figure of £50,000,000 to-day as a deficit which would face this country at the end of the year.  I do not know where that £50,000,000 is to be got.  It cannot be got but, of course, the Minister knows that there is no such thing as a deficit of £50,000,000 on that Book of Estimates.  It is part of the game of playacting.  What has happened is that the Minister has put into the Book of Estimates all the capital items and all the current items and mixed them up so that nobody can disentangle <Col N="2007" /> them.  Nobody can say what is capital and what is current, and he has reverted to the old jargon, common in financial circles before our policy of distingushing between capital and current expenditure in the dual Budget was put into effect, of above and below the line expenditure.  Of course, the object is to let nobody know what is above the line or below the line.</P>
    <P>What we should be doing here is discussing whether particular items are proper for financing through taxation or should be treated as capital expenditure.  We should be discussing if there is anything which should come in as a capital item.  We should be discussing priorities, and ways and means of developing the country through the medium of the capital Budget and capital developmental expenditure. Instead of that, we have all jumbled up in order to present us with a fictitious deficit of £50,000,000, which can be utilised as a screen behind which the Minister can impose heavy taxation on the people in an unnecessary fashion, and so get away with the excuse that it was necessary to do so because of the appalling financial situation in which he found himself.</P>
    <P>We shall approach the consideration of these Estimates of expenditure, particularly those items of the below-the-line issue, with profound suspicion because we believe that they are inflated Estimates.  The set-up, the plan, would be to show in this Book of Estimates current Estimates reduced apparently to the lowest possible figure and then the below-the-line items inflated and the result achieved of a £50,000,000, deficit, in order to justify the imposition of greatly increased taxation or alternatively that people can say: &ldquo;Oh, the Minister had a £50,000,000, deficit.  After all he did not impose as much taxation as we thought he was going to impose upon us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have always proclaimed our policy of balancing, in accordance with strict principles of financial rectitude, the current Budget but we deny that <Col N="2008" /> there is any rectitude involved in the fashion in which the Minister presents the Estimates for the coming financial year.  The Minister will get no cooperation, at all events from Deputies who belong to this Party, for increased taxation in accordance with the policy which he declared to-day and in the last few weeks.  We have never denied that certain types of capital expenditure for productive purposes might eventually be financed out of taxation but we do assert that the policy we adopted of segregating items of capital and current expenditure in the dual Budget was the proper method and the one that produced best results. They can be pointed to and cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the utilisation by the present Government of the moneys in the Counterpart Fund.  The methods by which Deputy McGilligan financed capital projects was, as I have partially indicated, that he got whatever free savings were available from the Post Office Savings Banks, the trustee savings banks, and Savings Certificates and then he announced he was going for a loan.  In the interval he borrowed from the Counterpart Fund by the method known as ways and means advances.  That money enabled projects to go on in the time between the initiation of the projects and their proper financing by means of the proceeds of the loan.  When the loan came to hand, these moneys were repaid to the Marshall Aid Fund and not a single penny was paid out of the Marshall Aid Fund towards the financing of these projects afterwards until all the moneys out of the national loan were exhausted.  Then after the proceeds of the national loan coupled with the proceeds from the savings banks and the Saving Certificates were exhausted, a small draft was made upon the Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>It was used as a supplement to the free savings of the people, given as I say to the Government for development through the medium of a national loan.  It was used as a shelter belt to preserve the economy of this country. That was a policy which would have <Col N="2009" /> allowed these Marshall Aid funds to be utilised for developmental purposes over quite a long number of years. There is not a penny of that £26,000,000, that we left behind us, there now.  For those two or three years, during which the Marshall Aid funds were at the disposal of Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, he did not take, as he could have taken, the easy facile way&mdash;of taking money from the Counterpart Fund and using it instead of going to the people for a national loan.  He went for a national loan every year, got the money and then utilised whatever was left by a draft upon the Marshall Aid funds.  Having done that for a period of three years, and having initiated schemes of capital development, these at all events did result in this, that there was the nearest thing to full employment in this country that ever was reached in our history.  We left, at the end of three years, £26,000,000 behind us, and there is not a penny of that left now.  Of course, the reason why the Minister for Finance spent it during a period of about six months&mdash;I think it was all spent before Christmas&mdash;at five times the rate that Deputy McGilligan spent it, was because he did not go for a loan.</P>

      <P>I have plenty of people behind me to do it.  The Minister had to draw upon these funds because of his failure to get a loan, and that is the reason why the kitty is empty. Now, there is no national loan but there is uncertainty and unrest, and if a loan could be got at all it could only be got under very adverse conditions <Col N="2010" /> and at a very much higher rate of interest than could have been obtained last year.  The Minister for Finance did not carry out his predecessor's expressed intention of having a loan.  He did not follow the lead that was given to him in the previous three years of going for a loan after the Budget and telling the people why he wanted it. That is why there is no money left in the kitty.</P>
      <P>What has become of the Grant Counterpart Fund?  That was not meant to balance an unbalanced Budget. That was left behind with projects for its allocation agreed upon between Deputy Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, and the representatives of the E.C.A.  That was agreed on in principle in November, 1950, and I want Deputies to mark the date. The Grant Counterpart Fund was a free gift without any tags or strings to it from the people of the United States to the people of Ireland.  But, being a free gift, they had this slight hold over it, that they said they would require to be consulted as to the way in which it would be spent.  Accordingly, before that free gift of $15,000,000 could be spent there had to be agreement between our Government here and the E.C.A. in the United States of America.  In November, 1950, before the change of Government, agreement was reached in principle between Deputy Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, and the representatives of the E.C.A. here as to the way in which that money should be spent, one of the ways being on a lime subsidy which now appears as an item in this year's Estimates meant to be paid for out of taxation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was part of the free gift from the United States to this country but the taxpayers are now going to have to pay it.  What has become of these $15,000,000?  The taxpayers now have to pay because of the ineptitude of the present Government although we had agreed in November, 1950, in consultation with the E.C.A.  Administration, as to how it was to be spent.  One of the ways was that there was to be £200,000 of a limestone subsidy for farmers.  The present Government took office in June of last year and did not take the necessary steps between <Col N="2011" /> June and December of last year to finalise the matter with the E.C.A. Administration in Washington.  They let the thing slip.  There is no E.C.A. Administration now and, therefore, there cannot be a duplicate agreement. An agreement is necessary to have that free grant expended, but we cannot have it expended now.  It may be that the United States will, as a further proof of their generosity, do something to rectify that error of the present Government.  I do not know whether Congress will do it or not, or whether Ministers are trying to get Congress to rectify the mistake or not.  All we know at the moment is that the $15,000,000 which we got as a grant from the United States people cannot be spent for the betterment of the Irish economy and the Irish people in the way it was agreed it should be expended.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I had intended to refer to.  I have noticed in the Minister's speeches, and particularly in the speeches and utterances of his colleagues through the country during the last nine months, an implied sneer at the American people for lending us money and at us for taking it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there have been, in certain quarters recently, criticisms of the American people, of their culture or lack of culture. I think it is right that this should be put on record, that that does not represent the view of the Irish people towards the American <Col N="2012" /> people.  I certainly want to disassociate those for whom I speak here from those criticisms that were made in Strasbourg and elsewhere and to say that is not part of our policy.  We repudiate those criticisms.  I want to say publicly to-night that we thank the American people for what they have done for us and the opportunity they gave us to develop our country in a way in which it could not be done if it were not for the help they gave us during the three years through the Marshall Aid Administration.  They are entitled to get that tribute from us and from every other section of this House.</P>

      <P>I am glad that one of the tasks facing the Minister for Finance in this year's Budget, to which he referred to-day, is the repayment of the first instalment of interest on those loans.  I said in 1948, when I went to America, at the time when we were asked about the Marshall Aid funds, that the Irish people would pay back every farthing, and that it must be a matter of pride for the Irish people; however they got the dollars, to pay back to the last farthing and the last cent every penny they got from the American people which brought such great benefit to the country and to the people of the country.</P>

      <P>This Vote on Account furnishes the House and the country with a preview of the direction in which Government policy is tending, and with a synopsis of the Government's intentions for their period in office in the control of the affairs of the country.  It is certainly not a very illuminating document, reflecting as it does the speedy reversion of the Government to the policy of stagnation and the stalemate that existed during the 16 years in which they were inflicted <Col N="2013" /> on the country on a prior occasion, and during which they acted a part, so pertinently described by the Taoiseach recently, talking about the inter-Party Government, as a kind of Laocoon.</P>
      <P>They sat upon progress and development during those 16 years, and we have now a reversion to that policy. Already, since they have come into office, the unfortunate unemployed have suffered the disadvantages of reversion of policy in painful fashion. For two years, or more, the workers of the country generally had got employment right through the winter.  They did not have to sign on at the labour exchange for two years until Fianna Fáil came back to show their hand again in 1951.  We find our rural workers now driven back in shoals to the labour exchanges, and the pay packets that used to come into their homes have had to be sacrificed because of the desire of the Taoiseach and the Government to restore at once our external assets to the bond of London.  By their speeches throughout the country and in this House they have tried to stamp out whatever private employment was in the offing by intimidating private individual employers, and by their actual practice in such control as they had of preventing employment in the country.</P>
      <P>In 1951 we slashed the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It has been further slashed by another 50 per cent. in this Vote on Account.  They slashed it right through the winter and left the unfortunate people to go to the labour exchanges or out on the emigrant ship. In my own county I have seen men who had not to sign on for two years flocking into the labour exchanges in Killmallock and Limerick, or taking their wives and families away in ships out of the country altogether, because there is no future prospect for them here.  That went on for a few months, and we see now that it will continue for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told the Local Authorities (Works) Act is gone and that in its place the people will be recouped by additional expenditure on road maintenance and road building.  I am in agreement with any expenditure upon <Col N="2014" /> our roads because they are a capital investment of great value to the country.  I will stand over any moneys spent on their maintenance, but increased expenditure on our roads is no alternative to the discontinuance of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>That Act was introduced by the inter-Party Government.  It never got the benediction of Fianna Fáil.  They killed it with kindness when it was going through the House.  It has never had their benediction since it came into operation and now they hope to stamp it out by knifing it.  Slashing it by 50 per cent will have an appalling reaction in relation to unemployment. That Act was providing very useful work of a national character in relieving flooding.  It contributed not alone to the amenities but also to the health of our people.  It was helping to prevent the flooding of land with its attendant destruction of crops until such time as the Arterial Drainage Act would come into full operation all over the country.  I know places where flooding that had taken place for 20 years was remedied under this Act.</P>
    <P>The scheme put forward by the elected representatives in the different areas had to be submitted to the engineers and sanctioned by them in conjunction with the engineers of the Department of Local Government and working in collaboration with the land rehabilitation scheme and the Arterial Drainage Act.  The slashing of the work done under this Act by 50 per cent. will undoubtedly adversely affect the land rehabilitation scheme&mdash;the Dillon Scheme, as we used to call it. In many cases land cannot be drained unless the drains on the side of the roads are done.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, speaking recently at Longford, that we must slash the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that we must create pockets of unemployment and that must be done because the work was a sheer waste in many cases and not co-ordinated with any other measure.  There is not a scintilla of truth in that.  These schemes were co-ordinated with the land rehabilitation project and the Arterial Drainage Act.  The work done <Col N="2015" /> stands to the credit of the engineers of the various counties and to the Department of Local Government and the promoters as being the best value for money spent on any type of drainage since I came into public life.</P>
    <P>Now it has been slashed, and I am afraid there will be a reaction upon the land rehabilitation scheme and the Arterial Drainage Act.  I do not know whether that is intended by the Government.  The Taoiseach, at the recent Árd Fhéis at the Mansion House, spoke slightingly, if somewhat facetiously, about the scandalous withdrawal of money by the inter-Party Government from the country's external assets in order to plough the rocks into the sea at Connemara.  Is it wise to take money away from where it is earning money to bring it back here to plough the rocks into the sea at Connemara?  Personally, I believe it is wise, and I think a statement of that type is unworthy of the Taoiseach of this country.</P>
    <P>The peasants in Connemara who have toiled for centuries with a spade in trying to shift the rocks and get down to the soil were entitled to the first of the bulldozers that we could buy with our external assets, with the savings of our people or through Marshall Aid.  I do not care where the money comes from so long as it ploughs the rocks off the land and makes the soil available to the people. I believe five or ten acres of land so restored are of much greater value than a holding given by the Land Commission in Meath, Dublin or any other part of Ireland, because it will preserve the Gaeltacht about which we hear so much.  The Taoiseach made a sneering reference to the inanity of his predecessors in taking our money out of the banks in London and bringing it back here to plough the rocks into the sea in Connemara; he thought the idea outside the consideration of any reasonable man.  Having regard to that statement and other statements made by Government spokesmen, I wonder whether the slashing of the Local Authorities (Works) Act is not part of a drive against the land rehabilitation scheme as well.  It has not so far been wiped out but, as <Col N="2016" /> Deputy Costello has said, we have been left in the dark as to what will be spent on these capital works.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has asked if we could point to any monument in this country as a result of the money that was spent.  The best monument that I can point to is what has been put into the soil to make it more arable, to make it produce more crops. The Government that we have at present pay lip service to the twin ideals of full employment and production and immediately proceed to take steps that will lead in a reverse direction, and make realisation of these aims impossible.  The Government that preceded them took the money and ploughed it into the land. That is our reserve bank of wealth, the only bank that matters.  If we can plough £4,000,000 a year for ten years into the soil and remove the rocks, the scrub and the briars and put lime and phosphates into land that has been starved throughout the years by overcrowding, wrong cropping and lack of fertiliser, we will be rendering a proper account of our investment. That is the wealth that we should have in order to enable us to meet our claims inside or outside the sterling area.  That is the wealth we must aim at.  That is the wealth that does not appeal to the Minister for Finance or his Government.</P>
    <P>He prefers paper tokens piled up in a bank in London.  The £150,000,000 or the £160,000,000 that he said had been amassed there during recent years and that could not be utilised must be put back with all speed, and the people of this country must tighten their belts and put on the hair shirt and adopt a policy of austerity in order to restore that money to the bank in London, to be left there at the mercy of international ramifications of finance or expediency, to be doled out at the rate of 9/- or 10/- for the 20/- that went in. We have had a clear indication that the policy of the inter-Party Government of trying to do something to develop the country must be sabotaged immediately simply because it was the inter-Party Government that devised it.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister for <Col N="2017" /> Finance would indicate that he has in mind any capital scheme that would be worthy of the investment of Irish money.  It seems to me that he has not.  They never showed any initiative. In 16 years they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.  For whatever little time we will have the affliction of a Fianna Fáil Government, from the indication of their future policy which has been presented to us in this Vote on Account, we can have very little hope of any alteration or improvement.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the slashing of the Forestry Vote will not mean any lack of employment in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slashing in public works and buildings of £181,000 &mdash;we are told by the Minister also due to the prescience of his predecessor in stockpiling.  He has no such apology to make in respect of the reduction in the grants to local authorities for sanitary services.  The Government that preceded this Government thought they were doing good work in building homes for the workers, in putting the rural workers into employment at wages on which they could afford to pay the rent, and thus enable them to marry and settle down in the country districts, where they would be available for tillage and other farm operations. Whether the Minister knows it or not, agricultural labourers cannot live on their fat between the sowing and the harvesting seasons.  They want other work.  We wanted to retain them in the country districts so that they would be available for farm work in the spring and harvest, and we <Col N="2018" /> wanted to provide alternative work in between.</P>
      <P>That is not the policy of the present Government.  It would seem that it was wasteful expenditure putting people into employment.  I maintain that money spent on putting Irishmen into employment at regular wages, which were spent in buying from the local shopkeepers the necessaries of life for the family, was money wisely spent, and that it was much better to spend it in that way than to have it depreciating at the whim of the bankers in London, which is the policy that Fianna Fáil seem to stick by so slavishly.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note in the statement made by the Minister that there will be no whittling down of the house-building programme.  There again we have to take the Minister's word.  The signs at the moment are not too healthy because we have been given to understand that there will be a drop of 1,000 houses in the erection programme of Dublin in 1953 that is alleged to be due to the lack of a drainage scheme in north County Dublin. That reason cannot be alleged for the shortage of housing at the present time.  There must be something wrong in Dublin when, for the past six weeks, more than 500 carpenters are idle in the city.  During the three years of office of the inter-Party Government, carpenters, plasterers or tradesmen of any kind in the building trade were not idle.  In fact they had to be brought from other countries. They were as scarce as radium.  Now there are 500 carpenters idle in the City of Dublin.  I have not the details of the number of other skilled trade operatives who are idle.  I am sure that by now a few of them will have made their way across the Channel where there is plenty of work for them.</P>
      <P>I do hope the Minister for Finance will not put housing in the category of unwise spending.  It will be a sacrilege if they allow the housing drive that was initiated and brought to such a fine pitch of perfection to be slowed down.  If it starts in Dublin, the slowing down process will soon be felt throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the actual house-building programme in the country is. <Col N="2019" /> I see that there are 11,000 people employed in public authority building. That is a good figure.  There is a total of 20,000 people employed in house building.  So far we have not been able to ascertain the number of persons employed by private builders.  I am alarmed to find that there is grave unemployment amongst building operatives in the capital where there are years of leeway in house building to be made up.  The <i>Evening Herald</i> of to-day's date reveals that there are people living six in a room in Dublin to-day, after all that the corporation has done in the matter of providing houses.  I would ask that, whatever sacrifices we may be asked to bear, whatever hair-shirt or austerity policies may be introduced, the Minister will see to it that the housing programme in Dublin and the provinces will be maintained at its normal rate.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to be deluded by the bankers and their wailings about the restoration of reserves. I would suggest that more money should be withdrawn for investment in this country for the advantage of the community as a whole.  The people of this country have not yet achieved the standard of living that they have a right to expect.  We cannot afford to write down the standard of living. Would the Taoiseach tell the unemployed people who have not got a day's work, or the unfortunate people in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork who are trying to make ends meet that their standard of living is too high?  We are told the standard of living is too high.  We have not yet reached the standard of living that the Irish people are entitled to and the head of any Government ought to be ashamed to make such a statement.</P>
    <P>The purpose for which we have to reduce our standard of living is to make good what was taken out of the English banks.  In my opinion, we are still holding too much money there. We ought to take it out and put it into Irish enterprise in order to develop our real wealth.  I greatly fear that as long as the present Government remain in office there will be a lack of policy, a condition of stagnation and stalemate. That will continue until the Irish people see fit to remove them again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it impossible to congratulate the Minister for Finance on the contents of his statement or on his approach to the various problems with which he dealt.  As the Minister seems to model his policy so closely on that of his British Tory colleague, I had hoped that possibly he might at least adopt the manner and courtesy which his British colleague adopted in his Parliament.  In many respects the statements of policy made by the Tory Government in Britain and by the present Government here are very similar.  As Deputy Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, remarked, it seems to be a question of keeping step by step with whatever the Tory Government is doing in England.</P>
      <P>But I noticed some differences.  I noticed that, despite whatever temptations the Tory Government in England may have to cast the blame for the present position on the preceding Labour Government there, they refrained from doing so.  The Minister's speech in the House to-day seemed to be concerned mainly with trying to throw blame on the previous Government or with scoring cheap petty points of one kind or another.  I think it is a pity that, in a serious situation, the Minister does not try to meet the situation seriously.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with some of the broader issues, I would like to protest at what is nothing short of an attempt to deliberately mislead this House by the Minister to-day in his carefully prepared statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister decided to take me to task for having drawn attention to the fact that the Forestry Vote had been slashed by 25 per cent.  He said that there would not be a penny less spent on forestry this year.  I asked him whether he would give an assurance to the House that there would not be a reduction in the number of persons employed on forestry this year.  He said there would not be any less money spent on forestry this year than last year.  That was a deliberate attempt to mislead the House, and the Minister knows that that statement was untrue, and I challenge him to deny it.  The Minister should not put himself in the position where he can be accused by <Col N="2021" /> any member of this House of telling something which is untrue and of misleading the House.</P>
    <P>The cut in the Forestry Vote, which is one of 25 per cent, is mainly under the heading of Forestry Development and Maintenance.  It shows not merely cuts in the cost of material, but cuts in labour.  It shows, for instance, a cut of from £181,000 to £135,000 in the cost of labour for drainage and preliminary forestry work.  It shows, in the next sub-head, a cut of from £160,000 last year to £135,000 this year in labour for constructional purposes.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, accused me of having made a misleading statement.  He read out most of his speech to-day from a prepared statement.  In that prepared statement he had decided to attack me for having drawn attention to the fact that the Forestry Vote had been cut by 25 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but surely, if that applies, it should also apply to the Minister, who should not accuse me of making a misleading statement. If the Minister takes it upon himself to seek to mislead the House, I claim the right here to expose him for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keyes has also referred to the cuts in the grants under the Local Works Acts.  It is quite obvious from an examination of the Book of Estimates that the policy which is being implemented by the Minister and his Department is a policy which was advocated by the Central Bank in its report.  That is quite obvious.  The Leader of the Opposition has asked&mdash; and I repeat his request now&mdash;for a full account of what took place in London, and in particular for a copy of the letter or message which we learned <Col N="2022" /> from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had been sent by our Minister to the British Chancellor. Surely if the British Chancellor, members of the British Government and members of the British House of Commons can be informed of messages or documents sent by a Minister from our own House, this House is entitled to the same information?  We are surely entitled to know the contents of the document which the Minister sent to his counterpart in London?</P>
    <P>It is interesting incidentally to note that in some papers&mdash;I think in the Minister's own paper&mdash;the heading was &ldquo;Assurances given by the Irish Government.&rdquo;  What assurances have been given?  I should also like to protest against the practice whereby we in this House first learned of these events through announcements made in the British House of Commons instead of the announcements made here or at least simultaneously in both Houses.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to discuss the general economic and financial policy of the State because we are not given adequate information concerning the position generally.  We have, to a certain extent, to discuss these problems in ignorance.  I think the time has come when we should have an annual economic survey of the position made and published before discussion of this kind.  That has been the position in England since 1941; an economic survey of the national income and of the overall financial and economic policy of the country is prepared and made available. The budgetary policy can then be determined by reference to the overall situation.</P>
    <P>We lack that information here and certainly the information which the Minister has given to us to-day has not been particularly enlightening.  What did the Minister tell us to-day?  He told us of the dire position of the balance of payments situation.  He told us the terrible things that might happen to sterling.  He read out from his statement passages apparently that he had carefully prepared for the purpose of the British Chancellor, but did he deal with any of the economic problems that face the country at the moment?  Did he deal with the fact <Col N="2023" /> that there are 12,000 more people unemployed now than this time last year?</P>
    <P>Did he mention the fact that emigration had gone up by over 50 per cent in the course of the last five months?  Not one word was mentioned &mdash;nothing except concern for the sterling area and for the balance of payments position.  Not a word about emigration or about unemployment.  Not a word about any measures to be taken to deal with them.  On the contrary, so far as one can judge from the Book of Estimates, we are to have more unemployment because we are cutting down on forestry and on works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  All that will mean more unemployment. Were we told anything about the cost of living?  Were we told anything about the rise in prices?  These matters were not mentioned.  The whole of the Minister's statement was concerned with the sterling area and with the balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government, the Minister in particular, intends to pursue the implementation of the Central Bank policy to the bitter end.  I am rather inclined to think that he is.  So far, he has undoubtedly been keeping policy, step by step, with his Tory colleague in London and, at the same time, implementing the Central Bank policies.  We have had restrictions on credits.  That was advocated by the Central Bank.  We now have unemployment at a considerably higher rate than before.  That also was inferentially suggested by the Central Bank Report.  We have an unemployment pool now.  We have heard many speeches about the evils of subsidies. The British Government have cut subsidies very substantially.  Are these speeches that have been made by different members of the Government in the course of the last two months an indication that this Government here have decided to follow suit with the Tory Government?</P>
    <P>Are these speeches an indication that it is proposed to implement the Central Bank policies in regard to subsidies?  Inasmuch as so far the Minister has implemented the Central <Col N="2024" /> Bank policies to the best of his ability, let me remind the House of what the Central Bank advocated in regard to subsidies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsidies are not only a heavy burden on the Budget but also constitute a disguised addition to purchasing power, as the money saved through getting the subsidised article at a reduced price is set free for other expenditure....  The effect of a subsidy may, of course, be modified to some extent by an associated system of rationing and some of the disadvantages of a subsidy may be obviated by a more severe ration scheme.  Reduction or removal of subsidies would, however, bring several advantages in relieving the Budget and allaying inflation and remedying a distorting influence in the price structure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, condescendingly, they add:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that removal of subsidy might tend somewhat to increase the cost of living but some inconvenience in this respect must be weighed against the compensating gains, including especially the reduction of consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that the price of essential commodities would cost more to people who could eat less.  Are we not entitled to have an indication from the Government now as to whether they intend to implement this recommendation by the Central Bank, having to the best of their ability already implemented many of the others?  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced the cuts he is making in his subsidies. In view of these circumstances, and particularly in view of the speeches that have been made recently, one might have expected that the Minister would give some indication to the House to-day of his policy in regard to subsidies.  I hope we shall not learn first by some announcement in the British House of Commons that the subsidies have been cut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was likely to get more information in the <i>Evening Herald</i> than was conveyed to me in the greater part of Deputy Costello's speech.  In the course of his speech, he repeated, over and over again, that whatever difficulties faced us to-day were due to the pessimistic attitude of the present Government.  I do not think there has been delivered in this House over the past 12 months a more gloomy speech than that which was delivered by Deputy McGilligan on the eve of the dissolution of the last Dáil. I think it would be no harm if Deputies of the Fine Gael Party would study the implications of that speech and try to get into their heads some of the lessons which Deputy McGilligan was <Col N="2027" /> trying to convey to them in a mild way at that time.</P>
      <P>Speaking, I think, on the 2nd of May, as reported in col. 1884, Deputy McGilligan referred to the inflationary position which was facing the nation at that particular time.  He described inflation in a very apt phrase as &ldquo;not too much money chasing too few goods but too much money attracting too many imports&rdquo;.  I think that in that he was attempting to convey to the House and the country the danger which he foresaw facing us almost 12 months ago.  So that whatever troubles we have encountered in regard to an increasing adverse balance of payments did not begin with the change of Government. They were evident at least to one member of the previous Government before they went out of office. He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is abnormal and, if it persists, can be seriously damaging is the use of our external resources for consumption purposes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>thereby admitting that, at that time, this nation was importing large quantites of consumer goods and was not repatriating external assets to build up internal resources but merely for the purposes of consumption.  Could we have a clearer indication that the position that was facing the nation was serious, and that its gravity was recognised by at least one member of the Government?  He went on in column 1883:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The outlook for 1951 is, I fear, that the deficit may be even greater than in 1950.  The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory and, if it continues to develop unfavourably, the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the present Minister for Finance had made such a threatening statement as that, I am sure there would be uproar on the Opposition Benches.  Yet that statement was made in May, 1951, by the Minister for Finance of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan nearly 12 months ago was threatening corrective measures in order to correct the abnormal <Col N="2028" /> and dangerous economic position. Those facts cannot be denied.  They are on the records of the House.  They may have been, perhaps, overlooked by some members of the then Government. They may have been hidden to a certain extent from the ordinary rank and file of the Fine Gael Party but they are on record, and I believe they were deliberately put on record by Deputy McGilligan in order, at least, to uphold his reputation as a man who understood finance and economic conditions.  That statement, after he had made it, was completely submerged and prevented from reaching the people, to a great extent by the optimistic declarations of Deputy Dillon, then Minister for Agriculture; Deputy Costello, then Taoiseach, and other members of the then Government. Deputy McGilligan was not given a chance to put that message to the country.  It is possible that he did not try unduly to put it across and that he merely wanted to have it on the records of the House so that, if disaster did overtake the Government if they had remained in office, he at least could say: &ldquo;Well, I at least warned them.&rdquo;  He went on in the same page in column 1884 to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Only if the gap in the balance of payments is narrowed so that external disinvestment is balanced by additional home investment&mdash; rather than by excessive consumption&mdash;can we be satisfied that, as a nation, we are making ends meet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, in spite of what Deputy Costello has said to-night about prosperity, about the progress that was being made under his régime, we have the then Minister of the inter-Party Government calmly announcing that the nation was not paying its way and that the gap in the balance of payments was steadily widening.  A good deal has been said to-night about the uselessness and the worthlessness of external assets.  Here is what Deputy McGilligan, in his Budget statement last year, had to say about external assets:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the great benefits conferred by the possession of external assets is ability to ride out periods <Col N="2029" /> like the present of exceptional difficulty and stress, but this external mass of manoeuvre is the mainstay of our economic independence.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal of truth in that statement.  I think it is essential for a nation, and particularly for a small nation with a fairly large external trade, to have, as a sort of protection, a minimum amount of external currency.  We have seen that, in the past year, our external assets were depleted by £66,000,000, and I think the Minister gave the figure of £130,000,000 for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>£155,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say that £155,000,000 of our external assets were depleted in the last three years.  If we could liquidate that amount of external assets in such a short period, are we not foolishly optimistic if we consider that the having of a couple of hundred million pounds of external assets is something which makes us absolutely secure against all danger?  Is it not clear that, if we were to go on liquidating our external assets, as we have been over the past three years, we would ultimately have no external assets whatever, and then we would have to face a position in which any deficit in our balance of trade would have to be met, I suppose, by borrowing externally.  In that situation we would become a nation dependent entirely for our economic existence upon externally secured accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is what Deputy McGilligan meant when he said that these external assets are the mainstay of our economic independence.  I think it is no harm to read back to the Fine Gael Party, at least the record of what their own Minister for Finance said when he was in power, because I feel that in his Budget statement he was speaking in a responsible way, having on his shoulders the obligation of safeguarding this nation's financial and economic interests.  I think he was not exaggerating when he said that the preservation of, at least, the minimum of our external assets was the mainstay <Col N="2030" /> of our economic independence.  Later on, I think in the same column, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for exceptional conditions prevailing, it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is a pity that Deputy Costello did not read over that Budget statement made by Deputy McGilligan before he came into the House to-night to make his long and, I would say, laboured speech in regard to the economic and financial position of our nation.  Is it not clear to every Deputy who regards this nation's position seriously that our immediate and most urgent task is to rectify the position of our external trade?  We cannot go on spending more than we are earning.  As a nation we cannot go on living beyond our means for an indefinite period. There are definite physical limits beyond which we cannot go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello spoke airily about how much worse the position of Great Britain is compared to ours.  I think that such comparisons are undesirable. It is true that Great Britain's trade position, her financial position, and her position in regard to external payments is very serious, but we know that there are many factors&mdash;I do not want to touch on this very much&mdash;concerning Britain's position in the world which do not apply to us.  We are a small nation that was neutral in the last war.  We cannot expect the support&mdash;financial, economic and other support&mdash;that in the last analysis Britain might be able to claim.  We cannot claim to be carrying on the vast rearmament programme which Britain is carrying on and which, I suppose, it will be the obligation of the United States to see will continue.  We are a small nation that is seeking to live its own life in its own way, one that has decided, for national reasons, to remain aloof from world organisations in regard to rearmament.  Therefore, there is a particularly strong obligation on us to make our economic position secure and strong.</P>
    <P>I think it is an appalling thing that, when Ministers seek to emphasise the necessity for making our position economically <Col N="2031" /> strong, they are accused of causing depression and anxiety.  If a man is using up his little credit balance in the bank too rapidly, if he is not adding anything to it but is liquidating it, would it not be to that man's interest that someone should suggest to him to adopt a different course?  What is demanded from the nation at the present moment is nothing more than that we should restrict all unnecessary imports, that we should increase production to the maximum, and that we should endeavour to increase our exports so that our balance of trade will reach an even keel.  I think that one of the greatest disasters that has befallen us over the past three years is that we have not been able to increase our volume of production sufficiently.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase, too, in the volume of industrial production.  It has been a reasonably satisfactory increase, but I think it could be even better.  We could have and should have increased our output of machine-won turf, for instance, or indeed of every kind of turf.  We should have and could have increased our production of such an essential commodity as cement.  We could have and should have increased a wide range of industrial products.</P>
    <P>We have experienced our main failure in relation to agricultural production. Deputy Dillon has been for some time questioning the statistics produced by the Statistical Department. He has suggested and, indeed, almost demanded that he should be permitted to recast and rewrite the agricultural statistics for the period in which he held office as Minister for Agriculture.  Fortunately such statistics cannot be recase or rewritten by any interested Minister, or ex-Minister. These figures are coldly and objectively compiled by officials who have no interest whatsoever in making a case for any particular Minister, any particular Government or any particular Party.</P>

That does not alter the incontrovertible fact of the present situation governing net agricultural output, excluding turf, since it is the desire that turf should be excluded.  In 1938 the index figure was 100; in 1942 it was 110; in 1943 it was 107; in 1945 it was 110; in 1946 it was 105 and in 1950 it was 97.  The volume of agricultural output was lower in 1950 than it was during the difficult years of the emergency.</P>

He has been clinging to the coat-tails of Deputy Dillon for the past 20 years and on every serious issue Deputy Dillon has invariably led him into a bog.  It would be better for him if he turned his back on Deputy Dillon and applied his own brains to these important economic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures I have given are the figures for net agricultural output, and net agricultural output is the real output. <Col N="2033" /> Deputy Dillon would like to rely on the figures for gross agricultural output, but we all know that that figure gives an untrue picture because it includes imports of animal feeding stuffs.

If we want the true picture of what was produced within the nation we must rely upon net agricultural output.  Deputy General Mulcahy knows that perfectly well.  Deputy Dillon, in an effort to save his face, is trying to rely not upon what was produced by our own farmers but on what was produced on the continents of America, Asia or Australia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon&mdash;and here I have a certain amount of sympathy with him&mdash;tried to show that there had been an increase in the volume of agricultural output by producing another set of figures which he had obtained from the Statistical Department.  That was the gross output with the changes in the numbers of live stock at the beginning and the end of each year added to it.  It might not be any harm in preparing statistics for agricultural output to add in or take account of changes in the numbers of live stock. From a statistical point of view that may or may not be sound.  From my standpoint it appears sound enough but I am speaking now only as an ordinary layman.  Even if you take <Col N="2034" /> account of the changes in live stock you cannot add those figures to gross output because, as I have pointed out, the figures for gross output are no indication of what is produced within the nation; they are an indication of what the people of North America and other continents produce.</P>
      <P>In order to be clear in my own mind on this question I asked the Statistics Department if they could give me the figures of net agricultural output with Deputy Dillon's proviso that the changes in the numbers of live stock would be added thereto.</P>
      <P>Here, now, are the official figures for net agricultural output, excluding turf, adjusted for changes in live stock: Taking the figure of 1938-39 at base 100 we find that in 1939-1940 it was 102.8; 1940-1941, 98.7; 1941-1942, 107.2; 1942-1943, 109.2; 1943-1944, 107.9; 1944-1945, 105.7; 1945, 111.4, and the figure for 1951 was 100.1.  So that, even giving Deputy Dillon his own adjustment of the statistics of output we find that 1950 cannot compare with the war years and is very considerably below the yearly average in the entire emergency period.  No matter in what way we regard this question, no matter from what angle we view it, we come up against the same result, that the inter-Party Government policy in regard to agriculture was disastrous as far as production is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello said that we can increase agricultural production if we take the proper steps.  I think that, on 13th June, we took the proper step in getting rid of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a Minister for Agriculture who had reduced the number of cows by 19,000 in the last year that he was in office, reduced the number of in-calf heifers by 33,000, reduced the number of sows by 433, reduced the acreage under tillage crops by 51,000.  Of course, from 1948 to the last year he was in office, he reduced the figure by close on 1,000,000 acres.  The policy frequently announced by Deputy Mulcahy and by Deputy Costello and the inter-Party Government generally was a policy of one <Col N="2035" /> more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.  It seems to be departing a long way from that policy to reduce the number of in-calf heifers by 33,000, the number of cows by 19,000, the number of sows by over 400 and the number of acres under the plough by nearly 1,000,000 in the course of three short years.</P>
      <P>By voluntary effort, by united effort, we can get back to a policy of increased production.  First of all, it is essential to bring home to the minds of our people, individually and collectively, that there is a serious problem to be faced, that this nation is in danger if it continues to live beyond its means.  We must also bring home to the minds of our people that we are capable of increasing production, that we are not the incompetent nation of idlers or wasters that some people think we are.  We have energetic young men and women coming out of the primary and secondary schools every year who are ready and willing, if given the proper lead, to devote their brains, energy, zeal and enthusiasm to the task of building up the volume of production in every field of activity.  If the right inspiration is given them, we can increase production. If an irresponsible policy is pursued, a policy of telling our people that to talk about getting down to realities is depressing and imprudent&mdash; a suggestion that has been made repeatedly by the Opposition&mdash;then we cannot hope for any real advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunities lie at our feet.  We can expand production over a number of fields.  When I was speaking in <Col N="2036" /> this House last November I said that turf, tillage and tourism offer three fields of activity in which we can expand production rapidly.  There are other fields of activity where increased production is also possible but where it may not be so rapid but which can be regarded as long-term propositions. I do not disparage in any way those who talk about long-term activities such as afforestation, land reclamation, generation of electricity.  All these projects are long-term plans.  They are essential projects which must be pushed forward with all possible speed. At the same time we must endeavour to pay our way.  Therefore, we must think, not only of long-term plans but of short-term methods of rapid expansion of output.  That is why I say tourism, increased production of turf and extension of the acreage under tillage offer a reasonable hope that we as a nation will pay our way.</P>
