      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the board does not propose to extend the boundary of the Rathmore area in order to include the village and neighbourhood of Gneeveguilla for the purpose of the supply of current under the rural electrification scheme but it is the board's intention to investigate the possibility of developing the region of Gneeveguilla and Ballydesmond as a separate area under the scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a proposal on the 31st July, 1951, from the Tipperary South Riding County Council regarding the transfer of the medical and maternity sections of the County Hospital, Cashel, to the Clonmel District Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Cashel County Hospital contained 66 beds for surgical, medical and maternity cases.  This number was found to be completely inadequate to cater for cases awaiting admission to the hospital.  On the date mentioned, the local authority intimated that the waiting list for surgical beds was between 70 and 80.  In addition, an orthopxdic service has been established in Tipperary and the orthopædic surgeon was severely handicapped through lack of beds.  It would not be possible either to reduce the waiting list for surgical patients or to provide beds for the orthopxdic surgeon in the county hospital without reducing very severely the number of beds available for medical cases.</P>
      <P>The local authority consequently suggested that Clonmel District Hospital should be reconstructed for use as the major county medical hospital and maternity hospital for Tipperary South Riding.  The reconstructed hospital will provide accommodation for approximately 107 patients.  Medical and maternity services in the hospital will be provided by the county physician.  Full X-ray facilities are available.</P>
      <P>It is not anticipated that, as a result of the transfer, there will be any reduction in the staff or in the facilities available for surgical and orthopxdic patients in the Cashel County Hospital.  There will be a considerable increase in the staff and improvement in the facilities available for medical and maternity cases in the Clonmel Hospital.  It is proposed to reserve a small number of beds in the County Hospital, Cashel, for urgent medical and maternity cases from the Cashel area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1494" /> The proposed transfer was sanctioned in the expectation that it would provide a more adequate and efficient service in the county.</P>

      <P>The total area of land on offer for forestry purposes in South Kerry is approximately 10,000 acres, on the basis of area statements made by the owners.  The actual area is believed to be much smaller.  The area on offer includes large tracts of unplantable land and land previously regarded as unsuitable.  The area acquired to date is 4,772 acres and the area planted 2,276 acres.  Existing key centres are Killarney, Kenmare and Kilgarvan.  It is probable that the next centre will be the Glencar area, and other centres will be opened where suitable initial blocks can be acquired.</P>
      <P>As there was no separate valuation of land and timber in some of the earlier acquisitions, my Department is unable to give a reliable average price per acre for all the land acquired.  The average price per acre paid for plantable land acquired since 1948 is £3 15s. per acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 42, 43, 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The number of news bulletins broadcast between July 16th and July 19th was 20.  Eleven of these contained reports of speeches by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  During this particular period the Minister had several non-political engagements of a kind always reported by Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the report of the inauguration of the rural electrification scheme in Drumlish, County Longford, this event took place late at night, about 9.30 p.m., and Radio Éireann deserves credit for reporting it in the news bulletin at 10.10 p.m.  In accordance with the practice of newspapers and other broadcasting organisations <Col N="1509" /> when dealing with rush copy of this kind, Radio Éireann reported the principal speaker only simply because there was no time to get in more.  There was nothing unusual in the report of the Minister's speech.  It has been Radio Éireann's practice for many years to report speeches explaining Government policy which are made by Ministers at non-political public functions.  It is, of course, unavoidable that Government policy should be controversial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the report of the Dáil proceedings broadcast in the 10.10 p.m. news bulletin on July 16th, the Dáil was concluding the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce and the report naturally consisted of a summary of the Minister's reply to the debate.  On the previous day almost the entire report in the news bulletin was devoted to speeches by Opposition Deputies. Taking the two days together there was a reasonable balance as between Government and Opposition Deputies. It is not, of course, practicable to report all Dáil speeches in the Radio Éireann news bulletins.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice for many years not to make copies of the radio news bulletins available to the members of the Oireachtas or indeed to anybody outside the broadcasting service, and I see no reason for a modification of that practice.</P>
    <P>Formal complaints of a serious character either by way of parliamentary questions or correspondence have been gratifyingly infrequent.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, surely there is a very different case in regard to the placing of copies of the bulletins in the Library during the newspaper strike from what there is in ordinary times, and I would press the Minister strongly to make available in the Library copies of all bulletins issued since the beginning of the strike up to the time when we hope it will terminate.</P>

      <P>It has been customary to give the news editor a very wide freedom and if we placed bulletins of political opinion reported in the Dáil in the Library there would be all kinds <Col N="1510" /> of criticism.  It is impossible for Deputies themselves to judge what a news editor would consider to be good news value.  Sometimes two speeches of an Opposition Deputy might have the same news value as part of a speech of a Government Deputy or vice versa. I think, in fact, that criticisms have been very few and far between of recent date.  If there have been any there have been one or two from the Government side of the House and I think that on the whole judging by the criticism we receive the news editor can be left the measure of liberty which he has.  Everything will be done to have a proper balance of news.  Quite evidently the Deputy was anxious in that he thought for some reason or other because there was a strike there was an abnormal number of speeches of my own whereas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On last Monday in the 1.30 bulletin, Ministers Walsh, Ryan and Traynor were reported; on the 6.30 bulletin the same Ministers were reported, with the addition of the Minister for Local Government&mdash; four Ministers in the one bulletin.  If the Minister is not going to put copies of the bulletins in the Library, will he at least put a certificate from the news editor as to the number of minutes given to both sides of the House so that Deputies can have the opportunity of seeing whether the reasonable balance to which the Minister refers is being continued, because any time I have turned the news on it has always been one Minister after another, both at 10.10 at night and at 8 in the morning?</P>

The Deputy should be reminded that there has been the Estimate of the Minister for Agriculture in regard to which it was extremely difficult to give even a reasonable summary of the work of the Department during the year even during the maximum time available over Radio Éireann.  There being only one newspaper published and all the other circumstances may have given the Deputy a false impression.  I can assure him that the news editor is a person of impartial mind and he can be satisfied that whether the strike continues or not there will continue to be a fair balance in the news.</P>

      <P>Sir, while I appreciate Deputy Killilea's statement to-day I think that what happened last night is a matter of serious importance.  There was last night a very grave breach of the privileges of this House by an attempt at assault on a Deputy in the House.  This is the third occasion in a very short time on which an incident of this kind has occurred and, therefore, while appreciating what Deputy Killilea has said to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this House will be doing its duty in safeguarding its dignity and its privileges unless formal notice is taken in a very formal way of what happened here last night.  I do not want in any way to prejudice the judgment of the House on anything that happened then, but I think what happened is of very serious importance and merits consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The House should have a report from that committee on the matter <Col N="1514" /> so that, with the full information it will have, it may give judgment on what took place last night in an effort to discover whether serious and definite steps cannot be taken to prevent occurrences of this kind in the future.</P>
      <P>It is not a sufficient protection of the House, its dignity and its privileges, that there can be an attempt at assault either in the House itself or within the precincts of the House and that that attempt can subsequently be rubbed out by an apology to the House the following day.  I think every Deputy in every Party must be of the opinion that our privileges and our dignity must be safeguarded.  Therefore, while appreciating what Deputy Killilea has said, I submit that the incident last night cannot be left without review and examination by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that the House may have an opportunity of considering the matter in a more formal way and seeing what steps can be taken for the future in order that incidents of that kind can be avoided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  That the proceedings on the Estimates for Public Services for the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, in Committee on <Col N="1517" /> Finance and on Report, and on the Resolution, in Committee on Finance and on Report, for the issue out of the Central Fund of the sum necessary to make good the supply granted for the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, if not previously brought to a conclusion shall be brought to a conclusion at 11 p.m. on Thursday, 24th July, 1952, by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the questions necessary to bring such proceedings to a conclusion; Provided that after the said hour on the said day a question shall not be put from the Chair on any amendment, nor upon any motion other than a motion necessary to bring the proceedings forthwith to a conclusion and then only when moved by the Government; Provided also that after the said hour on the said day only one question shall be put from the Chair in Committee on Finance on the Estimates then outstanding and that that question shall be in the form, that the total sum outstanding in respect of the Estimates for Public Services for the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, be granted for the service of that year; and that on the report of the Resolutions of the Committee on Finance, in respect of the several Estimates, only one question shall be put from the Chair, namely, that the Dáil agrees with the Committee on Finance in the said Resolutions;</P>
    <P>(b)  That the First Stage of the Appropriation Bill, 1952, shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the proceedings on the Estimates for Public Services for the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953; that the Second Stage and the remaining stages of the said Bill, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.55 p.m. on Thursday, 24th July, 1952, by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the questions necessary to bring the stages of the said Bill to a conclusion and without interrupting the proceedings as provided by Standing Order 20 (2); Provided that after the <Col N="1518" /> said hour on the said day a question shall not be put from the Chair on any amendment, nor upon any motion other than a motion necessary to bring the proceedings forthwith to a conclusion and then only when moved by the Government; Provided also that in Committee on the Appropriation Bill, 1952, only one question shall be put from the Chair, namely, that the several sections stand part of and that the Schedules and the Title be the Schedules and the Title to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should explain to the House that this motion was put upon the Order Paper on the assumption that, arising out of certain discussions which were proceeding between the Whips of the various Parties, there would be agreement between them for an arrangement which would enable the financial business of this session to be brought to a conclusion to-morrow night.  Perhaps I had better explain briefly the nature of the agreement contemplated.  It was proposed that any Estimate which had not been reached by the time mentioned in the motion would be passed without debate and the Government would arrange to introduce a token Estimate for the same service in the autumn session so that the debate on the Estimate could then be taken.</P>
    <P>Briefly the arrangement was one to make provision for the necessary moneys for the service and the postponement of the debate until the autumn session.  I should also explain to the Dáil that if no agreement of this kind can be made, it will be necessary to ask the House to pass another Vote on Account.  The main Vote on Account in respect of the public services in the present financial year covered the period from 1st April to 31st July, and, in the absence of any arrangement, and with the possibility that some of the Estimates would not be passed before the end of the month, another Vote on Account will be necessary.  If therefore it is clear that no agreement of the kind contemplated can be made, it will be necessary to ask the Dáil to deal with that Vote on Account to-morrow.  There has been some <Col N="1519" /> delay in introducing it, on the assumption that an agreement was possible, and there is now an element of urgency.  The Vote on Account would have to be taken to-morrow and the Dáil would be asked to remain in session until that Vote on Account and the necessary Central Fund Bill had been disposed of, the debate on the remaining Estimates being carried over until next week.</P>
    <P>Deputies may not appreciate that in the absence of sanction from the Dáil to incurring the necessary expenditure, certain difficulties would arise in meeting the cost of the remaining services, those not dealt with by the Dáil on the annual Estimate, after the end of the month and the Appropriation Bill would require to be passed by the Seanad next week so that it would be necessary for the Dáil to deal with it this week.  I move the motion to test the feeling of the House.  If it should not prove possible to get agreement, the House will understand that the discussion of the Estimates will have to be interrupted in order to get the Vote on Account to-morrow.</P>

      <P>The records of this House, so far as the discussion on the Estimates has gone up to the present, will clearly prove to any impartialminded Deputy that the members of this group have given helpful assistance and not obstruction to the business of the House.  Members of the group have given very careful consideration to the drastic nature of this closure motion and cannot agree to accept it or vote for it in the form in which it is now presented to the House. <Col N="1520" /> We have still for consideration 36 Estimates and Supplementary Estimates, involving a total amount of £27,683,633 and including Estimates of such importance as Agriculture, Local Government, Health, External Affairs, if it is considered a major Estimate&mdash; Education, and, last but by no means least, the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I am sure it will be agreed that from six to ten of these Estimates are normally considered by Deputies and by groups as Estimates of major importance, involving matters of serious policy concerned.  The members of this group are prepared to give further and reasonable consideration to the disposal of the remainder of the business and are prepared to come here next week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, if necessary, for the purpose of concluding the discussion on the Estimates and giving the Appropriation Bill to the Government, which, I think, is the customary practice, before the end of July.  Does anybody suggest that we would be doing our work efficiently on behalf of the people who sent us here if we passed these Estimates, involving almost £28,000,000, apart altogether from the importance of certain Estimates, under the terms of the motion moved by the Tánaiste?  It is not fair to ask us to do so.</P>

The suggestion, as I understand it, is that the Estimates should be taken, if not reached, without discussion now and the debate and vote on them adjourned to the next session.  It is a question of whether it is more convenient for the Dáil to discuss them through August or in October.  That is the only question.  There is no desire on the part of the Government to curtail discussion on these Estimates in the least.  The arrangement contemplates <Col N="1521" /> providing an opportunity for the Dáil to discuss each one and get a vote on it, if that is desired.</P>

      <P>I fully understand the meaning of the proposal so far as that is concerned, but I do not think, nor do members of this group think, that the House should adjourn without discussion of the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach, especially in view of the industrial position in the country and the financial position, internal and international. Some date in next October, after the 22nd, is going to present a different picture altogether.  I remember that, as the whip of this Party, as an officer of the Party, with the best will in the world, agreeing to an adjournment of a particular matter.  I admit that there was no guarantee given by the Taoiseach at the time that if the position in the country became more serious the House would be recalled to discuss it.  I also remember signing with a colleague of mine a request to the Taoiseach that the House should be recalled and giving the reasons for our request.  We received a very polite refusal from the present Taoiseach.  I think we are acting reasonably when we say we are prepared to come here next week for three days to assist the Government to get through the business which I know they must get through before 31st July and to get the Appropriation Bill&mdash;</P>

We cannot leave the decision off until next week.

      <P>I find it difficult to appreciate Deputy Davin's point of view because it would constrain us in the discussion of these matters which I consider are very important to too short a space of time.  He asks us to discuss these matters at a time when the House, due to pressure of parliamentary business, is not in a position to give the thought and preparation to these matters which they require. If we were to continue to-morrow as arranged with the Estimates or deal with the Appropriation Bill and then deal with adequate discussion with the remainder of the work on the Order Paper, even Bills, I do not think that the time of next week would be sufficient.  There are for very many reasons a very large number of pressing problems in the country which are not fully envisaged at the moment, and the fact that we are without newspapers&mdash;I do not mean the publication of our speeches&mdash; makes the envisaging of these conditions in the country a matter of serious difficulty.  If we take the Health, External Affairs and the <Col N="1523" /> Taoiseach's Estimate&mdash;to some extent the problems discussed as a matter of policy on the Department of Finance Estimate could more reasonably be discussed on the Taoiseach's Estimate&mdash;each might easily require a few weeks' discussion if the seriousness of the situation dictated.  If we are called upon to deal with these matters now I do not think they can be effectively discussed.</P>
      <P>All Deputies in the House will, I think, realise that the parliamentary year here is distorted due to the fact that the financial year ends on the 31st March.  Our finances are of a kind which presses the session of the Dáil right into summer.  The session could go to a substantial degree into the autumn from the point of view of the work that requires to be done. In the general climatic conditions in the country, it would be much more suitable if the discussion on financial matters could be advanced to the early part of the year and if we could finish the parliamentary session early in the summer.</P>
      <P>I do not regard this as a closure motion.  I regard it just as an Order of the House to arrange its business in a more satisfactory and effective way.  There is no suggestion that anything which requires to be discussed is closed out of the discussion, but it is proposed by this Order, if the Dáil makes it, to postpone the discussion to a time when there would be not only a more satisfactory assembly of information but greater and more suitable time to deal with these subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Tánaiste suggests &ldquo;well and good, if you want a full discussion on the Taoiseach's Estimate as a matter of general policy that Estimate could be discussed next week,&rdquo; my own inclination would be against that, but if a substantial discussion is required, then I think that it would be possible, knowing that we were agreed to postpone the major discussions to a more suitable time, to finish the Estimates to-day or to-morrow so as to devote the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill to a discussion of any aspect of the matters of which Deputy Davin <Col N="1524" /> speaks.  It is contemplated that the Dáil should sit from 10.30 a.m. until midnight to-morrow and I feel sure that matters of urgency could be discussed and terminated so that the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill could be dealt with to-morrow and during part of to-day.  On full consideration I feel that that would suit the intention and convenience of every Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset the Tánaiste mistakenly stated that there was assumed agreement.  There was no such agreement.  We are satisfied that as far as the Labour Party was concerned no agreement existed regarding a closure motion.  Our view has to some extent been put by Deputy Davin.  We feel that it is not reasonable that members of the House should be asked to go their ways until next October while there remains on the Order Paper a considerable list of items of urgent public importance which require the attention of this House.  If there are technical difficulties about the provision of moneys to carry on the concern they must necessarily be met by this House in the same way as anybody else, but no sufficient reason has been given why the members of the House should now go on holidays for almost three months instead of discussing the business of the country for which they were sent here.  That is the view of our Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that as we are discussing this matter we might&mdash;we probably do&mdash;throw our minds back to the considerable waste of time we have had in this House during the last six months.  I understood, I mentioned here last night, I think everybody in the House knows, that there has been general agreement on the lines of the motion introduced by the Tánaiste.  As he has said, there is no question of closuring anything because this is not a closure motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that we wait until October to discuss financial matters by means of token Votes is not one that commends itself to me for the reason that the session from October to Christmas is the most valuable session <Col N="1525" /> in the year for getting necessary legislation through and for giving Deputies by the provision of Private Members' Time an opportunity of putting specific matters before the House.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that Estimates have got to be passed.  Each Estimate gives an opportunity of discussing the administration of a different Department. I personally would have welcomed&mdash;and was anxious to take part in&mdash;a discussion on the Health, External Affairs and the Taoiseach's Estimates, but the Taoiseach's Estimate has always been taken as a discussion of broad general policy.</P>
    <P>I see on the Order Paper motions to refer back the Taoiseach's Estimate signed by the leaders of the Labour Party.  If there could be an agreement that we would discuss and conclude the Taoiseach's Estimate next week then I think that we should not put the financial business on the long finger for the autumn.  The matters which I understand the Labour Party want to discuss could be discussed on the Taoiseach's Estimate.  If we were to fall in with the Tánaiste's proposal, pass it to-morrow night and take a token Vote on which we could discuss them fully, that might be the proper way to do it.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to talk about adjourning for three months while there is certain work to be done. After all, this Parliament is run as a machine&mdash;we have a staff and that staff has to be considered.  The staff works for the whole year and I am sure the Labour Party would consider the staff of some importance in discussing the procedure of the House.  The best thing for the Tánaiste to do would be to let the motion stand at the moment, let the Whips discuss it and see if a full week, even sitting long hours, could be given to the Taoiseach's Estimate&mdash;all night, if necessary&mdash;next week.  When we finish next week, we could start in the autumn with business that awaited our attention then, and not have these Estimates coming along and eating into the time necessary for new legislation and Private Members' Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue here seems quite simple&mdash;it is a question as to whether we are going to have an adequate or an entirely inadequate discussion of the Estimates.  As Deputy Davin said, there are about 35 Estimates, most of them grouped around main Estimates, involving between £28,000,000 and £30,000,000. No member with any experience of this House believes for a moment that by sitting three days next week you can get an adequate discussion of those 35 Estimates.  That would be utterly impossible.  Neither do I agree with the suggestion that the Taoiseach's Estimate should be taken next week and the discussion of the remaining Estimates deferred until the Autumn.  I would not agree personally for a moment to taking the discussion in that order&mdash;the Taoiseach's Estimate has always been discussed at the end of the others and there is a very good reason for that.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to Deputy Davin and Deputy Dunne that they cannot possibly get an adequate discussion on the remaining Estimates next week, even if we sat for the six days.  Time could be usefully spent without any waste on a three-day discussion on the Taoiseach's Estimate in a general review and where are we going to find the time to do the others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the suggested arrangement&mdash;I do not think it is any more than a suggestion&mdash;is, in all the circumstances, a sensible one which the House could accept.  I would be inclined to agree with the suggestion by Deputy Cowan that further discussion could be deferred, to give the Whips an opportunity of meeting again, to see if they can come to an arrangement. From the point of view of an adequate and valuable discussion on the remaining Estimates, I think it could be much more fruitful next Autumn.  I venture to say&mdash;and I have some experience here&mdash;that if this discussion is carried over until next week you will be lucky to have 50 per cent. of the members here.  Even members of Dáil Eireann want to get out of this place some time&mdash;at least, they ought to.  There are Deputies in all Parties who have work to do that is of as much national importance in their constituencies or <Col N="1527" /> on their farms as they have to do here. I do not know that the House ever sat later than we are sitting here to-day in any year since we first opened the doors.  There were extra and unusual circumstances this year.  The suggested agreement that we should finish financial business to-morrow night to enable it to be taken to the Seanad and disposed of the following week, and that we have full and adequate time for discussion on any Estimates we wish on the resumption in the Autumn, is a fair one and I think all sides, including Deputy Davin, will get better value from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was dealing with the price of wheat and the attitude of the Government to wheat-growing generally.  As I stated then, when we came into office in 1951 we increased the price of wheat by 5/- a barrel and after the harvest, in order to induce our farmers to produce more in 1952-53, we again increased the price by 7/6 a barrel.  There had been no change in the price of wheat from 1947.  It has been suggested here that the Coalition Government were in favour of wheat production, but the attitude of the then Minister in the Coalition was that he did not want wheat growing.  It must have been so, because for the past 20 years, since <Col N="1530" /> it became the policy of Fianna Fáil to extend wheat-growing, on every possible occasion Deputy Dillon tried to kill that scheme&mdash;and when he became Minister he helped in killing it.  You can kill an industry, you can prevent people from producing an article, not by direct prohibition but by making it uneconomic for them to do so.  That was the policy adopted by the Coalition from 1948 until we came into office in 1951.  As I stated on many other occasions in this House the price of 62/6 was fixed in October, 1947, and there was no change from that until the graded system came in in April, 1951, and, of course, we changed that graded system when we were giving the increase in July of that year.</P>
      <P>Why was there that opposition to wheat growing?  Do Deputy Dillon and the people who support him not realise that it is of vital importance to this country to produce wheat? Deputy Palmer stated yesterday that this country was not suitable for the production of wheat.  I say that it is eminently suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon.  I did not state that this country was not suitable for growing wheat.  I stated that the cry of the Fianna Fáil Party was &ldquo;Wheat, wheat, wheat,&rdquo; whereas they never considered that in very many areas in the west we could grow no wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that we in this country can produce wheat 60 per cent. higher than any other country in Europe.  That figure is taken from the F.A.O. reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>60 per cent. higher yields are to be had in this country than you find in any other country in Europe. That is from the statistics of F.A.O. We must realise that, for the sake of our people and for the sake of our tillage farmers it behoves us to produce as much wheat as possible simply because of the necessity for providing farmers with a cash crop, an unlimited market and for ensuring that our <Col N="1531" /> people will have a sufficiency of bread if and when the necessity arises for us to make provision against an emergency. On these grounds alone, it is necessary for us to expand and develop the production of wheat as much as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>It was argued here that because of the Government's view on the production of wheat and because of their anxiety to have more wheat produced that, last year, the Government depressed or helped to depress the price of barley.  There is nothing further from the truth than that assertion.  The difference is this: in the case of wheat, as I have stated, there is a practically unlimited market but, in the case of malting barley, there is a very limited market.  The total acreage of barley required for industrial purposes in this country can be covered with 130,000 or 140,000 acres.  That is a very small percentage of our total acreage under cereals.  130,000 acres or 140,000 acres give a sufficiency of malting barley.  If you exceed that acreage, what is to become of the barley outside the requirements of commercial industry?  It has to be sold in the feeding market and the price that is available for feeding barley must be governed by the prices that you get for bacon, poultry, eggs, beef and milk.  It must be dependent on the prices that you get for these commodities.  There is no other use that it can be put to.  We must realise that.</P>
      <P>I have heard Deputy Sweetman and many other Deputies talking here about depression of barley prices, but did they ever advert to the circumstances, that the market for malting barley is limited here; that once the requirements are filled for commercial or industrial purposes, the only other market available is the feeding market, and that you have to depend on the prices that you get for your other commodities?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;An agreement is announced between the Brewers' Society and the National Farmers' Union on the prices to be paid for barley for the 1952 crops to be used in brewing.  For the 1952 harvest the minimum <Col N="1534" /> and maximum prices will be 120/-and 150/- per 448 lbs.&rdquo;  Where is the £5 5s. per barrel that we heard Deputies talking of yesterday and other days?  These are the prices that have been agreed to between the brewers and the National Farmers' Union of England.  Last year when the agreement was made it was on the basis that the Irish barley grower got 2/6 over and above the price paid by Messrs.  Guinness to the British farmer.  It did not follow that Messrs. Guinness paid the highest price for barley.  Actually in Britain that company would not pay the highest price for this crop.  The brewers of light ales were paying a much higher price.  They were looking for top quality barley which Messrs.  Guinness did not require. Farmers like Deputy Corry are doing much better this year than if they had made the same agreement as the beet growers made with Messrs. Guinness in past years.  This year farmers are getting a firm price of 75/-per barrel.  However, I am not concerned with this question of barley. The price of barley is decontrolled now and we always wanted it decontrolled. I am glad it is decontrolled, because I want to have a right to make my own price.  I feel it would be much better for this country if we had a little less bureaucracy and a little more independence and enterprise.</P>
      <P>An untruth has been bandied around, outside and inside this House, which I would like to nail by saying that neither I nor any member of the Government had hand, act or part in depressing the price of barley this year. I met a deputation from the Beet Growers' Association, I think, it was on a Wednesday or a Thursday, and they discussed with me the increased price for wheat.  As I mentioned to Deputy Sweetman last night, the new price fixed with Messrs.  Guinness for barley would be the last thing they would mention to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister not aware of the new price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If I had, I would have used it as an argument against them when they came to me looking for a higher price.  They could make <Col N="1535" /> a good case if the price had been 84/-a barrel, but at 75/- a barrel they could not have made a good case.  Is it not obvious to anybody that they would have hidden the new price from me?  Whether members believe me or not, the fact is, the first intimation I got of the new price was when I read it in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on the evening of the Gresham Hotel conference. At that conference the question was raised by Senator McGee and by Mr. P.J. Birmingham from Offaly.  At the time, I did not know what the reference was except that a price had been arranged between Messrs.  Guinness and the Beet Growers' Association.  I had no knowledge whatsoever of the price that had been fixed.  As I have said already, 130,000 acres or 140,000 acres was a mere bagatelle, and would not interfere in the slightest with wheat growing.  It is my policy that malting barley, feeding barley and oats should be grown.  It would be a good thing if Deputies tried to forget the idea they have that I depressed the price of barley.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon said that during the war period Fianna Fáil allocated a certain sum of money each year for the subsidisation of fertilisers. He told the House that this money was put into the Estimates for the purpose of hoodwinking farmers.  It is quite true that there was no hope of getting fertilisers in the early years of the war, but, yet, if they became available provision had been made in the Estimates to subsidise them. Most of us have a distinct recollection of the situation that existed during the early war years.  We know how difficult it was to get fertilisers, coal or any other commodities from outside. We realise that it was nearly impossible to procure the very necessaries of life and that our shipping was taxed to the utmost capacity to feed our people.  The argument is being used that provision was made in the Estimates for the <Col N="1537" /> subsidisation of fertilisers and that this was done for the purpose of hoodwinking people.  Vouchers were issued to cover whatever money was provided in the Estimates, so that the lands that had been deprived of fertilisers during the emergency period would be refertilised when that period came to an end.  Even to-day some of those vouchers are being sent in and credit notes are being issued for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At meetings with various county committees of agriculture, my argument on all occasions has been that I would not feel justified in even recommending subsidisation of fertilisers; we were importing a big quantity of fertilisers and even if we were able to get them in here at a pretty normal rate the first year and we put forward a subsidy, in the following year we would have to go back to those people and buy a quantity of fertilisers from them again.  There was nothing we could do to prevent those people from bringing up the price because they would say we could charge this price for it, that it did not matter to the Irish farmer if the price was too high as the Government would come to his aid by giving him a subsidy.  That is an attitude that could be and would be adopted by an outside firm, people from whom we purchase these manures. It would be a different matter, if we produced all our fertilisers at home, to talk about subsidising; but when you are dependent upon outside sources for <Col N="1538" /> your supplies in my opinion it would be bad policy even though at some time or other it might be necessary to do it in order to encourage people to use more fertilisers.</P>
      <P>During the earlier part of the war, when sulphate of ammonia was making £45 or £50 per ton, there were farmers who were prepared to pay that price. Even by paying that price they would be able to make a profit.  Is there anybody in this House who can assess the value of fertilisers and tell us when we have reached the maximum price for them, a price which from then on will provide you with no profit?  It is all right for people this year.  They may be dear but even so the application of fertilisers at any price is going to give you trouble.  That brings me back to another matter which is of vital importance and that is the application of ground limestone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about lime.  I say it is of vital importance to the country at the present time that more lime and more fertilisers be used. A survey is being carried out, and it is estimated that in order to correct soil acidity we would need to apply 12,000,000 tons of lime to the land in this country.  Early in 1947, the Government of the day decided to develop the production of ground limestone.  At first, it was thought that this should be done by a State company.  The elections of 1948 intervened before arrangements had been made and it was decided by the then Government that it <Col N="1539" /> be left to private enterprise.  To-day, we have 18 firms producing ground limestone in the country.  They produced 75,000 tons in 1950.  Up to 31st March, 1952, we produced 280,000 tons of lime and for the three months, from 1st April, 1952, to 7th June we have produced 100,000 tons.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I might say that arrangements are being made to have plant erected at Scariff, County Clare. Deputy Murphy raised that question last night, and for his benefit I would like to state now that arrangements are being made to go ahead in Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Treacy.  With the 18 firms working to full capacity, it is possible that we may be able to get 750,000 tons of limestone per annum. However, we will have to develop that.  There is room for development. A greater amount of lime must be applied to our land if we are going to get the production we hope.  The same thing applies so far as fertilisers are concerned.</P>
      <P>By using more fertilisers we will have better crops, better grass, and our cattle will be better fed during the winter-time, with the result that, in the spring-time, we can avail of the higher prices that are paid at home and abroad for our live stock.  It is dependent now on a greater use of limestone in the country and a greater use of fertilisers.  Pre-war in this country two-thirds of the fertilisers were used in the beet-growing and tillage areas.  Very little fertiliser was used outside of those areas.  We want our people to use them.  We want them particularly to use lime on most of our grasslands in the dairying areas.</P>

      <P>We heard a lot of talk about oats.  It might be of interest to Deputies on the opposite side to know that only about 10 per cent. of the oats produced in the country come into the market.  This year I was informed that there is a certain quantity of oats held in stores.  It would amount to quite a considerable sum.  I wonder what is the reason for that, because usually at this time of the year oats are running out and generally getting scarce.  I was just wondering if it was because Deputy Dillon permitted some of our wholemeal millers and oats factors to import 16,000 tons of oats in 1951, some of it arriving in this country before the harvest of 1951, choking <Col N="1541" /> our stores, and I would say having a detrimental effect on the sale of oats during the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not realise, I suppose, that 16,000 tons of oats came in from April to July of 1951.  Deputy Murphy asked me why I permitted the import of barley in 1952 and I had better give him the answer. In January, 1952, Messrs.  Guinness, even though they had paid £4 4s. for barley from September until January, found that owing to the new regulations regarding the gravity of stout in November, 1951 it would be necessary for them to get more barley. Messrs. Guinness paid the highest price in 1951 and yet after trying to get more malting barley at that period they were unable to get it.  If they were able to get it, I am sure they would have purchased it at £4 4s. per barrel rather than pay £5 5s. per barrel in Poland. It has been asked, &ldquo;Why did you permit them to do so?&rdquo;  We permitted them to do so because they were unable to get it at home.  If they were able to get it at home, they would have saved 21/- per barrel which they had to pay extra for barley from outside.</P>

      <P>As regards potatoes, they are sold under three headings.  You have seed potatoes, you have early potatoes and you have ware potatoes. As regards seed potatoes, there is a potato marketing committee set up in this country.  Its members are unpaid and it is not a statutory body.  It tries to find markets for potato seed growers outside this country in any country where seed potatoes are saleable.  There is no stone left unturned in trying to find markets.  I should like to remind the House, however, that the seed potato market is becoming a most competitive market.  Last year, for instance, even though it sold a very large quantity to another country early on in the year, it was discovered that as a result of improved yields in that country that its purchase of potatoes was reduced by practically one-half.  This is a very highly competitive market; it is a buyer's market.</P>
      <P>As regards early potatoes, the same thing applies; it depends to a very great extent on the weather.  As regards were potatoes, we are in the unfortunate position that when we have a heavy crop of potatoes in this country there is also a heavy crop across the water, so that there is no possibility of finding an export market in Britain for our potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.  As I am dealing with tillage I might as well deal with beet.  The Beet Growers' Association have been in existence since 1926 and every year since 1930 they have negotiated the price for beet.  During all that time it was a question of the beet growers negotiating their own price.  For one reason or another, this year the question of a flat rate was revived. That question goes as far back as 1933.  I was then on the council of the Beet Growers' Association when this question came up.  Some were in favour of it and others were not.  But the farmers supplying beet to the Carlow factory at that time who were outside a 20-mile radius wanted a flat rate while the others wanted the rate continued which was fixed by the transport companies whether it was by lorry or by rail the beet was being delivered.</P>
      <P>That was continued down through the years until this year when a change was made introducing the flat rate.  That is what has caused most of the trouble, plus the question of pulp.  I am sure it seems peculiar to many Deputies that during all these years there was very little use made of pulp in any of the areas outside Mallow and Carlow.  I would say that there were many farmers in the Carlow area who, during the years, possibly up to the 40's, got very cheap pulp.  Again, it was a way out for people in Tuam and other places who are anxious to dispose of pulp.  The fact remains that pulp remained the cheapest animal footstuff on the market up to last year.  It was costing £7 15/- per ton.  An analysis of pulp shows that it has the same feeding value as oats.  If you compare the prices of both you will see that pulp was the cheapest animal foodstuff available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sugar Company, in its wisdom, increased the price.  Possibly they were justified for this reason, that there were many growers purchasing pulp in the factory at £7 15/- per ton, plus carriage, and who were disposing <Col N="1544" /> of it in Dublin and elsewhere at £17, £18, and up to £20 per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. The Beet Growers' Association did not enter into it.  They transacted the business between the factory and the individual growers who were purchasing the pulp and they got the munificent sum of 2/6 per ton for doing that.  That is the only interest they had in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We lost 500,000 acres of tillage, and I am going to accuse the Coalition of being responsible for the situation that has arisen.  My reasons are these.  As I said before, you can kill a crop by not giving an adequate price or an economic price to the person who is producing that crop.  That is what the Coalition set out to do, so far as wheat production in this country was concerned.  We heard a lot of talk about Marshall Aid and of its being invested in capital projects, but was not the growing of wheat a capital project in this way in order to secure the independence of our people in a time of emergency or during a war?  It was as desirable an object of capital expenditure as any of these projects of capital expenditure about which we heard so much.  Maybe the Deputy felt that he could not make as many grandiloquent speeches or display his flamboyancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy could not display the same flamboyancy if he had to talk about wheat as one of the necessities of life.  If the 500,000 acres of tillage that we have lost had been devoted to the production of oats, barley, potatoes, turnips, mangolds and straw, on the barley equivalent it would have given us 14,620,000 cwts. of animal foodstuffs, and that would have enabled us to produce 210,000 cwts. of beef, 53,000,000 gallons of milk, 3,000,00 head of poultry, 440,000 pigs, the value for beef being £1,050,000, for milk £3,500,000, for eggs £4,125,000 and for pigs £8,000,000, making in all £16,675,000.  In addition we would have found employment for <Col N="1546" /> the 38,000 or the 48,000 men whom Deputy Dunne claimed had been driven off the land.  That is the result of three years of the Coalition management of agriculture in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of milk prices, which was also raised here, I explained to the House that the Government on coming into office showed their anxiety for the wheat grower.  So also in regard to the milk producer.  One of the first actions of the Government in July or August, 1951, was to increase the price of milk.  Deputy Dillon prior to the election of 1951&mdash;some time about April&mdash;discovered, after three years in office, that no change had taken place since the present Minister for Local Government fixed the price in May 1947.  I suppose the Coalition believed that it was a golden opportunity to hoodwink the farmers, to cajole them and to bribe them into giving them the votes.  Because of that the price of milk was increased in April, 1951. Remember there was an election pending in 1951.  There was no election pending in 1950 when the then Minister for Agriculture went down to Waterford and asked the farmers of the country to produce milk at 1/- per gallon for five years.</P>
      <P>I listened here yesterday to Deputy Madden with the eloquence of a Demosthenes, crying and bewailing over the Minister's attitude to the milk producers of the country at the present time.  I have a recollection of the same Deputy Madden two years ago when he trooped gaily in behind Deputy Dillon to the division lobby, when Deputy Dillon refused to give an increased price to milk producers in this country.  Fianna Fáil supported the demand then: Fianna Fáil believed then, and when they came into office, that the price of milk should be increased and to honour their promises and to show their genuineness and their honesty to the people who were producing milk that increase was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years past it has been my experience that in negotiating prices for any agricultural commodity, the <Col N="1547" /> farmer is always at a disadvantage, whomsoever he was dealing with &mdash; let it be a Government, an individual or a business concern.  He found himself at the disadvantage that when looking for a price he was unable to claim: &ldquo;This is what it costs me to produce it; I must get a margin of profit&rdquo;. The Government has now placed a weapon in the hands of the farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they have set up a Costings Commission, that will enable the farmer to discover for himself what it is costing him to produce a gallon of milk.  When that is done, and when milk is costed, there is no reason why we should not cost wheat, barley and oats and place the farmer in the same category as the shoe factor, the clothier or the proprietor of any other industrial concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that we are doing things.  There was another matter raised by some Deputy which I should have dealt with earlier.  It is the question of cow-testing.  I regard this as being one of the important matters in which our farmers should co-operate.  I refer to <Col N="1550" /> the formation of cow-testing associations, particularly at the present time. when we know that there is a danger to our live stock, due to a multiplicity of causes.  I may say that over the years there has been crossing and recrossing which, during all that time, did damage to our foundation stock. It behoves us now, if we want to raise our stock to the pre-eminence which it should occupy in the country, that our people should help in doing that. There is one way in which they can help and that is through cow-testing associations.  At the moment, we are providing help for those associations in having artificial insemination centres.  That help, with cow-testing, will, I believe, give us a satisfactory stock within a very short period.  I believe that our farmers should make a voluntary effort in forming cow-testing associations.  They are getting help from the Department.  For every 10/- spent, the Department contributes 8/-.  That represents the help they are getting from the Department.  I believe that it is necessary for the farmers themselves to co-operate in building up these cow-testing associations.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the Bansha scheme.  It was tried as an experiment. That experiment is being carried on for the coming year.  There is one feature of the scheme that I am not satisfied with, and that is the non-co-operation, I might say, of some farmers within the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, when this scheme was introduced, made provision for the replacement of uneconomic cows.  A number of heifers were purchased and placed on the Grange farm and on other farms, but when the replacement stage arrived a number of the Bansha farmers preferred to take cash rather than take a heifer.  That might be good business from one point of view, but in my view it was, generally speaking, very bad business because when the replacement stage was reached they went out on the commercial market and purchased a heifer to replace an uneconomic cow.  This heifer had not been tested.  That meant that you had to go back on these farms to re-test the cows, and sometimes you found reactors there.  For that reason I believe that <Col N="1551" /> the scheme is not getting the chance which it deserves.  I believe also that there should be greater co-operation from the farmers in the Bansha area if the scheme is going to be made the success which everyone wishes it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not better to leave them freedom to replace the beasts themselves rather than force them to take the heifers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that, if you do that and if you continue it, where will it get you?  It will not get you anywhere.  Are you not back in the same old position that you were in previously if a farmer can go to any fair and buy a heifer?  He does not know whether she has been tested and she may be a reactor.  That is the danger that I see.</P>
      <P>On that question of the heifer scheme, there is one point that I must refer to.  I am sorry that Deputy Giles is not here.  I do not say that he made an accusation, but said that what he mentioned was a rumour.  The rumour, according to him, was that I, accompanied by a colleague, brought an exporter&mdash;a cattle exporter, I presume&mdash;down to the Grange farm, and that we purchased 40 heifers at £45 each and exported them at £65 each.  That was the charge that was made against me.  I can say at this stage that it is utterly without foundation.  I was at Grange farm on one occasion in the course of my duty as a Minister.  I was accompanied by the chief inspector and the head of the veterinary section.  As is customary with any Minister, I am sure, I went around from farm to farm.  However, for the life of me, I cannot understand the reason for that rumour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Giles mentioned it in this House and said that it was a rumour.  Whether there is foundation for his statement that it is a rumour, I do not know.  The only thing I know is that these heifers were for sale on the Dublin market when <Col N="1552" /> the requirements of the Bansha people were satisfied.  A number of heifers which were surplus to their requirements were sold on the Dublin market to the highest bidder.  I think that Deputy Dillon purchased some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that this is a type of propaganda and defamation.  It is similar to the slanderous statements which we have heard in this country over the years. Our opponents, just in order to gain some mean political advantage, disseminate rumours of this kind, make accusations and defame a person's character.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies, including Deputy Murphy and Deputy Dr. Esmonde, raised the question of farmers' butter. The price of creamery butter has increased to 3/10 per lb. and good farmers' butter will make a reasonable price.  However, the secondary quality butter will not make a good price simply because the market that was there for it has gone.  There was very little difficulty during the war in selling that butter because of the scarcity of other fats.  To-day you have available vegetable fats and a great supply of animal fats.  Confectioners and all those other people who formerly purchased farmers' butter now purchase some other commodity in its stead.  Consequently, it is impossible to find a market for it.  As I told the House last week in reply to a question, the British Ministry of Food are prepared to take a sample&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I will come back to it.  I like to lift a person up and then let him fall.  I did state in my introductory speech that the grants for farm buildings were being increased. I believe it was very necessary, because one of the ways by which we can have increased milk production, for instance, is by having better housing.  There are three things necessary &mdash; a better breed of cow, better housing and better feeding.  In some cases I am increasing the grants from 25 per cent. up to 100 per cent. I would just like to make it clear that the houses that are involved in this are byres, piggeries, poultry-houses, hay-barns, store-houses for produce and store-houses for machinery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer to the reclamation of land here and I would like to remind the House that we have had land reclamation since 1930. It started then in the congested areas. In 1940 we had a development of the 1930 schemes and in 1949 we had a further development of land reclamation, a natural development.  Because we had a shortage of labour, for one thing, we became more mechanicallyminded and as a result of the progress of time the reclamation work that was carried out in 1940 by manual labour was in 1949 carried out by mechanical means.  We heard a lot of talk about this new scheme which was Deputy Dillon's pet scheme but it would surprise the House if they knew that under the old scheme of farm improvements more money was actually spent on the reclamation of land in any one year from 1940 to 1948, notwithstanding the fact that we had to produce more food for our people, we had to send more men into the Army and that there were other reasons why there was a shortage of labour.  But taking all these things into consideration it is a surprising thing that during those years we spent as much money as was spent during the first or second year after the introduction of what was known by Deputy Dillon as the land rehabilitation project.  From 1940 onwards land reclamation and field drainage amounted to £645,500.</P>

      <P>The number of applications received in 1949-50 was 35,750; in 1950-51, 19,925; in 1951-52, 19,740 and in the three months to June of this year, 3,884.  The acreage involved since April was 28,000 and the acreage reclaimed over the period was over 29,000.  The number of applications was, as I have stated, 35,750 and the acreage involved 363,000.  The acreage reclaimed from 1st June, 1949, to 31st March, 1950, was 410 under Section A; under Section B. none.  From 1st April, 1950, to 31st March, 1951, the acreage reclaimed under Section A was 20,562; under Section B none.  From 1st April, 1951, to 31st March, 1952, the acreage reclaimed was 54,114 under Section A and 15,174 under Section B, 12 times as much as was done by the Coalition Government in the year before they left office.  From 1st April, 1952, to 30th June, 1952, we have reclaimed 3,790 acres under Section B and 26,183 acres under Section A.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;project.&rdquo; Everything in America is a project. If one only smokes a cigarette it is a project.  It would not, of course, be good politics or good policy for Deputy Dillon to retain the word &ldquo;reclamation&rdquo; because that would be something like the tomato scheme and all the other schemes that were discontinued when the Coalition came into office in 1948.  They knew land reclamation should continue and the Deputy had to find a new name for it and he went to America to get that name.</P>
      <P>The Deputy stated that there was no quarrel between us.  Other Deputies had said the same thing.  I think it was Deputy Blowick who said that we were continuing the Fine Gael agricultural policy.  I deny that that is so.  The policy that the Coalition followed was the Fianna Fáil policy in so far as Deputy Dillon was satisfied that it would not do any injury to his prestige or to his vanity.  I have already explained how he tried to kill one of the &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; crops here, namely wheat.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that the Fine Gael policy was the policy of one more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough.  We heard that policy talked about 25 and 26 years ago but I heard it years before that. That is the policy that has always obtained in my constituency, the policy of mixed farming.  Twenty-five or 26 years ago a Minister used that phrase in this House.  It is not a new policy even though Fine Gael claim it was their policy.  Let us see how they put it into effect.  If you have one more sow, one more cow and one more acre under the plough you will produce more milk, more cereals and more pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What provision was made 25 and 26 years ago to provide markets for the produce of that extra acre?  Many of us remember 1929-30 when there was no market for malting barley.  I remember it.  I come from a barley-growing <Col N="1561" /> district.  Deputies from Wexford will remember it.  Barley was dropping by 3d. and 6d. a barrel every week and in the end becoming unsaleable. I saw barley kept over from the harvest time until February and March and no market for it.  That was the &ldquo;one more acre under the plough&rdquo;. Because there was no other cash crop for the farmer at that time we did not produce wheat.  What happened regarding the policy of one more cow, one more sow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Questions were asked by some Deputies and even though they have an opportunity of getting answers by means of parliamentary questions, I should like as far as possible to answer them.  Deputy Dillon and myself quarrelled some time ago regarding what he called the parish plan.  It was a three parish plan.  When I came into office, I gave the explanation (1) that I did not agree with the plan and (2) that we had not the technicians to put it into operation.  They were not available and I think it would be a most unjustifiable thing for a Minister to make it a piecemeal job.  However, I was going to go ahead with it, although fundamentally I did not agree with it.  Deputy Dillon's scheme was a scheme for a three-parish plan which took away from the local committee of agriculture all power of control and vested that power in the Department of Agriculture.  I do not agree with that.  We have enough bureaucracy in the country already without providing for more and the farmer is quite capable of looking after his own business.  He is the <Col N="1564" /> man who pays the piper and he must be entitled to call the tune.</P>
      <P>I believe that with the putting into operation of the advice I gave to every county committee, there will not be any difficulty about this, because I have recommended that county committees should employ a greater number of technicians and eventually we will arrive at a stage when we may have an agricultural adviser for every three parishes.  I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Dillon in his suggestion to transfer control from the committee of agriculture to the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Whips have reached agreement regarding business.  The agreement, I understand, involves the adoption of the motion on the Order Paper and an alteration in the Order of Business so as to provide that after the conclusion of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture the Estimates for the Department of Fisheries and the Department of Local Government, and those Estimates only, will be taken.  If there should be time to-morrow after the conclusion of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government that time will be availed of for a discussion on the Appropriation Bill.  The arrangement, of course, contemplates that for Estimates not debated there will be token Estimates for discussion after the Recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in despair about our farmers, particularly our dairy farmers.  I believe that they will use Herefords and Polled Angus judiciously.  They are and must be careful of their dairy herds and if they are to maintain a dairy herd they must have a certain number of their best cows inseminated with the dairy Shorthorn breed.  I have had experience and everybody has had experience of the type of cow which is not a first cross but rather a second or third cross of Herefords. I have advised farmers in every county I have visited that if we continue that policy we will eventually have in this country a cow which will not produce either beef or milk.  I believe that our farmers are conscious of that fact particularly our dairy farmers and will use &mdash; we have not evidence to the contrary &mdash; dairy Shorthorn bulls the more so now that you have first-rate top quality bulls in the insemination stations.</P>

      <P>Not yet.  I was remarking that I had no function in fixing prices for fruit.  The only function I have in this matter is <Col N="1568" /> to issue licences for the import of pulp. I have already assured the Deputy in my reply that I will insist on our own fruit being purchased before import licences are granted.  The quantity of pulp imported now is very small but however small it may be we will see that as far as possible the fruit growers will be protected.  Recently I met a deputation of fruit growers who claimed to represent the fruit growers of most parts of the country, Meath, Wexford, Waterford and so on, and there were other representatives on that deputation.  I made an arrangement with the jam manufacturers that they should meet and fix prices.  I have not had a report of that meeting with the jam manufacturers from the growers.  I take it, therefore, that they have fixed the matter themselves and are satisfied with the arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a penny less than last year.  The jam manufacturers have given various reasons for that: the sale of jam was slow during the year and they have quantities on hands. Again I might say that this is one of the best seasons we have had for a number of years for soft fruits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's information, a grower in my county, a small farmer, had ten acres of strawberries. This small farmer paid £1,000 in wages.  He has ploughed up those ten acres because of the action of the jam manufacturers towards him and his colleagues this year.  That is a very serious thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is very serious, <Col N="1569" /> but this organisation now, speaking on behalf of the fruit growers, were with me and made an arrangement to meet the jam manufacturers.  They met and held discussions and, as I said, I have not had any report from the fruit growers' deputation since; so I take it that they made an amicable arrangement with the jam manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Murphy, referring to flax, alleged that I advised people to grow flax.  I did not, at any time.  A parliamentary question was put down and I stated in reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been informed by the Irish Scutch Millers' and Growers' Association that they have agreed with the Flax Spinners' Association, Belfast, that they (the spinners) will take up to a maximum of 1,250 tons of the 1952 flax crop.  Assuming average yields, this tonnage would be equivalent to the produce of approximately 7,000 acres or slightly more than half the acreage under flax in 1951.  In the circumstances, any farmer growing flax this year is running the risk that he may not find a market for it and he would be well advised to consider using his land for the growing of crops for which there are assured outlets and remunerative prices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the answer I gave, and I mention it in order to correct the misstatement of those Deputies that I encouraged farmers to produce flax.</P>

Deputy Lehane was very critical about the pigs and bacon agreement and for some reason or other he could not understand what arrangements have been made.  No matter what I say to him, he still believes there is a catch in this agreement, that the shippers of live pigs are in some way contributing by way of levy towards a fund to bolster up the price of bacon.  That is wrong.  As Deputy Dillon knows, this agreement must be taken <i>in toto</i>, the export of live pigs, the export of bacon and the export of pork.  At the moment we are exporting pork; it suits the British better to import pork and it helps us. We were inclined to send any of our animals out dead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to raise a matter of very great import as regards the proceedings of this House, the dignity of its procedure and the privileges of its Deputies.  It is with very great regret, indeed, that I have, once more, to direct your attention and the attention of the Dáil to a very gross breach of privilege.  I had occasion on the 31st January last, I think, to draw your attention to an assault committed on a Deputy of this House by another Deputy.  On this occasion, I regret to say that the matter is even more serious.  A very short time ago a Deputy belonging to the Fine Gael Party was assaulted by a member of the Government.  He was in the precincts of this House, near the Inquiry Office, when by accident, he happened to meet the Minister for Education.  He put a query to him with reference to a letter that he had written about a matter concerning one of his constituents.  It was reported to me that the Minister made an offensive remark, whereupon Deputy S. Collins walked away.  He was followed by the Minister for Education who made another observation &mdash; also of an offensive character.  Deputy S. Collins walked down the steps outside the entrance to Leinster House whereupon the Minister assaulted him physically.  The Deputy warded off the blow and proceeded to walk towards his car in which a visitor awaited him. The Minister for Education took off his glasses and proceeded to follow the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts as reported to me and, if they are in any way approaching a correct account of what occurred, it does not need any words of mine to emphasise the gravity of the situation and the threat not merely to the privileges of members but to the democratic institutions of the Dáil.  I would ask you, therefore, a Chinn Chomhairle, without entering into any further discussion, yourself personally to investigate this matter as one of the highest import for every private <Col N="1579" /> Deputy in this Dáil and for the preservation of the decorum of the proceedings of the Dáil and the respect which our proceedings must have from the people.</P>

      <P>This, of course, is a matter which perturbs me and every Deputy of this House.  It will require a good deal of examination to find a satisfactory solution.  Every Deputy is anxious that the decorum of this House should be preserved and that it should be free from any taint. All I can say to the House at the present moment is that I will endeavour to find out what are the facts of the case and deal with the circumstances within the powers conferred on me by this House.</P>

Teastaíonn tuille airgid leis an gcóir chosanta ar na haibhneacha a dhaingiú, agus táthar ag tabhairt aire don scéal sin.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Fisheries Estimate for 1952/53, it is necessary to explain the changes that have been made in the Estimate since it was published in the official volume of Estimates for the Public Services for the financial year ending 31st March, 1953.  In that volume the net total of the Fisheries Estimate was given as £328,130.  The net total of the revised Estimate as circulated recently to Deputies is £211,530, a decrease of £116,600.  This decrease is not a reduction in the estimated expenditure on the fisheries services for the current financial year as may appear, but is due to the fact that a sum of £55,000 has been withdrawn from <Col N="1581" /> sub-head G (2) and a sum of £61,600 from sub-head G (3).</P>
    <P>These sums, which represent the advances to be made to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the provision of boats and gear to fishermen on hire purchase and for various works of general development respectively, will be provided from the Central Fund as they are really advances for capital investment.</P>
    <P>It will be recollected that it was specially provided at Section 18 of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, that the Minister may advance from time to time to the board such sums as the board may from time to time request. It will be noted that in the revised Estimate the sum of £15,000 appears under G (2) and the sum of £23,750 under sub-head G (3).  These sums were advanced to the Sea Fisheries Association before the new board came into office and for that reason they still appear in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>While the Sea Fisheries Bill, 1952, was before the House, I gave a rather comprehensive account of recent developments leading to the present position of the sea-fishing industry and I do not think that it is necessary to go over that ground again, except to repeat that it is now clear that if we are to arrest the decline which has been evident in the industry for some years past and to bring about an increase in landings and employment we must employ more efficient methods of production than heretofore.  Landings from inshore waters, i.e., the waters which lie within ten miles or so off our coasts, have been declining and there is no reason to expect that the stocks of fish in these waters will improve as long as intensive fishing is carried on on the present scale by large fishing boats in the waters which lie off our coasts but which are open to the fishermen of all countries.  The main line of development must, in the circumstances, be the provision of fishing boats of increased catching power and wider range of activity for our fishermen.</P>
    <P>During the past year or two the majority of the boats issued to our fishermen on hire-purchase through the agency of the Sea Fisheries Association, <Col N="1582" /> which has now been replaced by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, have been of the 50 ft. class.  These boats when adequately powered can engage in all types of fishing and can go to sea with safety except in extreme weather conditions.  It is not intended to limit the size of fishing boats to 50 ft. and boats of larger dimensions will be issued as time goes on.  The best efforts of our inshore fishermen even when furnished with boats of the 50 ft. class, cannot be expected to maintain an adequate and regular supply of fish in suitable variety from one end of the year to the other, as it is inevitable that their activities will be curbed occasionally by weather conditions, and seasonal fluctuations in fish stocks will reduce their landings. There is room, in the circumstances, for some considerable time for boats which can visit distant fishing grounds involving an absence from home of some weeks if we are to strive to reach as early as possible the position when imports of fish will become unnecessary.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara came into office on 24th April, 1952, and they have already made arrangements to acquire three modern fishing vessels of 100 ft. overall.  These vessels will be operated by the board itself and will be sent to fishing grounds in distant waters.  It is hoped that these boats will be able to stabilise supplies to some extent throughout the year and the experience gained with them will decide whether the employment of such boats by the board should be continued and expanded, perhaps, as a permanent feature of the fishing industry.  I may assure Deputies that in operating these vessels every precaution will be taken to ensure that their activities will not worsen conditions for the communities of inshore fishermen scattered around our coasts and the preservation and welfare of which is a fundamental matter of policy with the Government.</P>
    <P>As regards the general condition of the sea-fishing industry, in 1951 the total weight of landings of all sea-fish (excluding shell-fish) was 187,600 cwt. compared with 214,200 cwt. in 1950. The landings of demersal fish, i.e., fish which is usually found on or near the sea bed, showed a reduction of only <Col N="1583" /> 600 cwt., and in this connection it is pleasant to note that the landings of such fish by inshore boats, increased by about 5,800 cwt.; the net reduction of 600 cwt. was brought about by the decrease of 6,400 cwt. in the landings made by steam trawlers.  The reducttion in landings in 1951 compared with 1950 is accounted for, therefore, almost entirely by the drop in the landings of pelagic fish (herrings, mackerel and sprats) from 94,600 cwt. to 68,600 cwt. There was a serious fall in the landings of herring which in 1951 came to 49,800 cwt. compared with 67,800 cwt. in 1950.  Mackerel showed a drop of 2,800 cwt. from the 1950 landings of 19,800 cwt. while sprats fell away from 6,900 cwt. in 1950 to 1,800 cwt. in 1951.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, herring and mackerel are very fickle fish and there is nothing like regularity either in their visits to our coasts or the density of the shoals whenever they put in an appearance.  In 1951, herring seasons at almost all the points on the coast where herring fishing is pursued were disappointing in both the summer and winter seasons.  The herring made its appearance at most places but its stay within reach of the inshore fishing boats was of short duration and the shoals were not heavy.  Mackerel fishing, the main centre of which has traditionally been along the Kerry coast and some points on the Cork coast, was a failure in 1951.  The fish were observed to be in the outer waters but they did not come close inshore in any density.</P>
    <P>As regards shell-fish, there was some improvement in 1951 compared with 1950 as the value of the landings increased from £87,100 to £93,600.  It is not possible to give shell-fish landings by weight as some of the varieties are reckoned by number.  The variety that showed the biggest increase in landings was crayfish.</P>
    <P>As regards the catching power of the fishing fleets, the number of motor fishing boats still continues to increase steadily from year to year.  In 1951, 653 motor boats were engaged compared with 622 in 1950.  These figures show a very considerable improvement compared with pre-war years when the <Col N="1584" /> average number of motor boats in commission was only 390.  The number of unengined boats in the fishing industry shows very little fluctuation from year to year; it remains pretty constant at about 2,700.  The strength and efficiency of the fishing fleet is being constantly improved by the issue of additional craft through the medium of the hire-purchase scheme operated heretofore by the Sea Fisheries Association, and now by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  As an indication of the efforts being made to meet the needs of our fishermen in the matter of more efficient fishing boats in the shortest possible time, I may mention that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has now four building and repair yards in operation.  As well as building as many boats as possible in these yards in addition, of course, to any repair work that may be necessary, orders are placed with boat-building firms in this country and occasionally outside it.</P>
    <P>During the period from the 1st April, 1951 to the 31st March, 1952, 14 fishing boats of 50 ft. and over and three boats of lesser dimensions were issued to fishermen on hire-purchase terms; new engines were installed in four other cases.  At present nine fishing boats are under construction and it is expected that between this and the end of March next 13 boats will be ready for issue.  With the issue of so many first-class fishing craft, fitted with all the latest equipment to enable them to make the best possible use of their time there is every reason to expect that the landings of fish as to quantity, regularity and variety by our inshore fishermen will continue to improve. Most of these men are highly skilled and it is only due to them that they should be furnished with boats which will enable them to employ their efforts to the best advantage and also that they should have as much comfort as possible while they have to live on board when fishing on grounds which are far removed from their home ports.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of landings during 1951, it would be relevant to make reference to the position as regards exports and imports during that year.  Much comment is often <Col N="1585" /> made on the fact that considerable imports of fish are permitted.  Imports are unfortunately necessary as long as our home fishing fleets cannot meet the consumer demand throughout the year.  It must be remembered in this connection that the consumer requires a certain amount of variety in fish supplies and it has been proved that a demand cannot be created and maintained for any one class of fish week in week out.  Every care is taken, however, in the importation of fish to ensure that the quantities brought in are just sufficient and certainly not more than are required to bridge the gap between the landings by our own fishermen and the requirements of the market.</P>
    <P>In 1951 the value of imports of fresh and cured fish was £295,000; in addition, fish preserved in sealed containers to the value of £526,000 was imported. A heavy proportion of the fresh fish imported consisted of herrings which were needed by the trade when herrings were not being landed by our own fishermen.  The cured fish consisted mainly of smoked fish in the form of smoked fillets of cod or such fish and kippered herrings.  As I said before, it is hoped to reach the stage eventually when we will not require imports of such magnitude, as it is expected that our own inshore boats, plus the larger boats which will be employed to supplement their efforts, will eventually be able to keep a more or less adequate supply of fish on the market throughout the year.</P>
    <P>As regards fish in sealed containers, the position is, and I think it will be agreed by most people, that tinned fish has a place on the consumers' list in all countries, as fish so preserved has the attraction of being easily handled and readily available in all parts of the country.  It is a fact that such fish is preferred by many people to fresh or smoked cured fish.  The position will probably remain that imports will be necessary until such time as we are in a position to undertake the canning of fish ourselves.  This is not a development which can be lightly undertaken as canned fish must be available in a large range of varieties and, furthermore, the variety which is in keenest <Col N="1586" /> demand is salmon.  To bear the expenses of canning and marketing, salmon would have to be available at a very low price, and as there is a keen and constant demand in the fresh state for all the salmon we can produce there is very little hope that salmon will ever be available in this country for canning purposes.</P>
    <P>As against the imports of fish, it may be mentioned that in 1951 our exports of all classes of fish came to £1,027,000; sea-fish came to £160,200, while the fresh-water fish, salmon, trout and eels and some rough fish, came to £866,800.  Taking our extern trade in fish as a whole, we find that we had a balance in our favour of about £206,000.</P>
    <P>As regards inland fisheries, conditions of water and weather during 1951 season in general favoured fishing by commercial methods rather than rod and line.  The statistics for captures of salmon by the various methods came to 25,270 cwt. valued at £731,826 in 1951 as compared with 18,778 cwt. for which £563,024 was returned in 1950.</P>
    <P>The salmon season in 1951 was characterised by good runs of fish in those rivers which rely in the main on spring fish.  The large spring fish, which have been declining for some years, showed a welcome increase and the improved catches in many rivers in the months of February and March must be attributed to the high proportion of fish of this class.  The late spring and early summer fish which run from the end of April until about the 10th June in a normal year were probably less numerous than usual and this accounted for the very poor catches in most rivers during that period.</P>
    <P>The runs of grilse, which are small fish with an average weight of 6-7 lb., took place much later than usual and the peak of the run in most areas was two to three weeks later than normally expected.  Despite the lateness of the run the catches of grilse were remarkably good and in many areas in this respect the season was as good as that of 1941, when exceptionally good runs of grilse were also experienced.  The abundance <Col N="1587" /> of grilse in the late rivers more than compensated for the paucity of early summer fish and almost without exception the catches of salmon in 1951 were an improvement on those of 1950.</P>
    <P>The position regarding inland fisheries is generally satisfactory but the experience of boards of conservators throughout the country is that the statutory sources of revenue available to them&mdash;chiefly fishery rates and fishing licence duties&mdash;are proving to be year after year to an increasing extent inadequate to afford an adequate protection service.  This is due chiefly to the need for expanded and better protection in view of the incentive to illegal fishing which is offered by the current high prices for salmon, and the progressive rise in wage levels for all classes of protection staff.  These financial difficulties have become acute in many areas and I have under consideration proposals under which I hope that additional funds may be made available on the basis of contributions by the industry itself towards the cost of obtaining that protection without which the industry cannot prosper.</P>
    <P>The sum of £65,000 set down in the Estimate under sub-head F (5) is the amount expected to fall due for payment as compensation to those who can show that they suffered loss through the abolition of fresh-water netting by the operation of Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939, as from the 1st January, 1948.  Amounts totalling over £67,000 have been paid to date in respect of such claims.  Since the passage of the Fresh-water Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951, the way is open for the acceptance of genuine claims and as 30th June was the last date for the receipt of claims there is every hope that the payment of compensation can be completed within the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The provision made under sub-head H standing at £57,765 includes a substantial item of non-recurring expenditure, namely, the sum of £55,115 being the contribution of this State towards the cost of acquisition jointly with the Belfast authorities of fishing rights in the tidal waters of the Rivers Foyle <Col N="1588" /> and Faughan heretofore claimed by the Irish Society.  The agreement for acquisition of these rights on behalf of the public has been duly executed under the authority of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, and the administration of the fishery is now in the hands of the Foyle Fisheries Commission as constituted under that Act. This commission has the functions not only of conservation of the fishery as if it were a board of conservators, but also management of the property which is vested in the Governments and the power of governing the fishery by its own statutory regulations, subject only to the approval of the fishery authorities and of their respective Legislatures.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust, a company registered under the Companies Acts, is now functioning, and the sum of £4,900 is provided under sub-head F (6) by way of grant-in-aid to cover expenses of administration and development of fishing waters.  The Trust has already under its control extensive fisheries in Counties Cavan, Westmeath, Meath, Longford, Roscommon and the Midlands generally, as well as in County Cork, and a special staff is working on Lough Sheelin in the elimination of predatory fish.  It is the policy of the Trust to develop all waters under its control on a planned scientific basis, so that ultimately they may be as productive of brown trout as they possibly can be.  The financial provision is a modest one, and lest it should be criticised as being inadequate, I should like to emphasise that more important than financial assistance at this stage is the co-operation without which the Trust cannot be expected to function&mdash;the co-operation of the trout fishermen of the country by becoming members of the Trust and taking an interest in the programme of work which it has in hands.</P>
    <P>As well as the efforts of the Trust, encouragement is also provided in a number of forms for the improvement of fisheries through the agency of angling associations.  Such bodies often think solely in terms of restocking the waters under their control, and while increased provision is made for the schemes under which brown trout ova are made available at subsidised <Col N="1589" /> prices, it is right to point out that funds are also provided to encourage associations in activities such as the protection of spawning fish and the destruction of pests such as cormorants, otters and coarse fish.  It may well be said that efforts at restocking are worthless if not integrated into a general scheme of protection and improvement.  The increasing realisation of this fact is becoming evident in the growing number of angling associations who now undertake schemes for the removal of coarse fish.  Considerable interest is also being shown in the experiments which are being conducted by our scientific staff in connection with the elimination of coarse fish and fertilisation of trout waters by adding chemical nutrients.</P>
    <P>The other items in the Estimate follow the usual lines and there is very little that I can say by way of informative comment on them.  If there are any points, however, about which any Deputy desires information I will, of course, be glad to answer his queries as fully as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that when the Parliamentary Secretary read his simple statement he would add some remarks and give us his own views on these matters, and not the views of that section of the Department of Agriculture which deals with fisheries. It has been recognised that fishing comes perhaps next in importance to agriculture but, unfortunately, as the years go by, especially since we got possession of our fisheries, and have had our own Department responsible for the welfare of the industry, it looks as if we have neither fish nor fishermen. It is almost impossible at the present time to get young men to man the fishing boats that are available along the coast.  I had personal experience <Col N="1590" /> of this a year or two ago when a report was made that trawlers fishing in Kenmare Bay, within the territorial waters, were foreign trawlers.  After a report had been made to the Department of Fisheries it was discovered that the boats really belonged to an Irish national, but that he could not possibly get Irish nationals to fish in these boats, and he was obliged to bring men from Scotland.  The owner of these boats, registered here in Dublin, gave a guarantee to the Department and to me personally that if and when he could find men here in Ireland to man his boats, he would send the Scotsmen home.</P>
      <P>When you find that some of our young men, the sons of fishermen, are not willing in these times to carry on the trade of their fathers and grandfathers, and when you cannot find any people, hitherto not connected with fishing, wishing to engage in that trade, there must be something wrong. They must foresee that there is no future in that occupation.  I am not blaming the present Parliamentary Secretary for that, nor, I suppose, can I blame any of the previous Parliamentary Secretaries to Ministers for it, but there certainly must be some dereliction of duty on the part of the Department or of some Minister, in view of the fact that no progress has been made in the fishing industry during the past 13 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will admit that the Department responsible for fisheries and the old Sea Fisheries Association were at all times anxious and willing to afford all the facilities possible to really good fishermen in the way of supplying them with boats and gear to carry on their calling.  I would like to say that, personally&mdash;I am sure it will be news to very many people in this country and to fishermen too&mdash;I believe it would have been better if the Sea Fisheries Association had been allowed to carry on its work under the old scheme instead of setting up this new board which is now called An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I had apprehensions, when the Bill setting up that board was going through the Dáil, that its personnel would be selected on political lines.  When I see the names of the individuals who now comprise that board I feel <Col N="1591" /> perfectly certain that it does not represent in any way whatsoever the fishermen or those interested in fishing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a political board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can draw whatever conclusions he likes from what I have said.  While I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary mention that the policy of his Department now was to supply, as far as possible, large boats, 50-foot boats, I heard myself&mdash;I was in the audience&mdash;a member of that board distinctly state in Portmagee, County Kerry, that, so far as he was concerned, there was no use for these boats in that area.  However, his statement was very soon proved false, because I discovered later that many fishermen, in fact all the fishermen in that area who could afford it&mdash;I am sure the same would apply to all other areas around the coast&mdash;were most anxious to obtain the necessary facilities by which they would be provided with these boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will admit that the Sea Fisheries Association and the Department of Fisheries, in all cases where applications were made by fishermen for the larger type of boat, met those applications in a very sympathetic manner. Of course, we all understand that they are very costly boats.  Some two or three years ago they cost something like £5,000.  Possibly, now, the cost is £6,000, and with the gear attached to them, a further £1,000 if the fishermen are to be fully equipped.  I am glad to say that, in the particular area in which I would be most interested, we eventually obtained for the area eight or ten of those 50-foot boats.  The applicants pay something like a 10 per cent. deposit.  I think that in cases where a fisherman with a good record in the past, a fisherman who has fulfilled all his obligations during past years, makes an application for the best type of boat and gear to enable him and the members of his family and other fishermen whom he may employ to engage in fishing, it should never be refused by the Department, and that at all times <Col N="1592" /> every facility should be afforded to him, even if he cannot, for the time being, afford to pay the 10 per cent. deposit.  In a case of that kind, he should never be left without a boat.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made that a definite rule. It was carried out to the letter.  I have no doubt that the present Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are also anxious to do the very same, because, after all, if we are to make the fishing industry prosperous the first and most necessary object in view must be to supply a really good fisherman with the type of boat and gear that he thinks best to enable him to make a success of his calling.  There is a difficulty in that connection as regards inshore fishermen.  Because of the small type of boat they had previously, they did not go very far out to sea. When they got the larger boats they, too, would seem to have confined their operations very near the shore.  I think that, if the Department instructed them to follow the fish to any distance around the coast or out to sea, they would certainly be able to meet their commitments, as regards the repayment of the advances made to them, very much sooner than they can do at present.</P>
    <P>The inshore fishermen will now have the grievance that when some of their neighbours get those larger boats they will capture all the fish outside and so deprive them of the shoals which they would otherwise expect to meet.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that they are about to put into operation three modern fishing boats, 100 feet in length.  That is a very serious matter for the inshore fisherman and for the fisherman with the larger boat because, in reality, it will be the State in opposition to private enterprise. While a clause in the Fisheries Bill which was passed recently gives the State power to do that, I am afraid we did not realise that such a clause would be put into operation so quickly. Three modern fishing boats 100 feet long&mdash;and I suppose the State will not stop at that&mdash;can fish far out to sea and capture the shoals of mackerel, herring and so forth.  That will cause a serious injury to the fishermen with <Col N="1593" /> the small boats who can never go out beyond a mile or two from the shore. Furthermore, it is possible that the large boats with their big catches may flood the market so that when the inshore fishermen come with their catches they may not find anybody to purchase them.</P>
    <P>At present, even near the shore and along the shore, we never see any fish. I live in a town beside the sea.  Only very seldom is any fish brought into that village.  In fact, it is most difficult to get fish there and when it can be got at all it is a most exorbitant price.  I understand that the men who catch the fish have a grievance that the price they obtain does not compensate them for their labours and enable them to meet their commitments in the way of repayment on their boats and gear.  It is obvious, therefore, that something must be wrong. Hitherto the inshore fishermen had a grievance that they could not catch the fish because foreign trawlers, operating inside and outside our territorial waters, captured all the shoal and left them without anything.</P>
    <P>Fishermen in all areas along the coast have been continually seeking protection in that respect.  The Department of Defence are supposed to be responsible for the protection of our territorial waters but there is no protection.  The Department of Defence corvettes are not suitable for the work of protecting our territorial waters.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it should be possible to devise some means of carrying out that work effectively.  If some of the 50-foot boats or perhaps the 100-foot boats were equipped in the correct way, they too, while carrying out their fishing operations, could help to protect the territorial waters.  Provision could be made for some little extra payment for fishermen thus employed.  We could have look-out posts along the shore or a coast-watch service with which they could communicate at once and receive instructions as to the procedure to be adopted to prevent foreign trawlers from poaching in our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>The real grievance of fishermen is that they have not the necessary protection. If they have that protection, <Col N="1594" /> and if they are supplied with the type of boat and gear which they think would best enable them to follow their calling, the only question that remains is whether or not the shoals of fish will come within their reach.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned, mackerel, herrings, and so forth, are sometimes rather finicky.  They resort to certain waters at certain times and then, for some reason or other, they leave these waters.  However, if the fish are not there to catch certainly the blame cannot be laid on the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister in charge of the Department.  In order to protect fishermen, and especially fishermen with 30-foot, 35-foot or 40-foot boats, it is essential that look-out posts should be manned along the coast.  We have frequently asked the Department to do that.  In the past three or four years there have been some very sad accidents to fishermen in my own area.  If these outposts along the south coast, which are at present dismantled, had been properly manned and equipped, it is probable that these valuable lives could have been saved.  We should not think of the cost where lives are concerned.</P>
    <P>Again we have these old primitive piers or slips, and I have seen at various times at Reenard Point pier in Cahirciveen when the fishing is good and when a number of boats come in laden with fish, they must wait there for a very long time before they can land their catch.  For years past representations have been made by the fishermen, by Dáil Deputies and by various bodies to have that pier and some other piers improved.  Nothing has been done.  The matter is still under consideration.  I fail to see why something could not be done in that way if we are really serious in improving the fishing industry.  After all you cannot expect men to go out to fish if they are not properly equipped with boats and gear.  You cannot expect them to take up that occupation if the territorial waters are not protected properly and if there is not some lifesaving service or some look-out post which will enable them to feel that if an accident occurs rescue will soon take place.  Neither can we expect <Col N="1595" /> them to carry out their calling and carry on this business of fishing unless they have proper piers and slips on which to land their catch.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking of the supply of boats of the best type, I forgot to mention that I believed it would now be necessary&mdash;and I am sure that it is being done in various cases&mdash;that these large boats should be supplied with radar which would enable the fishermen to arrive at the proper fishing places and to discover the shoals so that there might be no waste of time in getting fish.</P>
    <P>As regards the inland fisheries there has been a most despicable practice in many areas of poisoning rivers.  It is disgusting to find in the morning so many salmon fry and fish of all kinds floating dead on the surface of the water.  It is a practice that has been carried out not only in my own areas but, I suppose, in various areas.</P>

      <P>They would not be very far behind in Cork.  There is a serious lack of morale among the people.  I know, of course, what the ordinary people say, that the fish belong, perhaps, to foreigners, but I believe that if all the fish of the various rivers and lakes were handed over to the local farmers, as has sometimes been suggested, the position would not improve.  Jealousies will always arise and so far as the poisoning of rivers is concerned, if the culprit is discovered and if it is distinctly proved that he is responsible for the destruction done to the fish in the river, to an important Irish industry, the law should inflict on him the most severe from of punishment.  Deputy Corry is laughing. I hope he has not been responsible for anything like that, even though he may be responsible for a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I do not wish to delay the House any longer and as I have covered the various points I wished to bring forward and which might help the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department I merely wish to say that <Col N="1596" /> so far as this important industry is concerned, nothing should be left undone which would improve the lot of the fishermen around our coasts so that an industry which was, at one time at least, considered second to agriculture, may still progress and so that the fishermen of this country may be able to follow their calling and make a decent living at the occupation which they follow.</P>

When the interParty Government put a creature of that type in charge of fisheries in this country it is no wonder we went rather astray.</P>

      <P>We had the complaint made by those in charge of our trawlers that they could not get the crew to man them.  They had to go to Scotland to get crews.  The next contradiction was we were told the fishermen were most anxious to get a larger type of boat. I wonder what they wanted a larger type of boat for if they could get no one to man it except Scotsmen?  Then we had a protest against the 100-foot boat that the fisheries branch was getting.  Then we had a complaint about the foreign trawlers coming in and taking our fish.  Was there ever such a mixum-gatherum from the front bench opposite?  The front bench is falling asunder pretty fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spent the past eight or nine years writing to the fisheries branch of the Department of Agriculture in connection with the pier at Ballycotton. There was very little use writing there during the last three and a half years <Col N="1597" /> whilst the £94,000,000 were being spent. I do not know who got that money.  The pier in Ballycotton has been neglected for a number of years.  It has fallen into such a state of disrepair due to neglect, that last winter it was broken up, and half of it was washed away by the tide.  The responsible member of the Sea Fisheries Association living in the district actually prohibited the purchase of any large boats or, indeed, any fishing boats by the people in the district because there was no adequate shelter for them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary visited the district, and he has seen the condition of affairs there for himself.  He has a knowledge of the fishing industry, and unlike his predecessor, he knows the conditions under which the larger boats envisaged by the fisheries branch will have to operate.  They will require harbours and proper piers in which they can shelter during adverse weather.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that work on the pier at Ballycotton should now go ahead.  The Parliamentary Secretary has received proposals from the local authority concerned and the county council in connection with it.  We hear a lot of talk from Ministers and Deputies in relation to the importation of things that can be produced within the country itself.  If you visit the town of Bantry you would think you were in Spain because 90 per cent. of the people you meet there are sailors off a Spanish trawler having come in there for shelter.  When one sees that condition of affairs one can only conclude that it is time the fisheries branch took a tumble to itself and decided to put vessels at the disposal of the fishermen to enable them to supply the country with fish.  The sooner that is done the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary <Col N="1598" /> Secretary in charge of the fishing industry has a personal knowledge of fishing.  He knows just where the shoe pinches.  I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary when he intends to introduce the legislation recently guaranteed by him to take the river fisheries out of the hands of the foreigners who operate them and vest them in the State.  We have the extraordinary position of farmers paying annuities and rates in my constituency for the ground over which the river flows, a river that a foreigner holds and has the right to let to another foreigner who comes along to fish there from the farmers' lands along the river bank.  I think that anomaly should cease.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Bill in connection with that will be a welcome one.  I do not want to go into details of the ends these people had to adopt in an endeavour to bring home to those in authority the condition of affairs under which they were paying for land out of which the foreigner had the right to take anything that was any good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency where fishing was&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;was&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;a very important industry, it is only right that I should make a few brief comments on this Estimate.  I am not personally very conversant with the fishing industry, though I live very close to the sea, but I have been asked by a number of fishermen to put a few points before the Minister.  It is very difficult to understand the decline in the fishing industry in recent years, but I believe that unless some definite measures are adopted in the near future, that decline will continue until the industry is completely wiped out. I know many fishermen in my constituency and know only too well that the majority of them are finding it very difficult to get anything near a reasonable income from fishing at present.  I know well that it is almost equally difficult to assign reasons for this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, years ago, there was no area where fishing was more prosperous than around the coast of the constituency I represent, West Cork. <Col N="1599" /> I have been informed by various elderly men, old fishermen, around the coast that such centres as Bantry, Schull, Castletownbere and Baltimore were hives of industry and that barrels of fish were exported from these ports in years past.  Unfortunately, that is not the position to-day and very little, if any, fish is being sent off from some of these centres.  When fishing was in its heyday, it was of advantage not only to the fishermen but to the traders and others in the towns and villages. The money the fishermen earned was an advantage to traders, publicans and so on.  They had the money and it went around, to the advantage of the whole community.</P>
    <P>It is, as I say, very difficult to assign reasons for the decline in recent years, but it has been put to me by experiencd fishermen that one of the principal reasons is the havoc wrought by foreign trawlers.  Everybody knows that these foreign trawlers are doing damage all around our coast at present and depriving our Irish fishermen of a livelihood, and I believe that some more definite measures to prevent these people coming within the three-mile limit must be adopted.  More money must be made available by the Department of Defence, which I believe is the Department concerned, to protect the livelihoods of our Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not a national but an international question, but various people who know and understand everything connected with fishing believe it would be a very good day's work for our fishermen if we could get an agreement to extend the three-mile limit.  From inquiries I have made, I understand that that is something very difficult to do, as it is an international question.  However, before leaving that point, I want to impress as forcibly and as strongly as I can on the Parliamentary Secretary now in charge of our fishing industry to make the strongest representations possible to the Department of Defence to secure extra boats for the protection of our coast from the foreigners who are coming not only from England, <Col N="1600" /> Scotland and Wales but from Spain as well.</P>
    <P>The second reason which our fishermen assign for the decline in the industry is that many of them, for financial reasons, have to contend with very ill-equipped boats.  I know a number of people who have boats which are not capable of weathering any rough seas or of moving out too far from the coast.  They have consequently to confine themselves to areas within a very short distance of the coast and it is only natural that their incomes should be greatly reduced on that account. If they had boats which could weather storms and which would enable them to be more courageous and to face out into the open sea, their catches would be much larger.  I know what the Sea Fisheries Association is doing so far as making loans available to fishermen for the purchase of boats is concerned, but I believe they are rather too strict and should work on a much more businesslike basis.  From the information at my disposal, they are very careful lest they be caught out.  As Deputy Palmer pointed out, any decent fisherman who is able to put up reasonable surety should have no difficulty whatever in getting funds for equipping his boat, and I hope that a change of attitude will take place in regard to the making of loans and, indeed, grants.  We have grants for this, that and the other, and I cannot for the life of me see why grants should not be made available to suitable applicants, applicants whose families have spent years fishing our high seas, and it would be a very good day's work if the Parliamentary Secretary drew up a scheme whereby grants, together with interest-free loans, could be made available to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned in the discussion was the inadequacy of many of the piers and slips around the coast.  I am not conversant with other districts, but I feel sure that there is no place which suffers more from that point of view than the West Cork coastal district. We have time and again made representations to every Government which held office since the inception of the State, with, I regret to say, very <Col N="1601" /> little result.  Deputy Corry mentioned the need for a pier at Ballycotton. That is a question which has been dealt with at the county council meeting simultaneously with another somewhat similar but more important matter from the point of view of my district, the provision of a breakwater at Schull.  The parish priest of Schull has gone to great extremes to try to get a Government grant for the erection of a breakwater at Schull pier to protect the fishermen's boats.  At present, because there is little or no protection there, on a night of gale the fishermen live in fear of finding in the morning that their boats have been wrecked completely.  That state of affairs should not be allowed to exist in the year 1952.  I would impress on the Parliamentary Secretary, as the parish priest of Schull and a number of fishermen who came with him as a deputation to Cork County Council impressed on the members of that body, the urgent need for this breakwater.</P>
    <P>Numerous applications are made for the erection of piers and slips at other quarters to help the fishermen. I know that it is very difficult from every angle, financial and engineering, to go into all those applications, but little or no effort is made.  I think it is only reasonable to ask that some qualified person, engineer or otherwise, should look into those applications and report whether they are justifiable.  It is very regrettable that irrespective of whether they are justifiable or not it takes two or three years before they are examined by an engineer of any description whatsoever.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accommodate as soon as possible people who make justifiable applications and to try to get all applications examined within at most eight or nine months.</P>
    <P>I put down a question in this House about a very important matter and I regret to say that I got an unfavourable reply.  I believe that Deputy Corry touched on it a few moments ago.  I cannot see for the life of me why in this country of ours which is supposed to be a Republic we have <Col N="1602" /> stretches of river confined solely and entirely to one individual family, in some cases to Lord This or Lord That and in others to Sir So and So.  That state of affairs should not be allowed to obtain.  Every river in the country should be free for every man, woman and child irrespective of who they are or what they are.  It is regrettable in the year 1952 we should have stretches of river here, there and everywhere&mdash;even in my own county I know a number&mdash;confined exclusively to one family.  I do not wish to cast any aspersion on anyone but the majority of those families, or I could say all of them, are Irish neither in name nor in origin.  I do not see why that privilege should continue and I hope that before the next 12 months have gone by it will be withdrawn.  I hope that by then these rivers where such privileged people enjoy the fishing rights can be fished in by every man, woman and child with no thanks to anybody.  That is reasonable and I believe that Deputy Corry had the same opinion.</P>
    <P>Even though I live close to the sea I have no practical knowledge of fishing and consequently it is rather difficult for me to make further comments, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take his courage in his hands and deal as bravely as he can with this very important industry and, if necessary, to provide more money to restore it to the place everybody admits it held in former years, that of the second most important industry in the country, the industry second only to agriculture.  I feel sure that if he adopts that attitude he will have the support, not only of every member of the House but of every citizen in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that fishing should be our principal industry because, first of all, we have unlimited supplies of what might be called the raw material, we have fish in abundance off our coasts; and secondly, we have a sufficient number of fishermen. That being so, all that is needed is to put sufficient money into its development and make it the most important industry in the country.  That is a matter for the Government.  Fisheries <Col N="1603" /> should not be tied as a tail-end to agriculture. The industry is of such importance that it should be allocated a Minister and in that way it would get the attention it deserves.  Up to now we have been toying with it and it is about time that some earnest effort should be put into it and not alone effort but money.  Any money spent on that industry will pay immediate and substantial dividends.  We have not far to go for examples.  Other countries in Europe make a success of the industry and they are no more favourably placed than we are.  We have everything they have and more. All that we lack is money, and the borrowing of large sums for this purpose would be justifiable even under present financial conditions.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about fishing rights on rivers.  Other Deputies have mentioned the question.  The fishing rights on these rivers are, in the main, held by absentee landlords whose estates have been bought out by the Land Commission.  It is not and it was not right that they should have been allowed to hold on to the fishing and gaming rights.  It is time now that our Government got control of these valuable rights for the people.  Many farmers whose lands border rivers which have supplies of salmon and trout cannot fish at the foot of their own farms.  In most cases they are not even allowed to take out a licence. We hear talk of the rings, but it is one of the hardest rings to get inside in this country.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, as in other places, there are demands for slips and for piers.  I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary about the pier at Portaleen.  I know that he knows about it and its importance, and also about the difficulties connected with it.  Deputy Murphy mentioned some port in his constituency where ships were in danger, due to storms.  At this pier I mention in my constituency, not alone are the boats in danger but the danger is so great that no insurance company will undertake to insure the boats against being wrecked in the winter time.  That gives an idea of the importance of providing suitable facilities there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> I understand there is a scheme for the training of young men in the business of fishing.  I do not know whether it has got under way or not, but it is a thing that should be developed and extended.  I know of some young men who have gone into the industry in a fairly big way.  They have bought large-sized boats of their own and they are taking a pride in that business.  Scientific fishing is something that any young man should seriously consider taking up as a career. It is all right to talk about fishing and about boats, but sometimes we find that when the fish are landed there is not a market for them.  It is very important to develop a market, but it is only by having regular supplies that people will develop a taste for fish and thereby a market will be fostered. Haphazard, irregular deliveries&mdash;some this week and none for two weeks&mdash; do not encourage the housewife to have a fish day or two fish days every week.  It will be necessary to have fish available nearly every day if we are to get our Irish people to develop a taste for it.  That is really important and everything should be done to encourage young men to take up scientific fishing as a career.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the importance of this Estimate, I shall be as brief as possible.  Perhaps that is necessary in view of two facts. One is the formation of this newly appointed board: we are not yet in a position to know whether the new departure will be the success we are hoping for.  Naturally, since such a short time has elapsed, it is futile for us to go into any discussion on that. The other reason for confining the remarks to a few items is that if members go through the debates on Fisheries for a long number of years they will find that consistently a number of Deputies from the seaboard areas were coming in here, from all Parties in the House, expressing their views on the importance of putting the fishing industry in a proper place in the overall economic position of the country; yet while some of the members are still members and others have left the House, with all they did and as a result of all the views they expressed <Col N="1605" /> so earnestly and sincerely, it is regrettable to listen this evening to the Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing this Estimate, say that, taking it as an overall picture, the amount of fish landings is&mdash;as we usually hear&mdash; decreasing.</P>
      <P>I would like at this stage to ask one question, which has a direct bearing on the livelihood of inshore fishermen. While some of us here have stressed the importance of considering also the broader aspect of deep-sea fishing, the Parliamentary Secretary here this evening, the same as Deputy Dillon when he was Minister and spoke on fisheries himself last year or the year before, dwelt more or less all the time on inshore fishing.  That being the case, I am anxious to raise this point. When is a salmon not a salmon?</P>

      <P>When is a peal not a peal?  It may seem to be a joke to ask these questions, and people outside this House might think that we are just trying to &ldquo;raise a hare&rdquo;.  However, it is of vital importance to the fishermen in such areas as south Cork and west Cork, and all round the west coast and the north-west coast&mdash;in fact, everywhere that fishermen are engaged in fishing where they are trying to help themselves and their families financially by selling salmon.  They are anxious to have this question answered&mdash;why is it that continuously year after year fishermen are being robbed by those in the ring, who will not pay a proper price for salmon?  At some periods the gentry who tell us that they are not making a profit on the sale of fish will tell the fisherman who has landed a salmon that, because it is under five lb., it is a peal.  On other occasions they may say that a fish that is under eight lb. is a peal. These dishonest people never say to the purchaser in the retail shop that the price of a salmon is reduced because it is a peal.  They are robbing the fishermen and they are fleecing the purchaser.  The housewife who buys salmon is told that there is no such thing as a peal.  She has to pay the full price while at the same time <Col N="1606" /> the man who is entitled to the greatest consideration, the fisherman, is unjustly treated by the members of this ring.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to throw some light on this problem.  It is of vital concern to the people engaged in fishing.  On many occasions I have heard fishermen complain that they got 4/6 a lb. and that the fish was sold in the fishmonger's shop at 7/6 and 8/- a lb. The sooner that is stopped the sooner we will show that we are interested in the fishermen more than in the getrich-quick robbers.</P>
      <P>I am glad that, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, it is the policy of the new board to continue building boats of 50 feet and that they have three larger vessels in course of construction of up to 100 feet.  Deputy Cunningham expressed his views on this important subject but I say that it is futile to imagine that under our present methods we can make the fishing industry the success we want it to be. Up to the present time we have more or less concentrated on inshore fisheries, which meant that in practically every week of the year the supply never met the demand.  People almost forgot that there was such a thing as fish.  Health authorities express the importance of fish, but our people have gained the reputation of not being fish-eaters simply because fish was not available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the present high cost of meat it is essential to provide fish for our people to help them to balance the household budget.  If, as a result of the activities of the board, an increased amount of fish can be landed to supplement catches in the inshore fishing areas, ultimately, purchasers in every area will be facilitated.  The policy of each Government has been wrong in this respect.  They have considered, as we all do, the importance of protecting the inshore fisherman but often they were creating a monopoly by not having a surplus quantity of fish.  I do not suggest that that should be brought in by foreign trawlers but that we could keep a certain amount <Col N="1607" /> of fish landed by Irish boats manned by Irishmen.</P>
    <P>I wish well to this venture.  I sincerely hope that it will have the success that we hope it will have, that it will help to supplement the miserable quantity of fish at present being landed and put on sale.  If increased landings can be achieved, I hope the policy of the new board will be somewhat different from the policy pursued in the past, of sending fish landed on the south or west coast to Dublin and returning to country areas anything that was left.  We want a change in that policy.  I do not begrudge the people in Dublin the fish that they need.  We are anxious to send them as much fish as possible but we also want our people in coastal areas to get fish.</P>
    <P>It is vitally necessary to build extra boats.  It is equally essential to have them built at the most economic price. I have been informed that we are prepared to embark on a policy of giving orders to firms in Scotland and Germany for boats for the fishing industry in this country, at the expense of the men employed in the boatyards here.  It is no justification to say that the foreigners' estimate is cheaper.  It means, as I know from the position in some of our boatyards, paticularly one boatyard in the area that I come from, that men who had been employed at good wages in those boatyards have been disemployed, and are now unavailable in those yards.  It seems the tenders submitted by the proprietors of these shipyards have not been considered competitive enough against the foreigner.  We shall be broadminded in our general outlook, but we cannot be so broadminded as to say that a Scotsman or a German is welcome to earn his living building boats for our shipping industry at the expense of Irishmen.  I am anxious that the Parliamentary Secretary should give us any information available to him on that matter.</P>
    <P>I will again lay stress on the vital importance of clearing up this question of the price of salmon.  In my opinion, this is a matter that we are going to decide by our actions in this <Col N="1608" /> House.  Some of us are doing our utmost in this matter and we are fulfilling our responsibility by drawing the attention of the House to it. Having done so, we expect that the Parliamentary Secretary will have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I will say, in passing, that the Parliamentary Secretary, during his term of office, has at all times acted in an honourable and creditable manner towards all members of the House.  I will go further and say that I found when reading any debate to which he contributed or any statement made by him in this House, that he knew his job.  We draw attention in this House to this important matter not to gain kudos for the Party to which we belong but to try to gain something for the fishermen who are struggling year in year out to try to make a living.</P>
    <P>The price of salmon is of equal importance to the fishermen and to the person who wishes to buy a piece of this fish.  I am quite aware that everybody cannot afford to indulge in such a luxury.  I know that, normally, the working man's wife who is rearing a family could never rise to a piece of salmon.  However, the people who can afford to buy it are entitled to get it at a fair price.  The ring that operates against fishermen, and which seems to have its own protection must be broken.</P>
    <P>I am not admitting for a moment that things are happy in the fishing industry.  I say that they are no better than they were when we spoke on this important subject before.  Owing to the fact that the new board has not yet had time to show that its approach would be correct, I suppose it is only fair to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the members of the board to defer our remarks until a later stage.  When we are in a position to offer our criticisms they may not suit either the Parliamentary Secretary or the members of the board.  When that day comes, please God, we shall all be united, as we have been during this debate, in our desire to see the fishing industry put on a solid, strong, financial basis.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate.  However, I think I would not be doing my duty if I did not protest against the attack made by Deputy Desmond on the fish merchants.  As a Cork Deputy, I take it that he was dealing with the Cork fish merchants.  I am acquainted with practically all of these merchants, and I must say that they are a most respectable body of men.  As the Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, is aware, they take a keen interest in their business, and they have to put up with very irregular supplies of fish. Some weeks they get a good supply for Friday and the week afterwards they may not get any supply at all. However, they must continue paying their rent and rates, their bills for wages, lighting and so forth.  Staff must be retained whether or not supplies are obtainable.  To call these merchants would-be robbers, in a general sense, is entirely wrong. Practically every one of these fish merchants, in Cork City at any rate, can be seen working in his shop, generally with his coat off, doing his business with the aid of a couple of hands.</P>

      <P>You were talking about fish merchants.  I just want to make it clear that the fish merchants in Cork City are as decent a body of men as I have ever met.  In my opinion, other sections would merit much more severe criticism than those men who, as I said already, have to depend on very irregular supplies of fish and who must keep on paying all the time.  As Deputy Desmond is aware, I am not a defender of people who charge unfair and high prices.  If the whole question of their outlay were examined, I feel it would be found that their margin of profit is much lower than that of many other traders.  Yet, they are the section who are being most vigorously attacked in this House for the past couple of months.  They were criticised during the discussion on the Fisheries Bill, and now they are being attacked during this debate.</P>

      <P>A couple of statements have been made here, and I feel that one must relate them because they rather surprised me.  Deputies Corry, Desmond and M. P. Murphy said that people fish along the banks of rivers and in rivers for which farmers are paying annuities.  It was also stated that certain rivers are deliberately poisoned.  As the Deputies who spoke come from Cork and Kerry, the inference I drew was that the poisoned rivers were in Cork and Kerry.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us some information on that matter and to tell us whether or not the statements made were loose and wild ones for which there is no justification.  In my own experience I have never known of any case in which a river was deliberately poisoned for the purpose of destroying the fish so that the people that owned the river would not get any benefit from it.  Why introduce these things?  Apart from raising social distinctions, apart from the ownership of these rivers there is a way of dealing with that.  Surely we have reached the stage of development where these things can be done in an ordered way as they must be done since we are dealing with the rights of property.  It is not for us to determine how these rights were originally acquired. Speaking generally, they were acquired for a consideration.  At the time of the passing of the Wyndham Land Act, when agreements were entered into for the sale and purchase of estates, the tenants surrendered the fishing rights attached to the sporting rights on the estates, They voluntarily agreed to it.  That occurred with regard to sporting rights in the estate on which I was born.  Surely it is too late in the day&mdash;practically half a century after the Act of 1903 was passed&mdash;to come along to-day and complain when the people voluntarily negotiated the agreement and gave away the sporting <Col N="1611" /> rights with regard to shooting and fishing in respect of the rivers on these estates.  I was not pleased with the allegation made this evening in regard to the poisoning of rivers.  Are there people in this country who would do that sort of thing in this age?  If these rivers are to be taken over from their present owners it must be done by operation of law and for a consideration. Therefore, one can foresee the tragedy of destroying the fish in these rivers as soon as the State finally takes over the rivers.</P>
      <P>One feels perplexed as to the <i>bona fides</i> of these statements.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will specially refer to them.  It would be an odious and very bad thing for this country, which is endeavouring to advertise its fishing and shooting rights in order to attract tourists that these things should occur.  To me they are barbaric. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will say that these statements are without foundation.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, one feels it difficult to get one's teeth into this Estimate owing to the developments that have taken place in this country during the last six or nine months.  In the first instance, we have had the Sea Fisheries Association abolished and a new body superseding it.  One cannot throw bouquets at the Sea Fisheries Association but yet one must admit that this body of men, who acted voluntarily, gave their time gratuitously for the benefit of this industry and that they did reasonably well.</P>
      <P>With regard to the new body, from its composition, as announced by the Department, I am sorry to say that I have no confidence whatever in its constitution&mdash;none whatever.  I want to be bold enough to make that prophecy.  I do not think the men either by reason of their ability or their training are fit and proper persons to do the job that is in hands, particularly having regard to the speeches made about the fishing industry being second only to agriculture. Statements of that kind give me the hiccup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> When one considers the state of the fishing industry there is no relation between the two.  One would love to see the fishing industry second only to agriculture but Deputies sit down and we hear nothing further about the matter until the next Estimate is being considered or some new Bill is being introduced creating a new body to deal with this industry.  Having looked over the names of the people appointed to the new committee, I regret that I have no confidence whatever that they will make a success of the job.  I hate to have to say that but in my opinion they are purely and simply political appointments. They have not the ability to grapple with the task in hands.  I hope that statement will be contradicted, that time will vindicate this body and that it may succeed in the task entrusted to it.  They have a big job before them.  We dealt with that matter on the Bill which was before this House a short time ago and there is no need to cover the same ground. We may pass over that part of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The second part of this Estimate deals with another Bill which was passed a few months ago in connection with this industry and which has reference to a river and a river area in my own constituency.  When that Bill was going through this House, I made certain statements to which the Parliamentary Secretary took exception. He contradicted them with regard to the position of the fish population in this fishing area.  I am now reliably informed that, so far as this fishing season is concerned, nets on that estuary have not caught half a dozen fish.  I think that confirms the statements I made when the Bill to which I referred was going through the House.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about all these rivers in this State and in particular about this river for which the State contributes portion of £55,000 and the Northern Ireland Government another portion of the £55,000 is that there is not one penny allocated to this body for the development of this river <Col N="1613" /> with regard to re-stocking.  I referred to this matter when the Bill was before the House and I wish to refer to it again because it may be that the Department would desire to place the responsibility of going to the expense of re-stocking it on the owners of the tributary rivers.  I venture to say that it will not be done.  The good-will of these men should be courted.  Harmony should obtain and there should be joint action with regard to the re-stocking of these rivers, whether the Department would undertake the entire cost of putting so many thousand fry each year for a number of years into these rivers or come to an agreement with the owners of the rivers to pay a portion of the cost.  Whatever we may think about the owners of these rivers they get very little by way of compensation or reward from the ownership of the rivers.  Probably not one of them would get six salmon during the entire year.  Therefore, if fishermen are to get the full benefits of the fish that are reared in the tributary rivers something should be done either by the Department or by the joint action of the Northern Government and our Government to contribute a certain amount to procure and place in the rivers a substantial amount of fry at an early date, because it would be too bad if, having taken the taxpayers' money to acquire the fishing rights of the rivers for the people, they were left in such a condition that no harvest would be reaped from the ownership of them by the State.</P>
    <P>I have no hope with regard to the new body, none whatever, but, with regard to the Foyle estuary fishing, I would earnestly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take steps during the forthcoming spawning season to procure fry in conjunction with the Northern Government in order to re-stock these rivers on a big scale.  It will be money well spent. You cannot reap a harvest without a planting and if you plant the rivers you will reap a reward.  The fishermen concerned will reap a harvest which will give them a higher standard of living and these rivers will be the asset that we hoped for when they were taken over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> With regard to trawling as against inshore fishing, apparently the Government and the Minister have decided to back the inshore fishermen.  That being so, let us all put our heads together and back up that and give every inducement we can to the inshore fishermen to make a success of their business.  But they cannot and will not make a success of it unless the new Fisheries Commission do their job.  That is the key to the whole problem.  Therefore, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take an active interest in this commission and its operations and that he will not be mealy-mouthed in dealing with them if he finds they are not discharging the duty imposed on them in the way he desires and this House desires. There should not be any patting on the back because the present Government appointed them.  They should not be regarded as sacrosanct because of that.  If they prove to be incompetent, the Parliamentary Secretary should come to this House and give us the facts and he will get our support in replacing them by somebody more fitted for discharging the duties.</P>
    <P>I can see no future for the fishing industry with a body like that.  They have not the record or the tradition. They have not the business capacity to deal with the problem.  All these things are essential in tackling a job of that kind.  Firstly, the men must have natural ability; secondly, they must have the training in and the experience of organising a business successfully before they can approach this matter properly.</P>
    <P>Here is a job for which you require able and competent men who have had experience of some business on a large scale dealing with production, marketing, advertising and distribution.  That is the type of man that you require to make a success of our sea fisheries. There is no use in talking about the fishing industry being second only to agriculture.  It is only making a laughing-stock of ourselves.  Anyone with experience of business looks upon statements of that kind as a mere joke. It is incredible that one has to listen to such stuff.  There is no comparison <Col N="1615" /> between the two, because there is no real approach to doing the job properly and in the way that is required by men who are competent owing to their natural ability and training and experience to carry it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a maritime country.  For the past week we have been discussing the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  A considerable amount of interest has been taken in it and a considerable number of Deputies have contributed to the debate on it.  But, living in a maritime country, when we come to consider an Estimate which should cater for the second greatest industry in the country, namely, our fisheries, we find a total of eight Deputies present.  I do not wish to be controversial and I do not wish to state to which Parties these Deputies belong. But we have so little interest in this House in our fisheries, that Deputies do not consider it worth while coming in to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>I have nothing but respect for the present Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries.  I have listened to him for some years both in this House, at the annual meetings of the Sea Fisheries Association and elsewhere and when he was appointed I looked forward to revolutionary changes in the attitude of this House and of the country to our fishing industry.  But I regret to say that things are going from bad to worse so far as the fishing industry is concerned.  The first thing we must consider is a market for our fish.  Unfortunately down through the years Dublin has been the market for our fish.  We cannot see beyond the City of Dublin although we have inland towns in this country in which people tell us that the very name of fish stinks in their nostrils because the fish which they see stinks before it gets to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we must do is to open up our fish market.  We must do that, not in the City of Dublin, but in the other towns and in rural Ireland generally.  I looked forward to the present Parliamentary Secretary initiating a scheme whereby <Col N="1616" /> every town and village would have a supply of fresh fish at least twice per week.  I looked forward to the Parliamentary Secretary opening in every town a small fish shop with a frigidaire plant installed.  I looked forward to the Parliamentary Secretary supplying these towns with fish by means of frigidaire vans at least twice per week.  Not one step has been taken to open up the hinterland of this country to the fishing industry. Actually last week prime fish were sold in the City of Dublin at the lowest price at which they had been sold for the past 15 years.  Prime fish were being sold at 2/6 per stone.  I do not grudge the poor people of the city all the fish they can buy at 2/6 per stone. But I wonder are the poor of Dublin getting the advantage of the method and the manner by which fishermen are being defrauded?  It is possibly true that we have to educate our people into the cooking and eating of fish.  I think we are not taking sufficient advantage of the picture-houses and the vocational schools for the education of our people in the cooking and eating of fish.  I think that at least once per week there should be a short addendum to each newsreel shown in the picture-houses of this country explaining the various methods of boning and cooking fish. Britain did it during the recent war and there is no reason why we should not follow the example of Britain in that respect.</P>
    <P>Take for instance the ordinary herring.  The ordinary housewife in the Midlands knows not of its uses other than to fry it or to boil it.  &ldquo;Shorts&rdquo; could be given in our picture-houses displaying other methods by which fresh herring, salt herring or soused herring could be made edible.  Having educated our people into the eating of fish, the next step we should take is to see that there should be continuity of supplies. We should see that the people of rural Ireland and of the inland towns should get fresh fish at least once or twice per week.  Having guaranteed continuity of delivery, then and then only should we set about guaranteeing continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> In my opinion our first step should be to extend our territorial waters.  Some of our Norse neighbours have done it. Iceland has been the last to do it. There is no reason under the sun why we should not extend our territorial waters.  Both Deputy MacBride and myself have on numerous occasions put down questions here to inquire whether the present Government proposed or considered implementing the recent Hague decision.  The reply we received on each occasion was that the matter was being considered.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to cast their minds back.  They will recall that during the past 30 years we have had only two prosperous periods for the fishing industry.  One was during the 1914-18 war and the other was during the 1939-44 war.  The reason is quite obvious.  Submarine warfare drove the trawler off our coasts and immediately the trawler was driven from our coasts, our inshore fisheries prospered.  By extending and protecting our territorial waters, we can again ensure that our inshore fisheries will become what they were in the 1914-18 period and in the period of the last war.  I think there should be some liaison between the naval branch of the Department of Defence and our fisheries.  If there were, there would be no difficulty whatever in protecting and extending our territorial waters.  If that were done, we could guarantee continuity of supply.  Having got our continuity of supply and continuity of delivery, and having procured a permanent Irish market for our fish, we could ensure and guarantee prosperity for our fishermen or at least a prospect of prosperity.</P>
    <P>Instead of that what do we find?  We find the board recently set up going abroad to acquire three German trawlers.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what these three German trawlers have cost the state.  I should like also to ask him why these trawlers have not been built in that excellent boatyard at Killybegs.  He will possibly answer me by saying: &ldquo;These trawlers are built of iron; the only thing we can do in Killybegs is <Col N="1618" /> to build wooden ships&rdquo;.  I agree with him but do not forget at the moment around our coasts seeking the protection of our harbours we have some of the finest fishing boats belonging to the Spanish fishing fleet all of which are built of wood.  If Britain considers it better to have ships built of steel there is no reason why we should follow suit.  We could give considerable employment in the building of wooden ships and in my opinion we should do so.</P>
    <P>While we were actually procuring these three German ships to augument our fishing fleet, we were curtailing the activities of our fishing fleet.  I am sure it will surprise the House and the country generally to know that the representatives of the Sea Fisheries Association at Killybegs in the past month have requested the fishing fleet there to refrain from fishing on other than four nights per week.  The excuse offered was: &ldquo;If you fish six nights per week you are going to glut the Dublin market.&rdquo;  These boats with fishermen from the west, south and north congregated off the Donegal coast have been requested by a representative of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, or rather their successors, to refrain from fishing other than on four nights a week.  At the same time that body is importing into this country three new German trawlers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture was instrumental in procuring plant for cold storage at Killybegs.  That cold storage has not yet become operative.  Instead of importing three German trawlers, if we provided many more cold storage plants around our coasts, we could when fish are plentiful, store the fish and keep them there to meet a period of scarcity and distribute them all over the country.  In that way we would be guaranteeing continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>It will surprise this House to know that last season prime cured Donegal herrings lay unsold on the harbours of Donegal for a period of nine months while we were importing from Iceland and other Norse countries, as well as Britain, salt cured fish.</P>

      <P>I know that a trade agreement was entered into in 1938 whereby we undertook to import certain salted and cured fish, but, surely, during the interval, we should have reconsidered the terms of that trade agreement and protected our own fisheries.  In my opinion, there should be greater liaison between the Department of Industry and Commerce and our Fisheries Department.  To-day, in this House, I received a reply to a question from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that it was hoped to complete a new pier in the fishing port of Killybegs in the middle of September next at a cost to the State of £65,000.  Now, some of that £65,000 has been spent in the laying of rails to the pier head. Rails have been laid from the railway depôt to the pier head.  Some of that £65,000 has been spent in the laying of those rails.  But, yesterday, the railway company of the County Donegal Joint Committee informed the public that they proposed closing the railway line between Killybegs and Ballyshannon, thereby cutting off railway transport from the pier head.  I presume that the County Donegal Joint Committee did not do this without consulting the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>If they did, it is a disgraceful state of affairs that the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1620" /> here would permit them to do so.  I hope that he will see that this gross blunder of theirs is immediately remedied.  Supposing, for the sake of argument, that they could persuade the Minister for Industry and Commerce that that railway line, for economic reasons, should be closed, is it not an awful state of affairs that some of that £65,000 should have been spent in the laying of rails from the depôt to the railway?  I think that there should be some consultation, some liaison, between the Departments of Defence, Industry and Commerce, Fisheries and Local Government to secure proper protection and proper transport of fish to the various parts of the country.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I should refer.  Again, it is one which calls for a certain amount of liaison between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Fisheries. Take the case of a fisherman who provides himself at the beginning of the season with a trail of nets, costing approximately £500 to £600.  His gross takings for the season may amount to anything up to £1,000, while his net takings may be, say, £500.  On the very last night of the season, as often happens, a tramp steamer on our coast may clean cut his entire trail of nets, and he has got to replace them. Naturally, the unfortunate part-time fisherman has to seek unemployment assistance for the remainder of the year.  The position, however, is that his gross takings are taken into account and assessed against his means, with the result that he is debarred from drawing unemployment assistance for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>Take also the case of one of our unfortunate migratory labourers.  He crosses over to Scotland and spends two or three months there, earning, possibly, £50 to £60 net during the period.  That earned income of his is not taken into account in the assessment of means for the purposes of unemployment assistance, but the unfortunate fisherman has his gross earnings assessed against him in respect of the short period during which he has been fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> That is one of the reasons why our fishing industry is being denuded of fishermen.  No enticement is being held out to our young people to go into the fishing industry.  In my opinion, scholarships should be granted to students at vocational schools to take up marine engineering, net mending, net making and navigation.  In addition to awarding scholarships, some monetary consideration should be given to those youths during the period of their apprenticeship.  Unfortunately, the wages across the water offer too great an inducement to our prospective fishermen to get them to remain at home.  If we could give some little remuneration to those youths during the period in which they are serving their apprenticeship to the various branches of the fishing industry, we would, in that way, be encouraging them to remain here, and in my opinion we would have many more applicants for such positions than we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputy. Corry, have complained about our harbours and piers.  God knows, when you think of the amount that we have spent on minor relief schemes, making bog roads that lead nowhere, we should be able to spend something on improving our harbours, piers and slips.  We definitely could do something. I have in mind a case in West Donegal at a place called Curran's Port, almost opposite Tory Island. The Parliamentary Secretary knows the spot.  He has been down there himself during the fishing season.  The fishermen there have no place whatever in which to land their fishing craft.  I have been receiving replies for the past two years that the matter is under consideration.  I have received them from the Parliamentary Secretary and from his predecessor. I am attaching no blame to any particular Government individual, but surely we could cut through this red tape, and get these harbour piers and landing wharfs improved.  Again, at high water in the neighbourhing port, Meenlara, the pier is actually covered to a depth of 3 or 4 feet of water.  It should be quite possible to raise the pier above high level.  If we did that we would be doing something to <Col N="1622" /> facilitate these unfortunate fishermen in landing their fish on this rugged coast.</P>
    <P>I come now to our inland fisheries. People have complained here about various methods of poaching.  The poacher does not do the amount of damage to our rivers that is alleged. What we want is restocking of our rivers.  If they were restocked then the occasional salmon or trout taken out by the poacher would not affect the overall prosperity of the river.  I should like to see the Department restock our rivers and lakes at least every second year.  I should also like to see some experiment made in the transfer of small trout from lakes in which they do not thrive to other lakes which are denuded of fish.</P>
    <P>I have had a personal experience of planting 50 two-year-old trout in a lake in which a trout has never been caught.  The lake from which I took them does not produce trout at any greater weight than, roughly, six ounces.  I transferred 50 of these trout to a lake in which there were no fish.  To my amazement, I found that after two years I was able to kill trout weighing one lb. and one and a quarter lb. on the lake to which they were transferred.  Local boards of conservators should be encouraged by the Fisheries Department to pursue such experiments.  In that way we should be doing something good for our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned a matter which, thank God, does not apply to Donegal.  During the salmon season our fishermen are completely at the mercy of the salmon dealer&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; within the meaning of the Fisheries Act.  As we all know, grilse or peal as they are called in the South, are sold at a much cheaper rate than salmon.  On the Donegal coast, salmon under five lb. weight is classified as a grilse.  Any salmon over five lb. weight is classified as a salmon. The difference is considerable in value. I am assured that this year in County Cork salmon weighing as much as eight lb. have been classified as grilse and that the fishermen are, therefore, defrauded of the difference.  I think there should be a direction from the Minister <Col N="1623" /> as to what are grilse, or peal, and what are salmon.  With such a direction, the fishermen will know where they stand and they will not be at the mercy of the dealers.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the theme on which I began.  I appeal to the Minister to open up the inland towns and rural Ireland to the fish trade.  If he does, he will help the fishermen and the people of Ireland generally to bring back that prosperity to the fishing industry which it enjoyed some 20, 30 or 40 years ago.</P>

      <P>I want to say just a few words on this Estimate and I might preface my remarks by saying how glad I am to see the development in the House, particularly in regard to this matter, of the ideal of socialism.  This debate clearly indicates that the general desire is that fisheries should be controlled absolutely by the State.  The whole fishing industry, from the provision of boats right down to the placing of a fish in the home of the consumer, should be controlled by the State.  That, as I understand it, is socialism and, as I say, I welcome the fact that there is this general desire for that type of control over our fishing industry.</P>
      <P>When I was a boy at home in County Cavan we could always buy fresh herrings at the crossroads on a Friday.  We always had a supply of salted herring in the house.  That was typical of County Cavan in the days before I went to school.  In those days we had no refrigerating plants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a difference in taste which I cannot understand.  However, that was the position forty or more years ago.  I <Col N="1624" /> think there is a lot to be said for Deputy O'Donnell's idea of classes and instruction in the benefits of fish and in the methods of cooking fish. I look on fishing as a very desirable industry that will give employment in the coastal areas in particular&mdash; employment that will provide comfort for many homes there.  To that extent, it is a valuable industry to the country and one which I should like to see developed.  I think we have that opportunity now, when fishing is the responsibility of one individual, namely, the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can hope to see a complete reorganisation of the distributing side of the industry, because unless the distributing side of the fishing industry is developed in a revolutionary way there is no possibility of improving the industry very much.  Without a proper system of distribution, fish cannot be brought into the villages, into the small towns and into the rural areas generally.  We had a fillip in the fishing industry, as Deputy O'Donnell says, in the years 1914 to 1918.  I take a different view from the view he takes as to the cause of that fillip.  It was not because foreign trawlers were unable to come near our shores.  I think there is plenty of fish in the vicinity of our shores to supply not only the foreign trawlers but also our own fleet.  Why the fishing industry did so well in the period 1914 to 1918 and during the last Great War was that fish became an essential food. There was a better market for it in the big towns.  In fact, it was the only food that was available across in Britain anyway.  Any time that I visited it during the last war, there was nothing else you could get except fish of one kind or another.  The people will eat the fish if they get it in the proper condition.  One of the difficulties in a city like Dublin is that fish is too dear and it is too dear because of defects in the organisation of the industry.  The House appears to be satisfied that there is no other method whereby Irish fishing will be developed than by the Parliamentary Secretary creating an organisation that will catch the fish, that will distribute the fish <Col N="1625" /> and put it, as it were, on the table of the housewife.</P>
    <P>That will take some time and in this matter we must be patient.  If we see a reasonable amount of progress each year, if we can look from year to year and say: &ldquo;We have made this amount of progress in the right direction&rdquo;, then I think the position would be satisfactory.  We must take the long view because otherwise we may build up something that may not last.  In the development of an industry like this I would like to see it develop on well thoughtout lines.  I want to see it develop year by year so that it can be safely said, the industry will maintain itself. The Parliamentary Secretary has a special responsibility in regard to that and not only has he a special responsibility but I can say, and I think every Deputy would say, that he has the good-will of this House in doing it.</P>
    <P>I just contribute those few remarks to indicate my anxiety, my desire, for a proper and sane development of our fishing industry.  I am delighted, as I said at the beginning, that Deputies realise that there is only one way that that can be brought about and that is by the initiative and by the organisation established by the State under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make just a few remarks on this Fisheries Estimate. While many Deputies, and other people throughout the country, do not seem to place it as high up in the list of priorities as other Votes that come before this House each year, I regard it&mdash;as I suppose, most Deputies belonging to maritime counties must regard it&mdash;as a very important Estimate.  It is a constant source of amazement that, in an island country like this, which is surrounded on all sides by salt water and that is very rich in fish, the whole fishery industry seems to have declined almost to vanishing point, and the efforts of various Governments to revive it or put it in its proper place do not appear to have met with a great deal of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 20 or 25 years ago, particularly during the time the Congested <Col N="1626" /> Districts Board was in operation, fishing formed a large part of the livelihood of many of the coastal dwellers and contributed in those years a substantial amount of the total volume of trade, but since then it has declined.  Might I put forward the suggestion that one of the principal reasons that fishing has declined is the failure to put fish in every town and village throughout the country, to make it available quickly and to make it available in a fresh condition to as many householders as possible throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I live in County Mayo and I am told on good authority that most of the fish used in the towns&mdash;not that there is much used&mdash;has to come from Dublin. There must be something wrong with the system of distribution that takes fish from the west coast, brings it to Dublin and sends it back again for sale to perhaps within a few miles from where it was actually caught and landed.  I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary my personal view that the present method of the distribution of fish represents one of the principal reasons why we are not getting anywhere.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make is that there is a large number of young men, particularly along the west coast, who are very skilled in the technique of fishing, knowing the good spots and the bad spots along the whole coastal area.  These young men are gradually leaving us, one by one.  They are taking on other occupations, mostly, I must say, in England, but some of them at home, because they do not seem to see any future in the fishing industry here.  The Parliamentary Secretary should bend his efforts towards keeping those people at home because if these experts, if I may so describe them, leave us, it will take a very long time if we have to depend on men who know nothing about the industry and have to learn it from the ground up.  If the hundreds of years' experience, handed down from father to son, is lost, it will be a serious blow to the whole fishing industry along the west coast.</P>
    <P>One way to retain these people is to make boats and gear available to <Col N="1627" /> them.  From the experience I have had and from the contact I have made with those people, I know they are willing to go out to sea, to endanger their lives for the fishing industry.  That is a fact, because they have told me so, but there seems to be something wrong with the method of placing boats and gear at the disposal of those men. While the Department has made generous gestures in the past to these people, the contribution they are asked to make in the case of new boats and gear is altogether beyond their means and some plan will have to be devised to place boats at their disposal.  It is obviously useless offering, say, a £3,000 boat to a fisherman or a group of fishermen if the deposit they are asked to pay, £300, £400, £500 or maybe £1,000, is beyond their means.  There is no point in offering them a boat in such circumstances even though the Department may be contributing as much as £4,000 of the cost.  The fact remains that the boat is there but there is nobody to take it up because the deposit cannot be met.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to benefit by the experience of the last 15 or 20 years and devise some means of putting the boats at the disposal of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>There must be some other method, when that one has not proved a success, by which it can be done.  To ask the people to get the boats themselves is out of the question.  That would mean that the holdings in a whole townland would have to be sold.  In most cases these people have no savings and they would be utterly unable to meet the demand.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have a certain amount of information as to the position in his own constituency.  He must be aware of the facts I am putting before him. It is quite obvious that this present method is worse than useless.  There must be some other means of approach whereby boats and gear can be placed at the disposal of these people.  If that is not so, then all our talk and all our voting of money here is to a large extent sheer waste of time, energy and money.</P>
    <P>If we have skilled men around the <Col N="1628" /> coast and allow them to take up other occupations thereby losing them, their skill and their knowledge, then we are guilty of criminal carelessness in relation to this particular industry. The distribution of fish is in my opinion one of the most important means of reviving the consumption of fish and we should deal with that first before we consider exporting fish.  I particularly want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for devising some means of placing boats and gear at the disposal of those who have the skill and the will to develop this particular industry.  I believe the present method is a failure and it should not be beyond the competence of the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials to devise some plan that will meet with more success than the old one has met with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most notable feature of this debate has been the almost complete unanimity of opinion in connection with the major problems. That in itself should help to make the effort to find a solution to these problems easier because those who take an interest in them seem to know what the causes of our difficulties are.</P>
      <P>There is a kind of vicious circle in the fishing industry.  That has been shown by the views expressed on the question of distribution and the provision of supplies.  Some Deputies seem to think that the amount of fish consumed would be greatly increased by the mere provision of refrigerated vans and things of that sort.  I agree that would be desirable but surely we must do first things first, namely, supply the fish.  By supplying the fish I mean supplying it regularly and in the variety which the public demands and supplying it also at a price which the public will be prepared to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three conditions impose a problem of the greatest magnitude on whoever undertakes the organising of the fishing industry.  We have had attempts at organisation in the past. We had the &ldquo;Hake Friday&rdquo;.  The catching end of that was sought to be provided for in those days by the chartering of outside trawlers.  A system of van transport was provided by the Sea Fisheries Association. <Col N="1629" /> Eventually that had to be stopped because it proved to be too costly. Whether the excessive cost had to do with the internal transportation or with the catching arrangements I am not in a position to say but at any rate an effort was made and some information was gathered as a result of that experiment.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to deal individually with the points raised by the Deputies who spoke on this matter except in so far as a Deputy may have raised some point of unusual interest.  I would like to refer to each Deputy personally and, if I do not do so, Deputies will understand that I am dealing in a general way with the points raised in order to utilise the time at my disposal by giving everybody as fair an innings as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer said that no man can be prevailed upon to take up fishing.  He was chided by somebody on this side of the House because his line of thought was not quite consistent. He seemed to criticise the provision of a type of boat which would induce young men to come along and join the industry.  I think we all have the experience around the coast that if these young men are to be induced to take up fishing they will have to be provided with tools suitable to the job.  They will have to get a boat in which there is some freedom of movement, in which there will be a feeling of safety in bad weather, in which there will be comfortable sleeping accommodation and facilities for the provision of a good meal.  I do not think one will induce any young man to take up fishing as a career unless one provides him with these amenities.  Our young men have left and gone to England to work on steam trawlers there.  I disagree with Deputy Blowick when he says that once a fisherman goes one cannot get him back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact I have had some of these young men back already showing an interest in getting into the industry here.  We are agreed that it is a question of what sort of craft we should provide. We are trying to get a boat which a fisherman will be prepared to use. If he is to become the owner of the boat it must be provided for him within the limits of his resources. That raises a problem of great difficulty. A 50-foot boat is now becoming the standard boat apparently.  That is the type of boat that is being sought by the fisherman who wants to make fishing a whole-time occupation.</P>
      <P>A 50-foot boat when fully rigged works out at about £6,000.  Up to the present under the system devised for paying for the boat the applicant must be able to put down 20 per cent. or, in special circumstances, the board is entitled to reduce that to 10 per cent. Taking it at the figure of 10 per cent., a £6,000 boat would require a deposit of £600 and we know that our fishermen around the coast, with the possible exception of those who have been operating large boats for a very long time, are not able to find £600.  The new board have applied themselves to the solution of this question and, I understand, have made certain recommendations to the Department of Finance and it is hoped that some easement will be achieved.  I regret that there is no result available about which I could tell the Dáil to-night.</P>

      <P>Could the boats not be given out without any initial charge on a hiring system, with some kind of written guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly how I should reply to that.  I have had that sort of viewpoint myself, but it has been put to me by fishermen that you should not give a fisherman a boat unless you give him some element of ownership in the boat.  I do not know whether that is a psychological approach to the matter, or whether it is based on the hard practical consideration <Col N="1631" /> of making a man have some interest himself which would make him work better.  It seems to me, however, that the universal advice in the matter is: &ldquo;Do not give a man a boat unless he is given some interest which he himself owns and which is his own personal property,&rdquo; that in that way you spur initiative to the best possible advantage.  Some compromise will have to be found if we are to do what Deputies have recommended with regard to good fishermen not being allowed to go boatless because they had not got money.</P>
      <P>One solution that would suggest itself is that the board ought to go in more for the use of experimental boats &mdash;put a boat in a place where the tradition of fishing is dying out but where it is still in the blood of a certain section there.  It is suggested that by putting the boat there and putting a good skipper in charge, you set the wheels in motion again and, in fact, you can train up a local crew and that the earnings of the boat during the experimental period would possibly provide some member of the crew with the necessary deposit.  That type of thing is being considered by the board to meet the particular problem of the deposit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>From the sale of the very first catch, could it not be said that the particular skipper has a certain share in ownership and with each catch that ownership is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but if you set a man operating a boat on which he is going to get his livelihood and possibly be able to put a little aside, if the boat is entirely at the risk of the public authority he is not going to have the same interest&mdash;I think that is the general experience&mdash;as if he had put down something for the boat, even if he has to borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  Once he knows he has the means where by to pay off the whole debt, you can be sure that his interest is increasing with every catch he sells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is a problem <Col N="1632" /> about which we all seem to have a sharp consciousness and to be keen on solving.  I have come up against it a great deal and have heard it both inside and outside the House.  I want to assure the Dáil that I have asked the board to apply themselves to it and they have done so.  They hope to achieve an easement of the conditions existing heretofore.  If they can make the position still easier for applicants along lines similar to what I have suggested, I know that they will not neglect any opportunity of finding a solution of that sort.</P>
      <P>Let me deal now with piers and harbours in a general way.  I hope that Deputies will not expect me to deal with each one which has been mentioned. The Fishery Branch is not a harbour authority and the harbour service, outside of the commercial harbours, is a very involved business, as most Deputies who have had anything to do with it have found out. There are several authorities interested in it and, last but by no means least, there are the county councils.  In a great many cases, we find that the county councils feel that they ought not to be asked to burden the rates with the provision of money for harbour works for the fishing industry. It seems to be looked upon as something that ought to be provided for entirely by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, you have the Board of Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office, where there is an employment problem, and you have the Fishery Branch, which is always asked to say what the state of the fishing is in the particular district and what the possibilities of development are.  When we have said that, we have expended our entire authority in the matter.  Nevertheless, we still have the requests coming back to us again about this question of harbours.  Since assuming the responsibilities which I now have, I have given my attention to the greatest possible extent to this question&mdash;much more so than anything else I had to come up against&mdash;because of its universality&mdash;you come up against it everywhere around the coast&mdash;its great importance and particularly because we cannot give out <Col N="1633" /> boats, even of the 50-feet type, unless we have safe and adequate anchorage for them.  One place was mentioned by Deputy Cunningham: Portaleen. When I was down there, I was told that in one place 12 motor boats were destroyed in seven years, which indicates what an intimate bearing this question of piers and harbours has on the question of the provision of boats.</P>
    <P>We have made representations to the Government in the matter.  We have pointed out to them that a very large sum of money will be required for the solution of the problem and that, as important as the money, a reorganisation of the service itself will be necessary, that we will have to stop what has been described to me as the roulette ball, sending it around from Billy to Jack, that it will have to be brought to rest somewhere.  We do not mind whether it is in Fisheries, the Board of Works or Industry and Commerce, provided there is some one authority charged with the initiation and completion of the scheme.  That is an important thing, because it has been established that there has been a timelag of an average period of six years in respect of these small harbour works and the Fisheries Branch is anxious to secure that that delay will be eliminated.  We have taken the necessary steps, so far as the Fisheries Branch could do so, by making representations, and we expect that these representations will bear fruit, that both the organisation and the money will be provided and that this work will be carried on much more expeditiously than in the past.</P>
    <P>The financing of these ports&mdash;I mean their maintenance after they have been completed&mdash;is a matter that will have to be worked out later, but I personally cannot see the local authorities entirely escaping.  However, that is not a matter for me to speak dogmatically on.  All I want is to have the jobs undertaken, done quickly and well and I feel that we are making progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked what the larger boats cost and where they were got. They were bought in Germany.  They are practically new boats made of steel <Col N="1634" /> and have every modern device and equipment that fishing science has made possible.  They have been bought at about £10,000 apiece less than we could provide similar wooden boats at home.  It is not because they were steel boats that they were bought and that the board changed their mind about making their own boats right from the start.  The chairman of the board informed me that there was a strong opinion among members of the board that delay should not be tolerated, that they should not wait for boats to be made in our own yards, as that would mean a delay of anything from a year to a year and a half.  This is particularly true in view of the delays in getting machinery because of the rearmament drive in all the countries where this machinery has to be sought.  The main motive for their decision was to get boats which could be put to service quickly.  In any event, quite apart from that, the value of the boats, I am reliably informed, is beyond question.  I do not know that their history as it was related to me was exactly true, but I was told that they were built by some German firm for fishing in the North Sea and in far northern waters, but some complications arose owing to peculiar circumstances in Germany because of the occupation and the boats had to be tied up, but in fact the boats are practically new.  They are worth twice the money given for them, I understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When were they built?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the oldest was built in 1947.  The policy of the board is to build their own boats at home.  They can build boats as big as these in Donegal or Cork and can also get them built by private boat builders in various parts of the country.  There is no necessity, therefore, to place orders for boats abroad in future.  It had to be done in the years after the war because of the amount of arrears which had to be made up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell is the man who dealt with the greatest detail on the question of how we should organise the industry.  In the main these recommendations are the ideas of <Col N="1635" /> everybody who wants to see this industry first rationalised and then expanded.  We have too great a dependence on the Dublin market. We are told that fish very often travels to Dublin and then goes back to the place from which it was originally sent.  We cannot blame the fisherman if, having brought fish in at a western port, he puts it in boxes and sends it to Dublin because very often if he keeps it in his local place he may lose on it.  The only way that situation can be met is, as was suggested by Deputy O'Donnell, other Deputies and very many people outside, to take the fish to a handling station, fillet it, deep freeze it and have it properly and hygienically packaged and then let it out on the market as the demand comes.  You can in that way avoid gluts of fresh fish and can also help to stabilise the price.  That will enable the fisherman to budget a little more accurately in the running of his boat.  It will also avoid too great fluctuations in price which annoy the housewife so much.</P>
    <P>Nobody has mentioned the control of prices.  Therefore I was going to slip by the matter, but there has of course, been a hearing before the Prices Advisory Body recently.  Their finding has not been issued.  This is a matter on which there are three opinions.  Some want the control removed altogether and say that while some fish would go up in price other classes would come down.  Some categories of fishermen&mdash;I might say the entire body of inshore fishermen&mdash; want prime fish decontrolled because they say that they are not getting proper prices and that as in any event 90 per cent. of it goes to hotels and more comfortable homes, if they have to pay more they can afford it. That would enable them, they say, to suffer a reduction in the price of round fish which the ordinary consumer uses.  I do not know exactly where the greater wisdom lies but all we in the Fisheries Branch could do when the tribunal was hearing the case was to give the facts as the body asked for them so that they might be able to get the opinions of all the interests and groups which gave information before them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> We in the Fisheries Branch want to see the consumer of fish getting adequate supplies but at the right price.  We also feel we have a very high duty imposed on us to see that the fishermen get an adequate and remunerative price.  A great many things might be said on this question of sea fishing and perhaps we should withhold our judgment in relation to this development of getting into the deep and looking for our fish, to see exactly to what extent we are able to steady and rationalise the market and also the extent to which we would be able to integrate the entire production and marketing of fish as between the most insignificant curragh and these new boats.  We feel that because we are marketing large quantities of fresh fish every week there is no reason for the inshore man to be apprehensive that his interests are going to be in danger by our putting out boats that will step up the production of fish.  After all, the immediate object of the board is to bridge the gap between the home demand and the home landings. Surely if we do that we cannot injure the inshore men.  In fact, we will not require any refrigerating or defreezing in the working out of that particular stage.</P>
    <P>It is when we come to the point where we have saturated the market with a satisfactory supply that this demand for the preservation of fish will arise, because we then set out on the task of doing what some of the other Deputies asked also, of developing the inland towns that do not now get fish.  Under the present arrangement we cannot undertake pioneering work of that sort, because we allow just as much fish in on licence as satisfies the known demand.  If we are to develop the inland towns and make fish available regularly so that a taste can be cultivated for it, we will then want these handling stations and will want a very much increased supply.</P>
    <P>It is said in the fishing industry that if you want to supply the demand you must produce anything from 10 to 20 per cent above what the demand is known to be.  That creates a problem, but we feel that problems of that kind <Col N="1637" /> can be handled and dealt with by the introduction of fish meal manufacture. A good deal of immature fish and unsaleable fish is bound to be landed and an outlet will have to be found for that.  At the present time a great deal of that fish is dumped.  It is a pity that our fishermen are getting so much of it.  There seems to be a very large amount of immature whiting particularly available around our coasts.  The fish traders do not want it; so far as I know, the housewife does not like it; and it is a drug on the market.  It is obvious that it is only in fish meal manufacture that you can find an outlet for that type of fish.</P>
    <P>There is a number of problems which make this question awfully difficult of solution, but back of the whole thing I myself feel that the fact that we have only a population of 3,000,000 and the fact also that we eat fish in the main only on one day of the week, forms the foundation of the main difficulty.  In England I believe the average Englishman eats 16 ounces of fish per week; while here the average Irishman eats only two to three ounces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain, because of the big population and much heavier consumption, it pays people to put large sums of private money into the enterprise&mdash;in private enterprises and large corporations.  We cannot do that here, as all the pioneering has to be done by the State and we have a great many interests that could very easily be hurt or damaged by any development that we undertake.  I have come up against an enormous number of conflicts in the fishing industry since I became Parliamentary Secretary.  In fact, there is no direction in which you turn to improve the position but you find yourself stepping on someone's corns.  What we have set ourselves out to do is to see if we can arrange these <Col N="1638" /> matters so that the least possible damage will be done to any interest affected.</P>
      <P>If there are any questions arising that I have not dealt with, I would be very glad to answer them.  I would ask the Dáil to indulge me for a moment or so while I give the trend of some figures which have been supplied to me on the imports of fish. The average figure of imports in the pre-war years was 129,000 cwt. and the value was £211,000.  That works out at something like £1 15s. per cwt. imported. As Deputies have pointed out, wars have always brought prosperity to the fishing industry, yet as soon as the war is over this industry seems to slide back again into depression.  That happened in the 1914-18 war and in the last war.  I have given the pre-war average.  In 1944, the imports were about 12,000 cwt.; in 1945, 9,000; in 1946, 18,000; in 1947, 18,000; in 1948, 18,000; in 1949, 21,200; in 1950, 23,260; in 1951, 38,000.  That shows that our imports are increasing. Another interesting fact is that the 1951 imports work out at about £4 per cwt., as against £1 15s. pre-war, so we are importing more heavily as time goes on and as we get further away from the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>What type of fish is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Fresh fish coming in every week.  We felt that some new departure had to be undertaken to check this.  I would like to correct Deputy Cowan's opinion&mdash;and I think it is the opinion of a very large number of people&mdash;that the waters around the Irish coast are teeming with fish.  If there is anything I could say to disabuse the minds of the public of that erroneous idea, I think I should say it.  We have some evidence, that in any event cannot be controverted, that that story is, unfortunately not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The French and Spanish fishermen come a long way, at that rate, to barren waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have incontrovertible evidence of the truth of what I say. It is this.  Two of the largest private enterprises in the country are going <Col N="1639" /> out of business, for the reason that the stocks of fish near our shores are becoming smaller and smaller year after year.  If people who have been in the fishing industry for generations come along and get rid of their boats, the sort of boats they use for that purpose, for that reason, surely you cannot deny that there must be some truth in it?</P>
      <P>With regard to the Frenchmen and Spaniards, they come around, but most of the time that we see them inside our three-mile limit they are coming in for shelter and harbourage. I saw them in the Aran Islands and I know they are off the south coast. We know that the Spaniards are coming over to our waters to fish the hake grounds which are 100 to 150 miles off the south coast.  They had to do that after the war because of the acute shortage of food and this was the only food for them.  If we want to make a claim that the hake grounds 100 miles off our coast are in Irish waters, I do not cavil at the statement in so far as it means that we are nearer to them than any other nation that is fishing them; but we have no legal claim to them any more than the Spaniards have.</P>
      <P>The fact is that larger boats, therefore, are becoming necessary.  That is not to say that the small boats that have been engaged and that still engage in seasonal fishing, such as lobster fishing, herring fishing, when the herrings come in shore, long lining, which was an old art, and salmon fishing in parts of the coast, have no further use.  Small boats&mdash;33 and 35-feet engined boats&mdash;are economic units for that type of fishing but, when it comes to whole-time fishing for sea fish the problem has taken on a new character and we have to adapt ourselves accordingly.</P>
      <P>There may be many matters that I have not touched upon with regard to sea fishing.  With regard to inland fishing, I am afraid I have not much more to add to what I said in my opening statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McMenamin's complaint about the Foyle waters, I <Col N="1640" /> can assure him that the Foyle Commission is giving and will continue to give every attention to that question by seeing that because of the new régime down there the stocks of fish will not become depleted.  I think, in fact, they have put on some recent restrictions to secure the objective that Deputy McMenamin has in mind.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Desmond's complaints about the palming off of grilse or peal as salmon, I do not know exactly what we can do about the matter.  The Deputy seemed to suggest that we should bring the scientific knowledge of the Department to bear on this question by identifying fish as peal or as salmon.  We have had this matter up before and I cannot give a categorical reply, one way or the other. In view of the very strong representations the Deputy has made, I will have the matter again brought to the notice of the Department because there is a double-edged complaint, which Deputy Desmond put very forcibly, that the fisherman is being deprived of higher prices when he is selling the fish and that the housewife has to pay higher prices when she is buying the fish. That would seem that a very unfair advantage was being taken both of the fisherman and the housewife and I will again have it brought to the notice of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned a few points when we were discussing this Estimate on the last occasion.  I was at the stage of drawing attention to the general question of finance, which is of vital importance in connection with this Estimate.  I do not intend to go into that matter in full detail at this stage because there may be various points that I want to raise that will have a direct bearing on the problem of finance and it may be easier to discuss it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> We are entitled to relate this Estimate to previous Estimates.  While it is not my desire to compare the present Estimate and the present conditions in connection with local government with the conditions in 1948, in view of some of the statements that have been made on the Estimate for Local Government for the last few years, it is perhaps important to refer to views expressed by some prominent members of the present Administration as compared with the views expressed by them when in opposition.</P>
    <P>As I stated on the last occasion when the Estimate was under discussion, it would be a waste of time to deal solely with the activities or otherwise of the present holder of the important office of Minister for Local Government without regard to the fact that the governing factor in the everyday policy and outlook of this important Department is the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputies have mentioned, when discussing matters arising out of the Budget Statement, the dangers inherent in the proposed increase in the rate of interest in connection with local loans.  That in itself may add to the difficulties which will confront local authorities in connection with the building of houses.  It will affect, not only local authorities but the central administration in the financing of important housing drives and housing programmes throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the present Minister for Finance in his relations with the Minister and the Department of Local Government considers that it is essential to increase the rate of interest for local loans.  If that is so and if any claim that he or the present Minister for Local Government may put to the House is justified, is it not strange that, when discussing the Estimate in 1948, so much attention was drawn, particularly by the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, who spent so much time belabouring the inter-Party Government and the then Minister for Local Government, a member of the Labour Party, to the disastrous policy of increasing the rate <Col N="1642" /> of interest for local loans from 2½ to 3¼ per cent.?</P>
    <P>He drew attention at that time to the problem that had to be faced by local authorities who have capital charges to meet as a result of the moneys raised for houses.  If he were justified in his criticism of the then Administration and if he then foresaw the danger of this policy, which would directly affect both local and central authorities, why is it that when he changes from one side of this Chamber to the other and assumes the responsibilities of a Minister he now upholds the policy which was attacked in 1948?  At this stage I do not intend to dwell further on this matter.  Perhaps, it might be worth while drawing attention to it later on.  In my opinion, at any rate, it shows that political expediency is a convenient method by which some people, when it suits them, attack a certain policy and a certain administration. They may consider the political advantages which may accrue to them as a result of their criticisms, but they should in all fairness be prepared to adopt and carry out, when they are the Government of the country, the policy that they expected other people to carry out.</P>
    <P>At that time the present Minister for Finance drew attention to the problem of the incidence of the rates. In doing so, and bearing in mind the dangers, he naturally drew attention to the fact that the rates would affect everybody in the country.  At a later stage during the year 1950-51, it could be realised that there was a slight reduction in the average rates charged by local authorities as compared with 1949-50.  Even so, our present Minister for Finance was not prepared to give credit.  He was prepared to criticise not only the members of the then Administration but the members of the county councils.  In his summing up he more or less said that the reduction was just a fraction of a penny.  He even went further and implied that the rates were reduced only because of a forthcoming local election during the 1950-51 period.  If ill becomes any member of this Assembly to go so far as to say that local authority members are prepared to reduce the rates <Col N="1643" /> slightly at a given time merely because they are facing an election.  In my opinion, this amounts to saying that members of local authorities are not concerned with the problem of the rates except at a period at which they are confronted with a local election.</P>
    <P>I will now touch on a very vital matter, in my opinion.  In this connection, while I do not wish to draw any individual personally into the debate, I find it of value again to draw attention to the line taken as regards housing by our present Minister for Finance.  In doing so, the present Minister for Local Government will not escape my criticism.</P>

      <P>I am certainly going to relate them to the Estimate.  At column 690 of the Official Debates of the 5th July, 1950, the following statement was made by the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any houses that were built in 1948, 1949 and 1950 derive entirely from the efforts of the Minister's predecessors over the years from 1945 to 1948.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It, therefore, seems that the sole credit for any houses that were built during these three years should be given to the Minister for Local Government who held office from 1945 to 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this Estimate the present Minister for Local Government told us the average number of houses built annually during the period from 1932 to 1940 and during the period from 1947 onwards.  It is only natural <Col N="1644" /> that the Minister found pleasure in stating, in his introductory statement, that the average number of houses built annually between the years 1932 to 1940 was 5,073, as against an average annual number of 4,576 in the period from 1947 onwards.  To the ordinary citizen reading that statement, it would seem quite obvious that the housing drive during the years 1932 to 1940 showed much better results than the housing drive from 1947 onwards. The Minister's statement gave the average number of houses built annually, but actually the number of houses built in the year 1951-52 was 7,195.  In the year 1950-51, 7,787 houses were built.  We had over 7,000 houses built in the year 1951, as against an average of 5,073 during the 1932-1940 period.  That shows an extraordinary difference in the tempo of the housing drive.  When the Minister for Local Government took over office in 1948 he could hardly be expected to show in the first year of office as high a percentage of houses built as was shown afterwards.  Between January and December, 1950, 12,118 houses were built by private persons and local authorities. If these figures are correct the Minister must admit that during the three and a quarter years of the inter-Party Government in which a member of this Party held the position of Minister for Local Government progress was the keynote in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister said that during the 1932-1940 period 5,073 houses a year on an average were built.  How does that statement compare with statements made by members of his Party when they were in opposition?  They claimed that during the years from 1932 to 1939 there were at least 130,000 houses built.  If that number of houses were built how does it compare with the average number supplied to us at this stage by the Minister?  Whatever our views, whatever the views of any Government or of any Party which may form the Government, we must, if we are interested in the people of this country so far as housing is concerned, be prepared to do our utmost to give the figures as they should be given for the purposes of <Col N="1645" /> comparison.  The figures must not be used solely for the purpose of being able to say that one Party did better than another.  We should do our utmost year after year to build more houses than ever before.</P>
    <P>The Minister, or any Minister for Local Government, has a long way to go before he can say: &ldquo;I have made far greater progress than anyone expected.&rdquo;  Housing is of vital importance to our people.  In passing, may I say that the members of all Parties of the local council in the south Cork Board of Health area are at one when it comes to the question of housing.  We never divided when it came to the issue of building houses, thanks be to God.  We never went so far as to say that one Party was better than another when it came to the question of building houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference to a ten year programme based on an average of 7,000 houses per year.  I stand to be corrected but that was the impression I got.  While we are improving the position in regard to housing in our country, I believe that an average of 7,000 houses per year in a ten year programme will not be sufficient.  We are inclined to forget that there is always a tendency towards overcrowding.  The number of persons requiring homes will not remain static.  While we build houses each year that does not mean that the number demanding houses will be reduced by the number of people who are housed.  In County Dublin, in Cork City and in Limerick, Waterford and many other towns where there is a big population, we must be prepared to admit that our figures must be set at a percentage higher than the amount submitted by the local authority. In a few years' time the figures are bound to increase.</P>
    <P>As regards the percentage of the Estimate that is devoted to housing, it is well for us to remember that each year the Government finds it essential to apportion a high percentage of the amount of money made available by the Department to housing.  In 1948, when the Minister was introducing his Estimate, he stated that approximately 85 per cent. of the demand was put <Col N="1646" /> into housing.  As far as I can recollect, the Minister stated in 1949 that there was approximately 88 per cent. put into housing.  If that is so is it not a clear indication that the Minister's predecessors, during the period from 1948 to 1951, realised that the Department had a direct responsibility for housing?  When we were prepared to say in 1948 and 1949 that our policy demanded the construction of a large number of houses, then there is little use in the Minister trying to suggest by figures submitted to us that the average output of houses during that period was lower than in the 1932-39 period.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the then Minister for Local Government when he took office considered that he should travel around the country in order to remove the many doubts and uncertainties which prevailed amongst some local authorities in regard to problems confronting them which they were not able to overcome. The Minister considered that it was his duty to go around and find out for himself the problems that confronted these local authorities.  What happened?  In 1949, and even in 1948, Deputy MacEntee from the Opposition Benches drew attention to what he described as a series of royal progresses which were unwise and a waste of time.  He considered that they were picnics at which luncheons and banquets were given.  These &ldquo;royal progresses&rdquo; left behind them something which showed the sincerity of the man who undertook them.  Time has justified his action in going around the country.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the present Minister has found it wise to fall into line with these so-called &ldquo;royal progresses.&rdquo;  I do not object to the present Minister going down the country to open housing schemes.  I believe that these are not occasions for banquets and picnics.  The people were glad to see their Minister coming amongst them.  We were all proud to let the people see that a Minister realised the importance of opening a scheme of houses in any particular area.  Even though members of the present Minister's Party objected to <Col N="1647" /> that in 1948 and 1949, I have never objected since I came to this side of the House to any Minister performing the important function of opening a housing scheme.  He can then see the problems which may confront the people with regard to housing in these areas.</P>
    <P>After all, three and a half or four years is a short period of time to show that the actions of the Minister in 1948 and 1949 and of his successor have been justified. Perhaps those people who attacked that policy then may see that instead of playing politics going around the country the Ministers for Local Government during those three years realised their duty to the people and fulfilled the obligation placed on them to encourage the housing drive in those areas.  I believe that the present Minister is in favour of that policy and I am in favour of it.  I wonder are there Deputies who may say that it is not a correct policy.  I wonder will the present Minister for Finance say it is a wrong policy or will he say that the policy of the Local Government Department should be one of bellringing when the Minister enters the Custom House in Dublin?</P>
    <P>We have to face these problems in local government as we see them and because no other Department has such a direct bearing on and such direct contact with the everyday life of our people we must be prepared to give and take perhaps, but certainly to give when the giving is deserved.  Let us therefore hope that we will not drift back to the policy which was so noticeable in the period prior to 1948. Local authorities, county managers and officials are entitled to a little more consideration than a dictatorial demand from the Custom House. We have had enough of that and we do not want any more of it.  I sincerely hope that the Minister is not thinking of reverting to that.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Estimate the Minister, so far as I am aware, said there was to be a reduction of about £30,000 in the contribution towards houses for newly-weds.  In my opinion, that is an unwise policy.  One of the <Col N="1648" /> greatest handicaps which have been facing our people for many years is the problem that in the event of marriage they have no home of their own to go to.  We know that in the cities and towns it very often means that another couple have to move into a room in a tenement or to pay an exorbitant rent for a room or two.  It is not a very satisfactory beginning in life for any young couple that, instead of owning a home of their own or being able to rent a house from a local authority, they have to go to live in these overcrowded slums or tenements.</P>
    <P>I believe that it should be the policy of the Government, while we know that it is not very easy to provide the additional capital required, to increase the amounts made available for these schemes instead of reducing them. Deputies who may be members of local authorities in city areas will, I am sure, voice their opinions on this important question on behalf of people who are continually asking them whether there is any hope of getting houses.  Government policy in this matter should be fundamentally one governed by Christian principles.</P>
    <P>Another problem that confronts us in country areas is the question of providing sites for housing.  I have in mind various villages in the county from which I come in which there are derelict sites which, viewed from any angle, are certainly deplorable.  We know that at times even local authorities are not able to get that co-operation to which we believe they are entitled from the owners of some of these derelict sites.  I know the Minister may say that local authorities have power, under the Derelict Sites Order, to acquire such sites.  That is true but it is only as a last resort that we desire to exercise such powers.  It would be much preferable if they could be acquired by consent or even by arbitration.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well if the Minister, through the local authorities, could impress on the owners of derelict sites the many advantages that would accrue to these people themselves by co-operating with local authorities.  I have in mind one case in a small village in South Cork in which there is a <Col N="1649" /> derelict site, occupied at present by five sheds or stables.  The owners, who are business people, could not see the advantage which would ultimately come to them by giving this particular site to the local authority.  Unfortunately, they have the impression which is held by so many people in this country, that one can demand a fabulous price from a local authority for any property in which they may be interested.  They fail to realise that, in the long run, they themselves will have to contribute in the shape of rates or taxes to these fabulous prices. I think the Minister should endeavour to draw attention to the importance of local authorities being able to acquire such sites for the erection of new homes.  Derelict sites are merely so many eyesores in various areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The policy pursued by the Cork borough authorities in the acquisition of sites is one on which I should like to comment favourably&mdash;that is the policy of acquiring sites for eligible persons who may wish to erect houses themselves.  I know that, in many cities and towns, some people who receive housing grants are prepared to build their own homes, but from the very outset they are confronted with the problem of trying to get suitable sites.  They often find it very difficult to get sites, and frequently the annual rent demanded from them for such sites is prohibitive.  That means that, in the long run, local authorities are saddled with the added responsibility of housing people in local authority houses who would be prepared to build their own homes if they got the necessary co-operation.  I am not suggesting that each local authority should be prepared to acquire a large area of land for this purpose, but it would certainly be advantageous if local authorities, when acquiring land for their own housing schemes, included in the area acquired a certain amount of land which could be let by that local authority to persons who, with the aid of housing grants, would build their own homes.</P>
    <P>If such a policy were put into operation it would mean that we would eventually come to the time when we could hope for a reduction in the <Col N="1650" /> amount demanded for this purpose from local authorities and which has to be found by them from the ratepayers. Our ultimate aim must be to arrive at the time when the demand on local authorities for this purpose will become less formidable.  When we have done that we can, I think, claim to have satisfied, to a certain degree, the desires of those people.  We should be prepared to look forward to the time when rate demands, which press so heavily on the people, and particularly on working-class people, can be reduced.  We should encourage to the very utmost the acquisition of land for the purpose of renting it to the people. Otherwise, we shall have to house them through housing schemes.</P>
    <P>There is another problem closely allied to that with which I have been dealing.  It concerns reconstruction grants and the policy of inspection and of payments associated with them. This is a matter of vital importance to the people.  I&mdash;I am sure the same is true of every Deputy&mdash;receive many letters from my constituents in regard to the final payment of these grants. They are anxious to receive them so that, in turn, they may hand them over either to contractors or suppliers to whom they owe debts in respect of the work carried out.  I believe that if the payment of these grants was carried out more promptly there would be much more reconstruction work done throughout the country.  Something ought to be done to remedy the delays that are taking place at present.</P>
    <P>Cork is a very big county and a great deal of work falls on the official who has to carry out these inspections. I understand that additional duties have been put on him which take him into parts of Kerry and Waterford.  No matter how hard he may work it will be impossible for him to cope with all the inspection work that is to be done. It is no pleasure for Deputies to be raising questions in the Dáil about the delays which take place, both in regard to final inspections and payment. The Minister himself was a member of a local authority and should be well aware of the difficulties that arise in this connection.  We are the servants of the people who sent us here.  They are our masters and it is our duty to <Col N="1651" /> make inquiries for them when they make these complaints.</P>
    <P>This problem that I have been dealing with is, I fear, going to be aggravated in the future because of the present policy of departing from the practice that was in operation during 1948, 1949 and up to the time of the change of Government.  During that period the necessary forms in connection with grants could go through the local authority.  The Minister may believe that this policy of local administration was not a success.  I do not know what his views on it are, but I think I am entitled to say that the policy of reverting back to the position of having all such grants and applications go through the Custom House is a very bad one.  I do not think the Minister should adopt it.</P>
    <P>Let us be fair to our local officials. At our local meetings we may sometimes not be fair to them.  We may abuse them at times because we try to get the best out of them.  At the same time, we know in our hearts that they are doing their very utmost to discharge their duties and responsibilities in a competent and efficient way.  When this work that I have referred to was being done under the local bodies it imposed a heavy task on the local officials.  In my opinion they did the work well.  When there is a glut of work in the offices of the local bodies, the local officials are surely entitled to the same consideration as those in the Minister's Department.  They should be given every support to prepare their course of action for any new duties imposed on them.  I contend that when these forms in connection with the grants were being dealt with in the offices of the local bodies the work was well done by the local officials.  In view of that, is it not a strange thing that there should now be this desire to centralise that work again?  The word &ldquo;centralisation&rdquo; must again ring in the ears of members of local authorities and officials of local authorities.  Apparently the people down the country must again send their applications to Dublin if <Col N="1652" /> they want land down in the heart of South-West Cork or Kerry or even down in Deputy Corry's area, East Cork.  They must send up their application here to the Custom House whereas, for a few years, they had the much more direct line of approach of sending it to Father Mathew Quay in Cork City.  Members of local authorities were in the advantageous position that if people asked them to inquire how their applications were being received and dealt with they were able to go into the local authority office and to inquire there about the position relating to that particular grant.</P>
    <P>What happens now?  We get a letter from some person in the country who has sent his application to the Custom House.  He may get the usual acknowledgment but, after that, the dread American wake begins.  The letter is transferred from one table to another in the office and from one corner of the room to another corner of the room.  Even if a Deputy finds time to go to the Department, it is still a difficult matter.  I have no desire to blame any official in the Custom House.  I will never say a word against the ordinary staff in any office.  A young man or a young girl from the heart of Donegal may be dealing in the Custom House with an application from someone in County Cork for a reconstruction grant.  No matter how perfect the filing system in the Custom House may be, the man or girl in the office in Cork who is familiar with the areas from which the claims come, and who may even know the person or the family by whom the claim is made, is far more suitable from that point of view.  The ambition of the local person is to ensure that these applications will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  The local authority officials did a good day's work in the time allowed to them for dealing with these cases.  If there was any hold-up or any weakening, at times, I say that the responsibility for it must not be laid solely at the door of the local authority officials.  The fault cannot be theirs in all cases.  I believe that time will justify the policy of letting applications for local grants go through these <Col N="1653" /> channels rather than through the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I come to another problem which people in these areas must face.  I have mentioned derelict sites.  I come now to another side of this problem. I want to keep the views of all sections of the community in mind, realising my obligation to act fairly in the interests of all sections of the community.  I wish to draw attention to the delay in dealing with arbitration reports.  I have put a question down in connection with this matter as I am awaiting information on a particular issue.  I consider, however, that when an inspector of a Department travels down to Cork, or elsewhere, the problem is the amount of money being allowed to arbitration.</P>
    <P>These houses having been built, the problem is an interesting one in this respect.  The tenant of a local authority house is paying rates and at the same time the landowner is paying rates.  I know of some farmers in South Cork whose case was before arbitration many months ago and yet they are paying rates on the bit of land that has been acquired by the local authority.  The tenants of the local authority houses built on these sites are paying rates.  Surely there is an injustice there.  We know that the incoming tenant must be prepared to accept his responsibility in the matter of paying rates.  Surely, however, the delay is unjust to the man giving the land&mdash;even though the Minister may say that if there is delay in payment the man will get interest on his money. The delay, in itself, is not satisfactory to people down the country.  Many a man with a few acres of land is, at times, very much in need of the hard cash he may be expecting from his local authority.  I consider that this matter is not being dealt with expeditiously by the Minister and his Department. It is a further point in justification of our claim that local authority means nothing in this country so long as the vicious control is held by the central office in Dublin, no matter what Minister or what staff may be there.  The policy must be either local government or central government.  In this case, as in other cases, we have a further proof <Col N="1654" /> of the weakness of the everyday policy carried out by central government. Certainly, these matters should be expedited. Officials dealing with them are, to a point, correct when they say that they have other duties to perform and that their time is occupied with other problems also.  The fact remains that public representatives have placed on them the duty of going out and asking for sites from some of these farmers who, to our knowledge, have not yet been paid for sites for which arbitration had been arranged so many months ago.  I consider that it is not fair to the landowner or to the member of the local authority who has to meet him in the course of his work.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the classification of sites, there is also the problem of general sanction of these housing sites.  The Minister may say that his policy is the same as the policy of his predecessors, but that is no answer to the problem.  Let us, as we are discussing an Estimate, treat it as an Estimate and deal with the problems affecting the Twenty-Six Counties instead of the problems affecting our respective constituencies.  I consider that the problem of sanction in the case of requests from local authorities for the general acquisition of sites for building should be speeded up, bearing in mind the fact that, by law, we are compelled, from the date of first publication, to wait roughly five weeks before submitting the matter to the Minister.  In addition, a certain period must be allowed lest the owner of the land should wish to oppose the acquisition by the local authorities.  He is allowed a period during which he is entitled to take action against the decision either of the local authority or of the Minister.  I consider that that period should be sufficient, without permitting months to elapse before a local authority can get general sanction. When people in the country see an advertisement in the paper to the effect that houses are being built in a certain area, when they find the delay that occurs they come to the conclusion that the members of local authorities are not doing their duty. They believe&mdash;who can blame them&mdash; when they see the advertisement that <Col N="1655" /> in a matter of a month or so tenders will be asked for, contracts will be placed and the building of the houses commenced.  The policy of giving general sanction for the acquisition of these sites, therefore, should be accepted to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>When local authorities, through their responsible officials, through the co-operation of their members and through the employment of qualified architects, request sanction <i>in globo</i> for the acquisition of sites, covering a general area or sites covering a particular area, there should be no necessity for such sanction being delayed down in the Custom House for many months at a time.  We want houses built, no matter what Government is in power.  No matter what Government or what Minister is in power they wish to see to it and to have it to say that so many houses were built in their time.  If the present Minister can increase the number of houses built in South Cork, if he can double the number as compared with the number built in any previous year, I do not begrudge him the credit if he so wishes to take it.  I will co-operate with him, as will any member of the local authorities.  We can take pride in the fact that we are improving in the case of house-building.  In the case of the general sanction for the acquisition of sites, it is important to give that co-operation to local authorities to help them in their problems.  After all, members of local authorities are not paid officials.  Very often they get great abuse from people who are not aware of the facts, from people who do not realise the problems and who are never willing to give praise to the members of local authorities for the work they do.  From my experience of those members of local authorities, I can say that I found them a decent body of men willing to serve their own particular district and their own particular county to the best of their ability.  Why should they be held up in their work due to delays in the Custom House in Dublin, which means disappointment to the people who are waiting for houses and also annoyance and disappointment to the members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> What I have said in connection with general acquistion sanction also applies to sanction of tenders.  I realise that it is most important when these tenders are forwarded by the manager of a local authority to the headquarters that these figures should be studied carefully and that it is incumbent on the responsible officials to do so.  Nevertheless, I am not convinced that there need be this undue delay in examining these estimates which is so noticeable.  The Minister may point out various delays which can be accounted for.  The officials in his Department may point out the impossibility of dealing with these problems of tenders more speedily, but from my own experience in the building industry and my own knowledge of matters appertaining to checking of tenders, it is not a problem that should hold up officials for months on end.  We want these matters expedited.  We cannot do anything unless the Minister is prepared to see that in his Department these matters are not held back for a period longer than we believe, and the Minister himself should believe, justifies that delay.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which, perhaps, is not the Minister's fault, yet it is a problem which is very noticeable in country areas.  When the members of local authorities go to landowners, and ask their co-operation, ask them to give an acre or two for the building of cottages, they tell the people, naturally, that they will be compensated by the local authority.  Sometimes we in the local authority receive that splendid co-operation which is so pleasing to us.  Other times we may have a struggle before we can strike a bargain with the landowner.  Eventually, we get that site and ultimately the landowner is told how much he is going to get for that site, but the difficulty arises, as Deputy Corry is so well aware, having taken a prominent part in trying to solve this problem as all of us have done in the board of health areas, that while the houses have been built and occupied many of these landowners, simply because of the problems relating to proving of title are not yet in a position to say that they are safe <Col N="1657" /> in getting the few pounds, whatever it has been arranged to give them.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister for Local Government is not responsible for title?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have not yet had an oportunity of making myself clear to you in that respect but if you consider the suggestion I am trying to make is out of order I certainly will not pursue it.  I am only suggesting that the Minister for Local Government is the Minister responsible ultimately as, half-way through, the local authorities are responsible, for the collection of rates.  If a certain person is not paying rates then a local authority manager, a servant ultimately of the Minister for Local Government, is empowered to prosecute that landowner.  Therefore, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I suggest to the Minister, as Deputy Corry rightly suggested long before now, in view of the fact that these people are admitted to be the rated occupiers and that money has been accepted from these people as the rated occupiers, that whether it be by having accompanied with their application a sworn affidavit or otherwise, this problem, which we are told is a local problem, a problem most annoying to many of us, can be overcome in a simple way by the course I am trying to suggest to the Minister for Local Government.  After all, if the county manager gets a written statement from the recipient safeguarding him from any further claim I think the Minister should be empowered, since he will be safeguarded in law, to give the money for which the applicant has waited so long.  In that way we will overcome the difficulty with regard to title and we will no longer have to journey down to the Land Registry in an effort to get title.  We will no longer have to chase after the Land Commission because the Minister will help us to get over that difficulty and give the money to the applicant to which he is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who are interested in buying houses for their own occupation.  There are certain facilities for those who are anxious to build houses for their own occupation, <Col N="1658" /> but unfortunately the grant only extends to those people who are building new houses, and no grant can be made available to a person who has been the tenant of a house over a long number of years, and is now anxious to buy it outright.  Could not similar facilities be extended to those who are already tenants of existing houses to enable them to buy them?  If we give those facilities we will be helping people to own their own homes, and that is something we all desire.  We will be putting them in the position that they will no longer have to pay rent week by week, or month by month, to a landlord.  Our ambition should be to make as many people as possible the owners of their own homes.</P>
    <P>In relation to house building, the price of materials plays a very important part.  That is particularly true in the case of local authorities building houses by direct labour.  While I know that the Minister is not responsible for the control of prices, I suggest to him that he should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in an effort to bring prices, particularly the prices of hardware merchandise, down to a reasonable level.  Prices have gone up by leaps and bounds.  I think the Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and examine this problem because these prices have a direct bearing on the rent and rates that the tenants of local authority houses will ultimately have to pay.  I am sure the Minister is anxious, as was his predecessor, to see a reduction in the tenders submitted for houses.  It is our duty to ensure that the prices of materials do not impose too heavy a burden on those who are building houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but I suggest he should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in an effort to secure that the prices of raw materials for house building will bear a more reasonable relationship to the overall cost of erecting houses for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it possible to increase the amount <Col N="1659" /> of the grants being made available to local authorities?  The Minister may say it is not possible to increase them at this stage.  On the 5th July, 1950, at column 683 of the Official Report, it is quite specifically stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential that the rents of houses built by local authorities with Government subsidies and with subventions from the rates should be related to the capacity of the tenants to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by Deputy MacEntee, now Minister for Finance. Remembering that it was made by one who is such an expert on finance it carries a certain weight.  Rents must be based on the capacity of the incoming tenant to pay.  Those of us who are members of local authorities are faced with a big problem at present. Even after making due allowance for the Government grant, we are still faced with the problem of having to provide, roughly, 55 per cent. of the cost of building the house.  The Government grant averages about 45 per cent. and, according to the statement made by the then Deputy MacEntee, the local authority must take into consideration the amount the tenant can pay, which means that the local authority must be prepared to provide the rest of the money through an imposition on the rates.  I am not saying that the Minister should immediately increase grants.  Our financial problem is a big problem and one which must be faced as an over-all problem rather than one relating to a particular Government or Minister.  It would be well if the Minister, in view of that statement, would consider the possibility of increasing these grants because, if it is possible, it will relieve the local authorities of a little of the heavy burden at present on their shoulders.  It will be an advantage to the people in general because one of the hardships imposed on them as ratepayers will be somewhat eased.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the Seanad a week or two ago the sale of houses by local authorities.  One point struck me as being very notable, that is, that the Minister's view is that local authorities should be able to <Col N="1660" /> make a profit on the sale of these houses.  Normally, I agree with that up to a point, provided, of course, that the profit is severely limited.  It will not be very much advantage to the State if local authorities are to launch out on a house-building programme and introduce purchase schemes which will give them a profit higher than normal. That statement must be closely examined in view of the fact that local authorities are offering for sale the tenancies of old cottages.  Is it the policy of the Minister that the local authorities, when offering these old cottages for sale, should be entitled to such a profit?  In arriving at any profit, due recognition must be given to the tenant in respect of all the years these cottages have been built.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in this problem in view of the fact that some local authorities may at present be preparing purchase schemes for the sale of their cottages.  It could be somewhat dangerous if local authorities, having read that statement, should introduce into any scheme for the sale of old cottages conditions which would be advantageous to them, but most undesirable from the point of view of the prospective purchaser and of no advantage to him.  In that case, also, I should like to know where we really stand in connection with any purchase scheme.  I do not propose to drift into a discussion of purchase schemes, as I know it is a matter on its own, but knowing, as I do, the various difficulties involved in these schemes, I feel that we should get some clear indication from the Minister as to his line of approach, and, in view of the statement he made in the Seanad, it is essential that the matter be clarified.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession at the moment details of a very interesting case in this connection, a matter which perhaps can be raised at another time but one which must be clarified, because, while it is a particular case affecting a particular individual, it is a matter which could affect thousands of people.  The obligation is placed on us of advising would-be purchasers of the advantages or disadvantages of any of these schemes and as some of these schemes <Col N="1661" /> are in course of preparation at present, it is incumbent on the Minister to make clear his views, so that members and officials of local authorities may know exactly what the position is when drafting their schemes.  It will not be any advantage to local authorities if, having prepared schemes and submitted them to Dublin for sanction, with all the delay involved they are then told that their schemes are not in conformity with the scheme the Minister wished <Col N="1662" /> them to submit.  Therefore, it is at this stage that the Minister should make the position clear and should give local authorities an outline of the scheme or schemes which he is prepared to consider, with a view to giving sanction.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12 midnight until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24th July, 1952.</P>
