      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if it is the intention of his Department to acquire from the Roscommon County Board of Health cottages and plots in County Roscommon at present in occupation of tenants of the local authority and who have been allotted parcels of land by the Land Commission; and, if so, on what basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 39 of <Col N="1526" /> the Land Act, 1927, &ldquo;any local authority in whom is vested any cottage erected or acquired under the Labourers' (Ireland) Acts, 1893-1919, which has ceased to be required for the purposes of these Acts, may, with the sanction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and subject to such conditions as he may prescribe, sell such cottage, together with the land attached thereto, to the Land Commission for a price payable in 4½ per cent. Land Bonds.&rdquo;  Up to the present no such sale has taken place in any county.  The Deputy may be under the impression that if land is allotted to the occupier of a labourer's cottage, the local authority is obliged to take up the cottage.  That is not so, as the part of Section 19 of the Labourers' Act of 1906 which requires this to be done was replaced by the Land Act, 1923.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I was quite well aware of that Section 39 of the 1927 Act; that is the reason I put down the question.  What I want to know is whether the Land Commission has any intention whatever of compensating the local authorities for those cottages, or do they intend to take any steps in the matter?  The local authorities are desperately anxious to get rid of the cottages to those farmers, but they want to know if the Land Commission are prepared to make any move in the matter.  This is the position we are in.  There is no need to quote the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 74:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (d), line 15, to delete the figures &ldquo;56&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;49.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that, in connection with shift working on continuous processes, no worker shall be required to work more than 49 hours, instead of the 56 hours provided for in the Bill.  In this Bill the Minister has fixed a maximum working week of 48 hours in respect of day work, and, presumably, that is based on the belief that from a social point of view, from an economic point of view, and from a national point of view, a maximum working week of 48 hours is desirable.  In connection with the conditions under which shift work is performed, the Minister proposes that the hours of work may be as long as 56 in any one week, and that is eight hours longer than the Minister proposes for the maximum working week in respect of day work.  I cannot <Col N="1528" /> see any reason for extending the working week in the case of workers employed in shift work.</P>
    <P>If there was a scarcity of workers, one could understand the desire of the Minister to safeguard industry against the possible reactions that would flow from a reduction of working hours.  But it is not a problem of the scarcity of labour; it is a problem of a surfeit of labour; it is a problem that expresses itself in the the fact that there are too many workers for such work as is available and, so long as that condition of affairs exists&mdash;and I think it appears likely to continue&mdash;there is no case for continuing a 56-hour week in respect of shift work while we fix a maximum working week of 48 hours in respect of day work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only consideration which I can advance against the acceptance of this amendment is the same as that which I advanced against an earlier amendment moved by the Deputy, amendment No. 42.  We are not proposing in this Bill to do more than fix the maximum working hours and conditions contemplated in the Washington Convention, and they represent the conditions generally recognised by the majority of good employers.  If there is any case for a reduction of working hours below the maximum hours authorised by this Bill, then it is proposed to effect that reduction after examination of the conditions operating in each industry, after consultation with the parties engaged in it and by regulations made under Section 44.  I do not think it is desirable that we should proceed in any other manner. Any all-round reduction of working hours that would tend to affect the conditions of a number of industries might produce results which we cannot foresee, and the wiser method is to deal with the matter industry by industry, after examination of all the circumstances and after consultation with the interested parties.  Consequently, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1529" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister must realise that there would be nothing to prevent him having such consultations as he might deem necessary with interested parties, following the passage of this Bill, even if the working hours in respect of shift work are reduced from 56 to 48.  The Minister ought to try to give us a 1935 reason and not a 1919 reason for the fixation of hours of work on shift work at 56 a week.  Of course, the Minister knows that, in effect, 56 hours a week would be the normal working period in respect of shift work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Bill authorises the worker to be employed for not more than 56 hours in any week. The Deputy will appreciate, if he multiplies 9 by 6, that any week in which 56 hours are worked will be an exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A man working nine hours a day for six days will have a total of 54 working hours.  The Bill prohibits any person being employed on a shift longer than nine hours.  If he works six days he will not work 56 hours.  He may, however, having regard to variations in employment which naturally take place in industries worked on the continuous process, be allowed in any week to work 56 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming this thing works out in the nice tidy way envisaged by the Minister, at least there will be a 54-hour week and possibly, on a change over of staff, handing over from one worker to another when commencing a new shift week, the working hours might probably be extended to 56.  I cannot understand the Minister's case for making a maximum working week of 56 hours.  What is the difficulty in making the maximum working day seven hours instead of nine hours?  What is the difficulty in working shifts on the basis of four instead of three?  The Minister ought to tell us what practical difficulties could be anticipated if the shifts are <Col N="1530" /> worked on the basis of four instead of the three envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is expected to know.  Who ought to know if the Minister does not?  It is the Minister's special task to examine the reactions of a Bill of this kind.  He should be in a position to tell us what effects an amendment of this kind would have on industry and the beneficial effects it would have on the serious unemployment problem that there is now in the country.  Does the Minister take the view that it was not possible to have a consultation between representative persons in industry and that it was not possible to have further planning if the hours in this sub-section were reduced from 56 to 49?  I submit the Minister can have consultation and further planning if the hours are reduced from 56 to 49.  It is not a valid argument against this amendment to say that because certain persons met in Washington in 1919 and had a certain conception of industrial hours in the circumstances then obtaining that the same arguments can be automatically applied to the consideration of a problem the same in character as in 1935 but varied in circumstances from 1935. I want to press this amendment on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that it is wiser to proceed in the manner of making a separate examination of each industry and to have this examination of their circumstances in consultation with the parties engaged in it.  The International Labour Office at Geneva some years ago did not think this was necessary. Now the International Labour Office has come to the opinion that it is wiser to proceed with industry by industry after making an examination of all the circumstances and after consultation with the interested parties.  This section is in conformity with the best opinions all over the world.</P>

    <P>Motion declared passed&mdash;amendment lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 75:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to insert before paragraph (e) the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e) no worker shall work for more than one shift in any period of twenty-four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to endeavour to safeguard a worker against the possibility that he may be required to work two shifts in a period of 24 hours.  Under the section it is true that no shift may be longer than <Col N="1533" /> nine hours in duration, and under sub-section (1) (c) it is provided that no worker shall work another shift unless eight hours have elapsed since he worked on a previous shift.  Looking at the effect of the section on industrial employment, it would appear to be possible for a worker to work nine hours, to have eight hours off, and then to start a second shift of nine hours, unless there is some provision that he shall only, at all events, be required to work one shift in a period of 24 hours.  I think the Minister will agree that it is very undesirable that a worker should be required to work for 16 hours within a period of 24 hours. Under the section as drawn he can be required to work for a period of 16 hours within a period of 24 hours.  I think the Minister should meet this amendment at all events to the extent of ensuring that a worker will not be required to work for such long hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says it is possible for a worker to work 16 hours within 24 hours.  He can do it under the section, but that is to permit of the change-over taking place, as it must take place in every shift work industry, where a worker does a week or a fortnight or a month on a night shift and then goes on to the day shift.  On the day of the change over it may be necessary to take two shifts which must be divided by a period of not less than eight hours.  The amendment would prevent that and create considerable difficulty and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  It is necessary to provide that a worker, changing over from the night to the day shift or <i>vice versa</i>, or changing over from shift work to day work, could in certain circumstances be required to work two shifts with an interval of eight hours in between.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The safeguards are all there.  The safeguards are that the worker must not work on two shifts unless there is an eight-hour interval between the two shifts.  In any event, he is subject to the maximum hours <Col N="1534" /> per week and the maximum hours per shift, so that the situation which the Deputy contemplated could only happen once in a week.  It could not happen as a regular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it could. There is nothing to prevent it happening as a regular process.  What is to prevent a worker being required to work 16 hours in 24 hours; 16 hours in the next 24 hours; and 16 hours within the next 24 hours?  Is not that quite possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible, under the section as drawn, for a worker to work a nine-hour shift, to have eight hours off, to go on again for a second nine hours, to be put off for a second eight hours, and in that way exhaust his working week, let us say, in three and a half days of the normal calendar week.  Even if he has the remainder of the week off, I think it is very undesirable that a worker should be allowed to undertake a physical endurance test of that kind.  I am willing to consent to any conditions that may be necessary to deal with the possibility of meeting a situation which involves a change over from day to night work, or from one shift to another, but it is not necessary, in order to meet that situation, to leave the section as wide as it is.  The Minister could, I think, meet whatever difficulty he has in mind without leaving the section in this loose way.  I shall calculate the timetable for the Minister on the next section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal in what the Minister said in regard to the change over from night to day work if the amendment were accepted but, at the same time, the Minister might see if he could not tighten up the section a little more because, while what Deputy Norton outlined is not likely to happen, there is at least the possibility of its arising. I do not think it is likely to happen because, apart from the question of the workman, the employer who would be so foolish as to try to make a man work 16 hours out of the 24 for two or three days per week would find his man was not very much good at the end of it, or that the work turned out by a man under these circumstances would not be up to the standard.  At the same time, I think the Minister should see his way to tighten up the section a little more&mdash;it is impossible to make it watertight&mdash;while leaving that looseness which is necessary to accommodate the change over from one shift to another.  There is the possibility of what Deputy Norton mentioned happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that we are fixing under this Bill maximum hours of work in respect of a number of industries which are worked on the shift-work system at present. Lower maximum hours than those are, in fact, in operation at present.  In fact, at the recent International Labour Convention, at which there was a proposal of a 40-hour week for the glass bottle industry, we were in a position to ratify the Convention straight away, because the conditions in the glass bottle industry here are such as would enable us to do it without any change whatever in the existing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to certain other industries where the maximum hours are much lower than those authorised in this Bill.  Deputy Norton is making the point that we accepted the maximum hours suggested and adopted by the Washington Hours Convention in 1919, but the fact is that few countries <Col N="1536" /> have yet attempted to embody these hours in their legislation.  We are amongst the first to do so and we have put them in with the intention of making them the normal outside limit.  The intention is to further reduce them where circumstances require but to have special provision made in accordance with Section 44 where it is considered the circumstances require it.  Deputy Norton thinks the legislation should automatically operate to give effect to such drastic proposals as he suggests.  Our idea is that to be fully aware of the consequences of any substantial reduction in hours in any industry you must take that industry separately and deal with it by regulations that can be modified, if necessary.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are providing, in connection with shifts, for the adoption of the working hours of the Washington Convention.  There were workers' representatives present when these hours were adopted and they agreed that where there were three shifts the provisions made were ample to safeguard the interests of the workers. In the glass bottle industry, where there are four shifts, the hours are very substantially reduced.  For the purposes of this part of the Bill, the effect of the Washington Convention was to authorise a three shift system, and we propose to do that.  It is not possible, as Deputy Norton seems to suggest, for a worker to be asked to work 18 hours on two consecutive days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say 18 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, 16 hours.  If a worker works for eight hours, he gets eight hours off and cannot get another shift until after eight hours' rest.  If he works nine hours, he gets eight hours' rest and can do seven hours in the next shift.  The next day he can do two hours in the first shift, and after the prescribed rest complete a total of 11 hours, and the next day 13 hours, but that would never happen in practice.  The argument against Deputy Norton's amendment is that it would prevent something that is desirable in the interests of the worker and the employer, namely: that it should be possible to change a man, from <Col N="1537" /> a night shift to day shift without dislocating the industry or the process.  The only industries dealt with here are those in which the process must go on all the time and in which there cannot be any interruption of the work which must go on once it is started.  It is necessary to make different provisions in these industries from those which can be started at 8 o'clock in the morning and stopped at six in the evening and started again the next day.  The industries affected here are of an entirely different nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Has the Minister read the speech made by the Labour Minister in the Labour Government at Geneva when this matter was discussed there?  If he had done so, he would not make the statement he has just made.  Far from having a right to compliment himself on the fact that this country is ratifying the Washington Convention, the Minister will find that it only proves that this country is out of date in attempting to establish a high social programme founded on the Washington Convention. The Washington Convention is out of date in respect to industrial matters.  In many countries, the hours of work are not more than 48, and in many countries they are less than 48.  I think in Czecho-Slovakia and Denmark, they are less.  If he steps outside Great Britain the Minister will get an example of what is being done in respect to working hours.  If the Minister compares the standard in the two countries I have mentioned with the standard obtaining here, he will find that these countries are far ahead compared with ours in that respect. I am prepared to meet the Minister in respect to the matter of the change from one shift to another. At the same time, I think it is not necessary to have the section as widely drawn as it is.  If the Minister would look into the question of having the worker not required to work for more than one shift in any period of 24 hours, except for a change-over, I would withdraw the amendment.</P>

If his relief is delayed by accident or otherwise, he must remain until someone comes to take his place.  The same thing would apply in the event of any cause preventing the worker from taking his place in the shift when the time came for him.  It might be necessary to call in as a substitute for such worker somebody who had been working in an earlier shift&mdash;not the immediately preceding shift but an earlier shift.

      <P>I move amendment No. 76:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (e), line 17, to delete the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;thirty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to extend the period of the rest interval <Col N="1540" /> allowed under sub-section (1) (e) from 15 minutes to 30 minutes.  The relevant portion of the sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every worker shall be allowed at least 15 minutes' rest in every shift not less than three or more than four hours after the commencement of such shift.</P>
    <P>The object of that portion of the section is to provide the worker with a rest interval of 15 minutes in each shift of nine hours, and the object of the amendment is to extend the period to 30 minutes.  I take it that the Minister agrees that the rest referred to is mainly for the purpose of enabling such workers to partake of a meal, and if that is the object, I do not think that 15 minutes is adequate in respect of a worker who is compelled to work nine hours continuously in a shift in industrial employment and probably during the night, and having regard to the strain and burden imposed upon the worker as a consequence of being required to undergo a period of toil extending over nine hours.  I think 30 minutes is the minimum period of rest which ought to be allowed in nine hours' toil.  In any case, 15 minutes seems altogether inadequate, and a very small fraction of the working hours of a worker for the purpose of enabling him to partake of a meal or to engage in any other kind of rest.  I suggest that the Minister ought to accept the amendment, because I think 15 minutes is altogether inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether this is to include the meal hour?  Is it not exclusive of meals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no meal hour provided for here.  I want Deputies to remember again the type of industry they are dealing with.  I give the example of a sugar cooker in the sugar factory.  He cannot leave the sugar boiler.  So long as he is on duty for the whole of the period, he must be there, and even his rest and his meal must be taken beside the boiler.  It may be that for half-an-hour he will have nothing whatever to do with the boiler, except to look at the indicator showing how the sugar is cooking, but <Col N="1541" /> he must be there in case something goes wrong, to put it right.</P>
      <P>The same thing would apply to certain other industries, such as, for example, a worker in a gas works whose job it is to see that an engine keeps running.  It may be that, for an hour, he will have nothing to do, but he must be there all the time, and even when taking his meal he must be there in case something should happen to the engine which would require his immediate attention.  Deputies will get over their difficulties in dealing with the provisions of this section if they remember that it relates only to industries which are worked on a continuous process and in which the work must go on continuously or a disaster of some kind will happen.  The provision here is that the worker may be given fifteen minutes' rest for a meal in the course of a shift.  I agree that the fact that the worker has to remain on the premises makes it obvious that even that rest period must be regarded as a working period for purposes of pay.  In so far as the worker is not free during that period to leave his work or to take recreation, it is a working period and he is paid for that period.  This is merely put in as a proviso to ensure that he will be allowed to take a meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it would be possible in any one of these industries&mdash;certainly neither of the two I have mentioned&mdash;on a basis which would allow a worker on a shift to go outside the factory or to walk about in the open air.  Again, I say that I think 15 minutes too short a period, and I know that in some of these shift industries they manage to give the workers a longer rest period than 15 minutes.  My feeling in these matters is that we should take the practice as we understand it to exist and as laid down in the Convention to which I have referred; to enact that as the standard; and then to proceed to take industry by industry and modify these regulations in whatever way it is considered desirable, having regard to the representations made by the workers and the general desire that the hours of work in industry should be reduced and that working conditions should be <Col N="1542" /> improved.  Therefore, I am inclined to resist any of these amendments which propose to modify these sections, all of which are taken verbatim from the Washington Hours Convention.  I say that we should take these sections, put them into our legislation, and enact them, while, at the same time, taking power to make regulations industry by industry, to reduce hours of work and improve conditions in whatever way it seems desirable after all parties have been taken into consultation.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we have got to face up to this fact, that under this section a man may be called on to work continuously for nine hours, with the small break suggested by the section of 15 minutes.  The Minister talked about a man whose job it would be to look at the gauge of the engine or boiler, but I suggest that the Minister took the easiest form of work.  We know that that man is engaged all the time, in the sense that he has to keep his eye, so to speak, on the gauge and to see that everything is going right, but there is the other type of worker. You might have shift work where a man is engaged in strenuous manual labour for a continuous period of nine hours, and it seems to me that the cases I have in mind apply to a far greater number of workers than the case suggested by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but we have to fix a maximum that will cover all workers.  I agree that if there is strenuous manual work involved, the shift should be short, and I propose to effect that in relation to such an industry under Section 44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, but again I want to return to this continuous period of nine hours. It is very long.  It may seem short when talking about it here, but if a man has to undertake to do a form of work over a period of nine hours, and particularly if it is at night, it seems considerably longer than nine hours.  It seems to me that if arrangements can be made to give such men a 15 minutes' rest interval, there ought not to be any very great difficulty in extending that to half-an-hour.  I think the amendment <Col N="1543" /> is reasonable.  I am, of course, glad to hear the Minister say that he proposes to have regard to the type of work which will have to be undertaken, because I know of certain work performed in this country which is very strenuous and at which a man must keep working continuously over the full period of the shift.  I would ask the Minister to take whatever precautions he can in the Bill to see that workers of that class particularly will get the maximum rest that it is possible to give them, having regard to the difficulty of arranging time during shift work.</P>

      <P>Let us see what it is. The power conferred on the Minister under Section 44 is to restrict the hours of work.  The Minister, say, restricts the hours of work from 44 to 40 per week.  That is what the Minister can do under Section 44.  He can bring the hours down to 40 per week, but, in any case, the person employed at shift work will still only be entitled to 15 minutes rest in any period of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My object here is to increase this period of relief in such a way that the worker will not be unduly extended and will also be paid for the period of extension because of the fact that it is only 30 minutes in a period of 9 hours.  The Minister will find on reconsideration that Section 44 does not give him power to deal with this matter. However, when we come to Section 44, I hope the Minister will be as audacious about the powers he has under it as he appears to be now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to allow a 15 minutes' interval on 9 hours work, surely you would be justified under the Minister's argument in reducing the 15 minutes if you reduce the hours of work?  If you reduce the hours from 9 to 8, you would be quite justified in reducing the 15 minutes to 13.  The fact of the matter is that a person employed for 9 hours on laborious work is only to get 15 minutes from the section. The Minister has quoted in support of his case two very extreme instances which can hardly be said to be typical of continuous processes in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the process is a continuous process, there must be adequate precautions to ensure that the process will not stop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be nobody more concerned to see that an engine is not overheated than the worker himself. He will be much more concerned than the Minister or the employer who will be perhaps at home in bed.  The worker will be quite concerned to see that the engine does not become overheated, because the worker will stand in the greatest danger of physical injury if any of these precautions are not taken.  We can assume, at all events, that the worker will probably take more interest than anybody else in making sure that adequate precautions are taken.  The Minister says, however, that from whatever survey he has made of the conditions in such industries he is quite satisfied that 15 minutes, at all events, can be afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he implies it when he makes provision for this 15 minutes in the section.  The Minister is not going to say quite recklessly and <Col N="1547" /> without any consideration that he is going to grant 15 minutes, because even under the Minister's section the worker can go away from the sugar gauge or the engine indicator for 15 minutes.  The Minister is satisfied himself, by seeking to enact this provision, that the worker can do what he likes in these 15 minutes.  The Minister has broken ground in providing that the worker must get 15 minutes at a certain period, not being more than four hours since he commenced work, during which the worker can be away from the vital machines of which the Minister talked.  The principle, therefore, of his right to be away is established. The principle of the desirability of giving him that rest is established.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that there is no risk if he is away for 15 minutes, and my proposal is that since 15 minutes is inadequate, it should be extended to 30 minutes.  My amendment does not bring into consideration the idea whether it is possible to afford him such a rest interval.  The Minister has already decided that.  My amendment does not bring into consideration the question of whether there is danger if he is absent, because the Minister has already decided that.  I think it must be admitted by everyone that 15 minutes in a long nine hours' toil is altogether inadequate.  I am surprised to see the Minister standing over a proposal of this kind, because 15 minutes is obviously inadequate.  About 2 per cent. of a man's time, out of the nine hours, is granted to him for rest. Remember this is the only opportunity the man may have of getting a meal during those nine hours, and the Minister is proposing to give him only 15 minutes.  I think the proposal is outrageous.  We have got to make a choice between the sugar being perfectly cooked and boiled and of ministering to the needs of the human material engaged in making the sugar process possible.  At all events, if we are to err at all, we ought to err in doing what is reasonable and fair to the human material engaged in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long debate with regard to the case of a man in charge of the sugar boiler. There are other types of employment to be considered where you will have a number of men on a job, and in those cases I do not see how this principle of a 15 minutes' rest period can be applied at all.  I do not see much difference between the Minister's proposal and Deputy Norton's amendment. I think that neither will be found adequate in certain circumstances. I have in mind the case of men engaged on railway bridge construction. The tides hamper or facilitate their work, with the result that very often they have to work not only during the night but throughout a great part of the following day.  The reason for that, of course, is to make the railway-road available as soon as possible.  A period of five, 10 or 15 minutes may be of vital importance where you are dealing with the tides. Paragraph (e) of this section says that every worker shall be allowed at least 15 minutes' rest in each shift of not less than three nor more than four hours.  In connection with the work that I am speaking of, it may not <Col N="1549" /> be possible&mdash;indeed in many cases for the reasons that I have already stated it would not be possible&mdash;to observe that condition at all.  Because of the conditions under which this special work is done, a 15 minutes' rest would not be sufficient at all.  Irrespective of what is laid down in this section, the men engaged on it will not be satisfied with 15 or 30 minutes.  They will have to get adequate time to take a full meal.  That class of work is of a very arduous nature.  This section, in fact, contemplates wiping out the minimum of a 45 minutes' interval enjoyed by all workers engaged in construction work, and proposes to reduce the interval to 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in it for meal hours.  There is just the provision for the 15 minutes' rest in a nine-hour spell.  I think, in connection with the workers to whom I have been referring, the Minister should put into the section the words &ldquo;without prejudice to their regular meal hours&rdquo;. An amendment of the section is required to meet this special class of workers.  If the Minister has not already the power to deal with special classes of work, he should take the power, because the cast-iron conditions laid down here could not be applied in the case of constructional work on the railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that this section provides for a 15 minutes' rest interval.  It provides for at least a 15 minutes' rest interval, and the Deputy should not ignore the two vital words &ldquo;at least&rdquo;.  Again, I want Deputies to remember that where you are dealing with legislation of this kind, fixing maximum hours of work and minimum standards of conditions of employment, it is unfair to contend that <Col N="1550" /> the maximum hours fixed or the minimum standards fixed are the Government's conception of what should be the normal conditions.  If you fix minimum rates of wages for industry you are not saying that you think that those are the rates of wages that you think should prevail generally. In this case, where you fix maximum hours and minimum standards of conditions of employment, you are simply doing that in order to fix a limit beyond which conditions cannot deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>You are fixing a minimum in this section which, I submit, cannot be applied in the case of the special class of railway work to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The special regulations required to deal with a special class of work do not come in under this section, but under Section 44.  Under that section special regulations will be made to exempt special classes of workers, such as those referred to.  It is obvious that they should not be subject to the general provisions of this Bill.  There is a provision in the Bill which prohibits certain classes of work on Sundays and holidays, but as we all know, those engaged on constructional work on the railways do most of their work on Sundays and holidays, and obviously they will have to be excluded. They will be allowed to carry on their work during the time best fitted for its execution.  You can only deal with a special class of work by special regulations. I have been trying to get that into Deputy Norton's head during most of the afternoon, and I am glad that I am now having the co-operation of Deputy Keyes.</P>

    <P>Amendment 77 not moved.</P>
    <P>Section 26 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any employer to permit any worker employed by him in any industrial undertaking to do any industrial work on licensed shift work in such a manner as to contravene any condition contained in the licence authorising such licensed shift work or any of the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  no shift shall be longer than nine hours in duration;</P>
    <P>(b)  no worker shall work on two consecutive shifts;</P>
    <P>(c)  no worker shall work on any shift unless at least eight hours have elapsed since he worked on a previous shift;</P>
    <P>(d)  no worker shall work for so many hours in any week that the average number of hours per week worked by him in any three consecutive weeks would exceed forty-eight;</P>
    <P>(e)  every worker shall be allowed at least fifteen minutes rest in each shift not less than three nor more than four hours after the commencement of such shift.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 81.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) before paragraph (d) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No worker shall work for more than one shift in any period of twenty-four hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussing a similarly phrased amendment on Section 26, I urged on the Minister that it was desirable that a worker should be prevented from working two shifts in any period of 24 hours.  I still think that there was a <Col N="1553" /> good case for the acceptance of that amendment by the Minister, but there is a very much stronger case for the acceptance of this amendment.  Under Section 26 no worker could be obliged to work more than 56 hours in any week but, under Section 27, it is possible for a worker to be employed for 81 hours in one week.  The only overriding consideration is that when you take his time for a period of three weeks he should not work more than 48 hours each week.  It is unreasonable to expect that a worker should be required, in the absence of any restrictions in the section, to work 81 hours a week, and I think the Minister will agree, in respect of this section, that it has not the safeguard which existed in the previous section, namely, where they work two shifts in the period of 24 hours the worker should not be required to work more than 56 hours in the complete week.  I should like to hear the Minister justifying a provision which would make an employee work 81 hours a week.</P>

      <P>Exactly, their power to ensure that unreasonable conditions will not be imposed upon them.  We are setting down statutory obligations regarding the hours of employment.  In many cases there will not be an actual obligation because conditions which are regarded as good and reasonable, and likely to produce the most efficient results, will operate in the majority of <Col N="1554" /> cases.  We are taking power, where necessary, to enforce statutory obligations where these conditions cannot be secured otherwise.  Under this section the obligation on employers is more restrictive than in the case of the previous section, because, in respect of licensed shift work there is an obligation that the worker's maximum hours per week must not exceed 48.</P>

      <P>Every shift work licence granted under this Act shall be in the prescribed form and shall authorise the person to whom it is granted to employ workers on shift work either generally or subject to such conditions as the Minister may think fit to impose and to insert in such licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 86:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> At the end of the section, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nothing contained in a shift work licence granted in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall operate so as to disturb any agreement either expressed or implied relating to the hours of work, rates of pay or conditions of employment subsisting between the person to whom such licence is granted and the workers employed by such person.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to authorise the granting of a shift work licence it is only reasonable that when the employer is given certain rights, by reason of being excluded from the scope of certain sections of the Bill, that should not operate to disturb in any way existing agreements that were arrived at between employers and workers.  The granting of such a licence should not operate to reduce the standard of living of the workers, rates of wages or conditions of employment in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, but I do not see why it is necessary to insert such a provision here.  I do not know if the Deputy contemplates that that danger will arise.  Section 30 provides that the Minister may license an employer engaged in a particular form of industry to work the shift system, upon such conditions as he thinks it necessary to impose, in order to safeguard the position of the workers, or for any other reason.  I do not know why the Deputy contemplates that the power might be used to depress wages.  In any event, having inserted a previous amendment regarding consultation, this hardly becomes necessary.,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does.  You might have a position where, in respect of a certain form of industrial work, for a certain period it is within the scope of the Act, and consequently is obliged to conform to its provisions.  But some of these provisions might have been embodied in an agreement negotiated between workers and employers.  Subsequently, <Col N="1556" /> if the Minister issues a licence for shift work in respect of that form of industrial undertaking, I want to make sure, wherever the provisions of that agreement are to the advantage of the workers, even if some of them are part of the Act, that they will, at least, be preserved to the worker once it is shift work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to have this section in order to enable shift work to be practised in industries which may not be properly described as continuous process industries. Flour milling is a case in point.  It would be impossible to contend that flour milling is the type of industry which must be worked by continuous process.  It need not necessarily be worked in a continuous process, but that has been the practice. If we were to insist on day work in flour mills we would have to have three times as many flour mills as we have now, involving considerably higher costs.  Ordinarily flour mills would be licensed to operate the shift system, even though it is not a continuous process industry, but discretion is exercised.  Continuous process industries can work without reference to this, but in other industries this licence is required.  That is in accordance with the Convention. The intention is to enable industries where shift work has been the practice to continue to operate on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not 56, but 48. The irksome 81 hours in three weeks would come in if this licence was granted.  There may be a case in <Col N="1557" /> industry where a firm may have an arrangement that the conditions of employment provide that the workers will have a maximum working week of 44 hours, and the Minister may license that firm to undertake shift work, when they come within the category of Section 27.  The 44-hour week is gone then.  In that case, the test of their working hours is 48 hours&mdash;their hours should not exceed 48&mdash;averaged over a period of three weeks; and although they had formerly a 44-hour week in one particular week, in this Section 27 they would be required to work 81 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 87:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 2, before the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;male.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 provides what are to be the hours of work for male and female adult workers in industry, and the object of amendment No. 87 is to insert the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;adult&rdquo; in line 2 of Section 31 (1), so as to ensure that the hours fixed in the remainder of the section shall only apply to male workers.  There is a later amendment which will provide that, in respect of adult female workers, the hours of work shall terminate, in the case of week-days at 6 p.m., instead of the 8 p.m. in the section, and at 12 o'clock on Saturday instead of 1 p.m. as provided in the section.  There are further amendments, the object of which is to reduce the hours of work, although that is not exactly relevant to the matter we are <Col N="1559" /> now considering.  I think that, running right through the Bill, there has been a recognition that, in respect of female workers, we ought not to impose upon them the arduous conditions which are possible in respect of male workers under the Bill.  There has been recognition of the fact that it is desirable that the heaviest portion of the work should be done by male workers, and the Minister has even taken power to prevent the incursion of women into industries where it is thought that their employment is undesirable either in their own interests or in the national interests.  The object of amendment No. 87 is to provide that the hours of work set out in the section will apply to male workers so as to provide an early finishing hour in respect of women.  In other words, under the section a male workers' normal working day will not be continued after 8 p.m., on any ordinary working day, and it will not be continued after 1 p.m. on any short day. The object of the amendment is to ensure that, while these hours may apply in the case of male workers, in the case of female workers, their working day should end at 6 p.m. on ordinary days and at 12 noon on short days, instead of the 8 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively, provided in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that there is any point in this amendment at all. If there is any occupation in which, for any reason, women should not be employed, then the matter would be dealt with under Section 12.  If, however, it is decided that in any particular occupation the employment of women is unobjectionable, I see no reason why we should have different starting or finishing hours.  In any event, it would be impossible to operate a system in which you would have different starting or finishing hours for men and women in factories where both men and women were employed, as is the case in many if not the majority of factories.  I do think, however, that we should modify the section in respect of paragraph (a), which has to do with the commencing hour of work.  There will be a number <Col N="1560" /> of industries in which that cannot be operated.  I think we can make it a much earlier hour than 8 a.m.  The ordinary practice, of course, in this country is to start at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., but there is no reason why the statutory regulation should not permit of starting at an earlier hour.  Of course, in such cases, they will be subject to the same requirements in respect of the total number of working hours.  I propose, accordingly, to modify paragraph (a) so as permit of an earlier starting hour, but I see no reason for fixing a different finishing hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, Sir. I should like to call the Minister's attention to some points.  While we all could agree that starting at 8 a.m. and finishing at 8 p.m. was ample for an ordinary day, there are certain points about which I should like to ask the Minister.  I should like to know how he proposes to deal with them.  Take, for instance, travelling time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, here in Dublin there are a number of skilled workmen whom it is not easy to get in other parts of the country, and it might be quite possible that an employer would receive a wire from the very southwest of the country asking that a workman should be sent down to do a particular job. That would entail his starting by the mail train in the morning.  That occurs frequently.  Another point which I should like to put before the Minister is that it is quite conceivable that he might be travelling until after eight o'clock that night.  Is he to get off the conveyance when 8 p.m. is reached and sleep on the roadside?  I think the Minister ought to take into account the case of a workman travelling to or from a job.  I think that is the principal point arising on this section.  At the same time there are a couple of others which might arise.  It might quite easily happen that there was an evening train or bus starting, say, for the sake of argument, at 7.30 in the morning, which would allow the normal working hours to be carried out, and the man to come home.  There is another point in connection with which <Col N="1562" /> I should like to ask the Minister how it would be dealt with.  It is a case where an employer could only get permission for the workers to work at certain specified hours.  Would that be a case of a special permit?  I suppose it would be specially dealt with? Take for instance a case where a job had to be done in an office, which could only be done, say, for the sake of argument, after 8 p.m.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider those three points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended, as I have explained, to alter paragraph (a) by making an earlier start than 8 a.m. possible in certain cases.  The other cases seem to me, at first sight, to be cases which would be covered by regulations under Section 22, the excluding of certain forms of work or work done under certain conditions from the application of this section.  I will have that examined to see if it is necessary to make any special provision for that in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendments are taken to this section I should like to explain to the Dáil that it is intended to recast the section to a considerable extent.  The section provides that, in respect of overtime, regulations shall be made.  That is in accordance with the International Convention, but having regard to the circumstances in this country, and representations which have been made by particular industries, it seems to me that it is going to be very difficult to deal with matters of overtime by regulation, and I contemplate instead introducing a section which will permit of certain periods of overtime being worked in the course of a year, expressed, as I see it at present, in a percentage of the work permissible under the Bill being worked by way of overtime in the course of a month or a year.  Generally, it will make it possible for employers to avail of that overtime condition when circumstances arise, subject to the obligation to pay overtime rates and so forth.  I think it will be found easier from the administrative <Col N="1563" /> point of view to operate an overtime condition of that kind rather than to undertake the duty of making special regulations for the authorisation of overtime in particular industries. Therefore, discussion upon this section might, perhaps, be left over to the next stage, when the amending section will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say in reply to the Minister that at first sight that percentage would appear to meet a certain number of difficulties, because while most employers are opposed to overtime in principle they find that it is the lesser of two evils.  To my mind the Minister's idea of a percentage would separate the employer who was trying to get two men to do the work of three by working overtime from the employer who genuinely found cases of emergency arising from time to time, which could not be got over by getting in temporary workers, who possibly knew nothing about the particular form of work, or the place in which they had to carry it out.</P>

      <P>You would have to have two or three percentages.  You would have to provide for not more than, say, 20 per cent. in a week or 10 per cent. in a year, with perhaps even an intermediate percentage in a month, so that you would allow an employer to deal with particular rushes of work arising at certain times of the year, but subject to an overriding maximum in respect of a whole year.  The suggestions that have been made are 20 per cent. in a week or 10 per cent. in a year.  I am not saying that those would be the final figures introduced; they would be something about that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 98:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 33 to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Save as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this Act shall apply and have effect <i>mutatis mutandis</i> in relation to the employment of persons employed as night watchmen in an industrial undertaking.  In its application to the employment of night watchman, the provisions of this Act, relating <Col N="1565" /> to the time at which such employment may lawfully commence and terminate on any day and the provisions relating to the meal interval, the short day, the limitation of the working hours, intervals in work, public holidays and Sundays shall cease to have effect and in lieu thereof the following provisions shall apply, that is to say, no person under twenty-one years of age shall be employed as a night watchman and every night watchman shall be entitled to twenty-four hours continuous rest in each period of seven days and shall be paid in respect of time worked in excess of forty-two hours in any week at the over-time rate.  For the purpose of this section the expression &ldquo;overtime rate&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in Section 36 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any employer acts in contravention of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to deal with the position of a night watchman in an industrial undertaking.  I take it from the provisions of the Bill that a night watchman, even if employed in an industrial undertaking, would not come within the scope of the Bill because he is not engaged in the particular form of industrial work referred to in the Bill, and &ldquo;watching&rdquo; would hardly be described as industrial work under the Bill.  If there is an industrial operation being performed, and as part of that industrial operation it is desirable to leave some person there to watch the implements, and to take care that no accident is caused arising out of that industrial work, and that the worker is dealing with the tools common to this particular industrial operation so that his general line of work can be described as ancillary to that kind of industrial operation.  I think this is as convenient a Bill to bring him into as any other Bill may be.  The amendment is specially drawn to ensure that a watchman in an industrial undertaking is a person entitled to benefit.  It is particularly related <Col N="1566" /> to that kind of watchman rather than to a watchman, say, in a bank or a commercial establishment.  I think the Minister will be aware of the fact that the hours worked by a watchman are at present extremely long.  The work of watching at present consists of the imposition of an endurance test on those so employed.  It may be alleged of course that some of them sleep for portions of the time, but I do not think the Legislature ought to envy sleep in the circumstances under which it is enjoyed by a night watchman, particularly in the winter period of the year, and persons who follow this occupation have not a passport to get employment in the summer periods only, when perhaps sleep under such circumstances might appeal to many members of this House.  I think the provision as to a 42-hour week will hardly now be applied in view of a previous decision, but at all events there is a case for bringing night watchmen in an industrial establishment within the scope of this Bill.  I think they will fit into it much more conveniently perhaps than into another Bill which may not be dealing so specifically with industrial employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy.  I do not think there is any similarity between the work done by a night watchman and the work of an industrial worker.  I do not think there is, in respect of such people, the same obligation to protect them in the way of hours of work, holidays, rest intervals and so on.  It may be necessary at some stage to regulate their conditions of employment, but it will be an entirely different basis to industrial work proper, which is obviously much more wearying and strenuous on the individual than the work of a night watchman.</P>

      <P>It is not strenuous?  I am glad the Minister has entered into the domain of industrial fatigue research. To suggest it is not strenuous for a watchman to start work about six or seven o'clock in the evening and watch until eight o'clock in the morning, and do that for seven days a week, in such a month, for instance, as November, and to suggest that a person employed for these long hours, compelled to disorder his life from the standpoint of sleep, is not engaged in a strenuous occupation, will, I think, flabbergast most people who have any experience of these workers.  These night watchmen are compelled to work exceptionally long hours under conditions which are by no means such as to make even the Minister envious.  I think there is a strong case for the curtailment of the long hours which night watchmen are compelled to work. If the Minister is not willing to do it in this Bill, I would like to know what he proposes to do in respect of that category of workers, with what general group of workers does he propose to classify them and in what particular way.  I disagree completely with the Minister when he says that night watchmen's work is not strenuous.  I think it is strenuous.  Anything that keeps a worker out of his bed during the night is obviously a strenuous occupation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are dealing with the working hours of young persons in industry, and under the definition section, a young person means a worker whose age is less than 18 and more than 14.  This particular section has effect in its application to persons between the ages of 14 and 18 years.  Under this section it is possible for such a young person to be employed up to 8 p.m. every day, and 1 p.m. on the <Col N="1569" /> short day.  There may be a difference of opinion as to whether there is much real value between 12 noon and 1 p.m. on a short day, but I think there is a decided social advantage for young persons to be enabled to be off at 6 o'clock in the evening instead of 8 o'clock, as suggested in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be possible to employ a young person up to 8 p.m., no matter at what time that person starts work.  It is desirable to encourage such persons to get the maximum amount of recreation possible.  Generally speaking, the evening is the time at which that recreation can be most conveniently obtained.  It is desirable to encourage young persons to continue studies or attendance at educational classes of one kind or another.  If such persons are required to work to 8 p.m., or are not prohibited from working after 6 p.m., these two desirable objectives are interfered with.  The Minister has rightly taken the view that young persons require to be dealt with in a very special way, and you cannot apply the ordinary industrial standards to them. I think the Minister might go further, and agree to substitute 6 for 8 p.m. in the section.  If he does that he will be facilitating two desirable objectives, the pursuance of further educational training and making available to young persons between 14 and 18 years recreation which, it is generally admitted, can only be obtained in the evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has made any case for the amendment.  He is again making the mistake of assuming that what we fix as the outside limit of working conditions are going to be, in fact, the normal conditions.  The section says a young person cannot be employed for more than eight hours a day or 40 <Col N="1570" /> hours a week, and must not be employed after 8 p.m. on any day.  In practice the ordinary working day will end much earlier than 8 p.m. for young persons, and I see no reason why we should have a different provision in this instance.  There is no special need for such special provision, having regard to the fact that the working week is 40 hours and the working day is eight hours.</P>

I think from the point of view of our chief objective&mdash;recreation and education&mdash;there are advantages in releasing a person earlier.  If that person is brought into work earlier there is an advantage.  But I do not think there is the same advantage to the employer in bringing a person in earlier in the morning.  It might suit the convenience of the employer to have the young person brought in later and to have him set to work later. But we should set our faces against that in order to facilitate the opportunities for education and recreation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section fixes the maximum working week for young persons at 40 hours. We must bear in mind that &ldquo;young persons,&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill, are persons between the ages of 14 and 18 years.  The Legislature is now saying that it is desirable that a vigorous full grown man in the prime of life should not be asked to work more than 48 hours in the week.  But it is going to ask a young child of 14 to 18 years, a person undeveloped, just in an adolescent state, to work 40 hours per week. I think the fixation of 40 hours for a young person between 14 and 18 years of age is altogether too long.  If the State says that 48 hours is the maximum that a healthy man should be asked to work, then 40 hours is much too long for a young person.  I ask Deputies to remember that we are dealing with the future citizens whose physique should be a precious possession to the nation.  We should not bring these young persons in close contact with such violent impact with modern industrial life for 40 hours a week.  The maximum should be 35 hours for young persons.  If we are going to say that it is desirable to limit the control of the employment of young persons in industrial life, it is desirable to restrict their employment much more than is provided in this section. I hope the Minister will tell the House that he does not stand for asking young persons to work a 40 hour week under modern industrial conditions where you have rationalisation and all the modern speeding up processes that former generations have never known. These conditions are bound to be ruinous to the health of the young persons if the hours are 40 a week.  I think 35 hours a week is more than sufficient.  My only doubt is as to <Col N="1573" /> whether a 35 hour week is too long in respect of young persons.  The House should make provision for having the hours less than 40.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton seems to think that the rising generation are very tender sprouts.  He even doubts whether a 35 hour week is too long.  I see no objection to asking young persons to work a 40 hour week; it is a substantial reduction.  When I started working I was only 14 years of age, and I worked 56 hours a week; I do not say that my work was too unduly arduous or that the work had any very great injurious effect upon my health.  By this Bill we are reducing the hours from 48 to 40, and I think there are very few young persons who will not stagger through a 40 hour week.</P>

      <P>No; what I meant to say was that I do not think there is any occupation in which young persons will not be able to go through a 40 hour week without any bad effect on their health.  I read in the papers last week that the American boxer who entered the ring with Jack Doyle was only 17 years of age, and people of that kind must be considered as well as the tender, delicate people about whom Deputy Norton is so much concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would prefer to do any sort of hard work rather than to enter the ring against a boxer like Jack Doyle.  At all events, to my mind the position, as far as the Deputy is concerned, is this, that if I had made it 35 instead of 40 the Deputy would have put down an amendment to reduce the 35 to 30.  No matter what figure I put down, the Deputy would be trying to go one better.  The Deputy knows that 40 hours is a great improvement on present conditions, and that it is not at all too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not approach this thing at all in the light-hearted manner in which the Minister seems to <Col N="1574" /> approach it.  We are dealing with a position where the State says that the adult male worker, fully developed physically and mentally, shall not be required to work more than 48 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for physical reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say for physical reasons.  If the Minister wants the reasons, I presume they are social, national and economic.  It is assumed that 48 hours per week is the maximum desirable, having regard to these factors, to permit an adult male worker to work.  When we are fixing 48 hours per week for such persons we have in mind that, in fact, it is generally recognised, without regard to these factors which we take cognisance of in fixing the hours in this Bill, that 48 hours per week is as much as you could reasonably ask a person to work in existing circumstances in these particular industries, because these hours of work have been fixed without any particular regard to social, national or economic conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These hours of work which exist at present&mdash;48 hours per week and, in many cases, substantially less than 48 hours&mdash;have been fixed as a result, in the main, of a trial of strength between the employers, on the one hand and the workers, on the other hand.  We can, therefore, say that, generally speaking, whatever hours of work exist at present have been arbitrarily fixed, the consideration in fixing them largely being a trial of strength between the employers, on the one hand, and the workers on the other hand.  But if we fix a maximum working week of 48 hours for adult male workers in the prime of life, I say that we are not acting fairly towards the young persons between 14 and 18 years of age in fixing a working week of 40 hours, because it bears too close a relationship to the maximum hours which are permitted in the case of adult male workers.  If 48 hours is considered to be the maximum for which we ought to employ an adult male worker, then I think the hours of work for persons less than 18 years of age and over 14 years of age should <Col N="1575" /> be something less than 40 hours per week.  There is nothing very new or very novel in asking for a working week of 35 hours in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think if the Minister asks his advisers, he will discover European precedent for young workers being treated specially in the case of employment. The whole Bill itself recognises the special claims of young persons in industry.  I say that 40 hours is much too long for a working week, and that 35 hours is adequate, not merely having regard to industrial requirements, but having regard to the desirability of promoting healthy citizenship in future. The Minister quoted cases of persons who went into employment at 14 years of age, and feel all the better now. The Minister seems to think that because he entered employment when he was 14 years of age, he is now the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 35 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 34.</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister, if he is satisfied that young persons employed to do any form of industrial work are so employed as assistants to adult workers and that the work of such adult workers could not proceed if such young persons did not work for the same hours as such adult workers, may by order make regulations in accordance with this section directing that young persons while doing such form of industrial work shall be deemed to be adult workers for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall not make regulations in respect of any form of industrial work under this section unless he has first consulted with persons who in his opinion are representative of employers interested in such form of industrial work and with persons who in his opinion are representative of workers so interested.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever regulations made under and in accordance with this section are for the time being in force the young persons to whom such regulations relate shall be deemed to be adult workers for the purposes of this Act while doing the form of industrial work in respect of which such regulations are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 103.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 26 and 31, before the word &ldquo;young&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; in each line.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the section in which power is taken to extend the hours of employment of any young person.  The State, in Section 33, is taking the view that certain hours of work ought to be the normal hours, but there is power taken in Section 34 to extend the hours of young persons.  I want, in this amendment, to secure that the young persons whose hours are extended will be male rather than female persons.  Perhaps, a case might be made for the young male worker to see the whole process of the adult worker in respect of his trade; but I do not think that the same case could be made in respect of females, so that where we are dealing with an exceptional position here we ought, I think, to make the section applicable to males and not to females, and in that way limit the extension purpose of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why, if it is desirable that this power should be exercised at all in relation to male juvenile workers, it should not extend to females as well.  The extension can only have effect if the Minister is satisfied that the young persons are employed as assistants to adult workers, and that the work of such adult workers could not be proceeded with if the young persons did not work the same hours as the adults.  That can apply in the case of females as well as males.  Whatever case might exist for the extension of the hours of male juvenile workers, the same case can be made in respect of female juveniles in corresponding circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the effect of the <Col N="1579" /> extension under this section will be that the Minister will be bombarded with requests that young persons should be allowed to work abnormally long hours, and not the normal hours suggested in Section 33.  And, in a choice of that kind, the employer will naturally want to work for the longest hours the labour which is cheapest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation can only be made if the work of the adult could not be proceeded with without the assistance of the juvenile, and before the regulations are made the Minister must consult the representatives of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that, in respect of this extension, there is enormous scope for all kinds of pressure to be brought to bear upon the Minister to consent to the extension of the hours of young persons.  If we are fixing in Section 33 certain maximum hours of work, I think it is undesirable that we should open the door to what I fear will be wholesale exemptions to the normal hours as defined in Section 33.  The object of the amendment is to limit the kind of persons whose hours can be so extended and a later amendment is designed to restrict the number of persons whose hours can be so extended, having regard to the age of the person.  If the section were going to be used only in very extreme or exceptional circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My fear is that, as it is drawn and as it is expressed here, the Minister, as a matter of course, will have pressure brought to bear upon him to exclude certain young workers from the scope of this Bill, because if employers have been used to having young workers working the same hours as others, I think that there would naturally be an attempt to create an agitation if the young workers are permitted to cease work some hours before the adult workers. In that way, I think a situation would <Col N="1580" /> be created in which the Minister will find it difficult to resist that particular kind of pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no difficulty in resisting that kind of pressure unless it can be shown, and shown in the presence of the representatives of the workers, that it is necessary that the juvenile worker should work the same hours as the adult worker, to enable the work of the adult worker to be done at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what he has in mind in granting these extensions?  It is quite possible that it may not be shown that it is necessary to employ all the young workers up to the same hours as the adult workers.  It may be necessary to employ only a small number to assist such adults whose work is not yet finished; in other words, the adults who will work longer than the young persons referred to in the section. Confronted with circumstances of that kind, will the Minister say what he proposes to do in granting the exemptions? Is there to be a permit to the employer to select whom he likes to remain on or is any preference going to be given by the Minister in respect of retaining the older of the young workers rather than any persons whom the employer might care to select, irrespective of their ages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The power in this section is not exercisable by way of permit given to a particular employer but by way of regulations made covering forms of industrial work.  The circumstances will arise that in some industry it was demonstrated and agreed that the working of juvenile workers for a 48-hour week was necessary to enable work to be done at all by adult workers up to 48 hours.  In such a case, a regulation would be made in respect of that particular industrial work, enabling young persons to be so employed up to 48 hours.</P>

      <P>I scarcely think so, from what I know of it.  I do not profess to be familiar with the details of every industry.  What we intend to provide is that where young persons are employed as workers, in the ordinary way, to do work which is required to be done, and which can be done by young persons, the ordinary working week should be 40 hours, but where a young person is employed, the work being performed, in the main, by adult workers, if it is necessary to do so, we can grant an extension of the juvenile working time.</P>

It was contended that there might be difficulty in some industries if certain juvenile workers had a 40-hour and others a 48-hour week, and that there might be difficulties created in respect of rates of pay and that sort of thing, having regard to the fact that the reduction to 40 hours must not reduce the wages of the workers whose hours are so reduced.  I have not had any representations on other grounds that this section would be difficult to work, nor have I had any indications that many applications under it are likely to be made.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us what is the meaning of sub-section (2) of this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy's difficulty is.  The section provides that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>where in any week any employer who employs any worker to do industrial work for a salary or wages, permits any worker to work weekly overtime, and the weekly overtime worked by such worker exceeds the total daily overtime worked by such <Col N="1585" /> worker in that week, such employer shall be deemed to have agreed to pay such worker at the overtime rate for the amount of time which is the difference between such total and such weekly overtime in addition to any other remuneration which such worker may be entitled to receive for such daily overtime.</P>
    <P>It is possible to have, under the provisions of the Bill, a daily overtime and a weekly overtime.  If the weekly overtime exceeds the daily overtime, then in respect of that additional overtime the employer must pay at the overtime rate.  It is a somewhat complicated provision, but if I knew what the Deputy's difficulty was I could explain it to him more clearly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say for the sake of argument that there is a 44-hour week.  The worker has worked, say, 50 hours.  That means that he has worked six hours at the overtime rate, according to the weekly calculation.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Deputy this example: A person may work overtime on one day.  We maintain that in respect of the overtime worked on that day the person shall be entitled to be paid at the overtime rate, even though on the next day he worked short time, and even though the total of the weekly hours is not exceeded.  Similarly, you could have a person working within the limits prescribed for each day, but nevertheless exceeding the weekly number of hours permitted. Therefore in respect of these additional hours overtime rate will also be paid.</P>

Say that a worker works ten hours for five days of the week, and for five hours on a Saturday.  His daily overtime amounts to ten hours, and his <Col N="1586" /> weekly overtime to seven hours.  What overtime would that person be paid having regard to the terms of sub-section (2) of Section 36?</P>

      <P>Supposing a person works ten hours a day for five days, and on Saturday works five hours.  His daily overtime is two hours per day, and his weekly overtime seven hours. How many hours overtime would be paid for, having regard to the construction of the sub-section?</P>

What is intended to be provided is that even though the daily hours permitted to be worked by a worker are not exceeded, nevertheless if the total for the week exceeds the weekly hours permitted, overtime must be paid.  That would still apply even though the worker had exceeded on one or two days the daily hours and would be paid overtime in respect of the hours worked on these days.</P>

      <P>(a)  processes in which reverberatory or regenerative furnaces are used for the manufacture of iron and steel and the galvanising of sheet metal or wire (except the pickling process):</P>

Will the Minister say what case can be made for the employment of young persons between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.  While it might appear that the object of the section is to restrict the employment of young persons at night, sub-section (1), in fact, permits of their employment at night.</P>

Unless this is for the purpose of meeting the case of an assistant or of an improver who needs to add to his knowledge, there is no case for the employment of young people at night.  Had the Minister, before agreeing to put this section into the Bill, any representations made to him as to the necessity for it?  The Minister ought to give some of the reasons which prompted him to insert this section.  Unless it is absolutely necessary, it is, in my opinion, undesirable that young persons of 16 or even 18 should be obliged to work at night.

I think, in connection with a section of this kind, the Minister should give us some more information than he has given.  I observe that power is being taken to employ young persons over 16 years in &ldquo;gold mining reduction work.&rdquo; Quite apart from the fact that that kind of work is now of unusual importance in this country, this seems to me to be a sort of blanketing authority for the Minister.</P>

Still it goes in.  That is no reason why the Swiss should copy it when they are implementing the convention.</P>

      <P>There are certain advantages available at Geneva by so doing.  The Minister did not ratify a lot of other conventions.  He was keen on ratifying the convention with regard to the prohibition of opium but he did not ratify a lot of other conventions more important than the opium convention.  The Minister is taking this provision out of an existing Act and putting it into this Bill so that he may be armed with wide powers to the use of which he has not, apparently, given much consideration. It seems to me that the whole case for this section is not based on need but on the fact that it was in an existing <Col N="1594" /> Act and, therefore, should be put into this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my remarks last night I pointed out to the Minister that the fact that they had endeavoured to meet their ordinary obligations reasonably and honestly as far as they could was far from being a cause why this tax should be imposed upon them.  I want to emphasise that point.  I want to emphasise the point that when a <Col N="1599" /> country and the inhabitants of a country, and especially the poorer inhabitants of a country, have been impoverished by the actions of the Government and by the general policy of the Government, the fact that they have stinted themselves in order to meet public obligations, such as rates and taxes is no reason on earth for imposing further taxes, as the Minister suggests, but is a good reason to the contrary why the Government should not impose further obligations upon them.  I go further than that and I say that, if the condition of affairs in this country is this&mdash;and it seems to be so&mdash;that the Ministry has so impoverished this State; has brought this State into such a condition as the Minister for Finance in his opening Budget statement admitted; has brought this country into such a condition that other sources of revenue are dried up and cannot be taxed any further; then, rather than put these taxes upon the necessaries of life; rather than put these extra burdens upon the poverty-stricken people of this country; rather than make, as these extra taxes will make, people go without the necessities of life; it would be better, much as I hate borrowing, much as I hate the idea of a Government balancing its Budget by means of borrowing, to openly borrow. I say that it would be better and I say it would be fairer, rather than to deprive the poorer sections of this community of things which were absolutely necessary for them in order to preserve life, to make up the Budget deficit by openly borrowing, I say that it would be far better to do that than to impose this 4d. duty upon tea.  We are being challenged as to what alternatives there are.  The Minister has been regularly appealing to us and going down on his knees to us and to the whole House to tell him, for goodness sake, what he can do to avoid imposing this tax on tea, this tax on sugar, this tax on flour, and the taxes on the other necessities of life.  What is the use of the Minister now objecting; what is the sense of his objecting when I say to him that, if he has so mismanaged, as he has <Col N="1600" /> mismanaged, the finances of this State that he is driven to putting these taxes on the very necessities of life, it would be better for him to openly admit his mismanagement and, rather than crush down these unfortunate people by these taxes which he is putting on the very necessities of life, that it would be better for him to openly admit his faults and balance his Budget by borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We get back to the early hopes of the Minister for Finance in all this.  In 1932, the Minister decided that, as between sugar and tea, sugar was an absolute necessity of life and was of very high food value, and that a tax on sugar was what he described as &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax, and one that imposed an undue increase on the cost of living.  On the other hand, tea, in his opinion, had very little value as food, was not a necessity of life, and that a tax on it was what might be described as a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax, as a tax which need not necessarily involve a diminution in consumption or an increase in the amount spent upon the commodity. He went to to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The poor can adjust themselves to it more easily than through a tax upon sugar.  They will not have to pay more for tea, and I have no doubt that with a tax on tea we shall have enterprising grocers proclaiming to the public that their &lsquo;2/8 tea is still 2/8.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might make the comment on that that although they were still charging 2/8 for tea, whether or not it was the old tea is a matter that we will leave to be found out by trial or a little bit of error.  Last year there was a reduction of 4d. in the lb. in the duty on tea, and the Minister prided himself on the fact that that was possible.  Now, this year, we are up against a new situation: the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax has got to go on, and with it the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax.  Again, this has all got to be considered in the context of the taxes generally on the necessities of life.  One might not have quarrelled with the Minister if, driven and harassed by circumstances, he should have had to resort to a tax on <Col N="1601" /> tea; but that he should have also to impose this tax once more&mdash;the tax which he prided himself on taking off &mdash;in the same year in which he is putting additional taxation on the people for sugar, bread, flour, and so on, is a thing that the Minister will find it hard to explain.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that it would be better, in these circumstances, to borrow openly, and to admit that the Budget cannot balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This, Sir, has all been decided upon on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, as a criticism of a tax on tea specially, that it would be much better to admit failure openly rather than to say: &ldquo;We will cloak failure by putting on again what we have previously described as a &lsquo;soft&rsquo; tax.&rdquo;  It is quite clear what the situation is when, in the year in which the Minister has found himself driven to taxation of the necessities of life and having wrung a huge amount from what he described as the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax and from other taxes on the wants of the people, he should then have to load up the burdens by retaxing the people in this matter of tea.  That not merely argues, but proves in a most conclusive way&mdash; and it will be brought home strikingly to the people of the country, and to the poor first&mdash;what the present financial situation is.  I do not agree with him that the tea tax is a soft tax.  I would say this, that as between the tea and sugar taxation the scope of the sugar tax is rather ill-defined, because it comes into so many other things, molasses, syrups, jams and so on; whereas, at any rate, you can get the impact of the tea tax in a very clear way.  You can get the incidence of the tax in a very clear and precise way, but it cannot be said to be a soft tax when one is thinking in terms of those who can bear taxation less than others can.  From that angle, it is a tax which is definitely going to mean great hardship on certain people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister would need the help of many of those who are not just so accustomed to town life as <Col N="1602" /> himself to find out that there are great stretches of the countryside, particularly in the west, in which the main article, the article that is, at any rate, used most in the way of liquid, is tea. It is a well-known fact, although it sometimes strikes economists as being a peculiar fact, that there are certain very poor areas in the West of Ireland where of all the items that form the family budget most money is spent on tea, and that, relative to the circumstances of the people, teas of exceptionally good quality are purchased for consumption in those areas.  Although that is commented on by economists as being a peculiar thing, simply judging from the angle of the amount paid for it, the truth of the answer has been spoken to by very many people who know those areas&mdash;that in those areas the people do spend a very big amount of money on tea because they regard it as the main foodstuff; they have got used to it.  I do not say that its food value in itself can be regarded as very high, but the people have got used to it, and it enters more into their ordinary budget and into their ordinary daily routine of life than any other article.  They are inclined to pay more in order to satiate that particular choice of theirs.  Many persons, travellers, clergymen and inspectors of different types who travel around the west of this country, will tell you that the people there set as much store by tea as, judging by the advertisements, certain workers in industrial capacities set store by beer in other countries.  It is essentially a tax that is going to weigh with great severity upon those who live in the poor parts of the western side of this country.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to describe it as a soft tax.  Of course the Minister did not believe in that phrase, but it was a phrase that attracted him just because of the jingle, and because he thought at the time that he could make some case in regard to the change-over.  He was not saving any money by the change-over nor was he losing any by the change when he made it in 1932, but there was an attractive jingle about the phrase &ldquo;soft tax,&rdquo; and now he arrives back again at a position that <Col N="1603" /> was not here since the clearing up period just after the British left, in which we were going to have both the heavy tax on sugar and the old tax back again on tea.  I suppose in these days we have what never was there, either in the British times or in the clearing-up period when all the promotion expenses of the State had to be met; in addition to those two taxes we have an extra tax on bread and butter. The Minister may balance his Budget by those means, but, of course, the tendency towards unbalancing is there the whole time, marked by this tax. As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny has said, the ordinary sources of revenue have dried up.  We are getting now, in the words of Deputy Corry, to taxing necessities which the people must eat and drink.  Therefore, they cannot get away from this kind of indirect taxation.  The Minister simply must slam the taxes on whatever it is that people sustain their lives by, because then they cannot avoid them.  At any rate, he may get his taxes in this year, but he will by degrees weaken even this source of taxation by pressing too heavily on the people who use this commodity.  Even if the Minister could escape with some sort of fantastic borrowing this year he must see that the end is in sight, and that even taxes on necessities will defeat their own purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking in the House and outside the House in defence of this tea tax, the Minister says to those who want to maintain the social services provided last year, and to provide an additional £250,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, that we must swallow this tea and sugar tax for the purpose of making up the money for widows' and orphans' pensions.  We have the Minister and his colleagues speaking in different voices regarding the manner in which money is to be raised for the maintenance of social services.  We have them taxing coal to raise £600,000, and taxing the consumers of butter to subsidise the dairying industry, and here we find them putting a direct tax on the necessaries of life, tea and sugar&mdash;those are absolute necessaries of life to people in <Col N="1604" /> the rural areas&mdash;in order, as he thinks, to provide for widows' and orphans' pensions.  When we raised the question of the proposed reduction of £200,000 in the amount of money for the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and the question of the £100,000 proposed to be saved in the administration of the old age pensions, we were told, again in another voice from the same person, that this is money that must be found, and must be found in this way, in order to provide pensions for widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to follow the Minister and his colleagues when they speak in different voices in defining this particular tax, and also in defining the economies in the existing social services. I cannot understand the mentality of the Minister who says: &ldquo;We must tax the widows and orphans&rdquo;&mdash; who ordinarily must use, and always will use tea and sugar as long as they have money to get it&mdash;&ldquo;in order to provide pensions for themselves.&rdquo; They apply the same policy to the people who are entitled to receive the old age pensions.  The President, speaking on the Second Reading debate of the Finance Bill, admitted quite definitely that a very big percentage of the large sum&mdash;between £500,000 and £600,000&mdash; raised for the payment of cattle bounties has not been finding its way to the people for whom it was intended. Supposing 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of the £500,000 or £600,000 is going in the wrong direction, and is subsidising people for whom it was never intended, I suggest to the Minister that he would be quite justified, in view of the admission made by the President, in cutting the bounties by the amount which he believes is not finding its way to the livestock producers in this country, and thereby find the money which he is now trying to find by penalising the poorest of the poor through a tax on tea and sugar.  That is a definite suggestion which I am now putting to the Minister, and to which I should like to hear an answer, especially in view of the President's admission.  Why should the taxpayers of this country find increasing sums, as they will be <Col N="1605" /> expected to find in the coming year, in view of the meaning of the coal-cattle pact, for additional cattle bounties which the President admits are not going to the people for whom those bounties are intended, while at the same time the Minister stands up here in this House to defend a tea and sugar tax which is penalising the poorest of the poor?  The members of this Party will vote against this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin is quite right when he draws attention to the fact that you do not tax the very poor, and the widows, in order to provide pensions for widows.  This is not a social services tax; it is a war tax, and nothing else but a war tax. That part of the last ten years that preceded the coming into office of the Fianna Fáil Government showed the tradition that would be natural in this country in respect of taxation. About £1,500,000 in taxation that was on sugar when the last Administration took over office was removed during that period and the tax on tea was completely wiped out.  That shows the tradition that would be natural, the procedure that would be natural in this country in the matter of taxation if there was not a war on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister walked into a war situation in 1932 and the tea tax was imposed.  That war has been carried on for a couple of years and it induced the Minister, when he was framing his Budget for this year, to enter the houses of the poorer persons &mdash;&mdash;to enter, for example, the house of the average civil servant whose wages he quoted to the Dáil the other day.  It induced him to look around that house to see what could be taxed.  He had already taxed to some extent the sugar that was being used; he had raised the price of bacon by his Excise duty on bacon; he was raising the price of all the food commodities he could lay hands upon, and he had to go to the house to look around and to see what further articles he could tax.  When he had sized up what he could get out of linoleum, wallpapers, window glass, and even the mugs on the dresser, he <Col N="1606" /> had to look into the tea-caddy and he said &ldquo;I can get £400,000 out of this.&rdquo; Then he started to pinch the £400,000, and the Ministerial Party is so much aware of what it really means that members of it have been stumping County Dublin telling untruths about the tea tax.  The Ministerial propaganda with regard to the tea tax is: &ldquo;We took it off last year; how could we take it off if our predecessors had not put it on?&rdquo;  A word of truth on the subject was almost sufficient to break up a Fianna Fáil meeting. The Minister for Finance was able to take off the tea tax because it had been put on the year before.  It goes on now simply to carry on a war situation.</P>
    <P>The moneys raised in this way are simply going down the sewer and neither social services nor Government institutions nor any aspect of the everyday life of the people will be bettered by the way in which the money raised through this tea tax is to be spent.  All that will happen is that the people are going to be poorer by reason of a tax that is taken, I will not say in a flat rate from the whole population, but in a rate which, if it varies at all, varies in heaviness on the poorer side.  I am sure there is more tea on the average consumed in some of the poorer houses throughout the country and in the cities and towns than in the richer homes, so that the main incidence of the tax on tea falls on the poor.  Therefore, the Minister has to concoct untruths for his Party to spread through the country in order to hide what the situation really is.</P>
    <P>Taxation of this type, linked to the kind of taxation put on food and on the petty articles in the home, should show Deputies here the extremities to which the Minister is driven in order to keep some kind of appearance on the finances of the State and the extremities to which he is prepared to go, no matter how much at the cost of the poorer classes, to keep up a pretence. What is he keeping it up for? The Minister cannot tell the House that he sees where he is going; he cannot tell the ordinary rank and file, <Col N="1607" /> the poorer classes where he is leading them.  Yet he continues taking money out of their pockets.  It has been mentioned here that in some parts of the country tea is very much used and that until the Fianna Fáil Party put the tax on tea in 1932 a very high standard of tea used to be used.  If the Minister has any connection with the tea trade he will know that after the Fianna Fáil tax was put on, when the tax was re-imposed after seven or eight years, following the time it was made free of duty, there was a tremendous fall in the standard of tea that was used in the West of Ireland. People who were accustomed to buy tea at 3/- and 3/4 a lb. fell within a couple of months to tea at 1/6 a lb. To that extent the standard of living in the West of Ireland was reduced in 1932 and 1933.  Now, that position is being worked back to, simply because the Minister is forced to look in every direction in order to get money to carry on his war.</P>
    <P>We oppose this tax, in the first place, because it is absolutely wrong and unsound and because it is taxation, the greater part of which falls on the poor; and we oppose it in the second place because it is indicative of the whole line of policy of the Minister, that it does not tend to develop social services, that it does not make in any way the national or the economic life of the people stable, and because it is leading to the very definitely unstable future that a war situation usually brings.</P>

      <P>The tax on tea has brought home to the ordinary people in the rural districts what this economic war means.  The poorest in the land now have a realisation of how high the cost of government can be. In Dublin, for some reason or other, whether it is because of the artificial prosperity or for other reasons, the attack on the breakfast table, particularly the tea tax, does not seem to have caused as much antagonism to the Government's policy as there exists in the country.  As regards the people in the country, if there is one <Col N="1608" /> thing that has made them take an interest in Government it is the tea tax.  I have heard it said that the late Kevin O'Higgins declared that until there was a change of Government the ordinary country people would not think politically.  They are going to think politically in future because this tea tax, accompanied by many other taxes, has made the poor in the community, the ordinary plain people, realise that they are now brought into a war which is not a decent war nor an honest war. That is a fight in which the people mulcted by a tax on tea, and it is for the purpose of carrying on what they are beginning to realise now is all humbug and claptrap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling attention to the fact that this is the second time in the course of this debate on a most important tax in which the Minister has treated the House with gross disrespect.  He has not even attempted to put before the House the Government case for this tax.  That may be technically correct, but it is grossly and entirely wrong.  The Minister has shown a complete contempt for the Parliamentary institutions, and it is on these grounds that I protest against his action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to supplement what I previously said. When speaking on the previous stages on this Budget, I did indicate a curiosity as to what tax would be of the most clastic nature; what, for instance, were the taxes that could be enlarged and the yield from which could be increased by administrative action.  We know that under administrative action, in the case of the Unemployment Assistance Act and the Old Age Pensions Act, the Government are going to save some money.  Clearly, this tea tax has been introduced for a second purpose. We know that the Minister thinks that the tea tax is a soft tax.  We know also that, notwithstanding the Minister's more or less subdued mood in his Budget speech, the Revenue returns have been shockingly disappointing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of this tax is in order.  The Minister said it was a soft tax, a tax that would not hurt very much if he increased it.  I suggest that the reason it has been introduced is not for the immediate amount it is going to bring in but with an eye on the future.  If there had been no tea tax in this year's Budget there would have to be the bringing in of a half-yearly supplement.  And merely to increase something that is there already will appear to the Minister not to be so bad.  The Minister has the view that this tea tax does not matter.  The 2/8 tea will still be 2/8, regardless of what the consumer will get for the 2/8.  That is another matter. I want to put this to the Minister that his scheme in introducing this tax goes far beyond merely the amount that he was to get in and that there is clearly going to be an autumn Budget in which this tax will be definitely increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever may be the Minister's views about the quality of the tax, it is quite clear from this year's Budget, from this Resolution, from this particular section, and from what we discussed last night, that the country is going to get hit hard and soft.  As far as the Minister is concerned, he is not going to let the people escape.  He is going to skin them alive in every fashion.  One thing, so far as this tax is concerned, is that it may be that it does appeal to the Minister that the quality of the tea can be degraded.  I have no doubt that that is the point, and if the people are fooled the Minister will be satisfied that once more the people will have to be deceived.  The people will have to pay and pay.  But I would remind the Minister that once more the Government will have taken a very definite step and a deciding step towards lowering the standard of living.  I admit that that is their proclaimed aim.  It is the old policy of hair-shirts for all.  You are advancing to it, and advancing to it with remarkable rapidity.  You have listened here and you have been told that this is a tax which can be avoided. It can to this extent: The people can more or less adjust the balance where they are concerned by a lowering of the standard of living and by getting a <Col N="1611" /> poorer quality of tea.  It is easy to understand why taxes of this kind should appeal to city men, to men who have no knowledge whatsoever of the country.  I notice that three-fourths of the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party in the House at present are city men. I cannot speak for the remaining backward quarter.  There are four in the House listening to the discussion on this tax.  Three of them are city men. Naturally our arguments pointing out the importance of tea in the life of the country will not appeal to them any more than to the Minister.</P>

The easiest way to waste time would be to call a count every time the Deputy's Party refuse to make a House.  Is not tea a luxury for the people of the country?  That is what is asked here.  Tea is not a luxury; it is a necessity for them, as anybody who has lived in the country knows. Furthermore, I suggest that the quality of the tea is only wrongly described as a luxury.  The attempt indirectly to change the quality of the tea so that the Exchequer may be able to screw more money out of the people is unjustifiable.</P>

      <P>Apparently, it is necessary once more to try to get into the heads of the Minister and his followers that one of the inevitable results of this tax on tea will be a lowering of the quality of the tea. Apparently, the Minister has made up his mind not merely not to participate in the debate but not to listen to the debate for that point has been made and driven home but apparently the Minister has not grasped it.  That being so, what chance is there of getting from the Minister any sort of reply to the charge we are making?

      <P>It was not my intention to do anything of the kind. I was only saying that in considering this tax we should refer to the amount of taxes already on.  That is all the reference that I intended to make, and all that I ever intended to make on a section of this kind.  I suggest that to put a tax of this kind on one of the prime necessities of life of people already overburdened with taxation is not merely unjustifiable but <Col N="1613" /> inhuman.  Is there any indication where taxation of this kind, as exemplified by this particular tax, is going to stop?  Where is there any indication of it?  I take it for granted that the Minister is rather juggling with this tax from year to year.  I do not know any other phrase to describe the action of the Minister in this particular matter than juggling with this tax.  It is now on and it is now off. But it is quite obvious that the Minister is now driven to the pin of his collar by the absurd increase of expenditure against which we have vainly protested.  He is now driven in this and other taxes to go beyond the limits even of what we thought a Fianna Fáil Government could do.  In all these taxes, indirect as well as direct, this as well as other taxes, we must realise that taken as a whole, there must be a saturation point for them, as the Minister has found out in connection with other things.  The House should not allow the Government to impose this additional burden on the people in addition to those they have put on them in previous Budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this a sort of threat?  I want to point out to Deputy O'Sullivan and the Minister what I said last night.  The Minister, as a sort of excuse or justification for the imposition of this tea tax said that people could adjust themselves to it. He meant by that that the people could buy a cheaper kind of tea.  But that is not so, so far as the poor people are concerned, the people who are most heavily hit by this, because as I pointed out before, and as the Minister knows <Col N="1614" /> quite well, owing to the restriction on the output of the cheaper teas by over 25 per cent., the prices of the cheaper teas have been increased by as much as 60 per cent. within the last two years.  Poor people who could buy tea two years ago, when the Minister first imposed this duty, for 1/2 per lb., cannot buy the same tea now less than 1/7 and 1/8.  These people will have to bear this impost of 4d. in full.</P>
      <P>I suggest that this is a matter that ought to concern particularly the three city Deputies here, because we know very well that the cheaper teas are used very largely by the poor of the cities and towns, and it is going to hit them particularly hard.  They are not in the same position as the person who can afford to buy a better quality of tea. The person who has been in the habit of paying 3/- a lb. for tea can now purchase tea at 2/8 per lb., but the person who has been paying 1/7 or 1/8 cannot escape this tax, because the tea for which they were paying 1/7 and 1/8 will be now 1/11 or 2/-.  The Minister, when talking about the people being able to adjust themselves to meet this tax, ought to keep that in mind&mdash;that the people who are going to be hit particularly hard by this cannot adjust themselves to it.</P>
      <P>I want to protest, on a very important Bill like this, and particularly on a very important section, and upon a tax which is imposing roughly £400,000 on the people of this State, against the Minister's thinking so lightly of his duty as Minister as to refuse to answer on a debate in this House upon that particular section.  I say the Minister is failing in his duty as Minister.  He is here as a Minister appointed by the House and paid by the people of this State to answer debates in this House and justify any tax which he proposes to impose upon the people.  The Minister, of course, gets a fit of bad temper.  It very often happens with the same Minister&mdash;he gets into a bad temper when he feels something is going against him.</P>

      <P>This again is another tax which is inexcusable at the present time.  Evidence has already been given before the Prices Commission that this tax has resulted in an increase in the price of bread and, not only that, but the increase which has already taken place has not brought the price of bread, as far as bakers are concerned, to a remunerative figure and a further increase may be expected in the price of flour arising out of this tax.  This tax has been put on at the beginning of a year in which an unknown increase in the price of flour is going to be brought about by the operation of a Bill at present before the House.  The Minister for Finance has provided in the Agriculture Estimate this year £300,000 as the bounty on wheat&mdash;last year's wheat.  The cost of subsidising home-grown wheat is rising to such a figure that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance are co-operating with each other to hide the cost to the public, and so the cost has to be hidden by means of legislation which is at present being dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But which makes us absolutely certain, Sir, that there will be a further increase, before the present calendar year is over, in the price of flour and in the price of bread.  It is a tax that hits the poorer section of the people in the same heavy way that the tax on tea hits them.  It is a tax which is nothing but a war tax and which can do nothing towards improving the general social stability of the people, while, at the same time, it takes increasing amounts out of the people's pockets and takes them in a hidden kind of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taking of that money out of the people's pockets has been even bigger up to the present than would normally be necessary.  In imposing this tax, the Minister took no steps at all to protect the people against an unjust rise in the price of flour on which this tax never fell.  The various merchants throughout the country have been complaining to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to Deputies of this House that an entirely unprecedented step was taken by millers with regard to large quantities of flour, the purchase of which was already contracted for.  A situation has been created in which merchants, who had purchased flour from millers on a contract, the normal terms of which were that they were <Col N="1621" /> given three months to take delivery, have been charged this tax on that part of their contract which had not been taken over at all.  I should like to ask the Minister how it comes that no consideration is given to the public when putting on a harsh tax of this kind in the way of relieving them of the incidence of a certain amount of the tax from which they should reasonably be relieved.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is a policy of giving a certain amount of largesse to millers and people like that, so that there may be more people, standing for business ability and business credit, who can be bought in this particular way to help the Government to put a kind of face on their policy. It can be the only explanation of it. We protest against these taxes which raise the price of bread and the price of flour, prices which Government policy is going to raise still further. As I say, evidence has been given before the Prices Tribunal already that the price of bread is not remunerative for bakers by reason of the great increase brought about in the price of flour owing to Ministerial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wondered how one section of the Budget was raised, and until Deputy Corry spoke last night I had no hint.  Taking Deputy Corry's phrase about taxing the things that people must get, it is quite clear that the Ministry came to the point at which they simply said: &ldquo;Let us find out the one thing from which there is no escape.&rdquo;  They got Deputy Corry or perhaps one of his constituents, put him on a sort of compulsory hunger strike, and found what he cried loudest for when that was over.  So they arrived, by that process at bread, butter, tea and sugar as the necessary items and they decided to tax these commodities.  I do not know if history shows anywhere, except as the prelude to a revolution, an instance of a tax such as the tax on bread or bread-stuffs.  In fact, the reverse used to be the position.  Even the Minister must have heard of the old system of holding off the multitude by giving them free bread and free games.  At the moment, the only <Col N="1622" /> thing we have as big game in this country is the economic war and it is not free.  It, or part of it at any rate, is going to be paid for by the tax on bread.  We have reversed the old procedure. This free bread, and the free circuses or the free games were given as the prelude to the break up of a very big empire.  We have now gone down hill so much more than that, that we have decided the time has come when bread-stuffs or to take the old cliché, the staff of life, has got to have something put on it in order to satisfy Ministerial greed.</P>
      <P>Again, there should be some explanation of what other methods of taxation were considered and rejected, and why they were rejected, before the Ministry decided that the tax should go on such a definite, universally recognised necessity as bread. The very word &ldquo;bread&rdquo; has an association with life itself&mdash;with life of a primitive type, with the source and the beginnings of life&mdash;&mdash;of a nature that is brought home to everybody who reads, who says his prayers, or who does anything that shows any touch with life at all.  Yet the Ministry decided that the raw material of bread has got to be taxed.  Then, as Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, because of certain activities of the Ministry, the price that has to be paid for flour shows a difference against us of 4d. per stone as compared with the prices charged in the City of Belfast at normal prices.  Even so, those who manufacture flour, appearing before the Prices Commission gave evidence that the price, even though 4d. per stone higher than what is paid in Belfast, is not remunerative and they warned the community that so far from expecting any downward trend in prices, the price of bread must rise still further.  On top of that situation we get this tax on wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, let there be no running away from this&mdash;there is no question of protection involved.  There is already control and there is already machinery for that at the disposal of the Government. If it were a question of getting more home grown wheat used, <Col N="1623" /> there is machinery for doing that. This is intended simply to make the people pay more for what is going into bread.  Even the highest point to which the Ministry could rise in their optimism is that they are going to have a 20 per cent. admixture so that as far as 80 per cent. of our wheat requirements is concerned, it is going to be taxed in the way proposed here.  Surely that does call for some explanation.  One can see the answer that almost any tax&mdash;a tax on incomes, for instance&mdash;would be the obvious resort before the bread of the people would be touched.  We may be told then that if you touch income tax, to a certain extent you touch the source of production and you may drive people out of employment.  You may not allow people to get the wherewithal to buy even their bread.  The necessaries of life have got to be weighed one against the other in order that you may get the virtues of various taxes seen in relationship one with another.  But we have this tax put on without any definite reason being given for it.</P>
    <P>I think it is, as I say, historically unique that you should have in the same Budget year, a Government which has decided to put a tax upon such ordinary things as tea, sugar and butter, and add to them, as if they were not sufficiently final, this tax on bread.  There is no answer given as to why anything else should not be chosen except bread.  I do not know if we can even get an idea of the amount that is to be brought in by this tax.  We have got to get what is going to be the inter-action of this tax on the growth and the use of Irish wheat.  One thing that is clear is that the only justification for the tax is that if you must get money, and you want to get it with certainty, you want to get it without any fear of a breakdown, any spectacular breakdown in Government, all you have got to do is to watch for something that the vast majority of the people, if not the whole people use, and put a tax on it.  A small tax on such a commodity will bring you in more than a heavy tax which would affect <Col N="1624" /> only a small portion of the people.  It is an ideal thing from the angle of the man who must get money, who has his eyes closed to the sources from which that money is taken, who has no idea of humanity with regard to where the money comes from, who is blind to, or ignorant of, the misery attached to the taxation of foodstuffs.  I think there is no example in history of a tax being put on bread except in a period which was simply the prelude to a revolution, when things had got to the worst point, and those who constituted the Government were so blind and so reckless, so conscious of the fact that their existence as a Government was drawing to a close, that they put burden after burden on the community and, as the final straw, put a tax on foodstuffs, a tax on bread.  I do not know if the Ministry believe that we have come to that situation here now.  Their conduct indicates an appreciation of the fact that we are very close to it.  Their only excuse is that of sheer necessity. As I said before, they are on their uppers and there never was such proof of it as this.</P>

      <P>I desire to protest against this tax.  When I was young I used to hear people singing a song called &ldquo;Rowdlam Randy,&rdquo; in which a cake called <i>stampaí císte</i> was mentioned. The policy of the present Government is rapidly driving the unfortunate people of the country back to that position.  I would like to bear out the statement made by Deputy Mulcahy with regard to this tax being shoved on to people before the millers had paid it.  My attention was drawn to that by two merchants, one in Macroom and the other in Ballyvourney. They were compelled to pay the tax, or else the contracts they had made would be cancelled.  The Minister suggested last night that complaints of this kind should be sent forward to the Prices Commission for investigation.  I hope that he will take steps to send this complaint forward. If he wishes I can give him the names of the two merchants.  I may say that up to recently one of them was a supporter of the Minister and his Party.</P>

      <P>I have consistently <Col N="1625" /> opposed any tax on the food of the people, and on many occasions I have given my reasons for my opposition to that form of taxation.  It has been pointed out by other speakers that every penny imposed by way of taxation on bread and on other commodities in general use, particularly by the working class people of the country, means, in effect, a reduction in their wages.  There would be a terrible outcry amongst the organised working classes if, at any time, a body of employers sought to reduce their wages by a sum of at least 5/- per week.  It has been proved conclusively by Deputy Morrissey, amongst others, that the various taxes to be imposed under this Bill will mean a reduction of at least 5/- per week in the case of the average working-class family.  Some people who can claim to speak with authority place the figure somewhat higher than 5/-.  I took a rather prominent part on one occasion in this House in seeking to get a protective tariff for the flour-milling industry, but I then recognised, and still recognise, that most of these tariffs have at least one certain effect: the tendency to make the rich man richer and the poor man poorer.  I think it is agreed that all these taxes or tariffs are, in the long run, passed on to the consumer, and the consumer in whom I am most interested is the poor person.  The poor are hit more severely by these taxes than the rich, for the reason that the rich have more money to spend. With regard to the whole wheat policy of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will leave that question aside, but perhaps another occasion will arise for dealing with it.  I was very interested on one occasion in getting a particular tariff in order to help our own people, but, as I said, the tax was passed on to the consumer.  As Deputy Mulcahy said, there is no certainty that this tax will not be still further increased.  We may be told that this is a matter that may be brought before the Prices Commission, but if the bakers and others can produce satisfactory evidence to the effect that they are not overcharging, that they are only getting their ordinary profits, the Prices Commission cannot be effective in reducing the price of the loaf.</P>
      <P>I join with the other Deputies who have protested against any policy that will result in increasing the price of food stuffs for the people, particularly for the poor, who, in the main, are the working classes.  The tax will press more heavily on them than on the richer sections of the community.  I think that the Minister might have looked about for some other source from which to get his revenue before embarking on a policy which, in effect, will mean reducing wages in working-class families.  He has not given us any indication that the price of the loaf will not go still higher.  I hope that when concluding he will give the House some indication that he will see to it that no profiteering takes place in the price charged for the loaf.  I should like, too, to have an indication from him that if and when he is returned to power, which God forfend, he will not on any future occasion interfere with the price of a commodity that is in general use by the poor, the class most affected by any increase in the prices of flour.</P>

      <P>This is a tax which, on the face of it, carries no pretensions. On many occasions we have had statements <Col N="1627" /> from the Government Benches to the effect that taxation was necessary in order to protect industry of one kind or another.  That case cannot be made for this tax.  There is no protection being afforded to home-grown wheat by this tax because the position appears to be that the percentage of home-grown wheat to foreign wheat controls the whole situation as far as the importation of foreign wheat is concerned.  Consequently, this is a revenue tax pure and simple.  It is not a happy matter for Deputies to have to contemplate that the Government have been driven to tax bread in the way they are doing in this Bill.  It forces one to the belief that they are in financial straits when they must have recourse to putting a tax on bread which everyone, rich and poor, must use in order to sustain life. Deputy Anthony expressed the hope that, if the present Government continue in office, some assurance should be given by the Minister for Finance that this will be the last attempt made to increase the price of bread in this way.  I would like to be able to share Deputy Anthony's hope, but as Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, in view of another Bill that is coming along, I am afraid one can hardly entertain the hope that the price of flour can remain even at its present level, or anything like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net effect of this is going to be not a protection of Irish industry but a raising of the cost of living, with a consequent reduction in the standard of living. From that point of view, it is certainly deplorable that the Minister has felt obliged to have recourse to this tax.  At a time like this, when even the Ministerial Bench admits that it is hard to balance the Budget, and that the country is going through hard times, it is sad that, with our depleted resources, the price of bread must go up because the Government wants more money.  On the whole, I maintain that there is no justification for this tax.  There cannot be any pretence about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said recently in <Col N="1628" /> this House that, because of the success of the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, certain duties and revenues were being cut off from the Minister for Finance. Apparently, the Minister for Finance is going to see that they are brought in somehow.  However, I do not think that the returns prove that the contention of the Parliamentary Secretary was correct.  We have at present out of our depleted resources to carry very heavy charges and I maintain that the increase of the cost of bread is entirely unwarranted.  In common with my colleagues on this side of the House, I protest very strongly against this tax.</P>

      <P>As the last speaker has touched upon the principle of this tax, it is well to clear away any doubt that may exist in the mind of the so-called man-in-the-street.  This is a tax for revenue purposes purely and simply, and it should be known as such.  No cheap clap-trap from any soap-box orator anywhere should persuade anybody that this is an imposition on the general community for the benefit of the agricultural community. The Minister for Finance finds himself in straits and looks around to get something to tax.  He hits on imported wheat.  Badly informed people or credulous people may ask: &ldquo;Is it not imported wheat?&rdquo;  That wheat is a necessity here.  We are not producing at the outside more than 25 per cent. of our wheat requirements.  In the current year, during which this tax will operate, we shall have to import 75 per cent of our wheat requirements, so that, to that extent, this is a direct tax on consumers of bread.  That should be thoroughly understood.  If we were near the point of production of our full requirements and a tax was put on imported wheat, it could be argued that it was an imposition on the general community to help the agricultural community.  We are not near that point.  It is also well to remember that this tax will mean 6d. per cwt. on the 500,000 or 600,000 tons of wheat that we have to import.  If we import 500,000 tons, then this tax will mean an imposition of £250,000 on the bread-eating community, which <Col N="1629" /> is practically the entire community. The Exchequer will get that money. That discloses a very alarming situation. Out of the taxation of last year, the Exchequer provided a bounty on wheat amounting to £300,000.  The Exchequer is saving that amount this year and transferring it to the community, to be paid indirectly in the market price of flour.  Flour will go up to that extent.  With that principle, I agree, but see what it discloses as regards the general financial and economic position of the country. Last year, the Government was able, out of general taxation, to provide this bounty on wheat.  It cannot do that this year and it throws the burden on to the consumer, who will have to provide another £250,000 by reason of the 6d. per cwt. on imported wheat. No tax has been remitted this year and new taxes have to be imposed. That shows that the economic position of the country is sinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall probably have an increase in wheat production during the next few years.  Next year, we may find ourselves with 100,000 more acres of wheat than we have this year, just as we have 100,000 more acres this year than we had last year.  We may even have 200,000 additional acres because of other agricultural crops not giving any return.  The people will naturally turn to the crops that give a return. Is this sixpence to be there to make a case for the Minister for Finance to point out as he pointed this year, that because of the operation of the import duties that were put on specifically to help home industry, and not for revenue purposes, and because of the success of the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there has been a diminution of revenue and that taxation in lieu of that must be imposed?  Hence the new tax.  We will be told next year, if there is an increase in the acreage of home grown wheat, that this tax will have to be increased to one shilling or two shillings. In case anyone might be misled on the question, I want to make it clear that this is a direct tax on imported wheat that does not compete with wheat produced here.  Owing to an arrangement made by another <Col N="1630" /> Minister, if we produced 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. of our wheat requirements there will be a market for that quantity at a fixed price.  We do not import any wheat except what is required to make up the difference between what we produce at home and our total requirements.  There is every indication that while the present Government is in office that is the line they will take.  With that line I am 100 per cent. in agreement. I only want to make the position clear.  Let everyone then decide whether this is a just tax or not.  It is a tax on imported wheat that is not competing with Irish produced wheat.  It is a direct tax on bread. This tax is not intended to help agriculture but is intended for revenue purposes only.</P>

      <P>If any further illustration was needed of the havoc that the present Government has played with the economic condition of the country we have it here, when it becomes necessary to have recourse to what has been described as this obnoxious course of raising money.  I am sure it must be just as obnoxious to many Deputies on the Government side, and to the Minister, as it is to the Opposition. There is no justification whatever for what I might call this bread tax.  Judging by the silence on the Government Benches there is apparently no defence of it.  We have not heard one Minister or Deputy defending this tax.  We have the curious anomaly of one Minister issuing bread tickets, as represented by the number of people to be seen parading before the labour exchanges, and others receiving the dole with which to provide ordinary sustenance, of which bread forms such a large part, and, on the other hand, we have the tax gatherers lined along the quays collecting the wherewithal so that the Minister can provide doles to keep the unfortunate workers and hard-up people alive.  It is no satisfaction to some of these poor people that the money they receive has to be got from taxation on the necessaries of life, in the shape of bread, tea and sugar. This is a poverty tax.  The Ministry <Col N="1631" /> have reduced themselves to the position that there is no way of finding money but to resort to the desperate expedient of taxing food.  That represents more clearly than anything else the havoc that has been wrought and the deplorable condition of poverty to which the country has been reduced. There cannot even be the defence that there is any necessity for this tax. It will not have any effect in limiting imports.  The tax is designed and framed purely as a revenue tax and not control or to limit imports of wheat.  I have intervened mainly to see if I could induce some member of the Government Party to make some sort of plausible defence of this tax. That is due to the House.  Deputies on this side are definitely opposed to this tax.  We could like some Deputy on the Government Benches to make some defence, if any defence could be made for this tax.</P>

      <P>This tax appears small when mention is made of 6d. per cwt. on wheat.  What the country is entitled to know is what it will represent in the cost of a sack of flour.  I presume the tax will not fall upon by-products, such as bran, pollard and the &ldquo;tails&rdquo; but the incidence of it will fall exclusively on flour.  If that is so it means 1/9½ per sack.  Presumably <Col N="1632" /> there will be the cost of collecting the money, so that the actual cost will be 2/- on a sack of flour. Having regard to the various other impositions it is monstrous that that addition should be made to the cost of flour.</P>

These Deputies come along now and talk about increasing the price of bread, but they walked into the Lobby to support Deputy Norton's amendment reducing bakers' hours by six or seven hours.  They did that coolly and deliberately, knowing what it meant. They are forgetting about that now, and are here with their tongues in their cheek talking about increasing the cost of flour by 2/- a sack.  The age of humbugs has not yet passed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This tobacco tax increases the charge of Customs duty on tobacco, since the Government came into office, by 2/- in the lb. That tax falls very heavily on the working-classes.  Tobacco is one of the few luxuries left to them and, in present circumstances, when other costs are as high as they are, it seems almost ridiculous to be adding to this particular item of tobacco, which is sometimes called a luxury, and which is more times called a necessity, an imposition of this sort. It is quite possible that increasing this tax will have the same result as the increased taxes upon other commodities which place them beyond the reach of the public.  It is a very nice question as to whether we have not reached saturation point with regard to this tax.  If the impression is that those who use tobacco can afford to pay any tax on it, then if the Minister is particularly short of money and requires money for certain purposes there may be a <i>prima facie</i> case made for introducing this particular tax at this moment.  But if, on the other hand, what has been regarded as a fairly steady source of revenue is likely to be prejudiced, as has already happened in the case of beer and spirits, then when this tax fails to produce its money some lame or limpid Minister for Finance would come along later on and say: &ldquo;I require money for social services; having failed to get it from the rates, and having failed to get it from those who use luxuries such as tobacco, I am driven to taxing the necessaries of life.&rdquo;  It is not perhaps as serious a tax upon the wage-earning class as the tax on tea, but nevertheless it falls heavily upon the class of people least able to bear it, and in consequence it is my intention to vote against this tax.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Minister and the Government are carrying on the fiction that tobacco is a luxury. Ninety-nine out of every 100 old age pensioners would rather go without food than without a smoke.  It is the only comfort they have left.  Tobacco has become of such wide use that it is now a necessity to practically all the male population, and to a large section of the female population. Whether it is good for them or not is another matter.  When we consider that a material with a commercial value of about 5d. or 6d. per lb. is carrying a tax of 9/4 per lb., surely <Col N="1635" /> it will be agreed that there must be a great demand for it.  If it is injurious its use should be stopped altogether, but the amount of tax it is carrying shows what the people are prepared to pay for its use.  We all know the comfort it is to old people, and young people too.  There is no use in the Government continuing the fiction that they are the poor man's Government when they are prepared to tax his smoke without showing any corresponding relief.  It shows unmistakably the way in which we are drifting.  Perhaps it is a good thing that we have this tax on tobacco, because when a man goes in for his ounce of tobacco and finds that he has to pay out another ½d.&mdash;if he smokes three or four ounces in the week his income is reduced by so many halfpennies&mdash;it brings home to him the way in which we are drifting, and it will probably teach him such a very useful lesson that he will know how to exercise his citizenship on the next occasion better than he did on the last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the point of view put forward by Deputy Belton that tobacco is not so much a luxury as a necessity.  It enables everyone, whether rich or poor, to carry on his work.  It is a sort of anodyne, and to that extent it is a necessity and not a luxury.  This particular tax, in the way in which it is sought to be imposed by this section, really does fall harder on the people who have to pay either for tobacco or the cheaper class of cigarettes.  The price of cigarettes that people smoke has been increased by a ½d. in the 20 packet.  Very few people feel that, if they are in any sort of comfortable circumstances.  They usually got a packet of cigarettes for 11½d. and took a carton of matches which they did not really want.  But to a poor man an additional ½d. on a packet of cigarettes is a really serious matter, and an additional ½d. on an ounce of tobacco is a still more serious matter. Since the present Government came into power they have increased the tax on tobacco by 2/-.  They increased it by 1/4 in their first year, and this year <Col N="1636" /> they have increased it by 8d.; in other words, they have increased to the ordinary man the expenditure on his weekly amount of tobacco by from 6d. to 8d.  That is a serious item on what is really a necessity rather than a luxury.  In addition to giving a certain amount of comfort, and soothing the nerves, as tobacco does, it enables a man to work.  It gives him a certain amount of relaxation, and enables him to do his work better.  To that extent, it is a necessity.  The tax on tobacco is just a necessary consequence of the type of thing that is being done under this Finance Bill&mdash;putting a tax on every article of necessity which the people have to buy.</P>

      <P>There is one satisfaction at any rate to be derived from those imposts on the necessaries of the people.  You have a tax on tobacco, on bread, sugar, tea, coal, etc., and the one satisfaction is that it will bring home to every member of the community the financial chaos that exists, and the tendency to drift further and further almost into bankruptcy. It used to be said, and said with a good deal of truth, that the farmers were in the front line trenches in this country.  They were, but now the workingmen, consumers of the commodities I have mentioned, are going to be brought into the front line trenches, and very properly.  I have said, I think, on a previous occasion, that until the full force of the trouble we are passing through, namely the economic war, was brought behind the shop counter, into the workshops, into the counting-house, and into every other place as well as into the farmyard, the people would not realise the effects of entering into this foolish, ridiculous and nonsensical economic war.  This is the best indication that can possibly be given by this Government that they have failed ignominiously to balance their Budgets, or even to do national housekeeping of any kind or character without taxing the very food of the people.  It is considered by all Governments, and in all countries, that it should be the last resource of any Finance Minister or of any Chancellor of the Exchequer to tax the breakfast table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Food has been taxed, and now another necessary in the shape of tobacco is taxed.  A lot of Members have pointed out already that this is regarded as a necessity, and it is regarded as a greater necessity by the poorest persons in the community.  The old age pensioner has been mentioned, and some persons spoke as if there were no female old age pensioners. Everybody knows that some of the women old age pensioners are possibly heavier smokers than the men.  Any of us who has been engaged in any kind of welfare work knows that the most welcome present to an old person is a couple of ounces of tobacco.  Now we are going to increase the cost of living in another respect on the very poorest persons in the community.  It is all very fine for the man who smokes an expensive cigar and who is accustomed to pay a good price for his tobacco; he does not mind a few pence extra in the way of additional taxation because he can bear the burden.  But every additional penny you put on these necessaries of life means so much of a reduction in the wages of the poor man or poor woman, as the case may be.  This tax has one satisfying aspect, and that is, it is bringing the fight into the homes, into the kitchen, into the backyards, into every part of the home and to every member of the community.  It will not be long, I suppose, until the Minister introduces a Bill here in which he will ask 40 per cent. of the people to maintain another 40 per cent.  Then we will be in such a condition that the whole nation will say: &ldquo;For Heaven's sake send us any Government that will reduce the taxes on the necessaries of the poor.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The silence of the Minister on all those matters is very eloquent.  I suppose the fact is that he really cannot tell us anything and there is no defence to be made.  If tobacco has a soothing influence on the nerves, as we are told, I think there should be a free distribution of tobacco instead of a free distribution of beef in view of the nerve-racking experiences the <Col N="1638" /> people have gone through and are going through as a result of this Government's policy.  The nerves of the community are racked trying to find money for the various purchases they have to make.

      <P>Such an interjection on the Minister's part only serves to illustrate the condition in which he finds himself.  It is quite possible that this tax may have the opposite effect.  It is possible its imposition may have this effect, that we may reach saturation point in this matter.  While we may regard tobacco as important from a soothing point of view, it is, nevertheless, the type of thing that people can go without, and the Minister may find that his revenue will not increase as a result of this tax.  As Deputy Anthony pointed out, and as we have endeavoured to point out, this is one more indication of the tragic position in which we find ourselves.  It is a very sad state of affairs to find that the Government must tax all foodstuffs and must even tax tobacco in order to accumulate revenue.  I am very sorry indeed that a Government of this country should have sunk to such a depth.</P>

      <P>Listening to what Deputy Anthony said, I recalled a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance during the Budget discussions which were the prelude to the present Bill, and I was wondering if Deputy Anthony had not really put his finger on the purpose of the tax.  Is this tax really brought in for the purpose stated by the Parliamentary Secretary during the Budget discussions?  He said that <Col N="1639" /> what he liked about the Budget was that it brought everybody up against the facts.  In answer to Deputy Anthony, who protested against taxes on working men, the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;Why should not the working man be taxed?&rdquo;  He said also that the Budget brought everybody, including the working man, up against the facts.  Perhaps Deputy Anthony has really discovered the true purpose of this tobacco tax&mdash;that it is not for <Col N="1640" /> the purpose of revenue or even taxing the luxuries or the necessities of the working man, the poor man, but it is really for the purpose of bringing home to everybody the facts of the present situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Mulcahy I beg to move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>Before Section 25 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The duty of five shillings per ton imposed on coal, culm, shale, slack and coke and also solid fuel which in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners is composed wholly or mainly of coal or coal dust under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) (No. 5) Order, 1932, and confirmed by the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Act, 1933 (No. 21 of 1933) shall cease to be charged, levied or paid as on and from the passing of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had examples already of what I may call the topsy-turvy policy of the Government in certain matters.  But anything more irrational than their conduct in connection with this tax on coal it is difficult to imagine.  We are asking for the removal of this particular tax on coal.  Everybody will remember the excuse that was put forward at the time of the imposition of this tax. Even at that time it was a mad idea to strike the Government to adopt this tax, at least if it was their purpose to use it as an economic weapon in the economic war.  Anything more foolish or ill-conceived than that particular tax on coal it would be difficult to imagine. It was, as the House will remember, a tax imposed on British coal which was meant to hit back against the British in the economic war.  It was pointed out at the time that it could have no such effect.  The only result of such action on the part of the Government would be that our cattle would be heavily taxed going into England, and we would pay that tax owing to the fact that we were only supplying a portion of the English market and that most, or practically all, of our cattle had to go into that market.  It was pointed out, in these circumstances, and would be plain to anybody except the Executive Council, that the people of this country would have to pay that tariff&mdash;every penny of it.  That is what happened.  Of course, it was denied at <Col N="1646" /> the time; now it is acknowledged by everybody.</P>
    <P>Then a brilliant idea struck the Government.  They said: &ldquo;What about taxing English coal?&rdquo;  With that simplicity of mind that characterises them on certain occasions, they assumed that because a tax was put on cattle by the British Government and paid by Irish farmers, if a tax was put on British coal by us it would have to be paid by English producers and not by Irish consumers. Again it was quite clear to anybody who gave the conditions of the country a moment's consideration that what would happen would be this: There might be interference with the amount of coal that came into this country, but the tax would be paid not by the British producer but by the Irish consumer. That, of course, was what happened.  The only excuse offered for the putting on of this tax&mdash;we heard no other justification for it and I wonder will we hear one from the silent Minister to-night&mdash;was that it was a weapon in the Irish war.  It was a weapon with the unfortunate characteristic of the boomerang when used by unskilled hands.  It had the effect merely of increasing the cost of British coal to the Free State, yet it was hailed at the time as the first of the great big strokes that were to be delivered against the British Government to bring them to a sense of the seriousness of entering into an economic war with this country.  Anything more foolishly conceived than such a plan it would be difficult to imagine.  But foolish as was that plan, the whole thing became nonsensical when the embargo on British coal was declared off and not merely was the divorce between ourselves and the British declared off, but there was to be close union between the two countries, and, in the future, not merely were we to be allowed to take British coal but were to be compelled to do it and, incidentally, to pay an extra 5/- per ton by way of tax.</P>
    <P>That 5/- per ton we could escape at first by taking Continental coal instead of British.  Now, as a result of the friendly relations established in <Col N="1647" /> the war which still continues, we are compelled to take British coal, and that economic weapon which was one of the methods of attacking the British now stands forth clearly, for what it really is, merely a dodge to raise revenue by a tax which is pressing upon everybody.  It presses upon people who buy one or two tons of coal, but it presses still more upon people who only buy a bag of coal at a time.  That tax is left, and not merely is it left, but now it is imposed on everybody as he has to buy English coal.  What was to be a great counter offensive, in the economic war, has now become a weapon for drawing the last penny out of the pockets of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is £600,000 or not&mdash;I forget the actual figure&mdash;that the Minister expects to get from this particular tax, but the House will notice that whatever excuse was ever put forward for this particular tax has vanished&mdash;I was going to say has more than vanished.  However, if it was possible for the Ministry to do anything absurd they would, of course, do it.  Not merely has the excuse vanished for this tax, but now we are compelled, whether we like it or not, to buy coal that we were warned not to buy at the time when the tax was first imposed, and we are compelled to do that in the new atmosphere of friendship between the two Governments who are at war.</P>
    <P>The war goes gaily on; the fight still goes on, but the burden remains to the people of this country.  The people find that the knife they were using against the other side has an unhappy knack of closing and cutting off their fingers.  There has been reference to taxes put on in war conditions.  Here was an actual war tax meant to hit others and not to tax the people of this country.  It was never meant as a tax at all and in fact we were told, when this tax was put on, by many Government spokesmen that it was not the people of this country who would pay this tax but the producer in Great Britain.  Unfortunately, even when we had the Continental coal market open to us, that particular statement <Col N="1648" /> was not true.  How much less is it true now when the Continental coal market is closed to the people of this country and when the people are compelled, by the recent pact, to take British coal and to take only British coal?  What is the justification?  A war tax, a war measure meant to hit the enemy, kept on in the dire straits of the Government so that they can scrape every penny from the unfortunate taxpayer to meet bloated expenses, because it is absurd to say that this tax cannot be got rid of, as the Minister used to say when he made even the pretence of putting forward a case in this House in favour of the policy he is meant to sponsor.</P>
    <P>What is the excuse now?  None whatsoever.  Expenses are mounting up year after year and mounting up by the million.  It is inevitable, if the Government goes in for the policy of gross extravagance, on the one hand, because that is what they are doing, that they have to grind the last 1d. out of the unfortunate taxpayer, on the other hand, and they have to utilise discreditable methods of this kind and turn what is meant, as I say, to be a great war weapon into a weapon against our own people.  For that reason, I ask the House to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a part of the Government's policy which I find very hard to understand.  I find it very hard to understand the mentality that conceived it.  Prior to the Coal-Cattle Pact, one would be looked upon as unpatriotic if one supported British coal, and, in some quarters, one would be called a traitor for doing so. Public bodies in various parts of the country were almost compelled by the Local Government Department to use Continental coal.  This Continental coal could only be brought in in large complements by large steamers, and these steamers were unable to enter the smaller ports, with the result that during the 12 months prior to the Coal-Cattle Pact, a great number of harbour authorities suffered very seriously.  Now, since the Coal-Cattle Pact, we are asked to be unpatriotic and, in being unpatriotic, to pay 5/- <Col N="1649" /> of a fee.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this tariff is put on English coal.  We are compelled to take it; we have no option.  It is hitting the poor very hard and I am sure it costs the ordinary working man's household at least 6d. per week and that, along with the other taxes imposed by the Government in this Budget, is something which I am not going to support.  I think that even now the Minister should see his way to remove the tax altogether.  It is an unjustifiable tax.  It is certainly not understandable and, to say the least of it, it is absolutely Gilbertian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish is, I think, putting it at a very low figure indeed, when he puts the increase at a minimum of 6d. per week in the average household.  If Deputy Corish was thinking solely of the 5/- tax, he would probably be in or about right, but the Deputy must remember that it means more than that.  This tax becomes particularly harsh because the giving to Great Britain of a monopoly of the coal supplies of this country means not only 5/- per ton tax, but 5/- per ton increase on the coal in addition to the tax, so that the consumer of coal in this country to-day is paying, between the tax and the increase in the price of British coal, that is, the difference in the price over and above the price at which good Continental coal could have been purchased prior to 1st February, at least 10/- per ton.  I think Deputy Corish or anybody else in the House will agree that that means a minimum of 1/- per week extra in respect of coal alone in the average household in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking three items alone in the Finance Bill&mdash;tea, sugar and coal&mdash; there is the huge sum of £2,000,000 in taxation imposed on the people.  The Minister will get roughly £700,000 from this coal tax.  Under the first quota order, the amount of coal to be imported from Britain was roughly 1,100,000 tons.  That quota order was due to expire this month.  A new quota order has been made for the remainder of this year and, under it, 1,705,000 tons of coal are to be <Col N="1650" /> imported, of which 1,704,000 tons must be imported from Britain.  It will, therefore, be seen that the quota allows, over a space of about 11 months, an importation of roughly 2,800,000 tons of British coal at 5/- per ton. The people of this country are, however, compelled to pay more than £700,000.  I want to submit here that it would be nearer £1,400,000.</P>

I am putting forward this point and I challenge the Minister to contradict it, that, quality for quality, British coal to-day, including this 5/- tax, is 10/- per ton dearer than it was prior to the coal-cattle pact.</P>

    <P>When one has regard to the attitude of the Government on this Finance Bill, one is driven to the conclusion that the coal-cattle pact was negotiated not so much for the sake of getting rid of 150,000 head of cattle, as to enable the Government to collect £700,000 by way of the coal tax.  I think that is what is emerging now.  The coal-cattle pact surprised everybody in this country. Nobody could understand for a moment how the Government could have concluded such a silly bargain. We can only come to the conclusion that it was arranged and that this monopoly was given to Britain in order to enable the Government to collect, as I say, roughly £700,000 in taxation from the people of this country.  We must remember that this is not the only saving the Government has made in this matter.  I do not remember the details but when the Government decided to impose a duty on British coal, I seem to remember that there was a question of a half-crown a ton of a bounty or a subsidy or whatever it was called for small boats supposed to be affected.  That, I am sure, amounted to a fairly tidy sum which had to be paid by the Government.  When the coal-cattle pact was concluded, that subsidy was withdrawn, from the smaller boats.  It was supposed <Col N="1651" /> to be no longer necessary to pay it and, therefore, there was that saving also.  I should like the Minister, if he is going to reply on this, to give us some idea of the sum involved in that subsidy to the smaller boats.</P>
    <P>It was first blurted out in the House here that the tax was being retained for the purpose of collecting revenue.  Then, as a sort of afterthought, in order I suppose to try to recover a little of the patriotic touch, it was said: &ldquo;People can burn home fuel; if they burn turf they may not pay the tax on coal.&rdquo;  I daresay if they decided to do so, they would very soon find that there was a tax on turf also.  The fact remains that there are many reasons why people do not burn turf exclusively. Some people cannot burn turf at all because they have not the means to do so and for many other reasons. One reason that it is not as economic as coal.  I think it is admitted by everybody, who knows anything about the matter, that it takes three tons of turf to give the same results as one ton of coal.  There is also the question of the inconvenience of storing it in certain private houses because of the bulk of it.  If the Minister would take the price of three tons of turf against one ton of coal, even at the increased price, he will find that there is a substantial difference. Here is a tax which was originally imposed for the purpose of keeping British coal out of the country as far as possible.  That tax is now being retained although Britain has been given a monopoly of the coal supplies of the country.  The people are denied an opportunity of getting coal from the Continent or any other country in the world because of the coal-cattle pact.  A fact which I want Deputies to realise is that the people of this country are being compelled to pay not only the 5/- tax for revenue purposes but another 5/- over and above what they were paying formerly, an increase of 10/- per ton in all.  That is what the people of this country get on the coal side and we know what they are getting on the cattle side of the pact.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish told the House that he cannot understand why the Government have imposed this tax.  I think it is rather unkind for Deputy Corish or any member of the Labour Party to criticise the Government for this, because the Government have had the support of the Labour Party for the last three years in wasting the resources of this country, and they must find money from somewhere. Deputy Morrissey has mentioned the fact that in addition to a tax of 5/-, there is an increase in price which the British coal exporters imposed on coal since the coal-cattle pact was entered into.  There is another aspect of the matter that strikes me very forcibly as representing a constituency with perhaps more poor people than any other constituency in this country.  What is the increase in the price of coal for the poor people of the city of Dublin who buy it in small quantities of a stone at a time?  When you come to distribute the increased price of 10/- per ton, over the price of stones of coal, the increase to these people probably works out at £1 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly who represents a constituency that I think is almost equally as poor as mine, namely, the South City, told us this evening that he would be confined to barracks if he were to speak on the question of the tea tax.  I wonder would Deputy Kelly be confined to barracks by his Party or by his Whips if he were to speak on the coal tax and the effect it has on the poor people of the City of Dublin.  This tax is an extraordinary instance of the peculiar orientation of this Government since they came into office.  When they first put a tax on British coal as a sort of so-called war measure, they were following the advice which Swift gave this country nearly two centuries ago when he said that we should burn everything English except her coal.  The Minister started off with that policy a couple of years ago but now the policy of the Government is that we must not be permitted to burn any coal except British.  That is in return for this extraordinary so-called concession, <Col N="1653" /> this bargain by which we are entitled to send 150,000 head of cattle more in the year to Great Britain with the duty that we pay the British Treasury on every one of these cattle.  This coal-cattle pact is the most astonishing bargain that was ever made by any Government in any country.  Such is the condition of desperation to which the country has been reduced by the policy of the Government that even that wretched bargain was accepted by the people.  It was accepted by them on the grounds that even a very bad bargain is better than no bargain, having regard to the condition to which the country has been reduced.</P>

      <P>This is a matter in which the Government has taken a step that they will regret.  They have given away the greatest power that any Government could possess, namely the sale of coal in this country.  It may look to some of us a very small matter when we see the bellman going around, but it is the one control that Britain has over us here, the selling of that lump of coal.  We may produce gold in Wicklow, or coal in some other place, but we certainly cannot produce coal at a price as economical as England can produce it and sell it here. The country was told twice, in 1932 and 1933, that we would fight Britain and beat Britain in this economic war.  The greatest weapon we had in that war was the purchase of coal by the Irish people.  That weapon&mdash;&ldquo;weapon,&rdquo; perhaps, is the best word to use&mdash;in the economic war has been handed over and surrendered.  It has been surrendered by a Government who come to the Irish people to-day and say: &ldquo;we are fighting for the Irish people against England.&rdquo;  They began the fight by handing over the best <Col N="1654" /> weapon that could possibly be used in a fight, economic or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I think that the people of this country have not realised the repercussions of this Coal-Cattle Pact and of this tax with which we are now dealing. They are led, improperly or otherwise, and they follow that lead. In a speech which I saw reported in the papers recently it was stated that the Irish people always stood by their leaders.  The President of the Executive Council speaking, I think, in Limerick, said that the fight in the Land War was greater than in the Black and Tan War and that the Irish people backed their leaders on that occasion.  In connection with the Land War we have such names as Parnell, Davitt and O'Brien.  I wonder do the Irish people realise to-day that they are called upon to fight behind a Party under the leadership&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely I am in order in saying that the leaders of that Party have given over the greatest weapon they had&mdash;the purchase of coal by Ireland from England.  They did it before the war began.  Then they come back and they appeal to the patriotism, the courage and the decency of the Irish people, saying &ldquo;back us now: we are fighting England.&rdquo;  They do that, having handed over the guns. I think the Greeks did that in the Great War, and I remember that something similar happened in Cork in 1916, but I do not think that anything equal to this happened in Irish history before&mdash;before the fight begins to hand over the only good weapon we have.  What do we hand over? Is it a gentleman's agreement?  No. Is it a bit of paper, secret or otherwise, or signed by anybody?  Not at all. The poorest people of the country must pay for this.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain why coal has increased in price by from 5/- to 10/-. There was a market here open to English, German and Polish coal.  At that time, there was a 5/- tax on British coal only.  In case the competition amongst these countries for the Irish market would continue, the Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;We will restrict the amount of coal imported.&rdquo; I know that I may be reminded that I am discussing the quota.  I am. Why is it that out of 1,705,000 tons of coal only 1,000 tons may be imported from outside Britain?  That is the open market.  And this is a country which had the coal supplies of the world at its service.  I do not think that the House should support this tax of 5/-.</P>

      <P>I am just wondering if the Minister has yet discovered how ridiculous he has made not alone himself and his immediate supporters in the Government appear but how ridiculous he has made most of his supporters in the country appear by this tax.  Deputy Corish referred a moment ago to the action of a number of Government supporters in the country who were successful in having resolutions passed at public boards precluding these boards from using British coal.  That was the case with one board in Cork.  Supplies of coal were to originate outside Great Britain.  We could not purchase British coal and we were compelled to use coal from Westphalia, Silesia and other foreign centres.  I remember at one <Col N="1657" /> time working in a little bit of badinage which had a useful effect, with the efforts of other persons, who thought on the same lines as I did, in bringing the Government to realise that their policy was ridiculous.  And it is still ridiculous in this respect.  I stated publicly on that occasion that I would run all the risks of which Deputy Corish spoke about a moment ago.  I was prepared to run the risk of being called an Imperialist, a traitor and everything anti-Irish because I said in public I would continue to use British coal.  Now, I find that I must have been a patriot then because I am now compelled to buy British coal.  I pointed out on that occasion that we had a lot of our kith and kin working in Westphalia where the Murphys and the McCarthys come from.  I am sure the Minister had that in mind, that we had working in the mines of Westphalia people with such Irish names as I have mentioned.</P>

His supporters told us at one time to boycott British coal, but now we are being compelled to buy British coal, whether we like it or not, at a prohibitive price to the community.

      <P>The effect of it at any rate is that the ordinary consumers are being called upon to pay at least 10/- per ton more for their coal.  It is the duty of the Minister, I think, to give some explanation of the figures quoted by Deputy Morrissey and others, and to let the country know where exactly we stand.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say that it is a good bargain, but he has been reminded by some Deputies that it is a very bad bargain, and that, in the final analysis, it is the consumer who will have to pay.  There would be no use in again enumerating all the necessaries of life that have been taxed by the present Government. Our people are certainly a patient people to put up with the Government and the Minister so long.  If the Minister set out to do some very unpopular thing, he has gone the right way about it.  There is such a thing as doing an unpopular thing when there is a public duty to be performed, but this is not to be taken in that light. There are certain unpopular things which the Minister might attempt to do, but which I am precluded from referring to on this amendment.  But certainly the Minister has set out to make the lot of the poor harder, and to make the rich richer.  I hope that even at this stage the Minister will show a little commonsense instead of making himself and those associated with him ridiculous.</P>

      <P>Apparently there is no defence possible for the Government's proposals in this Finance Bill.  We were treated to the spectacle of an hour's debate on the question of an additional 2/- tax on the bag of flour. We had a discussion in connection with the additional tax of 6d. on the bag of coal.  Previously we had discussions on a tax on the bag of sugar and on the bag of tea.  A Deputy reminds me that our next discussion will be on a tax on a bag of cement.  Well, we have not yet been driven to the stage of eating cement though I think we are coming near it.  One Deputy said that this was a 5/- tax on coal, and another said it was a tax of 10/-.  I do not know what the amount of the tax will be eventually when the coal reaches the poor consumer through the bellman. When the tax of 5/- a ton comes to be paid by the poor person who purchases a stone or two of coal at a time, I do not know what the actual increase will be.  When that 5/- comes to be expressed in vulgar fractions over so many stone of coal, I am afraid it will amount to a considerable sum and particularly after the profiteer has added his little fraction.  If I were to refer to the Coal-Cattle Pact, I know that I would be ruled out of order by the Chair.  All that I will say on that is that when we export cattle to England Paddy pays the tax on them, and when we import coal from England Patrick pays the tax.  Paddy or Patrick has to bear the burden in either case.  Yet, there is no Deputy on the Government Benches venturesome enough to get up and attempt to defend this coal tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, Sir. I have been talking on this burning, or non-burning, question, if you like, for ten minutes.  I have been trying to confine myself to the tax on coal. I am quite satisfied that the coal will cost a good deal more than the 5/- a ton by the time it reaches the stores. I am waiting for the Minister to prove that the tax will only amount to 5/- a ton.  I hope, when the Minister makes another bargain, that we will not have to pay on all sides, and that some distinction will be made in the terms of the bargain.  We protest in the strongest terms against the imposition of a bag tax on coal, a bag tax on flour, a bag tax on sugar, and a bag tax on every other necessity of the poor.  It is really the very poor will suffer from these taxes.  I suppose it is no harm to be humorous occasionally, but this is not a question of humour.  There will be many fireless grates because of this imposition on coal.  If the Minister could defend this tax, possibly he would do so in the way he defended the other taxes, by saying that if people do not want to use coal they need not be taxed; that if they do not want to use flour they need not be taxed; and that if <Col N="1661" /> they do not want to use sugar they need not be taxed.  That was his solitary line of defence of these impositions on the food of the people. The people were told that they need not buy any of these things, that they could fall back on some other foods. Perhaps if they use raw beet, or raw wheat or even potatoes they would be exempt.  There is very little left for them to use if they are going to defy the taxation that the Minister says they need not pay.  If we do not wear boots, I suppose we need not bear the taxes, because we can go in our bare feet.  The only way of evading the Minister's tax gatherers is by not wearing boots, clothes or other necessaries. So far we have not tempted Deputies on the Government Benches to defend these taxes.  They dare not do so.  Deputy Corry ventured to speak for a few minutes, but the gag was put on and the rest of the Party was confined to barracks.  They are still there.  None of them has the courage to get up to defend a tax of 2/- on a sack of flour and a tax on coal.  I suppose to-morrow or after we will be told that we are traitors because we are defending the poor against these taxes.  I have not been interrupted while speaking.  Usually there is a volley of interruptions from the opposite benches.  For once, there is silence.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment because it will clear away the misunderstanding that was abroad in connection with this Party voting some time ago in favour of the Coal-Cattle Pact.  It was represented by those who desired to misrepresented the United Ireland Party that this Party voted in favour of the 5/- tax on imports of British coal, when, as a matter of fact, we voted for the Coal-Cattle Pact so that farmers might be able to get rid of their cattle.  By this amendment, we are using all the <Col N="1662" /> pressure we can to keep the Minister from exploiting that pact against the interests of the community.  The question has been ably dealt with by Deputy Corish, Deputy Morrissey and other Deputies in which they referred to the iniquity of the tax. Some time ago it was patriotic for public bodies to burn nothing but turf, and it was patriotic of members of these bodies to have the odour of turf on their clothes when they travelled in the trams or in the trains. It was considered patriotic to do that, in order to show that we were doing everything possible to keep up our end in the economic war.  Now, we see that that was all flapdoodle and nonsense, that it was all sham.  Tonight's proceedings prove that it was never meant.  All this country has got to do now is to let the Die-hards in the Carlton Club in London see that our financial position is so bad that we can do nothing but order all the coal this country requires from Great Britain and pay an extra fine of 5/- on every ton.  Surely, that must be looked upon by other countries as a form of imbecility.  That attitude cannot be understood except in the peculiar atmosphere of this House. I wonder what the Germans, the French, the Belgians, or other Continental peoples, from whom we could get coal, think of us, seeing that Great Britain has got everything from this bargain, and that we have to pay an extra 5/- per ton for coal, while, at the same time we are supposed to be fighting for our economic existence. The Minister may have reasons for increasing the imports of coal from Great Britain, but no camouflage or smoke-screen can hide the fact that this tax is to get money to carry on the affairs of the country.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister and the Government will not accept this amendment.  I cannot understand the eloquent silence of my friend, Deputy T. Kelly, who has spent his life in the service of the poor.  The very poor are vitally concerned about the price of coal.  The only <i>apologia</i> I heard from the Government Benches was from Deputy <Col N="1663" /> Moore last week on another phase of the Budget, when he issued a solemn note of warning that there was profiteering in coal, that bellmen were extorting fancy prices for this coal. That shows the mentality behind the support for this tax on coal.  If a man buys a ton of coal at £1, he goes out and trades it among the community. In order to make a living profit out of it he has to put on the price on the basis of £1 outlay.  If he has to pay 25/-, he must make his profit on the basis of 25/- outlay.  If a man is going to buy coal at £1 and sell it at, say, 5/- a ton profit, is he going to pay 25/- a ton and still sell it at 5/- profit?  Of course not. He must have his profit on his initial outlay.  I am sorry Deputy Moore is not here.  I hope that some Deputy of his Party will take up the running for him in his absence.  Do not blame others for your own iniquities. The Coal-Cattle Pact has been mentioned. Personally, I am proud of having voted against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We do, and the Minister has had a queer job now, and the silence on his benches bears eloquent testimony to the queer things the Minister has to do.  Deputy Kelly&mdash; honest Tom Kelly&mdash;nods assent to that. It has been stated here that the price of coal has gone up 10/- or 12/-.  That is true.  What is, perhaps, more significant and more important is that the coal we are getting now is much inferior to what we would get if we had freedom to buy in an open market.  However, perhaps that is travelling away a little bit from the 5/- tax.  This 5/- tax, however, was imposed and defended in the first instance as a hit back at the British. Now that we have made peace on the coal front with the British, there is no longer any high explosive on that front.  Why, therefore, is not this big gun of a 5/- tax, that was used when the fight was fiercest on that front, silenced?  Now the Minister and his colleagues have to admit the truth: that it is a naked tax for revenue, <Col N="1665" /> and all the arguments used heretofore, to the effect that the tariff on coal was a weapon of retaliation against the British cattle tax, have broken down.  The bottom has fallen out of that argument.  I should be delighted to give way to the Minister in order to hear him prove that we are taxing British coal by this.  Instead of that, we are making the public pay for it.  I am not going to make a special appeal and say that it only affects the poorest of the poor.  I do not take any special credit for defending the poor.  I think there is more hypocritical talk about the defence of the poor than anything else and I think there is no sincerity in most of it, but it is an economic trading fact that 5/- is put on, and I should like some attempt made to defend the imposition of that 5/-.  It cannot keep out an article that you have agreed to let in to the exclusion of that article from any other source than Great Britain.</P>
      <P>This is purely a naked tax for revenue.  As I said in connection with the wheat tax, it is a fearful admission of the straits to which this country has been brought when we have to tax this coal that we have to buy for our own use.  We do not produce it. In other aspects of the Budget debate it was mentioned here&mdash;I think by the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;that there was a rebate or remission of the duty where coal is used for power purposes, but we could not find from the Minister where a remission was given.  I asked him specifically whether a remission was given to the Electricity Supply Board for the production of electricity in the Pigeon House, and I was told no.  Now, if there is, theoretically or in practice, a remission given anywhere, I should be curious to know, and I am sure more than I would be curious to know, where a remission of this 5/- is given in cases where coal is used for power or in industry.</P>

The City of Dublin had to stand that racket, but the Exchequer could not stand the racket of a remission of 5/- per ton on the coal used in the Pigeon House.  I am not surprised that Deputy Kelly yawns when he hears that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do&mdash;very seriously. Through you, Sir, I would ask the Minister to take it seriously, and to give the House some information as to why he will not accept this amendment by Deputy Mulcahy, or why he insists on collecting this tax off coal&mdash;<Col N="1668" /> not off British coal, but Irish coal. It is Irish coal when we have agreed to buy it.  It is here for our use, and not for British use.  It is coal which was necessary for the Irish people to get. If it was not necessary for us to get it we should not have allowed it in. We have agreed to take it in, and we are taking it in.  When the matter is in that position the Minister for Finance comes along and says &ldquo;Now, for every ton of that coal you use you must pay me 5/-.&rdquo;  That is increasing the price to the consumer.  Why does the Minister insist on doing that?  Is it because, as has been suggested here earlier, he wants to make the consumers of coal get into the front line trenches in the economic war?  If it is, when the people who are in the front line trenches are taken out of those trenches they should get some relief, but no relief has been offered. They are still going to be in the front line trenches.  Has the Minister, like King Louis, called up his last reserves?  Are these his last reserves? Is it the last throw of the dice?  If it is, tell us.  Is this the financial condition to which the country has been brought?  If it is, well then the sooner the whole present situation is reviewed the better.  If it is not, then the Minister ought to give us some reason why he proposes to continue this tax and rejects this amendment.</P>
