      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether he has been requested to prepare a new panel of persons to serve on Selection Boards appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners; and, if so, whether he intends to take any action in regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of Boards to interview candidates for local appointments is entirely at the discretion of the Local Appointments Commissioners, who, I understand, have received no request to prepare a new list of persons to serve on such Boards.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the lists of persons from which panels are prepared embrace every category of profession, qualification and experience necessary for the various posts to be filled, that these lists are kept constantly under review and that additions are made to them from time to time.</P>
      <P>I may add for the Deputy's information that when a Board is required, a panel of names drawn from the existing lists is submitted to the Commissioners by their secretary.  The Commissioners may either select the Board from the panel or go outside it if they so desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that a scheme was prepared some considerable time ago by the Fermoy Urban Council for clearing the islands at the northern side of the bridge in the town of Fermoy; if he is aware that the work is required to be done urgently, and if he will state when the scheme will be sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this project has been a matter of considerable local interest, but no specific proposals have reached me, and it is not clear that the work would have a direct bearing on the functions of my Department.  Perhaps the Deputy would be well advised to ask the promoters <Col N="4" /> of the scheme to bring it before the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether representations have been made to him to extend, by increasing or otherwise supplementing the tariff on certain imported articles, the protection afforded to the brush and broom trade; whether he is aware that previous extensions of the tariffs affecting this trade, while enabling home manufacturers to increase their output and their profits by the installation of modern machinery, actually diminished the amount of employment available in the trade for adult men; whether it was brought to his notice that the operatives are apprehensive that, if additional protection is afforded to the trade in existing circumstances, there will follow a further development of mechanisation and the consequent loss of employment for a large number of men employed on hand processes; and whether having regard to such representations he will be prepared before extending the tariffs on imported brush and broom wares to consult the men's union with a view to devising some means of providing employment in the trade for the men who are now unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that it would be in the public interest to give information in advance, indicating whether proposals for protection in particular industries have been received or to reveal in advance the nature of any representations which may have been made for or against such protection.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed regarding the employment of adult men in the brush and broom trade.  Statistics available in my Department show that employment for adult men has increased since additional protection was given to the industry in April, 1932, and on 1st September, 1934, was higher than at the corresponding date in any year since 1926, when such figures first became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the employment afforded by the various industries established in the Saorstát receives the <Col N="11" /> constant attention of my Department, and I am, at all times, prepared to consider official representations from responsible trade unions regarding this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister contend that in respect of the largest firm in this industry there is more adult employment available now than formerly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give any information concerning an individual firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear to the Minister that, far from being misinformed on the matter, I saw a deputation from the trade union concerned in this industry and they produced to me undeniable evidence that in respect of one firm in this industry the result of the tariffs already imposed has been the disemployment of male workers in that firm and their substitution by the employment of young girls who are employed in manipulating some of the new machines installed, and thus doing work at which men were formerly employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the number of adults employed in the industry was higher on the 30th September, 1934, than at the corresponding date of any year, and my information is that the percentage of unemployed workers in the trade union which caters for such workers is now lower than it has been for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he has obtained confirmation of that statement in respect of the largest firm in the industry or from the union concerned?  I want to say that my information is completely contrary to the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why it is not in the public interest to disclose the fact that requests had been received by him for protection in the case of a particular industry, and does he realise the position that if that fact is not disclosed the result <Col N="12" /> may be that for one reason or another those who would object to protection being afforded in a particular industry have no means of making known their views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures are always taken to ascertain the views of parties interested in matters of that kind, but it is obviously undesirable to indicate that proposals for protection in a particular industry had been received because it has been found by experience that in some cases this leads to forestalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>We may take it, I presume, that the mere knowledge of the fact that requests had been made for protection is not regarded by the Company concerned as equivalent to protection being granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience of the Government has been that when a question has been referred to the Tariff Commission of a proposal for a tariff even where it was not in the least likely to be recommended, it led nevertheless, to a considerable excess of imports taking place, and as a result people were very frequently involved in losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is likely that any further tariffs are to be imposed in respect of this industry will the Minister first take some means of ascertaining whether as a result of that tariff, adult male labour will be reduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of 22/6 per ton quoted by the Deputy is apparently the average c.i.f. price for the month of February for all household coal imported into the Saorstát, according to the official Trade Statistics.  This price is not, of course, comparable for many reasons with the average retail price of household coal in any particular district.</P>

On the basis of the Board's report he was <Col N="17" /> awarded a temporary pension of £120 per annum, plus a married pension of 9/- per week based on an assessment of 80 per cent. disability, for the period 1st April, 1932 up to the 31st December, 1933.  On the expiry of that award Mr. McCarthy was called for medical re-examination, but absented himself from hospital before the completion of his examination.  He subsequently intimated his willingness to submit himself for complete examination, and was examined in November, 1934.  The Army Pensions Board then reported that his degree of disability did not reach the minimum prescribed by the said Army Pensions Act, viz., 80 per cent., so that payment of pension could not be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Financial Resolution, there is very little change arising from the system we have followed for the last three years.  This levy covered by the Financial Resolution will be levied on creamery butter sold from the 1st April, 1935, and also on non-creamery butter from the 1st April, 1935, onwards, which is sold through a factory or a registered exporter or a person on whom a notice has been served. With regard to all other products, that is, farmers' butter, etc., no levy can be put on until the Bill goes through.  The levy is laid down under the Bill at 39/- per cwt. on butter until a new order is made under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to tell us more explicitly what the financial effect of the Bill will be.  In a Parliamentary Question, I asked the Minister how much money was raised during the year 1934 by way of levy, and he said the figures were given in reply to Deputy McGilligan on a recent occasion as £1,230,448.  In reply to a question as to how much was paid out by way of bounty from that levy, the answer as given on 20th March to Deputy Norton was £1,221,233.  When we dealt with the original Price Stabilisation Bill I put it to the Minister that when we took into consideration that the price of farmers' butter would be raised to the purchasing public, the increased cost to the consumer would be £1,487,000.  The Minister questioned that and, as reported in column 1376 of the Official Reports of the 4th May, 1932, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;We in our calculations gave the figure of £415,000 as the cost.&rdquo;  That is the cost to the consumer. Further on he said, referring <Col N="33" /> to the tariff:&mdash;&ldquo;If, however, we were to take the cost of the tariff and this thing combined&mdash;to take the two together which would, perhaps, be the fairer way to look at it&mdash;the cost would be about £610,000.&rdquo;  That is the cost to the consumer.  Under the scheme £1,230,000 was collected from the creameries and approximately the same sum was paid back.  That sum cheapened the butter to the British purchaser.  Can the Minister say how much is going to be collected now?  If we accept the figures given by the Minister in 1932, regarding the total amount of butter consumed here, which were very much smaller than the estimate put on consumption of butter on this side, he is only going to collect about £663,000.  The Minister told us at that time that the total consumption of creamery butter was 300,000 cwts., that only a small amount of factory butter was consumed, and 40,000 cwts. of farmers' butter sold for consumption in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the figures quoted by the Minister as regards the consumption of butter are correct, then, on the levy reported, the Minister is only going to collect £663,000.  Where is any change being made under the Bill?  I take it the Minister will deny that the farmers are going to receive less money for their butter or that the creameries are going to receive less money for the butter they sell.  Some of these financial details require to be cleared up by the Minister, and I think the House is entitled, on having this Resolution presented to it, to have a statement as to how the new procedure will affect the creameries, farmers and consumers. We hold, when we take into consideration the increase in the price of farmers' butter, that consumers in this country are paying £1,400,000 more for butter than they would have to pay if this Bill was not in operation; and more than butter consumers in England and in the North of Ireland would have to pay if they consumed the same amount of butter.  When asking the House to pass a Financial Resolution dealing with legislation that permanently increases by 5d. per lb. the cost of butter to consumers in the <Col N="34" /> Free State more than consumers in the Six Counties have to pay, we ought to have some rather detailed explanation of the financial effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I had not the good sense to look up what I may have said three years ago, but, at any rate, my forecast at the time was right for that year.  The amount collected would be about £400,000 were it not that the Emergency Fund was brought into operation and the creamery industry partly financed, and, therefore, the levies were not collected during part of the year.  Of course, Deputy Mulcahy is altogether wrong in assuming that the £1,400,000 is put on to the consumers.  Under the new system the consumers are going to be as well off, or as badly off, as they were for the last three years.  The farmers will be in the same position and the creameries will be in the same position. The only difference is that we are going to collect not more than half the levies we have collected for the last three years.  Really it is quite obvious it is only a matter of bookkeeping, and if it is only a matter of bookkeeping, and if we can reduce the levies from £1,400,000 down to half that amount, the case that the consumers have been paying that £1,400,000 does not hold. We are making this change; we are now only going to collect levies on butter sold at home, and because we are making that change, the levies drop practically by half, so that the consumers cannot complain that they are paying as a result of this legislation more than what was collected on levies.  It will amount in the coming year to £400,000 on creamery butter. I cannot say what it will amount to on non-creamery butter.  It will not, I am sure, be as much as that.  It may be considerably less, certainly something less.  We may take it that it will be somewhere around £700,000&mdash;at any rate, less than £800,000&mdash;and that is a very big difference from the amount levied in the last financial year.  Our calculations are based on a net return to the creameries of 100/- per cwt. That is what they got last year, so that we will be in the same position this year and it follows that the farmers <Col N="35" /> supplying creameries will be in the same position.  The price of butter to creameries will not be changed, so that we have the consumers and producers exactly in the same position, but by this change in legislation we are reducing levies by at least half.</P>

      <P>What the Minister says makes the situation even more remarkable.  In 1932 he told us that we consumed 300,000 cwts. of creamery butter, a small amount of factory butter and only 40,000 tons of farmers' butter.  The Minister now proposes a levy on farmers' butter as well as on butter sold by creameries in this country.  He expects to raise only £400,000 from the creameries and £300,000 from the farmers, so that while the creameries, the Minister expects, are going to get back £700,000 approximately as a result of the Financial Resolution, farmers who produce butter for sale here are going to provide £300,000 of that amount for the assistance of the creameries.  That is a point I should like to hear the Minister develop.  I should like the Minister to say in what way this is going to affect the production of butter and the amount of butter that will be exported. Will the difference of level between what an Englishman can buy Irish butter at and what a resident of the Free State can buy the same butter at be changed as a result of his operations? In the past an Englishman could buy Irish butter cheap by reason of the fact that £1,250,000 was paid as a subsidy to cheapen the cost of Irish butter in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  That amount of money will not be paid now.  Will that have any effect?</P>

How <Col N="36" /> does the Minister reconcile that?  Is not this whole business an attempt to make tax gatherers of the farmers who are at present manufacturing their own butter and supplying customers?  Who is going to pay the tax?  How are the farmers and the consumers going to be as well off while the Minister collects a tax of 4d. a lb. off them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, to all intents and purposes, is a continuation of the Dairy Produce Act, which was in operation for three years and which has just expired.  It has certain modifications which, from experience in the Department, were thought advisable.  The Principal Act was brought in in 1932 to maintain a higher price for butter on the home market.  I think, seeing that we are protecting certain industries here, and trying to give manufacturers and the workers in those factories a decent standard of living, if we had no export butter trade nobody would think it unreasonable to put a tariff on imported butter in order to give our own producers the price which we are trying to get them here, 141/- per cwt. During the 10 years from 1922 to 1932, until the original Act was brought in, the average price which creameries were getting for butter was something over 160/-.  A strange thing about it during those 10 years was that there was no great increase in the price of cows, so that it may be taken for granted that farmers were not making a fortune out of butter production during that time.  As I say, if we had no export surplus of butter or milk products, and if we were protecting the farmer here on the home market for the production of butter, it would not have been considered unreasonable to protect them at the level of say 140/- per cwt. for butter in the creamery. If we did that, the consumer here would have no great complaint.  He could not complain any more than if we were to protect say boots or clothes or anything else.  The fact that we placed butter at that level and then asked the creameries to contribute into <Col N="38" /> a fund in order to finance their own exports is no concern of the consumer at all.  I do not see how the consumer comes into it.  If the creameries wish to cut down products and cut out export they may have that 140/- for themselves, and the consumer is in the same position.  Whether they increase or decrease their export is their own look-out.  If they increase their export they get less for their butter per cwt.; if they decrease their export they get more for their butter per cwt. but the consumer here remains the same all the time.</P>
      <P>Under this stabilisation plan the Department of Agriculture is managing the fund.  Under the Pigs and Bacon Bill there is a different arrangement; the trade itself is taking up the management of the stabilisation fund. We can do the same here&mdash;and probably ought to do the same in the near future&mdash;and that is to bring in a Bill to hand over this whole business to the creameries themselves, or to the butter producers, whether they are creameries or farmers, and let them manage their own stabilisation fund. There is nobody here unreasonable enough to object to the protection of the producer of butter here on his own market at a fair price, and surely 140/- is a fair price, considering that they were getting 160/- for ten years previously.  There has been a lot of talk during the last three years from Cumann na nGaedheal financial experts in the country&mdash;especially when speaking to what they believed to be ignorant farmers, and more especially, of course, when they believe they are speaking to ignorant consumers in the towns&mdash;to the effect that we are raising levies here and making our own people pay more for butter in order to give cheap butter to John Bull.  We are getting the same price from John Bull as we would if there were no Bill, and practically the same price from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

I say the <i>Irish Times</i> because I presume that is the paper which he reads. Whatever it is, it is higher above New Zealand than it was two or three years ago.  Free State butter is classed as colonial butter, because it is made from unripened cream.  In many other ways it is the same as Australian or New Zealand butter.  Previous to the introduction of the Stabilisation Bill three years ago we were, on an average, 7/- below New Zealand.  Now we are, on an average, 3/- below New Zealand, so we are coming nearer to the New Zealand figure, although they say we are raising levies off our own consumers to give John Bull cheap butter.  That shows how ridiculous are the arguments of General Mulcahy and Deputies like him that we are putting levies on the consumers here for that purpose.  I have pointed out that we are going to give the same terms to the farmer and the same terms to the consumer, so that ought to show any reasonable person that Deputy Mulcahy's arguments during the last three years are just nonsense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  I was going to say that I wondered whether it is any use telling the Deputy.  The policy we have been adopting during the last three years was to take a levy on all butter produced in the creamery and on non-creamery butter acquired by those who came under the Act.  That undoubtedly created certain inconveniences to the creameries and to the buyers, because very often a creamery, when first turning out large quantities of butter and having to pay a levy at the end of the month without having disposed of the butter, found itself in serious financial trouble and had to borrow money to tide it over the <Col N="40" /> period.  If it could not borrow the money, which was often the case owing to other circumstances, it had to throw the butter on the home market in order to get ready cash.  The result was that a serious element of competition was introduced into the home market which had the effect of bringing the price of butter on the home market down lower than it should be. That meant that they got no benefit, because, if butter is supposed to be sold at 141/- and if prices are supposed to be fixed on that basis, if the distributors can get 138/- or 139/-, they will keep the margin for themselves and it will not be passed on to the consumer.  It is proposed to change that system under this Bill and to put the levy on butter as it is sold.  In that way, it will be easier for the creameries to finance their business. It is also proposed under this Bill to take a levy on butter sold at home and not on butter exported.  That is where the difference comes in.</P>
      <P>The levies will be much smaller this year than last year.  The difference is that the levies are only being collected on butter consumed at home, and not on butter exported, as has been done for the last two or three years; so that every penny we collect this year is from the home consumer, which means that we are only going to collect half what we collected last year, although Deputy Mulcahy has been quoting very large figures as to the amount of the levies to be collected.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have recognised that before now.  Suppose our exports were equal to home consumption. The plan was that we collected 1/- from the export of <Col N="41" /> butter and 1/- from the home butter, and that we gave that 2/- to the butter going out.  That meant that the exporter had to pay 2/- and had 1/- extra for himself.  He now has to pay 1/- with the same advantage.  That is the whole difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed, therefore, to collect levies only on home sales and not on butter exported.  It is also proposed to fix a minimum price on home sales.  I stated already that it was impossible to fix a minimum price on home sales here so long as the former system obtained, because creameries, having to pay a levy before selling their butter, found it impossible to finance their business, and found that they had to get cash quickly if they exported their butter.  They had to wait for a considerable time for the bounty, and, therefore, they were tempted to throw their butter on the home market in order to get the full amount.  Having removed that difficulty by financing, it will be possible, I believe, to maintain a minimum price on home sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another defect in the 1932 Act.  That defect, in my opinion, is the provision in regard to a levy on non-creamery butter.  The levy was only payable by certain persons registered under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  In addition to that, we had power to serve notice on any particular person who was doing business in butter, such as, for instance, a grocer in a provincial town who was buying a considerable amount of farmers' butter and retailing it to customers.  We did serve notice on many of these people, during the last year especially&mdash;over 4,000, I think.  No man in the butter trade was doing anything illegal, in that connection, under the last Act, unless we served notice upon him.  The <Col N="42" /> change in this Bill is that it is illegal for him to do so unless he himself applies for a licence.  It means that we are putting the onus on him rather than on the Department of Agriculture to serve notice, and in that way we hope to get a very big increase in the amount of levy that will be collected.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is so.  Deputy Belton should be careful. He should not make a statement like that in this manner.  It would be better for him to put it in the form of a question.  These farmers&mdash;a majority of them&mdash;were selling butter to the grocers.  In my experience, at any rate, what they did was that they sold, perhaps, 10 lbs. or 12 lbs. per week during the eight winter months, but when it came to the summer months the grocer was unable to take much more than that, and, as a result, they had to sell three-fourths of it to an exporter&mdash;the grocer either passing it through a factory or arranging for it to be exported.  During the summer months they were only getting somewhere about 6d. or 7d. a lb.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get as high a bounty on the export of non-creamery butter as on creamery butter.  That has not been the case in the last few years, but now the bounty will be the same.  Under the present Bill there will always be the same relation between creamery and non-creamery butter, whether there is a surplus or a scarcity of either kind of butter.  In the past, when there was a surplus of non-creamery butter it was sold at very low prices, but in future it should hold the same ratio to intrinsic value as creamery butter, so that the farmer who is going to pay levies under this Bill will be better off, in my opinion, because he will be getting his fair share of the pool.</P>

      <P>As I said already, no butter trader was bound, under the last Act, to pay levies unless we had first served them with notice under the Act. Our inspectors from the Department did send in quite a number of names, and other people who are interested sent in more names.  We did, I believe, collect a levy off most of the buyers of butter in the towns throughout the country, but in the small remote villages we did not collect it at all.  It is better that we should try to treat everybody on the same basis and make it illegal for any person to deal in butter in future unless he comes under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, the Bill follows mainly the lines of the original Act.  I want to follow it as it is set out.  The first four sections do not raise any difficulty.  Section 5 provides that all levies due under the 1932 Act should be paid into the butter fund, and all bounties due under that Act should be paid out of the fund.  Also it provides for the punishment of offences committed under that Act.  Section 6 deals with the registers.  There will be a register of producers and a register of distributors.  The producer who sells his butter direct to a consumer or sells to a non-registered person must be registered.  A distributor who buys from a non-registered person must be registered.  The producer must be registered himself or sell to a registered person, subject to an exception where the amount he is supplying is small.  From the beginning it will be possible to control the dealings in butter and the levy will be collected. If the producer is not registered, making returns and paying levies, he must sell to a person who is registered and who makes returns and pays levies.</P>

Section 9 sets out the fees on applications for registration or for renewal.  The fee in the case of a producer of non-creamery butter is 5/- and in the case of distributors the fee is £1.</P>

      <P>No, he does not get a halfpenny.  Section 10 deals with the certificate of registration and it does not offer any difficulty.  Section 11 sets out the people who can or cannot trade in butter.  Under sub-section (3) you will see that no unregistered person is permitted to trade in butter except a person who sells to a person who is registered in the register of distributors of non-creamery butter.  That is, a producer, though not registered himself, is quite entitled to sell his butter to a registered person.  The person who purchases from a registered person is also exempt.  That is, a shopkeeper or anybody else who buys all his butter from a registered person is exempt and he is not committing any offence.</P>

The remaining sections, until we come to Section 16, are sections with regard to registration.  Under Section 16 an exemption licence may be given to a farmer who is selling butter direct to a consumer if the butter is made from the milk of his own cows and the quantity is under the maximum prescribed and that it is not sold for resale.  In addition to that <Col N="48" /> the Minister may attach other conditions. The penalty for any breach of this section is £2.  Anyway the point is that the farmer may supply butter to any quantity under 5lbs. a week, and if it is not given for resale he is exempt from paying any levy.</P>

      <P>Probably.  Section 20 brings in a special provision for the Kerry cattle area.  Some Deputies may ask why the Kerry cattle area was chosen.  It is because there is a comparatively big amount of milk in that area for its size and particularly because of the valuations of the land in that area.  It is considered, according to any advice I have got on the matter, absolutely impossible to get an economic creamery system in that area.  We are, therefore, driven to try and develop and improve the farmers' butter in that area because creameries could not be maintained there so as to bring every farmer within, say, three and a half or four miles' reach of a creamery.  It would be impossible to bring some farmers, at any rate, within seven or eight miles of a creamery.  Most of them are small farmers and for the small amount of milk they have it would be very hard to expect them to go six or seven miles per day to a creamery.  It is much better for them, under all these circumstances, that we should try to give them for the farmers' butter as good a price as if they were supplying milk to a creamery.  They will not have to go out daily as they would have to a creamery.  They will only have to go once a week to the butter market.  They have facilities for making farmers' butter and have been doing it for a good many years. The only thing necessary is to improve it.  One of the measures that might be taken to improve it would be to grade it, because there was no inducement in that area in the past to produce good farmers' butter.  Whether they produced good or bad butter, they got the same price.  One farmer did not see the advantage of producing really good butter while his neighbour, who produced bad, dirty butter, got the same price.  Under this section we can give a different price or, if you like, exact different levies on grades one, two and three butter and try and get them to improve and produce first-class butter, as they are capable of doing if they get encouragement.</P>

We have a well-defined area, an area which is just as entitled, from the point of view of milk supply, as practically any other place to get whatever help the State gives for the provision of creameries. But, on account of the terribly hilly nature of the district and the difficulty of getting roads from one place to another, it would be impossible to provide creameries within reach of every farmer.</P>

      <P>Sections 21, 22 and 23 do not give rise to any difficulty.  Section 24 is for the prohibition of the import of butter, and Section 25 gives power to collect a levy in case the butter is imported.  It is a rather new principle perhaps.  It is not a tariff. Any levy collected will be paid into the fund in case butter has to be imported, which is not, I think, likely. For the last three years we have not had to import butter at any time, with certain exceptions where a small quantity was taken in perhaps on a few occasions and again exported for one reason or another.  Part V deals with the restriction on the importation of milk and milk products.  It is the same thing as the restriction on the imports of butter, with the exception that we cannot collect a levy in that case.  By Part VI we may prohibit exports.  Having prohibited exports we may also license certain people to export.  Exactly the same provision appears in the Act of 1932.

      <P>I can foresee where that sub-section would be necessary.  We had to stop the export of butter last September.  Then the German agreement came along and we had to license someone to export butter in order to keep that particular market going until the flush season came on again in April.  A licence was given to the Dairy Disposals Company to fulfil that contract.  But suppose we issued a licence to someone to export butter and found, perhaps after two or three months, that it had not been availed of, we might issue a licence when we have a sufficiency of butter to meet a particular contract.  After two or three months if a licensee had not availed of a licence, we might feel that we had not sufficient butter and might revoke the licence.</P>

      <P>Section 40 compels a person who enters into a contract to supply butter to quote at the minimum price.  If an order is issued changing the minimum price then, though a contract has been made on the existing minimum price, the contractors must also change the price. The fund is dealt with in Section 41. Into that fund we will pay anything that may remain under the 1932 Act, which is only a small amount, and also all money for licences and fees under this Act.  Some time ago Deputy Belton said that the Minister for Finance was going to collect all the moneys.  He is not.  They will go into this fund, as well as all levies collected. Out of the fund we are paying the bounties due under the 1932 Act and the bounties due under this Bill, as well as the salaries of any temporary staff of inspectors that may be employed for the purposes of the Act. There is provision for ordered marketing. The fund is exhausted at a certain period of the year, when it is £100,000 in debt maybe, but it comes back to level on March 31st, the end of the year.  It has been the experience for the last three years that in October we must borrow to maintain the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make sure that it does not.  We can now come to the last section, dealing with the question of marketing.  At the time the Act of <Col N="56" /> 1932 was going through, a number of Deputies made a strong plea that we should do something for ordered marketing. I found it impossible to do anything at that time, because there was great prejudice in the creamery industry against central marketing.  In fact that prejudice lasted, I might say, almost up to recently.  Now there is a different feeling on the question.  I think I can say that we have almost an unanimous feeling in the creamery industry for some sort of ordered marketing.  The position is this, that some creameries had good contracts in Great Britain, and when that was found out by other creameries they came along and cut the price, perhaps by offering butter at 1/- or 2/- per cwt. less.  Great damage was done in that way.  Even a single creamery might be selling butter to a fairly good customer and, having a surplus, might sell the remainder to a competitor of that customer at a few shillings less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those things are sometimes found out, and of course naturally the creamery would lose its first good customer, and its price would be down a few shillings per cwt.  They were gradually cutting each other in this way, and the price was not realised that we should have realised on the British market.  We had the whole question examined.  We got a return from every creamery in the country showing exactly where each creamery sent all its butter last year.  We found there were very few creameries maintaining a regular connection in the British market.  Evidently the big majority of them were changing around from one place to another according to the price.  Although that particular deal perhaps&mdash;the particular deal which they made in the month of May last year&mdash;may have been 1/- or 2/- better than sticking to the customer they had, it was very bad policy in the long run. In face of this prejudice which there was against getting creameries together for some sort of ordered market, the only thing we could do under the last Bill was to try to encourage the good sellers by giving an equal subsidy to all.  In the beginning there was a demand made from some quarters that we should bring everybody's price up to a certain level.  We did not do that. <Col N="57" /> We took the average selling price of all good creameries for a month.  Suppose we were bringing the price up to 100/-, and suppose the average price which they all realised was 72/-, including the Government subsidy, then the bounty payable under the Bill was the difference between the two.  It was calculated in that way.  Of course the person who was getting a good price had that advantage all the time over the person getting the bad price.  That was all we could do over the last three years.  It was not much, and did not improve things very much in regard to getting the maximum that could be got in the British market.</P>
    <P>We find that there are certain centres in Great Britain flooded with Irish butter at certain times, particularly, of course, the ports which are nearer to this country, while there are other large centres which would take our butter if any creamery would send it. The point is that the freight to those particular centres might be higher.  For instance, the freight to Newcastle is higher than the freight to Liverpool, but there is no doubt that with a small amount of Free State butter in Newcastle as compared with Liverpool it might get a higher price.  However, no creamery wants to take the risk of paying a few shillings more per cwt. before it is sure that it will have that advantage on the further away market. It is only by having some sort of organisation to combine them together, and let the organisation take the risk of trying new markets and taking a certain amount of butter off the markets which we are flooding, that that can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Deputy were to examine the figures of the surprise butter inspections he would find that over ninety per cent. of our creameries may now be treated as first class.  The percentage is gone <Col N="58" /> up from something like 72 per cent. to 94 per cent. in the past few years.  Even on the surprise inspections we cannot catch them out as making bad butter. A few months ago we got together the people interested in the creamery butter industry generally.  It was a very representative meeting, and we had some discussion on this matter of ordered marketing.  We did not go further than that; we did not even mention the words central marketing, because as I have said there is such a prejudice against it.  I thought we might aim at least at getting some sort of fixed contracts for the year between the creameries and the buyers on the other side.  It is not necessary that a creamery here should supply 100 cwts. of butter every week of the 52 weeks to the people on the other side.  The people on the other side have told us that they do not want that nor do they expect it.  What they do want is to know beforehand what amount of butter they may expect.  If they take one hundred or two hundred cwts. of butter during the month of April from a certain creamery, and if that creamery gets a 1/- more from somebody else in the month of May, and goes away, they do not want it back again. We got those creameries together and asked them if they would be prepared at least to give an indication of the amount of butter they would have for export during the six or seven months in which they export, the amount for each month, and whom they would be likely to sell it to.  We thought we could also perhaps fix a price.  The Danes do that.  Perhaps we have not reached that stage yet, but at any rate we thought we should aim at fixing a price.  We got a Committee set up as a result of that rather large meeting. There is now a Committee dealing with that matter which I believe has the confidence of the creamery industry in general.  There are three creamery managers, three suppliers and two exporters on that Committee.  They are examining the possibilities of getting ordered and regulated marketing as far as possible.  They believe that they have to go slowly.  They believe that they cannot launch out immediately into any sort of central marketing <Col N="59" /> organisation, but that they ought to go slowly, try to get some regulation in the market, and try to get the best that possibly can be got from the export market.  We then got the bigger buyers from Great Britain to come across.  They came here in two groups. The agents came on one occasion and the big wholesalers or distributors came on another occasion.  They are very willing to fall in with and in fact welcome the suggestion of some sort of ordered marketing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That may be reached at a later stage.  It is admitted by everybody concerned that our butter is as good, and, in fact, better.  As a matter of fact, we believe that it is better here, but they admit that it is at least as good as the New Zealand butter, and there is no reason why we should not get the same price under an orderly regulated marketing scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that the Danish problem is a different question.  Unless New Zealand and Australia were to combine with us to try to get the same price in the British market, we cannot do much in that direction.  We cannot go far above them.  Danish butter is a different butter and has been getting a much higher price.  It is made from ripe cream, is sold in casks and so on, and is sold in different markets from the New Zealand, Australian and Irish, and has gone away very far at times from these butters.  How we can come nearer to Danish butter, however, unless the New Zealand and Australian sellers are prepared to do something to co-operate with us in the way of putting up the price, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to say, in conclusion, on this point, that this particular Committee is a provisional Committee, and that it is hoped that, if they meet with any success and get the whole-hearted support of the creameries throughout the country, we may be able to get the creameries to form some sort of society under, say, the Provident Societies Act, which would be a legal entity and <Col N="61" /> which would do business on their behalf and would be elected by them in the ordinary way in which the committee of a friendly society would be elected.  Apart from that, there is nothing else arising out of this Bill that we need touch on, in my opinion.  If there is, I should be only too glad to deal with it as soon as I have an opportunity to do so during the course of the debate.  The only other question is with regard to two Schedules.  The First Schedule may be confusing to Deputies because it says that the rate of bounty on creamery butter is £1 5s. per cwt. and that, on non-creamery butter which was in the ownership and possession of the exporter on 31st March, 1935, the rate of bounty is £1 12s. 8d. per cwt.  The reason for that is that that butter, in the exporter's possession on the 31st March, would have been entitled, had the other Act been continued, to a bounty of £1 12s. 8d.  The quantity involved is only a small quantity. There is only a small amount of money involved and it is sufficient to pay on the amount of butter which is there to be exported, and that amount can be paid as soon as this Act goes through. Under the new Act, however, where we collect a levy, it will only provide a bounty of 25/- and, therefore, 25/- is laid down as the bounty under this Act. It will be noticed that there is the same bounty on all other non-creamery butter, and bounties on tinned cream, raw cheese, and so on.  These bounties are based on the butter-fat content and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Second Schedule, I have already mentioned that 141/- per cwt. is fixed for home sales of butter of not less than 20 cwts. in Dublin, and, where less, 145/-.  Outside Dublin, the wholesale limit is put down as 5 cwts. instead of 20 cwts.</P>

      <P>The Minister displayed some irritation when I interjected a comment on what has been said by his Leader and his associates on a prior occasion about the British market; but I think it is an interesting comment and something that Deputy Brady ought to listen to with care, because he, and people like him, believe that President de Valera thinks that the British market is gone. A great many innocent people in this country take the same view, as a result of such statements.  Now, however, they listen to the Minister for Agriculture, when he is really talking business and coming down to the hard tacks of his Department, saying quite blandly: &ldquo;I asked the British people to come over here and talk to me, and they say, &lsquo;Send us all the butter you have so long as you let us know in time what quantities you have for disposal&rsquo;.&rdquo; The Minister says here that these British distributors are willing and anxious to co-operate with us not only in that regard but that there is no limit to what they will take from us if we will only let them know beforehand what quantities we have for disposal. In view of such statements, would Deputy Victory and Deputy Brady take note of that and realise that they are only being made fools of when President de Valera gets up in <Col N="63" /> Ennis and says that the British market is gone?  Would Deputy Victory and Deputy Brady realise that when President de Valera says that, he is only saying it for the purpose of impressing on the virgin minds of Deputy Brady and Deputy Victory that they should have some sense of responsibility and that they should not allow themselves to be made fools of on the platforms of this country at the instigation of President de Valera or anybody else?  The market is not gone. Even if President de Valera and others of the Cabinet would say: &ldquo;The British market is gone, thank God,&rdquo; the Minister for Agriculture says that the market is still here; that it has not gone; and the Minister for Agriculture goes on to say that if only our own producers would co-operate with the British distributors, a great many of our difficulties would be solved for all time.  Would these Deputies get that into their heads and would they apologise to their constituents and say that they now believe that President de Valera was only making fools of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken to-day about central marketing.  To hear the Minister speak of it one would imagine the problems to which he referred to-day were of yesterday's growth.  These are problems that have perplexed the butter-producing industry for the last ten years.  May I say that so far as I am concerned the Minister will have all the help and co-operation I am in a position to give him in instituting some kind of a central marketing system which will place our exporters in a position to deal with the British distributors on an equal footing?  Where you have a number of creameries competing against one another for the custom of individuals in the British distributing trade it means that our creameries are at the mercy of the British wholesale distributors.  I have a considerable experience of the applications which one receives from British wholesale distributors where they ask you to forecast accurately the quantity of the commodity that <Col N="64" /> you want to sell them and add: &ldquo;We have no difficulty in distributing it, but we must know in advance what you are going to send us.&rdquo;  The Minister knows as well as I do that it is not always possible to give an accurate forecast of what one particular unit in the creamery industry will be able to ship in any given week, but it is possible to forecast, with pretty considerable accuracy what the entire industry will have for disposal from time to time.</P>
    <P>If you could once bring all the product of the industry which it was intended to export into the hands of one central authority, that central authority would find it a comparatively easy thing to advise his consignees what quantities he would expect them to take in a given period. Furthermore, I will submit that when this central marketing is set on foot we should make a very vigorous endeavour to grade our marketable produce.  At the present time in the Department's surprise inspections a very close and exhaustive grading is done on the basis of which marks are awarded.  Certain creameries are distinguished for the excellence of their produce as compared with the local competitors.  I would like to see the Minister examining the possibilities of grading the butter for the export market and setting the seal of Departmental approval on certain butter as being first grade butter, on other butter as being second grade butter, and I expect there would be other butter perhaps of a grade which he would not recommend for sale to retail customers, but of a grade which ought to be confined to the confectioners' trade or for utilisation in some other similar way. I have not the slightest doubt that if the Minister would do that a great deal of the difficulties we have to face in the British market will disappear.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, quite casually, that Danish butter is making 20/- a cwt. more than our butter on the British market.  That does not seem to surprise him.  He seems to think we ought to be very grateful that we can keep neck and neck with New Zealand and Danish butter.  We <Col N="65" /> have beaten Danish butter on the British market; on certain occasions we have got a couple of shillings more than has been got for Danish butter on the British market.  Within the last few years we have got as big a price as Denmark has got for her butter in the British market.  May I submit to the Minister that if he can do two things, one, to reform the system of marketing on the lines I have suggested and, two, stimulate winter dairying in this country&mdash; secure that our producers will be in a position to supply their customers not only in the plentiful summer months but in the scarce winter months as well&mdash;we may reasonably expect not only to get as good a price for Irish butter on the London market or any other part of the British market as Denmark is getting, but a better price?  That ought to be the ambition that should be set before us.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is imprudent in implying, publicly, that he is contented with a situation wherein Irish butter is valued 20/- a cwt. lower than Danish butter.  That does not reflect the true values of the two commodities and it is only because we are failing to market our butter efficiently and failing to maintain all the year round supplies that our butter is not making as much as Danish.  That is the kind of position the Minister could really remedy if he would put his mind to it, if he would make up his mind once and for all that the British market is not gone, thank God, and if he would adhere strictly to his North Wall declaration that the British market is now, and forever will be, the best market we have in which to dispose of our agricultural surplus.</P>
    <P>Those general principles arise on the consideration of this Bill.  The Minister has gone into the Bill in great detail.  I prefer to state three grounds upon which I think this Bill ought to be opposed.  One is because it perpetuates the system of providing for the necessary subsidy by way of a levy.  If it seems necessary to the Legislature, that we must have, during a period of crisis and difficulty, <Col N="66" /> an artificial price for butter in order to carry on the dairying industry while world conditions are in confusion, then my submission is that such subsidy as may be necessary should be charged on the supply services. There is no logical reason at all, if you have to raise £400,000 or £500,000 for the dairying or any other industry, why you should raise it from a group of the community arbitrarily selected, such as the butter consumers.  Why are they any more liable for the social duty of carrying on this industry in a time of crisis than any other section of the community?</P>
    <P>I say it is highly undesirable to finance a subsidy of this kind through the medium of a levy and that the Minister should come to the House, boldly and courageously, tell the House what sum is necessary to provide the assistance which the industry requires if it is to survive, and ask the House to provide the money at the expense of the general taxpayer and not at the expense of one particular section of the community. There is a dual advantage.  Firstly, the burden is farily spread and secondly, the Legislature is in a position to perceive at all times what the necessary step for the protection of the industry is costing, and there is no concealment such as takes place under the system of raising levies and putting these charges on to the retail price of butter in this country instead of letting the article sell at the most advantageous price here or at the world price and assist the industry by such subventions as may be necessary from the supply services.</P>
    <P>I say that specially because it seems to me that there is force, and that is the second reason why I object to this Bill.  I object, and my contention is that we are paying inflated prices for butter in this country in order to provide cheap butter for a foreign market. I entirely agree that owing to world conditions something must be done to carry on the dairying industry until world conditions rectify themselves and until economic prices are forthcoming for dairy products.  But in the meantime, if it is absolutely necessary to <Col N="67" /> dispose of any butter on the part of the dairying industry at about 77/- per cwt., surely it is our own people who should get the advantage of such a state of affairs.  Surely there is no conceivable sense in saying that the poor person in Dublin must pay 1/5 a lb. for butter whereas a similar person in Manchester can get the same quality butter at 10d. a lb.  Owing to this levy system we are making the consumer of butter carry the whole burden.  If we were to make the taxpayer carry the burden we would make the butter cheaper for our own people instead of charging 1/5 a lb. for it here as against 10d. a lb. in Manchester and the English cities.  If we were to sell the butter here at 10d. a lb. the result would be that the sale of margarine would be wiped out.  Would not that be a very good plan?  Would it not be much more desirable than shipping it abroad at nearly half the price at which it is being sold at home?  If the butter has got to be disposed of at a cheap rate, why not dispose of it at home at a price at which our own people and those who are constrained by economic circumstances to eat margarine could purchase butter instead?</P>

      <P>Has Deputy Dillon made any calculation as to what scope there is for an increased sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very great.  Indeed it would be enormous if the price were reduced to what it is in England, but I have not made the calculation to which Deputy Moore refers.  The suggestion has been made by the Minister that there is a close analogy between the principle of this Bill and the principle underlying the Pigs and Bacon Bill.  How the Minister responsible for the two Bills could say such a thing astonishes me.  There is no analogy whatever between the two Bills.  What the Pigs and Bacon Bill is designed to do is to level out the price curve.  The purpose of that Bill is to avoid undue fluctuations in the prices and to adapt the industry to the quotas in Great Britain.  As to that, there is no question whatever of getting artificial prices by subsidising exports and charging high prices at <Col N="68" /> home.  It may happen sometimes that we would be able to get better prices for bacon in Great Britain than in the Saorstát.  The very reverse is the case in regard to butter.  So there is no analogy whatever between the regulation system in the Pigs and Bacon Bill and the regulations about to be set up here.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the third objection, and it is a very grave one.  That is a proposal to extend the levy system to the manufacturers of home-made butter.  Section 20, the Minister himself admits, is going to impose a great hardship.  The Minister recognises that.  In parts of the County Kerry where he knows that the erection of creameries is unthinkable, he says that it would be an unjust and indefensible hardship to apply the levy rates provided in the Bill to the products of the farmers in that area.  I must confess that as I listened to him&mdash;and I listened to him with great attention&mdash; I did not hear him defend at all the justice of the proposal he is making.  The Minister said that the producer of the home-made butter will pay the levy, but that he will be getting an increased price if the butter is exported.  What the Minister seems to have forgotten is that in practice the producer of the home-made butter will go in and sell his butter to a wholesale factor who will be scrupulous to deduct the levy from the price of the butter. But that wholesale factor will sell it to the manufacturer, who will blend it into factory butter and possibly export it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that the bounty on the export is going to travel back to the farmer who sold the butter in the first case?  Am I not right in saying that the moment the butter is sold to the registered factor the levy must be paid, and the registered factor can only hope to recover that levy by getting it from the butter manufacturers?  Then we must depend on them to pass it back to the producer of the butter.  But suppose, as will inevitably happen in the flush period when there is more butter in the hands of the producers than they can sell, there will be competition for the custom of the butter factor, who <Col N="69" /> will be in a position to say to the producer: &ldquo;If you do not like my price you can leave it,&rdquo; do not we all know that what will happen is that the butter producer will have to take the best price he can get, and that price will, in fact, be substantially less than he would get for the butter if this whole system of levy were left out of the question altogether?  At the present time there is an artificial price for butter similar to that in the Schedule to the Bill&mdash;141/- and 145/- per cwt. When a person comes in with a firkin of butter, the country shopkeeper is open to buy that firkin of butter or else order butter from the creamery. If he orders from the creamery he has got to know that he has to pay the creamery at least 141/-.  The country person offering the firkin of butter knows that too, and if the shopkeeper offers the woman 9d. or 10d. a pound she can say: &ldquo;Why should you offer me 9d. or 10d. when you are buying creamery butter at 1/3¾d a lb.?&rdquo;  And on this occasion she is probably able to sell the firkin of butter at 12d. or 13d. a lb. according to the demand that obtains at the moment and according, of course, to the quality of the butter in the firkin.  I am, from my own experience, prepared to say that a good firkin of butter at present is worth at least 1/- per lb.  What will it be worth when this Bill comes into operation?</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of the question. The second aspect is that this Bill requires every producer of butter to register if he proposes to sell his butter to a shopkeeper or to a factory unless the shopkeeper or factory is registered. I do not know what the Minister's own forecast is, but I am quite satisfied that the vast majority of producers will not register, because they have no facilities for keeping official records or for conforming to the regulations.  If they do not register, do Deputies realise that they will not be allowed to sell, according to the Minister's forecast, more than 5lbs. of butter in the week?  So that if they have half a dozen customers who take a couple of lbs. of butter apiece from them they have to throw that business away unless they are prepared to register <Col N="70" /> and keep all these documents which a Department requires, particularly if the Department of Finance is interested in the records to be kept.  If a country person, selling her 12lbs. of butter to her neighbour, fails to keep her documents correctly, she is liable to very heavy penalties and is unquestionably guilty of defrauding the Revenue.  Is it conceivably possible that this House desires that every woman in the country who sells a few lbs. of butter weekly to a neighbour is to be turned into a registered butter factory?  If you do not intend that, then I suggest that this Bill ought to be either rejected or amended.  I doubt if the Minister will contemplate amendments sufficiently comprehensive to admit of the exclusion of the domestic producers of butter.  If he will not, then I suggest to him that he must withdraw the Bill and confine its operations to the creameries in the country.</P>
    <P>There is very grave danger of a system of dragooning the people growing up in this country and becoming an every-day practice.  I entirely agree with the Minister that, in face of modern conditions, it may be necessary to give Government help to industries to organise themselves to meet modern conditions of trade.  But there is a very wide difference between that and a universal bureaucracy that wants to intrude itself into everybody's home.  There has been from time immemorial a desirable and lucrative little business conducted by the farmers of this country in the manufacture of butter in their own kitchens and in their own dairies and in the sale of the product to their neighbours.  To my mind that is a desirable and admirable institution.  This Bill is directed to destroy that system. Deputies should realise that in so far as that is its purpose the Bill is a bad Bill and should be rejected.  In so far as the Bill is directed to carrying on, in these difficult times, the dairying industry and to promoting the cause of central marketing, and in so far as it is directed towards showing the Minister's determination to develop winter dairying, the Bill is good.  In so far as it intends to finance its operations out of a levy from butter, with <Col N="71" /> the result that the poor of this country must pay 1/5 per lb., while the people of Great Britain can buy our butter for 10d. per lb.; in so far as it is designed to exact a levy on the domestic producer of butter and to make an end of that highly desirable system of agriculture which has obtained in this country for a very long time, the Bill is a bad one.  On the ground of its application to these aspects of the question, I strongly urge the House to reject the Bill, to require the Minister to redraft the whole measure in such a way as will meet the necessities of the situation without the damage which the measure, as it at present stands, might do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the previous Act has expired, I expect the Minister had perforce to bring in some measure to help him to continue the dairying industry.  We all hoped that when the necessity arose to bring in a new measure some better provisions would have been introduced than are offered in this Bill, and that the price guaranteed to the farmers would have been higher than it has been hitherto, instead of being one or two shillings less per cwt.  Unfortunately, we are engaged in what is commonly called an economic war, and, being engaged in a war of any kind, it is natural to expect from any Parliament responsible for the carrying on of things that the people in the front-line trenches who are bearing the brunt of the war should be put in a position to help them to carry on the war.  If one is engaged in a military war one takes good care that the soldiers are properly equipped.  They have their necessities provided for in the way of arms and equipment; their dependents are also provided for, and all this is done at the expense of the Exchequer. We have no such system in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objections to the Bill are that the price guaranteed to the farmers is not a just one; that 100/- per cwt. for butter in the present circumstances is not a price that farmers can carry on with.  Even if all the dire effects of the economic war did not exist, 100/- a cwt. would not be a price which would really maintain a farmer and help him <Col N="72" /> to carry on dairying.  If we take into account the other difficulties that the farmer is labouring under in carrying on this war, the other losses he has to incur, 100/- a cwt. is an absolutely uneconomic price to offer him for his butter.</P>
    <P>In this debate I do not want to go further away from the question of butter and dairy produce than I can help.  On reading over the measure I saw that it was necessary for the Minister to have a definition of dairy produce lest anyone might be confused. I have, at various times, ventured to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that butter and milk do not constitute the whole produce of dairy farming; that there are other things to be considered. The Minister knows of cattle and calves, to mention one branch, where the losses on the output of dairy farmers are a good deal more than the loss on the milk side.  To suggest that 100/- per cwt. guaranteed for butter is going to be any adequate compensation to farmers for the war they are helping to carry on is absurd. A certain body brought it to the Minister's attention recently that anything less than 120/- guaranteed for butter would not be sufficient to meet even the cost of production. That suggestion was made by a body competent to speak for the dairying industry.  As a practical dairy farmer representing a county of dairy farmers, I can state definitely that 120/- per cwt. would not meet the cost of production of milk.  At the rate of 120/- it would not pay to produce milk.  Something better than this Bill must be provided if dairying is to be carried on and if the war lasts indefinitely.</P>
    <P>My second objection to the Bill is that it brings in a section of farmers not included previously.  I am referring to small farmers who produce butter and who are now to be subject to the ramifications of this measure.  If any class of farmers should be left out, it is the class partly left out under the previous Act; small farmers who produce a small amount of butter in outlying places.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, the Minister has seen <Col N="73" /> the difficulty in relation to Kerry farmers.  I should say that a greater number of farmers in other places will labour under precisely the same difficulties.  In the mountainous and craggy parts there are small farmers who produce a small amount of butter. That helps them to exist.  It is now proposed to deny them whatever little advantages they had.  I strongly object to that.  The loss on the other side of the dairying industry is considerable to small farmers who are to be subject to a levy under this Bill. They practically existed by the rearing of one or two calves.  The income of small farmers in Clare and in the hilly parts of Limerick and other counties was practically derived from the sale of a few pounds of butter and of the few calves that they reared. Not only did they rear the produce of their own cows, but many of them went to the dairying counties and bought calves and reared them.  These are the men we are trying to drag under this legislation, men who would not in the end get any of the advantages that properly organised creamery districts get from the Bill. The Minister proposes to exempt certain farmers, who have only one cow. I do not know if he is even going to exempt them, because any cow worth having is going to provide one pound of butter in the day or seven lbs. in the week.  A man with one cow does not eat much butter.  He is not able to do so.  He will want to sell the 7 lbs. but the Minister by this Bill is only going to let him sell 3 lbs.  The Bill is not even exempting the one-cow farmer.  The Minister thinks that a certain class of farmers producing butter are to be exempt.  I say that they will not be and that no one who can be called a farmer will be exempt.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to set up a new class of smugglers under the Bill. There is bound to be smuggling of butter into the homes of consumers, into shops and other places.  I hope the consumers will at least get the benefit of that.  The Minister's officials are going to have a hard task in collecting money from small farmers who sell more than three pounds of butter. I wish the Minister luck if he attempts <Col N="74" /> to enforce the provisions of this Bill. The Minister found a difficulty in collecting certain other taxation. When the inspectors or collectors go to certain portions of the country to try to exact 4d. on every pound of butter produced, all I can say is God help them.  When I looked at the Bill I was between two minds whether to vote for or against it.  I decided in the end that if I voted for it it would be for the reason that the original Bill has lapsed, and that some method must be available if the export of butter is to continue.  The Bill does not satisfy anyone in any Party.  The farmers are not satisfied with the price offered and consumers are certainly not satisfied.  I do not believe any Deputy is satisfied in his heart with a Bill which gives the ordinary farmer something less than 4d. a gallon for milk, while he loses any chance of selling some other dairy produce.</P>
    <P>The Bill is going to make consumers bear an altogether inadequate portion of the burden for the war that we are involved in.  It does not put the burden of carrying on the war on the Central Fund as would be the case in any other war.  If the Bill eventually passes through this House I hope it will be radically amended, so that, at least, farmers will be offered 120/- a cwt. for butter, which is the lowest price, as the Minister will admit, at which it could be economically produced. Secondly, that any sums needed to provide that price will be borne as far as possible under the present circumstances from the Central Fund, and lastly, that the poor unfortunate individuals whom somebody might call farmers, who make four, five, six, eight or ten pounds of butter themselves will be left in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill I have made up my mind to oppose it, no matter what view Deputy Bennett may take, because it places a hardship on a section of the farmers in this country which can least afford to bear it.  To my mind, it says very little for the Fianna Fáil Deputies representing the agricultural industry or representing the farmers that they are absent from the House on this <Col N="75" /> occasion, because even if they did not know or had not studied the Bill sufficiently, if they came in here and listened to the debate they would be able to judge something from it.  I think a Bill like this should be left to an open vote of the House.  What does the Bill purport to do?  The Minister says it is necessary to introduce it owing to a recent Act having lapsed. Of course in so far as doing something for the dairy industry is concerned we could support it, but the particular parts to which I strongly object are the licensing, and the levy on farmers. One wonders what we are coming to in this country.  If a farmer wants to sell seven or eight pounds of butter&mdash; they often sell it to private customers &mdash;he cannot do so now without being licensed, and he has to pay 4d. per lb. to the Government tax-gatherer when he comes round.  The Deputy need not laugh; that is what is in the Bill. That is one of the things to which I object.</P>

      <P>He can do that, but there is a practice in this country amongst a good many farmers&mdash;and the Deputy knows it&mdash;of selling butter to private people.  They can no longer do that.  They will have to be licensed and they will have to pay a tax of 4d. per lb.  Coming down to the question of the dairying industry, the Minister says here that they fixed a price of 141/- per cwt.  That may sound all right to somebody like Deputy Kelly and others who do not know all the circumstances in connection with the price of butter, but the point is: what does the producer get? What is the net price of the creamery <Col N="76" /> which sells the butter?  It is about 100/- or 102/-.  The average price, and the Minister knows it, which was paid last year by the creameries was about 4d. per gallon.  As pointed out here before, that would be about 10d. for the raw material which goes to the making of butter.  The Minister has agreed with me before, and has himself stated in this House, that that is not an economic price to cover the cost of production.  The position of the farmers in the Six Counties has often been mentioned in this House. Deputies on those benches have asked what the farmer in Northern Ireland is getting.  He is getting 5d. per gallon, where we are getting 4d.</P>

      <P>Why does he not do that instead of taxing everybody in the country, and the unfortunate farmer himself in the first instance? The fact of the matter is he is pretending to give a good price to the farmers, and they have not been getting it at all.  Of course I realise that with the position as it is in the British market something has got to be done, but I always consider that it should be done out of the Exchequer and not through the means by which the Minister is seeking to do it, that is by collecting a levy off everybody. Nobody can agree&mdash;and I am sure there are many Fianna Fáil Deputies who do not agree&mdash;with the legislation indicated here, under which every small farmer through the country will pay a tax of 4d. per lb.  The farmers have only been able to carry on this little industry because of the fact that creamery butter commanded a good price.  They were able to sell their butter in some cases at, perhaps, 2d. or 3d. a lb. less than <Col N="78" /> the price of creamery butter.  What will the position be when the levy is on?  The farmers were able to dispose of their home butter because it was sold at a few pence a lb. less than creamery butter.  Then there was no levy.  What will be the position when the levy is on?  What will the position be when they have to take 4d. less?  I think it will put them out of business.  The Minister knows very well that the creamery industry in this country is not established as a whole.  It is not established in every place.  My own county is fairly well equipped with creameries, but there are other places which are not.  I think the farmers will be placed in a very difficult and desperate position as regards this Bill, that is, of course, if the Minister wants to enforce it.  How he is going to do that I do not know.  This Bill, like other Bills, might be innocent enough in the first instance, but with Minister's orders and everything else one does not know where one stands.  Like other Deputies, I would suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw some parts of this Bill, and certainly that part of it which applies to the levy on farmers' butter.  There may be some farmers who have escaped paying the levy in the past.  Some of them who had big contracts with hotels and convents may have escaped the levy, although there may be no justification for their escaping it, but certainly the small farmer&mdash;who is the man I speak of and the man whom I think the Minister and the Government should not get after in this instance&mdash;is the man who will be hardest hit if the Bill is worth anything at all.  As far as I am personally concerned, I think that that part of the Bill should not be introduced at all, and that the Minister should do something, either by way of withdrawing this Bill or by introducing some other Bill which would take out these provisions.  We all agree that it is necessary to help the dairy industry by every means in our power.  It is only reasonable and necessary, in our present circumstances. I would suggest, however, that the Minister ought to help the <Col N="79" /> dairy industry in the way in which it is being helped in Northern Ireland, and not by way of a levy, which means taking it out of the pockets of the farmers and giving it back again, so to speak.  For instance, the creamery with which I was associated paid £7,100 last year by way of a levy and got nothing back. I am told, of course, that it got the home market.  Of course, it got the home market, but who is paying for it?  The producers are paying for it. The Minister admits that he collected £1,250,000 last year from the dairy industry.  I admit that it is necessary to do something for the dairy industry, having regard to world prices at the moment, but I do not think that the British price should be the world price.  I hold that whatever the price may be, it should have some relation to the cost of production. I think that everything should be based on that.  This Bill, in my opinion, does not give the cost of production to farmers in connection with the dairying industry.</P>

To listen to Deputies on the Opposition side, one would think that there was nothing good at all in this Bill.  I do not know if I am right in the quotation, but I think the saying was that nothing good can come out of Nazareth.  The idea of the Opposition seems to be that nothing good can come from the Fianna Fáil Government. The Deputy, who has just spoken, called attention to the fact that the Fianna Fáil members were not in the House to examine the Bill and to hear the debate on it, and he said that if they had been here they might have got some information.  As a matter of fact, if they had been in the House and if they had listened <Col N="80" /> to what was said by the Opposition, they would have got a lot of false information.  One of the things that are not taken into account by the Opposition is the price of all agricultural produce all over the world. That, definitely, is not taken into account by the Opposition.  They know it quite well, but they do not tell the public the position of affairs. The price of all agricultural produce all over the world is down in the dumps.  It is in the doldrums. According to the Opposition, of course, the Fianna Fáil Party are responsible for that.  According to these people, it is because the Fianna Fáil Party are in office that world prices are so bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who spoke last referred to the price of milk given to the farmers in the North of Ireland; but the mere fact that the Government of Northern Ireland had to go to the aid of the farmers there indicates that the produce of these farmers could not be made a paying proposition unless their Government came to their aid by subsidising them.  That was the market that Deputy Dillon was referring to a while ago, where he said that the Fianna Fáil people had stated that the market was gone, and thank God it was gone, and all the rest of it.  The actual fact is that prices are so bad in England, and in the world generally, that Governments have got to come to the assistance of their own peoples, or else their peoples cannot carry on the business which is their normal means of livelihood.  I happen to be engaged in the butter trade, not alone in the Free State, but also in England.  We bought Polish and Siberian butter last year at 60/- a cwt.  That would be about 6½d. per lb.  There is a duty of 15/- a cwt. into England, and that brings it down to 45/-.  With freightage and so on, that would bring it down to 42/-, or 4½d. per lb.  How much a gallon will that price, of 42/- per cwt., enable the farmer to get for his milk?  Certainly not 4d.  It would be just as well if Deputies opposite and people in the country generally would get into their heads the fact that the real reason for prices being so bad is the condition of the English market&mdash;the market that we <Col N="81" /> should be seeking, according to Deputies on the other side.  I am not saying that it is not a valuable market, but I do not agree at all that it is the admirable institution that Deputies on the opposite side want to make out. One of the chief points made by the last Deputy who spoke&mdash;I am sorry that I cannot remember at the moment what constituency he represents&mdash;is that we are going to have a levy on the farmers&mdash;the poor farmers&mdash;and that they are the people who can ill-afford to pay the levy.  The Deputy suggested that, instead of collecting from the farmers, the Government should produce this money by means of taxation, from the Central Fund, or by some such means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but one would imagine, according to Deputies opposite, that this kind of thing did not take place in other countries.  For instance, in South Africa we had <Col N="82" /> an attempt by the Government there to collect a levy to make certain exemptions.  They found that the farmers were endeavouring to circumvent the Act and to get more from it than they should.  They imposed a stamp on a wrapper and no butter could be sold except in a wrapper with the stamp on it.  That stamp was the amount of the levy per lb.  Some of the farmers sent this butter to their friends and told them to be particularly careful about the stamps and not to dirty them, and in that way the stamps were used over and over again. That is what the farmers were doing there.  I am not saying that they were justified in doing it, but that is what they did.  The Government then issued paper wrappers bearing an embossed stamp that would be sure to get dirty when used, and that was how they overcame the difficulty.</P>
      <P>Is there any country in the world, outside of the Free State, in which the people get 100/- for their butter?  I do not believe there is one.  One would think that this portion of the island, the Free State, was an El Dorado in which the people had merely to make demands to which the Government would comply.  The only way to succeed is through hard work and if the dairy farmers in Limerick, about whom Deputy Bennett was speaking, did more work and a little less dairying they would be much better off.  The cost of production in dairying is pretty high but, at the same time, 100/- is a much better price than any other country is able to pay its farmers. That is a point that should be borne in mind.  If Deputies insist on calling attention to 100/- as a poor price, they are indeed very unreasonable.  I think it is a very good price and it indicates a considerable increase over the price obtained in other countries where perhaps they are producing much more butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was difficult to follow the reasoning of the Minister, speaking first on the Financial Resolution and then on the Bill.  I have an open mind on the Bill.  If the Bill were standing by itself as a beginning I would have <Col N="83" /> no hesitation in opposing it, but a system has been in operation and I suppose the fact that it has operated for two or three years makes it incumbent on the Government to continue that system.  There are many objections to this Bill which are common to many Bills that have been introduced here.  It seems to me that it has become the fixed policy of the Government to give general powers to Ministers to do certain things and Ministers implement those general powers for the purpose of making orders that, in my opinion, should be made only by this House.  If that development goes far enough it will not be very long until there will be no need for a Parliament at all.  General powers will be vested in the various Ministers and once they are vested in the Ministers they will be automatically vested in the President, so that the President becomes an absolute dictator and the Ministers will have to dance to his tune.  Probably, they are accustomed to that by now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowdall took Deputy Curran to task for making the case that farmers will have to pay a levy of 4d. a pound on their butter.  Deputy Dowdall said that was not so, that the farmer had not to be registered to sell his butter so long as he sold it to a registered distributor or so long as his production was below five pounds per week and he sold it to a consumer.  It matters very little to a farmer whose sale is only five pounds a week whether he has to pay a levy or not.  It would matter, perhaps, only the price of a glass of whiskey.  But in trade he has to pay the levy himself or sell to a registered distributor.  The only difference is that in the one case he pays it out of his own pocket and in the other case he gives it to the registered distributor. I fail to see any point in the argument put forward by Deputy Dowdall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see this thing debated in a calm, non-Party atmosphere, because it is a Bill in which there is a lot and it will not be properly debated if it is not debated in a non-Party atmosphere.  The Minister for Agriculture juggled with figures in the <Col N="84" /> early stages of this debate.  I think he got a little confused in his figures. He said that the Bill provides that there will be no levy on butter exported and that the bounty payable on exported butter will be provided by registration fees and by levies on butter consumed at home, the levy being 39/- a cwt.  I asked him if he could give the relative amounts of butter consumed at home, the relative amounts of creamery butter, factory butter, etc.  I believe the levy applied to factory butter before and in the case of farmers' butter&mdash;not factory or creamery butter&mdash;no levy applied. Now, he intends to put a levy on that similar to the levy on creamery butter, and he is going to hand that amount of money over to this fund to provide bounties for the export of factory and creamery butter.  In fact, he is calling to his aid the people who produce butter for sale locally and I cannot follow his reasoning when he says that nobody would gain anything or nobody would suffer anything by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have a little experience of the trend in the consumption of butter and I put this to the Minister that the consumption of creamery butter at home is increasing and that the consumption of farmers' butter is diminishing.  If the levy on creamery butter was to remain the same and the new levy, where there was not one before, was to be put upon the farmers' butter I see nothing for it only that, of course, some farmers will carry on while they can obey the law.  We are debating this from the standpoint that there will be no evasion of the law.  The production of farmers' butter for sale must cease.  The Minister knows that on the whole there is a good margin between the price of non-creamery farmers' butter in the ordinary sense and the creamery butter.  The Minister knows that the farmers' butter, even without a levy, is not increasing in bulk.  Now he puts a levy on it which will diminish the returns to the farmer by 4d. in the lb. The result will be that farmers' butter must go out of commerce altogether.  I would like to hear the Minister, or somebody on his behalf, put up arguments that will convince anybody with <Col N="85" /> a knowledge of the trade and general conditions that the farmers can bear this levy of 4d. in the lb.  The farmers will get nothing in return.</P>
    <P>The people who are using the farmers' butter to-day, if asked to pay 4d. a lb. more for it, will buy creamery butter instead.  I asked the Minister if he has any returns showing the consumption of this kind of butter that heretofore was not subject to a levy but which will be subject to a levy in the future under this Bill.  I wonder would these figures approximate to the position&mdash;300,000 cwts. of creamery butter and 40,000 cwts. of farmers' butter.  I would like the Minister to take a note of this and deal with it. I have no special information, but I think these figures are substantially correct.  The position with regard to the consumption of farmers' butter is this, that under present conditions the sales were not increasing and creamery butter was encroaching on the sales of farmers' butter.  Notwithstanding the fact that creamery butter had to pay 4d. a lb. levy that the other butter did not bear, the position was as I have said.</P>
    <P>I would, I think, be substantially correct in saying that in the City of Dublin the public taste is such that creamery butter is entirely used.  And Dublin City is the largest consumer of creamery butter in Ireland.  The people here want creamery butter, and they want it as cheaply as they can get it. I think the Minister would be well advised to cut out that section altogether.  If the Minister thinks of retaining the 5lbs. maximum he should cut out the sub-section.  This 5lbs. is not an exemption.  Perhaps the only material need for the Bill is to rope in those people who are not suppliers to creameries.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Minister made an exceptionally bad case for the exemption of the Kerry cattle area.  That area is not supplied with creameries. The cow population of the country that is supplying creameries is not by any means half the cow population or near it.  There are only a few counties that are fairly well supplied with creameries.  What disadvantage does the Kerry area suffer in comparison <Col N="86" /> with any other area that is not well supplied with creameries?  The Minister talks about the distances that people have to travel if creameries are there.  The only material fact that remains is that there is not a creamery near them to which to take their milk and manufacture it into butter.  Therefore they must have special advantages.  Whether a creamery can be started in other areas or not, the fact remains that you have not creameries in other areas.  These areas are in precisely the same position as the Kerry cattle areas.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well what is the trouble in the Kerry cattle areas.  It is not a question of milch cows but a question of five, six or seven year old cattle on the mountains that heretofore got a market at £4 or £5.  These were bought by dealers and thousands of them were grazed along the Shannon and elsewhere in the grazing areas. There is no market for these cattle now because at no time would they be able to bear the £6 per head tariff.  As a matter of fact the man who would take a present of one of them would be in debt because the intrinsic value of the animal would be under £6 so that with the £6 tariff they would be worth less than nothing.  I am quite satisfied that that is the real problem that is facing the Minister in the Kerry cattle area. If that is so he should face that problem in its nakedness and not try to camouflage it by saying that Kerry cattle areas have not creameries and that consequently they must get an exemption from the levy and get the benefit from the markets that the levies will bring them.  That is not fair dealing.  If we are going to have a Free State with the hope of a Republic for the 32 counties some day let us not try and set up a second Ulster in the south by creating a new boundary.  If we are going to have legislation for the Free Sate let it be for the Free State and not for 25 out of 26 counties.  It will be very interesting to analyse this whole question of levy and bounty on the export of butter.  It will be worth while to analyse and investigate the wisdom of keeping the prices of butter at a <Col N="87" /> higher figure as stated by Deputy Dowdall, than obtains in any other country in the world.  I agree that the price of butter is higher than in any other country in the world.  That is a commercial fact that anybody who reads commercial news or intelligence knows.</P>
    <P>Is it the best thing to do?  First, of all, we should consider just as any man buying any article or making any investment considers, is this thing worth the price?  The Minister did not develop the question of the price levels in Great Britian.  All the information he gave us was that our price in Great Britain had been about 7/- per cwt. below the New Zealand price, and that latterly it has been brought up to within 3/- per cwt.  I suppose that our price in the British market on that basis would be about 72/- per cwt., which in fact means 43/- per cwt. net.</P>

If the method of working out percentages that I am adopting is not the correct one, he will inform the House, and through the House the public, that 60 per cent. of 72/- is not 43/-.  Then we have to pay freightage and various odds and ends out of that.  Before that happens, those consuming butter at home have to pay 39/- of a levy.  Even if the whole lot can be transferred to a bounty, are we not sending the British butter for nothing?</P>

      <P>What are we doing then? Would it not be better in the long run if there was no levy and if you dumped any surplus of butter you have into the Liffey?  I ask the Minister to think that over.  Then the consumer at home could have his butter at 5d. per lb. less and nobody would lose.  That is a little calculation that the Minister should think over.  There is another thing that the Minister ought to think over.  As I said, I should like to see this matter debated outside of Party politics; but there is one outstanding fact, that everybody entitled to speak for the Government on any platform, either outside or inside this House, claims one thing&mdash;the inalienable right of this country to independence.  I do not want to develop that further; but what explanation has the Minister for Agriculture, elected by that Party, to give to this House as to why Denmark can send its butter into the British market and get 22/- per cwt. more for it than we do, even before the tariff is taken off, and in addition has an exchange advantage of 25 per cent on that?

      <P>At the adjournment we were discussing the drainage side of the Vote.  Deputy Bennett raised a question which I think interested a good many people in relation to drainage, and that is the degree in which the local drainage boards could be more closely associated <Col N="90" /> with that work.  The suggestion is that small drainage could be done locally at considerably less cost than it could be done through the Board of Works; the suggestion being apparently that there is a good deal of overhead charges of one kind or another which would not accrue in the case of local authorities. We think there is a considerable amount of truth in that, but certainly not truth to the degree in which it is generally believed.  The general belief is that it it costs the Board of Works £10,000 to do something which other people could do for £400 or £500. There is no truth in that, but we feel that in a figure considerably higher than £1,000, which was the limit of small schemes previously done by local authorities, some economy could be effected by doing the work through local boards.  Deputy Bennett referred to the Camoge drainage scheme in which he alleged, I believe quite sincerely, that for a very small sum of money work had been done that would cost the Board of Works five or six times the amount involved.  I have not been able to find evidence of that.  We have, as a matter of fact, carried out a couple of schemes through local authorities and where we checked up their output in relation to small schemes we feel there is room for an extension of their activities in that matter.</P>

      <P>In allocating the amounts under the 1925 Act has there been any change in the ratios recently?  Are they the same as they were a couple of years ago?  If the Parliamentary Secretary examines some drainage schemes I think he will find that a lot of what might be called economic schemes were done before, and that the very most that can be done by the Board of Works now, under what I might call the practice that prevails, would be the reconditioning of a number of these schemes. Seeing that a great deal of money has been spent on relief works or otherwise, I was wondering whether the step might not be taken of revising the rates and to recognise that there are many schemes the performance of which would mean a real increase of <Col N="91" /> wealth to the country, at considerable cost, I admit.  It would not pay local farmers to put up, say, fifty per cent. or twenty-five per cent. of the cost of such schemes.  I know that certain schemes have been carried out where only two per cent. was provided.  I think that was so in the Aughabeg scheme.  At one period I do not know if it went beyond that.</P>

      <P>Anyone interested in the Drainage Act of 1925 and in the small one that followed would be disappointed if there were not more schemes.  There are no economic schemes&mdash;I mean reasonably economic schemes.  None are economic from the point of view of bearing the whole cost. I wonder whether it would not be possible to undertake large works by facing up to the situation that more than fifty per cent. of the cost may have to be borne by the Central authority.  I am afraid that raises other problems when it comes to collecting. I was anxious to put that view before the Parliamentary Secretary, so that he might give it his consideration and approach the whole question with an open mind.  I may be able to develop the point more fully when dealing with relief works.</P>

It was a case where four or five years elapsed before a charging order was made, during which certain interest is being charged to the parties concerned.  My desire at present is to point out that there is a large scheme towards which Roscommon Co. Council has agreed to make a substantial contribution.  I want some assurance from the Board of Works that something like what <Col N="92" /> happened before will not happen again, and that when the scheme is complete the charging order will be made, and that four or five years will not elapse and accumulated interest have to be paid as well as the original charge.

There are large numbers of big schemes such as rivers which are exceedingly difficult to deal with.  I admit that the whole question of drainage is very often difficult.  I also realise that upon the Board of Works no criticism should be made if occasionally the estimates are wrong.  From the very nature of the case it is inevitable sometimes that estimates should be exceeded.  I admit that the money is spent and paid out by the Government, but there is at least the advantage that it is not like a lot of other work done at a time of crisis, where the main purpose is that of paying out money and where the return is a secondary consideration. There are any number of rivers&mdash;for instance, take the Cashen River in North Kerry or the Robe in Mayo &mdash;which flood large areas.  Looking at that problem from the purely economic point of view of how much it means to the individual farmer, it will not pay him to approve of a scheme which will put a fairly considerable tax on him year after year for perhaps 35 or 40 years.  In the present straitened circumstances of local finance the local bodies will not be prepared to come forward.  If the work is to be done, therefore, it seems to me that the money must be provided by the central authority.  There will at least be this consolation for the central authority in this particular class of work, that though to the farmer the return for that amount spent may not be an economic balance, there will be a net gain to <Col N="93" /> the country as a whole.  All the money stays in the country, and, therefore, from that point of view, it can be put on a level with any other kind of relief work.  I think that there are very few types of work in which so much of the money goes into labour as in the drainage of a river, or possibly the making of roads.  In the case of roads the money spent makes the roads better, and adds to the amenities of the district, but it is not productive.  I think in the case of drainage, though the return may not be so much, it is productive.  You do get a real balance to the country in regard to adding to its permanent wealth. There are certain types of roads which are productive.  Tourist roads are productive, while bog roads may also be useful.  Money spent on drainage work can be productive, and that is the reason why I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to devote attention to seeing whether it would be possible to revise the scale of Government grants in that particular respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters to which I want to refer before the Parliamentary Secretary replies.  I should like to know what is his intention regarding the drainage of the River Robe in Mayo. In 1911 there was a scheme under the Congested Districts Board for the drainage of that river.  Then the War came along and there was no possibility of going ahead with it. The scheme was shelved.  In 1923 when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government got into power they found that they could not very well tackle a job of that kind until the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 was passed.  They promised that the drainage of that particular river would be one of the first works done under that Act.  The work was shelved, time and time again, and now it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to see what can be done. The Mayo County Council was asked several years ago to give a guarantee for.  I think, about one-fourth of the entire cost of drainage.  After some time they gave that guarantee.  As <Col N="94" /> far as I understand, the cost of the drainage of that river amounted to about £45,000.  The county council guarantee is £13,000.  The Government, I understand, has given 50 per cent. of the costs.  The remainder will be put on the benefiting area. There was an inquiry held about a year ago, and by an overwhelming majority the people of that area agreed to bear the cost which they were supposed to bear.  Now I see that the Parliamentary Secretary has only £10,000 down for the drainage, although £45,000 was the estimated cost.  I hope he will let us know when it is intended to start the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now no obstacle in so far as preparing schemes is concerned. The Congested Districts Boards prepared a scheme; the Board of Works prepared three or four schemes; the Land Commission prepared schemes. I think it has been a happy hunting ground for engineers down there for the last ten years.  It has already cost about £3,000.  The cost of those surveys, inquiries and so forth has amounted to that figure.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not again shelve the matter.  Crossboyne Church down in that area was flooded by that river three years ago.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce went down at that time and promised the people that when he got into power&mdash;which was a few months afterwards&mdash;he would see the drainage of that river carried out in the following summer.  Three years have elapsed and nothing has been done so far.  I hope the Minister will speed up the Board of Works and see that they will go on with the work.  The county council has given the guarantee, and the people in the district are all in favour of the work.  I do not need to stress the loss sustained by the farmers in the district through the flooding that occurred there, not only in winter, but even in July and August when there are heavy rainfalls.  The whole area from Ballinrobe to Crossboyne and from there to Ballyhaunis has been flooded, and the damage to crops has been considerable.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will speed up <Col N="95" /> the work, even if only £10,000 is available for it.</P>

      <P>What I want is equity and fair play to the people who have been charged.  That is all I want.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised a question as to whether there had been any change in the arrangement in relation to the 1925 Act.  As the Deputy is aware, there was no definite limitation laid down in that particular Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice has been that only 50 per cent. could be given. There has been no case, to my knowledge, in which that has been exceeded and the Deputy, who lived with this job for some time and who knows these difficulties, will know that immediately a limitation of that kind takes place, and is altered at all in practice, the floodgates are opened almost to 100 per cent.  Quite naturally, we are very unwilling to open difficulties of that kind.  As against that, however, there is undoubtedly the fact that a great deal of the delay and a considerable <Col N="97" /> amount of the subsequent cost in relation to the schemes is due to the very small proportion of money that is eventually put up by the farmers actually benefited.  The fact that certain formalities have to be proceeded with and that certain inquiries have to be made undoubtedly adds to the cost of the work, out of all proportion to the amount which is contributed by the people themselves. However, vague statements, such as the schemes &ldquo;being productive&rdquo; and &ldquo;leaving definite assets to the State when they are finished,&rdquo; do not carry us very far, as the Deputy is very well aware.  When the Deputy states that certain schemes, which have gone through, have been 100 per cent. economic, it means that there is no ascertained benefit residual to the land when there is put against that residual benefit the bare cost of maintaining the works when they are completed, and the mere fact that the State has passed schemes, as the Deputy said, up to 98 per cent. uneconomic in certain places, is a very strong argument against any suggestion of niggardliness in such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed&mdash;frankly amazed&mdash;and I think that the Deputy himself would be amazed if he went back over all the schemes put through&mdash; to see the schemes that have been put through.  I certainly think that he would not put it down to any hesitancy in issuing money for arterial drainage.  We are merely trying to find out the truth.  The main schemes&mdash;that is, schemes dealing with the main arteries of the rivers&mdash;while essential to the efficiency of any up-river schemes, are nearly all more than 100 per cent. economic. It is a question of clearing the main channels so as to have a way of draining the tributaries.  These main river schemes are very costly and, there is only a negligible amount of land which would benefit directly by the clearing of the main river.  If there were to be any increase of national or central contribution, as distinct from local contribution, towards those schemes, the best course, undoubtedly, would be to apply it in connection with <Col N="98" /> the main rivers.  The Deputy's difficulty is that works upon the main rivers have practically no value from the point of view of relief works such as he spoke of. Practically all of such schemes will have to be carried out by machinery, and actually the proportion of labour involved in such schemes is very low. The proportion of local labour involved in such schemes is very small because it is necessary to bring in special machinery and skilled crews to work the machines &mdash; men trained and experienced in the work.  As a result, in most cases it is not possible to recruit labour on the site from the local unemployment point of view. I am only mentioning that so that the Deputy may see that in anything we do, or in anything we refrain from doing in relation to drainage, we are doing it with a balanced consideration of all the factors in the case.</P>
    <P>I am putting it broadly, of course, but where you are dealing with up-river and tributary drainage you are dealing with schemes which do help the people in the neighbourhood, and I feel that a considerable proportion of that cost should fall upon them. Where, however, you are dealing with main river drainage you are dealing with a work to which there is very little direct local labour benefit accruing, and there is also the necessity for spending more money on the main rivers than on the tributaries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of estimates for schemes.  All I can say is that it is a matter which is receiving the very closest and most careful attention in the Department at the present moment.  We are inquiring into the methods of the Department with regard to the basis on which these estimates were founded in the past and we hope that we will be able in the future to estimate more closely than in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nally raised the question of the Robe.  The actual position is that the inspector's report, which is a very long and technical report, and which has to be read and considered technically, is in hand and being considered at the <Col N="99" /> moment.  I am not making any promise, because I do not want Deputy Nally to come back here and sue me for breach of promise on another occasion, but I hope that the work will take place this year.  Complaint has been made of the cost of preparing this and other schemes.  What happened in the past was that enough money was not spent before a scheme was started, with the result that more than enough money had to be spent after the scheme started.</P>

      <P>The total amount concerned in this Vote is the sum of £350,000, of which £100,000 is a revote from 1933-34 and the remaining £250,000 is for a new grant for this year.  As the House is aware, the revote is part of the machinery which was constructed out of the first big Relief Vote in 1932-33 in which we put aside a sum of about £150,000 for the purpose of financing relief works, schemes like Local Government schemes, public health schemes and things of that kind, in which a considerable amount of detailed work in the way of preparation and plans and so on would have to be done in the year previous to the year in which the work was actually done.  We have carried that on each year since.  It was once £150,000 and we have now <Col N="100" /> reduced the revote provision to £100,000.  We do not propose to reduce it below that.</P>
      <P>Last year the total amount was £500,000, but that included a Supplementary vote of £150,000.  The money will be allocated, broadly speaking, on the same system and principles as it has been allocated in previous years.  A map is being prepared and will be put up in the Dáil showing the territorial and quantitive distribution of every penny of this fund, with schedules showing where all the money has gone into every district and everything else.  That map is put up for two reasons, one, so that the Dáil may know what has been done with the money and, two, in order that 152 other Deputies will have an opportunity of constructively criticising what has been done and enabling us to do better.  It would be very extraordinary, in spite of the efforts which we have made, if we did know in my office as much about the actual circumstances of all the districts in Ireland as all the Deputies in the House, and in putting up that map I am asking them to go over it in relation to their own particular areas.  I am not asking them simply to come along and request more money for those areas; I merely ask them to tell us whether or not the distribution in those areas has been a proper distribution, having regard to what they know of the existing circumstances.  You will see laid out on that map the work done by the Local Government Department and by the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;road work and minor relief schemes etc.  The object of setting those out is so that the work of the departments will not overlap.  If, for instance, the Local Government people are doing road work out of the Road Fund in a particular area, then the allocation which ordinarily would go to that area at that time from some other fund would be transferred somewhere else.  Again, we will try to concentrate the actual relief works, not merely in the place but at the time in which they are most required, and that is in the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ran up against a rather curious thing when we first tackled these schemes and that was in relation to the <Col N="101" /> road work done by County Councils and the work done out of the Road Fund.  We found that you got a maximum of road employment at the period at which there was a minimum of unemployment. An effort has been made to transfer that this year and, as a result, the characteristic has been completely reversed.  The maximum amount of employment out of both local and State funds on road work to-day, apart from money voted actually for relief, is taking place at the time at which employment is most required.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty, however, which has been introduced into the system of concentrating work over the winter period, and that is the unemployment assistance register.  The fact that there will be a considerable number of people on the unemployment assistance register even during the summer months will tend to some extent to mean that there will be less concentration on the winter months, and the principle will remain the same. One other portion of the work also does not lend itself very well to winter work.  The money which is now being spent on peat development for commercial purposes comes under that head.  Where we were merely doing roads into turbary for the benefit of the individuals concerned in the turbary, they were prepared to put a little bit of extra enthusiasm against the weather difficulties and drive the roads through, even in the bad weather.  But as we have to have the production of peat available according to an industrial programme, it is necessary to do more of the peat development work in the summer than would be done on a purely unemployment basis.</P>
    <P>The main lines of use of relief money are peat development schemes, reclamation of land, mineral exploration and development, archæological excavation, minor marine works and minor relief works.  The only new one in that list for last year was archæological excavation.  The total amount spent was not very great, something like £1,750, but extremely valuable work was in fact done.  Nothing of the spectacular kind was done.  We did not find a tomb of Tutankhamen or <Col N="102" /> anything of that kind, but in practically every one of the works which were done definite advance towards really sound scientific knowledge was obtained.</P>
    <P>Links of various kinds, stretching back into pre-history, were made more exact, and some new ones were found. In two or three cases the existing and very strongly held archæological beliefs were changed.  One delusion which I think was quite common was very fortunately dispelled.  That was that the very fact that archæological remains in Ireland had for a period of years been rather violently and brutally rifled had destroyed the value of archæological research in Ireland has been completely dispelled.  Evidently the people who raided for gold were not sufficiently concerned to destroy the sources of really important information. It has been found that the evidential value of the remains which we now have is of extraordinary importance.  In nearly every case we have succeeded in pushing considerably further the limits of our known pre-history here, and I think we have also largely added to international knowledge on those lines.</P>
    <P>I now come to the peat development schemes.  About £65,000 was spent upon those schemes last year and it is hoped to spend approximately a similar amount this year. Those schemes are simply and solely for the purpose of rendering peat more economical and more easily available for commercial purposes in the country.  The peat schemes have run up against considerable difficulties but these difficulties are now being very definitely got over.</P>
    <P>The reclamation of land and miscellaneous agricultural schemes have had expended on them something like £26,000.  A sum (of £14,000) was made available for the provision of seed oats, seed potatoes and manures for specially poor districts.  A sum of £12,000 was provided from the Department of Agriculture to encourage the tenants on uneconomic holdings in the congested districts area to improve their land.  Grants varying from £1 to £5 were given <Col N="103" /> by the Department of Agriculture, who supervised the spending of that money and saw that it was well and properly used in the improvement of the land.  In practice, somewhere about four or five times the amount of labour which is paid for under a grant of this kind is expended by the tenants and the owners of the land in improving their holdings. This is one of the most promising directions in which money can be spent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the archæological survey and archæological investigations, we have to express our thanks to the Department of Defence, who lent their aerial survey for the purpose of not merely examining the specific works in which we were engaged but in opening up the ground from the point of view of further works.  It is remarkable how large an amount of additional information can be got through an aerial survey.  This survey in Limerick actually did discover a new pre-history burial ground of which none of us had any knowledge but which is now giving very valuable scientific results.</P>
    <P>On the minor relief schemes some 1,800 separate works were undertaken, costing about £120,000.  Deputies are all familiar with these works.  Their great advantage over practically every other work we have, is that you can break up, accurately divide and accurately apply the relief fund to particular areas in proportion to their necessities.  We have had extremely few complaints during the year though we have certainly done everything that was humanely possible to invite them.  I do believe that this scheme is now working as fairly as human limitations will allow.  I want to ask the co-operation and assistance of the House for this work, so that anything that is wrong should be brought to our notice, that anything which can be improved upon can be brought before as with a view to that improvement.</P>
    <P>The Unemployment Assistance Act, as Deputies know, was introduced in the winter of last year.  For the first <Col N="104" /> time it gave possibilities for an accurate social survey of the whole country.  If and when that information, fully digested, is available it will, I think, be possible to put upon a scientific basis and a basis over which one can stand, a system of fair and equitable distribution of any fund which the Dáil puts at our disposal for the purposes of relief, both from the point of dealing with seasonal and sporadic relief and dealing with the much larger and more serious problem in this country, the problem of endemic poverty.  That information was not available at the beginning of last year's relief work campaign nor has it been fully available to us at any time since.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the Employment Exchanges were set up for an entirely different purpose.  They were set up for the purpose of finding valuable and useful employees on the basis of their commercial value for the ordinary employers.  Gradually they were changed over under the new system of registration which came into force in 1932 which trebled the register.  They were turned over to work which was of the exact opposite kind.  In addition to the work which they hitherto had to do they were asked to find for relief work, for artificial employment, people not upon a basis of their suitability for the employment purely on a commercial basis, but on the basis of their need.  That facility was not available to us when we first started a relief scheme, but during the second year it was very considerably extended and very considerably availed of.</P>
    <P>We tried during the second year, and we did very largely succeed in changing over from the system by which men were recruited on the job by those responsible for the job to a system by which they were very largely recruited by a central organisation which had no contact with and no interest in the individual concerns of the individual schemes.  In my opinion that was an immense improvement. Unfortunately, at the very time when we were starting last year the new scheme of unemployment assistance men, the Labour Exchanges were completely overwhelmed with work.  It was impossible for them in practice, <Col N="105" /> however much they desired, and I believe they were entirely willing and anxious to do it at the time, to give us last year the service which they had given us in the previous year.  In addition to that, while we were deprived of the efficient central service of these widely-distributed and highly-informed organisations, it became necessary to correlate relief work recruiting to an entirely new standard&mdash; that was the standard of unemployment assistance.  We lost the Labour Exchanges as a recruiting base, and we lost the old basis upon which we used to select labour.  We were not able to get from the Labour Exchanges during that period that accurate information in relation to the distribution of people on unemployment assistance which was essential to the complete success of recruiting under the new scheme.  However, as I told the Dáil at the time, we would do our best in the matter, and we did.</P>
    <P>In certain districts recruiting under that system has been a complete success. In other districts it has been very far from a success.  In some cases 90 per cent. of the men on relief schemes are men on unemployment assistance.  In other cases there is a very much smaller proportion.  The House will recognise that you cannot get 100 per cent. on these schemes, because sometimes you have to have tradesmen and other people of one kind or another.  While they are essential for the scheme, they may not be on unemployment assistance.  In certain cases up to 90 per cent. has been taken.  We took a check early in the system and found that there was 48 per cent. on the schemes.  We took a check later and found it was 59 per cent.  A later check showed that it was still rising.  In other words, the proportion of unemployment assistance men was gradually improving over the place.</P>
    <P>We hope that next year we shall have at our disposal the knowledge and machinery of the Labour Exchanges, not merely for the purposes of telling us who are unemployment assistance men; but to enable us to recruit them and send them directly on to the job.  Whether that is going <Col N="106" /> to be attained or not I do not know, and I cannot promise.  But that is what we are working towards.  I desire to say quite definitely that in my opinion, if there is to be any large system of having unemployment assistance men on relief works, the fullest and most effective co-operation of the Labour Exchanges, not merely in the collection of information, but in the actual recruiting of the labour for the particular jobs, is essential.</P>
    <P>Sometime in December last year we sent out a questionnaire to every man in the unemployment register.  In addition to that, we sent out a special questionnaire to those people who otherwise would be on the unemployment register, but were temporarily engaged on relief works. The object of that was to get an accurate territorial and occupational census of the whole of the people who had up to that date been swept into the unemployment register. Unfortunately, we did not get 100 per cent. return from that register, and in addition to that we did not get it at anything like the peak point.  I think there were about 114,000 men on the register when we took the census and the total eventually ran up to something like 130,000.  For that reason it has been necessary in a more limited form to repeat that questionnaire for the purpose of getting on the unemployment assistance basis a new territorial map of the distress or necessity in the country as a basis upon which in future to issue relief moneys.</P>
    <P>Of £367,779 actually allocated last year, £133,000 was allocated to the Department of Local Government and Public Health for public health works of various kinds.  £26,000 was used for land reclamation and the provision of seed potatoes, manures, and seed oats for specially necessitous areas.  About £2,000 was spent on marine works&mdash; that is small piers and things of that kind.  £7,500 was spent by the Department of Industry and Commerce on mineral development and exploration; £64,500 on peat development and £2,000 on miscellaneous works.  In addition to the ordinary forestry work of the Department of Lands, £1,500 <Col N="107" /> was given to fit into special difficulties The various works of the Department of the Office of Public Works accounted for £7,700, and minor relief schemes covered £122,000.</P>
    <P>That is all I can say on the matter in relation to last year's campaign.  I am asking the Dáil for its constructive criticism of that work.  I repeat what I said on a previous occasion, that no man is an enemy of this Government who brings either to the Department or out in the Dáil anything which he knows to be wrong in relation to the administration of relief work; and that no man is a friend of this Government who knowing anything that is wrong for any purpose whatever keeps it back.  It is difficult in relation to about 2,500 schemes of relief work to say that everything is watertight, but we are doing our best in that matter.  We ask the co-operation of the House to help us to see that the work is well done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was putting the proposition to the Minister, whether it was really worth while trying, or whether it was a business proposition to keep up this question of butter exports at all, seeing that, in effect, the home consumers had to put up 39/- for every cwt. of butter exported.  That is as much as we would get in net cost for exporting butter.  While we would get 72/- we would pay the British 40 per cent. of that in tariffs and odds and ends.  I doubt if we would get 39/-, or a little over 4d. per lb. for our butter. The Minister told us to-day that the economic price would be round about 140/-.  Speaking nationally, when all the expenses are paid we are barely getting 39/- per cwt.  Deputy Dowdall laboured the question strongly.  It has been laboured here so strongly and so persistently that the camouflage is now too transparent; that there is agricultural depression all over the world. <Col N="108" /> There is.  But prices have not been falling recently in the agricultural world, particularly in the British agricultural world.  Agricultural prices have consistently gone up since Britain went off the gold standard.  It was to lift prices that she went off the gold standard.  She would have failed in that move if she did not lift prices. She devalued the £ down to between 11/- and 12/- in order to put up the paper money value of commodities. She has done so.  Prices have not gone up here.  Deputy Dowdall knows that perfectly well.  I am surprised at a businessman like him trying to camouflage the situation.  Agricultural prices have gone up in America by the dollar being devalued.  Prices have also gone up in Belgium recently.  It was to save the economic situation that Belgium devalued her currency.  Has that been reflected here?  Whatever agricultural prices are or whatever the price of dairy produce, we have to bear special tariffs.  The Minister should consider that.  Australia was confronted with a problem somewhat similar, only that ours is of a more aggravated form, because in Australia there was no economic war.  In Australia and New Zealand farmers set themselves out against inflating the price of butter to home consumers.  I am not saying that they were right. They believed they were when the crisis came a few years ago.  They are stronger in their belief to-day than when they took that decision.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that.  The Minister was forced into taking a decision and he had to camouflage other subsidiary lines, dairying or cow-keeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the depressed condition of the butter market and our inferior position compared with that of Denmark and the British Dominions, we had what was perhaps a subsidiary product of dairying annihilated.  A calf that was worth £3 has been sold freely in the dairying counties during the last few months for a bob a time. That is what has created the crisis in dairying.  Let the Minister consider what a little bit of dope will do for the butter trade.  How much is lost in a calf?  From £2 to £3.  £2 for a calf <Col N="109" /> would represent more than 1d. a gallon in milk.  Old or young stripper cows in fair condition can now be bought in the Dublin market for £1 a head.  When milked out that is what they are worth. I am sure the Department has statistics and knows that.  There have to be cow replacements of one in five every year meaning a loss of £10 over five cows or £2 a cow representing another 1d. gone in the value of milk.  I do not think the Minister would claim that yields on the whole average more than 480 gallons a cow so that £2 represents at least a loss of 1d. a gallon on milk.  I agree it would be impossible to carry on the dairying industry only for this camouflage, and this taxation of 7d. on every pound of butter. I agree a long way with Deputy Dillon that the Minister should consider the withdrawing of this Bill.  It is only a Bill to camouflage the position.  If it is true, as Deputies said here to-day, that milk is fetching 5d. per gallon in the Six Counties, that speaks volumes.  I should like to hear from the Minister why he accepts the position that Danish butter can maintain a price of 20/- or 22/- per cwt. in the British market over our price. What has the Department of Agriculture being doing for thirty years?  Is the Minister satisfied with his department. Is he satisfied with all that has been and is being spent, on the Department of Agriculture if we are to accept as a matter of course that the Danish product is worth 22/- a cwt. more than ours.  The Minister is also aware that New Zealand, Australia, the Argentine and South Africa are comparatively new arrivals in the butter market, and they are beating us.  Deputy Dillon mentioned to-day the old story of what militated against our retaining a position equal to that of Denmark in the British market.  I think the Minister said that we would want co-operation with Australia and New Zealand in order to get in line with Denmark.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon advocated winter dairying.  Of course under normal conditions winter dairying here is out of the question.  We have summer grass butter from New Zealand now, which we did not have twenty years ago, when we were talking about winter <Col N="110" /> dairying.  Twenty years ago at certain times of the winter butter reached its peak.  Latterly, with the supply of butter from New Zealand, Australia and the Argentine, butter actually falls at that period of winter.  I think, therefore, that the question of developing winter dairying here, no matter how armchair farmers may suggest storing grass and that sort of thing, is out of the question.  Again I would in all seriousness ask the Minister for Agriculture to remember that he has a very important duty to the agricultural population of this country.  I notice that so much alive were the Six Counties to the operations of finance that immediately the news came that Belgium had gone off the gold standard the Northern Minister for Finance went over to London to see how it affected the linen trade.  Here, no matter how the international financiers juggle with money, there is no notice taken of it.  If, for instance, Britain gave a special import preference duty to Denmark which it did not give to us, would we not say, &ldquo;Oh, it is the Saxon again; it is the Saxon hatred of Ireland&rdquo;?  But that is exactly the position we are in to-day. The Dane has 25 per cent. of an exchange advantage.  New Zealand and Australia have 25 per cent. of an exchange advantage.  By any manipulation which the Minister attempts here, levying from one section to pay another, how can he hope to compete against conditions of that kind?  In Belfast they were alive to the situation. They knew that if Belgium went off the gold standard, and had depreciated currency, Belgium could sell her linen goods and cut out Belfast.  The Northern Minister went over to London to look after the position, but here no Minister looks after our interests in the realm of international finance, nor have they taken any power to look after them.  I hope that the Minister will appreciate his duty and realise that no matter what schemes he puts through on paper, if the question of money value and exchange is not looked after, any other efforts will be futile.</P>
    <P>When he is winding up, I hope to hear the Minister make a better case for the exemption of the Kerry cattle area.  If we were here considering a <Col N="111" /> scheme for the establishment of creameries I could understand the argument which the Minister has put up, but we are here considering a levy on farmers' butter.  Farmers' butter is produced and sold in areas where there are no creameries.  We are not concerned at the moment with the reason why there are no creameries; we are only concerned with the fact that they are not there.  The Kerry cattle area is, therefore, at no more of a disadvantage than a similar area in Clare, Galway, Donegal, or even Meath, where there are no creameries. Why should one area be exempted against another?  Certainly the reasons put up by the Minister did not convince me, and I hope he will go further into the point when he is winding up.  If this is not a temporary measure, and if the present relations in trade between this country and Britain are going to continue, I do not see that the little bit of butter export trade we have is worth saving.  We are paying too large a price for it.  We are losing too much.  In order to get 39/- a cwt. for butter, which is only one-third of an economic price according to the Minister's statement here to-day, we have to tax our own producers to inflate the price of butter here so as to subsidise giving it over for almost nothing to Britain.  I should like to hear the Minister on that aspect of the matter; I should like to hear him make a case for the continuation of exporting butter to England.  Personally I see none. We would save considerably and obviously if we dumped that butter into the Liffey, or used it for cart grease instead of sending it over to Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the introduction of this Bill by the Minister was not very illuminating.  He left us to guess a good deal.  The Minister gave us to understand that everybody as a matter of fact would be better off as a result of this Bill.  Nothing is going to be put on the consumer, the farmers are going to be better off, and the creamery owners are going to be better off.  Personally, I cannot follow that.  The Minister was endeavouring to explain the benefits to be conferred on farmers <Col N="112" /> who were manufacturing butter and selling it to private customers, but I cannot follow his reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at the speech delivered here by a business man, Deputy Dowdall.  His speech was one of the most amazing things I have heard for a long time from a business man. Deputy Dowdall started off by saying that the price of agricultural produce had gone down all over the world; that it was not the fault of the Fianna Fáil Government, or even of the previous Government, that prices were so bad in the British market&mdash;that good old British market which, the Minister for Agriculture told us to-day, is willing to take all the butter we have in any quantities we state.  Deputy Dowdall told us that very bad prices were ruling in the British market and that the dairying industry in this country had to be helped out and relieved as a result of these bad prices. Last year it cost us £1,221,232 already extracted from the dairying industry of this country in order to get the butter into the British market&mdash;that good old British market!  In addition to that, Government funds contributed something over £800,000.  Deputy Dowdall went further, and, while supporting this Bill, he went so far as to say, in reference to something which Deputy Bennett suggested, that if the people who followed dairying in Limerick would take off their coats and work and do something else in addition to dairying, they would be better off.  As a matter of fact, that is where I find the great fault with this Bill really.  I think the Bill is inequitable.  I think it is unfair and unjust.  Let us take any dairying industry in this country. In any of those areas in the South where dairying is the industry they follow dairying as the main source of their incomes.  That is the industry they follow for their livelihoods.  In addition to that, they are entitled to follow tillage or any other kind of farming.  Is there any reason why a non-dairying part of the country should be obliged to come to the rescue of the main industry in that other particular area by paying a direct subsidy by way of levy towards the dairying counties? I think it is most inequitable.  I do not see any justice at all in it.  I do not see <Col N="113" /> why Roscommon, say, or Galway, or those other places where you have hard-working people following mixed farming and tilling a good deal, and where the wives of these farmers supplement their incomes by selling butter to private customers, should have to pay 4d. per lb. in order to help the dairying districts in which, Deputy Dowdall says, the people ought to take off their coats and work at something else.  I do not think there is any justice in it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am afraid that the Minister will come to grief if he endeavours to administer that portion of the Act which relates to the registration and the imposition of a levy on farmers' butter.  For instance, as the Minister explained here to us to-day, I am led to believe that all butter that is exported out of this country is not liable to a levy, but butter sold for consumption in the country is liable to a levy.  Take the case of a butter exporter, or rather a butter merchant, living, say, in Athlone or some such town.  He buys butter from farmers who are unregistered.  There is no need for them to be registered.  All they have to do is to sell to a registered dealer.  That dealer has the right to re-sell that butter to people in the town of Athlone, and he also has the right to export that butter.  Suppose we take it on a fifty-fifty basis, and that he exports fifty per cent. and sells the rest locally.  From whom is he going to deduct the levy?  He is entitled to deduct it in respect of the butter he sells locally, but not in respect of the butter he exports.  What will he do?  He will deduct it from everybody.  It is quite a common occurrence all over the country that we have butter merchants who are supplied by various producers&mdash;some of them good, some of them middling, and some of them not so good.  Now, locally, in the vicinity of that butter merchant there are people who want a particular person's butter from him. They want that particular butter and will not take anything else.  That is quite a common occurrence.  If that man wants to keep his customers he must supply them with the butter they want.  According to this, that will mean that it will be bought for 4d. less <Col N="114" /> than inferior butter.  How does the Minister propose to work that?  I certainly cannot see any solution for that particular case, nor can I see any equity or justice whatever in asking the farmer's wife, who is supplementing her small income by supplying the local bank manager or the local Civic Guard Superintendent with home-made butter, to pay 4d. per lb. in order that the dairying industry in the South may be subsidised.  I think that the Bill is ill-thought-out and unworkable.  As Deputy Belton pointed out, I should like to see this Bill, or any Bill of this kind, discussed in this House in an absolutely non-political atmosphere.  It would be a great matter, certainly, if we could dissociate this Bill, or the necessity for this Bill, from the economic war, but we cannot do it.  It is part and parcel of it, and certainly, as the dairying industry exists in this country to-day, it must be subsidised from some source.  Why must it be subsidised from some source?</P>
    <P>Taking the figures from the Government publication&mdash;that is, the Trade Journal&mdash;I find that in 1931 dropped calves were £2 17s. 3d. per head.  That was the average price all over Ireland. To-day, according to the same authority, they are 17/6.  In 1931 calves under six months were worth £4 4s. 9d. &mdash;that was the average made out by the officials.  What are they worth to-day? They are worth £1 14s. 6d. If you kept them for 12 months in 1931 they were worth £7 12s. 6d.  At the same age to-day they would be worth £3 3s. 3d. That is the average price.  In addition to that springer cows have dropped from £18 9s. 3d. to £10 12s. 0d.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a dairyman who has 30 cows.  The peculiar thing about it is that some people, even the Minister, do not seem to realise that we cannot have butter without cows, and we cannot have cows without calves&mdash;they are the essentials.  The man with 30 cows drops £2 a head on calves, and that amounts to £60 in a year.  That would be the loss if he sells them as weaned calves.  If he keeps them for six months he loses twice as much, and if he keeps them a further six months his loss is very considerable. If he wants to keep his herd <Col N="115" /> up-to-date he will be cashing one-fifth of them every year.  If he is breeding his own cows they come to him from the calf stage.  He loses £8 10s. 0d. on every cow as compared with 1931 prices.  A man with 30 cows is, owing to the economic war, losing a considerable sum yearly, and certainly that man must be subsidised.  That is the position, and there is no use endeavouring to camouflage it.  We cannot get away from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attempt to right the situation by this Bill is sheer humbug. This morning he told us he had a plan by which he could drop half the levy and leave everybody better off than before.  Of course he can, by not charging any levy on the export and consequently paying less of a bounty. It amounts to taking 1/- out of a man's pocket and giving him 1/6.  It would be as good to give him 6d. in the first instance and not take the shilling at all.  That is exactly what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>The principle behind this Bill is that there is a tax to be collected.  Instead of the Government collecting that tax in the ordinary way&mdash;and if they want to finance the economic war let them finance it out of taxation&mdash;they are trying to make tax-gatherers of all the farmers' wives in this country.  That is one of the effects of this Bill.  It will have another effect.  You will have, I am afraid, a repetition in regard to butter of what we have had on the Border with regard to cattle, and that is smuggling.  On the whole the Bill is a kind of camouflage, a kind of humbug. I believe that the portion of it that refers to the levy on farmers' butter will be absolutely unworkable. I think this measure is inequitable and unjust.  In my opinion the Minister would be well advised to withdraw the Bill and bring in some measure that would really and honestly meet the situation from his own point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather a pity that the Price Stabilisation Bill was introduced so soon.  It is a pity that some of the farmers were not left to feel the results of the drop in prices. If there were no economic war, and if farmers were selling their butter in <Col N="116" /> the British market at the price obtaining now and during the last two years, and they were realising from 1½d. to 2d. a gallon at the creameries, it would be a very easy way of ending the problem of the bullock.  I do not know of any farmer, even Deputy Brennan's farmer, who would produce milk at that price or be prepared to sell butter at 6d. a lb.  Naturally, if they had to do that, they would get out of cows. Deputy Brennan attributes everything to the economic war.  The Scotch farmers, who have all the benefits of the English market and the profits arising from them, have a different story to tell.  I saw a statement from them yesterday indicating that they had dropped £15,000,000 a year during the last five years in the value of their agricultural produce.  And they had all the benefits that could possibly accrue to them from the English markets. So much for Deputy Brennan's arguments in that connection.</P>

      <P>I would not like to be shaving the Deputy until then.  I consider that the levy that is being put on home-produced butter under this Bill is far too high.  Anyone looking at the two sides of the question and looking at the prices at which farmers' butter is sold to-day and the price at which creamery butter is sold will admit that.  The difference is some-think like 2¾d. per lb.  The Minister and his advisers in the Department know very well that the imposition of 4d. per lb. on home-produced butter is just going to drive that butter out of the market.  He should know it at any rate.  I consider that the Minister's advisers would be far better placed in providing those people with an alternative. In my constituency in East Cork we should get the very same treatment as the Kerry farmers.  An application was put up to the Minister from my constituency two years ago. That was a proposition for the setting up of creameries there.  We asked for a central creamery and five auxiliary creameries two years ago.  We had several inspectors down to visit the place and they slept on it.  They have not provided the facilities we asked for.  The farmers concerned are at present engaged in home-butter <Col N="118" /> making.  If those facilities were provided, that would solve the problem of the people there far easier and far better than imposing this system&mdash; coming down on the unfortunate farmer who is producing home-made butter and clapping a levy of 4d. a lb. on his butter.</P>
      <P>I consider that fixing the levy on home-made butter at the same figure as the levy on creamery butter is unjust and unfair.  It will only have one effect and it can only have one effect.  Our proposals were put up definitely to the Minister two years ago.  The Dairy Disposals Board and the other boards dealing with the question left a pretty nice mess after them.  I admit that in a particular area in Kerry you will not get the facilities in the production of milk within an area that would be covered in the ordinary way by an auxiliary creamery.  But I say that in other districts, where there are no creameries, the Minister should send down his Departmental officials and get his scheme going of setting up creameries there.  It would work far better than the system under this proposal or it should come side by side with it.  The farmers get something like 8d. per lb. for home made butter as against 10¾d. for creamery butter.  Working it out on that basis, the fixing of the same levy on farmers' butter and creamery butter is undoubtedly unfair and unjust.  It is endeavouring to drag too much out of the farmer who is producing home-made butter.  I think the Minister should reconsider the portion of the Bill dealing with levies. He should reconsider it in the light of the figures that undoubtedly are at the disposal of his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see very much in the other arguments put up on this particular matter by the Opposition. Were it not for the Stabilisation of Prices Act there would undoubtedly be no dairying in this country now. There would be no cows in the country to-day even if there had been no economic war at all.  I ask Deputy Bennett, who spoke against this Bill, what would his constitutents be getting for their milk now if there had <Col N="119" /> been no Stabilisation of Prices Act? They would be getting 2d. or 1½d. a gallon.  That would be the price, on the basis of the present price of Free State butter in the British market.  Deputy Bennett knows that and he proved that he knew it when he broke away from Deputy Mulcahy here and voted for the Bill.  We had the two inseparables walking into different lobbies on that occasion. That proved that Deputy Bennett was alive to the interests of his constituents. That Bill was undoubtedly required, but I think that this part of it dealing with the levy on home-produced butter will militate unfairly and unjustly against the farmer who has no creamery to which to take his milk.  It will militate against the man who has followed the policy of manufacturing his own butter at home.  He will be getting a lower price for his butter than the man who is turning his milk into butter at the creamery.  There is no gainsaying that argument, and I suggest that this particular section of the Bill should be reviewed in the light of the figures that the Minister must have at his disposal.</P>

Until Deputy Corry changed the atmosphere on the Fianna Fáil Benches we might as well be discussing this Bill before a group of beings in Mars as discussing <Col N="120" /> it before the Fianna Fáil Party.  The only people who broke the mummified silence on the Fianna Fáil Benches were the Minister and Deputy Dowdall.  We addressed suggestions, remarks and appeals to the members on the Fianna Fáil Benches who say they know something about farming and who say they have some interest in the Irish farmers. We asked these men to tell us what they think they are doing for the Irish farmers, why are they doing it, and what this Bill proposes to do.  I know little about the butter industry, coming, as I do, from Dublin, where all we know about this business is that we have to pay 5d. a lb. more for our butter than the people in Newry or Belfast or the people in other places across the Border and in Great Britain have to pay.  We might as well be discussing this matter in a museum in Mars for any hope we have of stirring up the Fianna Fáil Party to what is happening. Deputy Corry has made an appeal for a certain class of farmer in Cork, but that is all that will happen about it, and Deputy Corry knows that.  An ignorant person like myself listening to this discussion here might remember that the Minister for Agriculture described the dairy industry as the foundation of our agricultural industry here.  I remember that part of our agricultural industry that brought in the greatest income in the past to the Irish farmer was the cattle industry. The Fianna Fáil complaint on that part of the agricultural industry now is that its productivity has to be cut down, say, by two-thirds.  We are to produce only for our own needs.  When I see what is happening with regard to the dairy industry, it strikes me that there is an analogy with the cattle industry; that what should be happening with regard to the dairying industry is that we should be cutting it down by one-half; because, whether there is an economic war on or not, it seems to me we are putting a lot of hard Irish work and useful Irish money into the provision of something to be given in a very cheap way to Englishmen, Scotchmen, Welshmen, and the people who live in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sent ninety-two per cent. of our butter to Great Britain last year.  They <Col N="121" /> say the value of that was £1,158,000. Leaving out of consideration any money raised by the levy, we have to clap the greater part of £823,000 on top of that butter to get John Bull and Co. to take it.  He valued it at £1,158,000, and, as I say, the greater part of the £823,000 had to go on top of it or he would not take it.  Deputy Corry is concerned about producing more of that kind of stuff, and no doubt providing more money by taxation from the people to get these results of Irish capital and Irish labour shipped over there.  I find it very hard to understand it.  The Minister told us that the collection of one and a quarter millions in twopences and twopence-halfpennies last year and paying it back to the same people was simply machinery for fixing the price that the Irish purchaser of butter will have to pay.  He has now found a simpler way.  He will have only to handle £600,000.  All that £600,000 will be collected and paid back.  He is stabilising the price the Irish consumer will have to pay for butter in another way.  I suggest to him that he is stabilising it at one penny per lb. more than the people were paying last year, as high as they were paying.</P>
    <P>The great mystery, however, is where the £600,000 is going to come from, or the £700,000 or £800,000 that the Minister says it may run to.  When we were dealing with the Financial Resolution I pointed out that the Minister told the House during the discussion of the original Stabilisation Bill, as reported in column 1376 of the Official Reports of 4th May, 1932: &ldquo;We consume about 300,000 cwts. of creamery butter.  We consume only a small amount of factory butter.  Only about 40,000 cwts. of farmers' butter, so far as we know, are sold by farmers for consumption in the Free State.&rdquo;  The levy is to be raised now only on butter sold in the Free State.  In dealing with the Financial Resolution, the Minister stated when dealing with the amount of the levy: &ldquo;It will amount in the coming year to £400,000 on creamery butter.  I cannot say what it will amount to on non-creamery butter. It will not, I am sure, be as much as that.  It may be considerably less, certainly something less.  We may take it <Col N="122" /> that it will be somewhere round £700,000, at any rate less than £800,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that when the Minister speaks of the amount that will be raised in the coming year he is talking of a full year.  If he is talking of the present financial year, in which the full proposals of this Bill will not be in operation, then I would like to know that from the Minister.  I am taking the figures he has quoted as being for the full year.  He is going to raise £400,000 on creamery butter.  Creamery butter sold in this country is going to pay a levy of 39/- per cwt.  The Minister told us before that we used 300,000 cwts. of creamery butter.  He said that we used little or no factory butter.  Apparently the factory butter is to be exported in the coming year as it was usually in the past.  He told us that we only consumed in this country 40,000 cwts. of farmers' butter. If the 300,000 cwts. of creamery butter is still going to be consumed here and only £400,000 is going to be raised on that, where is the other £300,000 to be raised from?  Is it to be raised off the 40,000 cwts. of farmers' butter that the Minister says is consumed in this country?  If the Minister stands over that figure, then the whole thing seems to be absurd.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister explicitly if he is going to raise £300,000 on, say, home-manufactured butter in connection with this levy.  If he is, will he tell us what are the up-to-date figures of the sale of home-manufactured butter by farmers in the country?  He indicated on the Financial Resolution that he was going to explain all these things on the Second Reading of the Bill; but he certainly has not made it clear that he is going to put this burden of £300,000 on the farmer producers, or, as it will be passed on if possible by the farmer producers, on to the consumer of farm-produced butter.  Deputy Dowdall thinks it is a very reasonable thing, if the butter industry is to be subsidised, that it should be subsidised by an imposition on the consumer of butter in this country, and he is astounded that there should be any other kind <Col N="123" /> of suggestion.  If the creamery industry is to be subsidised by a tax on the consumer of butter in the country, then the position we have is that the taxation for that industry is being put to the greatest possible extent on the poorest section of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that farmers who consumed their own butter did not care what the price of butter is on the market&mdash;that they simply make their butter and eat it.  Deputy Dowdall, if he accepts the Minister's point of view, should know then that the price of butter does not matter to the greater part of the agricultural community.  A farmer may have a family of eight or ten children and he has not to pay 1/5 per lb. for butter.  A workman living in the City of Dublin or in the City of Cork is the man who is bearing this burden.  In the fantastic situation we have&mdash;if the people of this country are to be taxed to keep up an industry which is apparently overproducing and is dishing out the over-production, not only at a cheap price, but is also throwing money into the laps of people with whom we are fighting an economic war&mdash;the burden should not be placed on the direct consumers of butter.  If it does it will fall on the poor people.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the views of some Deputies on the Labour Benches on the principles enunciated by Senator Dowdall.  The Minister has had two full years' experience of subsidising the butter industry in this particular way.  He puts his proposals before the House without any review of the dairying industry, and without giving Deputies any chance of understanding where the £700,000 that he is to collect by a levy is to come from.  He told us that £400,000 would come from creamery butter.  Impliedly £300,000 is coming from the producers of butter on the farms.  If that is so, the Minister should state it explicitly. There is no other source from which it can come.  If that is the intention, the Minister has completely misinformed the House with regard to <Col N="124" /> the extent of home-produced butter coming on the market, which he told us was only 40,000 or 60,000 cwts.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I can tell Deputy Corry that I am completely opposed to the Bill.  I should like to hear the views of farmers on the Fianna Fáil benches.  Deputy Corry said that what I pointed out with regard to the farmers was all wrong. If it is all wrong from Deputy Corry's point of view I should like to hear whether it is right from the point of view of any other Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches.  If it is wrong then the Minister's whole scheme is wrong.  Perhaps it is of very little moment to any one in the agricultural industry at the present time there are so many things wrong.  It indicates the attitude in which agricultural matters are discussed here when we had the attitude of the Fianna Fáil benches this evening&mdash;such as it was.</P>

      <P>In intervening on this Bill I do not intend to pursue the course of lectures we have had from the Opposition.  Some of the Deputies think it right to lecture us on our duties to our constituents.  These Deputies would have quite enough to do if they looked after the interests of their own constituencies.  I do not intend to go into the provisions of the Bill. I realise the Minister's difficulties.  I realise the mess he had to face in handling the whole dairying industry.  While I say that, I ask him seriously to consider the 4¼d. per pound to be levied on farmers' butter.  There is no creamery in the county I represent. Recently many of the farmers there got hand separators.  At present farmers in that county are supplying the county home and the mental hospital with butter at 1/- per lb. They are lucky because they can add the 4¼d. to their price.  But what about people who are supplying local contracts?  Is 4¼d. per lb. to be deducted from them?  One Deputy stated that the tendency in the country generally was from farm butter towards creamery butter.  If 4¼d. per lb. is deducted from the price of butter it <Col N="125" /> means that a number of people will get out of the business unless prices are raised.  That will be a serious matter from the point of view of farming and cottage industries.  Are we to turn our backs on that method?  In my opinion 4¼d. is entirely too high a levy and seriously I ask the Minister to consider it again.  If it is passed by the House I can tell the Minister that it will have a very bad effect in the county I come from, particularly amongst people who go in for producing a first-class article. The first-class butter will be exported and the butter used at home will be paying the levy.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the matter.</P>

      <P>If anyone can claim to discuss this Bill as a non-Party measure I can make that claim.  I preface my remarks by saying that previously I fought with the Minister for Agriculture for not giving some assistance in the marketing of butter. As the position is intensified since, I hold that it is essential to give some subsidy to butter.  Butter is a by-product of a key industry, and if something is not got for the by-product the key industry will suffer.  I am in agreement with the Minister, and I think something should be done.  I am not able to follow this Bill in all its implications.  Perhaps some parts that I have not been able to grasp can be explained.  It seems to me that in our agricultural economy we are working ourselves into a position where we are bound hand and foot by regulations.  Within the last nine months we have had three Bills dealing with agriculture.  We had the Cattle Slaughter Bill, the Pigs and Bacon Bill and now this Bill, and running through all are regulations tying the most valuable people in the State hand and foot.  If I might illustrate the position it is all like the old type of mowing machine that some of the senior Deputies will remember.  There was so much machinery in it and so many gears and wheels that there was no power left to cut the crop.  We have so much machinery, and we are so interlocked, that any benefit accruing from any of the measures will be exhausted before it reaches the person <Col N="126" /> for whom it is intended.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should explore another avenue by which he might benefit the producers of butter, or rather that he should attack the problem more directly and subsidise the production of milk.  I am sure consumers like Deputy Mulcahy professes to be&mdash;a town-dweller, buying his butter and buying his milk&mdash;will need a great deal of explanation as to why they are paying at least 4d. a quart for milk while it is taking all this machinery with which we are concerned here to-day to get us 4d. a gallon.  That is really what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>We had the annual meeting of our creamery on last Friday night, and we had a representative of the Irish Agricultural Society there.  On reviewing our balance sheet he congratulated us on having maintained a higher price than the average through the creameries at which he attended in his rounds.  Our price would work out at about 4d. per gallon.  If we have all this machinery to help us to pay to the producer 4d. per gallon, while the new milk vendor is getting 4d. a quart, I am sure, as I have said, that Deputy Mulcahy and other town dwellers like him will ask us for some explanation. Butter at the price at which it has been for a great number of years is, in my opinion, a luxury.  The ordinary market price has not been a price related to the cost of production. Were it not for other side lines that were worked into the economy it could not be produced at the price at all. Most of those who deal with milk and butter know that on an average it would take two and a half gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  Somebody will tell me, of course, that in the creameries where they take the last out of it a pound of butter would be got out of two and one-third gallons. It will be seen that when it takes that number of gallons to make a pound of butter there is no relation whatever to the price we get for that pound of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those Deputies who have spoken as regards the levy on farmers' butter.  It was my opinion <Col N="127" /> that that should never have been put on.  I remember a year ago some of our members on the committee of the creamery were advocating that farmers' butter should come under the levy just the same as creamery butter. I opposed that, and I would oppose it still.  I think it is a mean and contemptible thing that we are going to bring in regulations to deal with small farmers who are only selling a few pounds of surplus butter.  The Bill, I understand, aims at giving them exemption up to five pounds per week. That will operate for, I suppose, 40 weeks of the year, because they would not have a pound of butter to spare for those 40 weeks, or during some such period, but after that they might have a few pounds to sell over the five pounds.  Whilst we may pursue dairymen, and so on, in the interests of public health, I think it is a contemptible thing to pursue a small farmer who is only selling his few pounds of surplus butter, and to pursue him not for health reasons but for levying purposes.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Victory who deplored the want of creameries in certain areas.  I have not very much sympathy with that point of view.  At the present time creameries can be organised on a co-operative basis. There is no reason in the world why any community, no matter how small the farmers are, should not go together and get a creamery separating station with the proper plant.  I come from a county of small farmers.  I think two-thirds of the farmers in County Monaghan would be under £15 valuation, and yet there is no excuse for any person who wants to send his milk to the creamery; there is a creamery available within a reasonable distance, which can be reached by cart or lorry. That is the only way that we can put a uniform article on the market.  My opinion is that we should not have a levy on this farmers' butter, because it is a dying industry.  Most of us are old enough to remember the time when we had big butter markets all over the country to which there would be a substantial amount of butter brought in baskets.  To-day there is no such <Col N="128" /> thing as a butter market.  Any butter that is being sold is sent into the shops or to private customers.  It is an industry that is fading out because there is no future for it.  When butter is collected from hundreds of small butter-makers, it is impossible to produce the same sort of article that could be produced at the creamery, where the milk is separated and the butter put on the market in the proper way. In my opinion the farmers' butter should be exempt.  The imposition of the levy will not benefit the State; it will irritate everybody and no good will come of it.  I can quite sympathise with the Minister's intentions, but I do not think that this Bill is going to help.  It will be like the Calf Slaughter Bill, where we have all the irritation and none of the benefits.  We are setting out in this Bill to be more irritating to the small producers, and we are setting out to do the impossible. We are looking after them and giving them the licence, and so, with what is produced, it will be as bad as trying to satisfy the Surveyor of Income Tax with regard to your income, and you will have to supply information as to how many eggs and how much butter you produce.  I think that the Minister would be well advised to leave that out of the Bill altogether and just to see that what is produced in the proper way is marketed in the proper way.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal in the Bill which, I suppose, is necessary and I do not propose to deal with it further.  I agree with the Minister in trying to help the price of butter and to help the producers of butter for export, because butter is a by-product of a key industry.  No matter how Deputy Corry, and other Deputies with a jaundiced outlook on the cattle trade, may express themselves, we still must have dairy cattle in the country, and it will be on those cattle that our future prosperity will depend more than on some of the other schemes that are being pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>One point that I should like to stress is the levying <Col N="129" /> of this 4d. per lb. on butter.  I am living in a dairying county which is fairly well supplied with creameries, but at the same time I realise how hard it is for some people, not living on main roads, to get their produce to the creameries.  Such people, with only five or six cows, find it very hard to get the milk to the creameries.  In many cases it would take them half a day to get to the creamery and they think that using their own separator at home is more profitable, from the point of view of saving time, than to send it into the creamery.  I think that it is a great hardship to put a levy of 4d. per lb. on what these people make at home.  Most of these people do not live on the main road and it is inconvenient for them to send their milk to the creamery.  I know of a number of people around our own area who are similarly circumstanced, and I know how hard it would be for them to send their milk to the creamery.  I think they are at more expense, really, in making the butter at home than in sending it to the creamery, because they have to keep up their little equipment and so on; and if they are in a slightly better position and perhaps getting a little more out of their industry, I think they are entitled to it.  I think it is unjust to impose any tax at all on butter, and that is what I am opposed to in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>One point raised by Deputy Dillon was that we should make an attempt to supply butter regularly to the British market during the winter as well as the summer.  Deputy Belton, I think, replied to that very effectively when he said that in recent years the price for New Zealand and Australian butter during the winter months has been lower than in the summer.  That is true.  I think that we would be very foolish, taking into account the way prices have gone during the last few years, to hold over butter in the hope of getting a better price.  I was asked what are the sales of butter in this country.  I cannot say.  I can give the sales of creamery butter because the <Col N="130" /> creameries make returns of their sales and production, and their sales on the home market amount to about 27,000 cwts. per month, but what the sales of farmers' or factory butter are I do not know.  We know that factory butter, at least, which was leviable, was about 20,000 cwts. per year for the last two years, but we do not know what farmers' butter, or producers' butter as it is referred to in this Bill, would amount to, and it will not be known until the Bill has been some time in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said here that some British merchants were willing to take all the butter we could give them.  Deputy Dillon, of course, naturally wanted to make a point about the great British market which was almost dead.  I could also say that there are British cattle buyers who would take all the cattle we could give them if their Government would allow them to take them.  In fact, I have had such buyers here with me begging for licences, but the British Government would not allow them.  If the British Government puts certain restrictions on the import of butter, then it does not matter what the British merchant is willing to take.  He will only be able to take what his Government allows him to take, and we cannot help him.  Have we not heard a great deal from Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies on the other side about the price the farmer is getting for his cattle, even if he is allowed to export them to England? We have heard statements from Deputy Belton and others to the effect that it would pay the farmer better to throw his cattle into the Liffey than to sell at that price.  Compare the price of butter now, however, with what it was in former years.  Irish butter in Liver pool this week is 76/-, and that is a good deal better price than prevailed for a great part of last year.  Seven or eight years ago the price of Irish butter there was 176/- instead of 76/-.  Well, if there is a drop of two-thirds in the price of butter, surely it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the British market is gone?  It must be remembered that there was no economic war in 1932 when we brought this Bill in first.  Suppose there were no economic war now and that we were to accept <Col N="131" /> British prices, even without tariffs or bounties, and so on, our farmers would get 2½d. per gallon for their milk.</P>

      <P>What is the price of Irish Free State butter in Liverpool this week?  We are talking about New Zealand and Danish butter and all that, but in Liverpool this week the price of Danish butter is 95/- to 96/-.  The price of New Zealand butter in Liverpool this week is 77/- to 78/-, and Australian butter is 73/- to 74/-.  The price of Irish Free State butter in Liverpool this week is 76/-.  Any Deputy here can go down to the Library and look up the Report of the Tariff Commission on butter, and he will find that for the eight years from 1922 to 1930 we were 23/9 behind Danish butter during all that time and that we were 9/4 behind New Zealand butter during all of the same period. This week, as I have told the House, we are 19/- behind Danish butter and 1/- behind New Zealand butter.  So that we certainly have not worsened our position.

      <P>It is quite possible that that could happen on a particular day, but I am taking the average for the eight years.  The Deputy is taking a particular day but he should take the average for that period of years.  Any Deputy can make out the average for himself, and he will find that for the last three years our position, as compared with New Zealand or Danish butter, has improved considerably during that period.  I do not say at all that we are satisfied to remain that distance below Danish.  Because we are not satisfied, we are endeavouring to do something to get a regulated market for our butter in Britain.  Many Deputies disagreed with this Bill because there is a levy going on farmers' butter.  Deputy Dillon took the case of a trader who buys farmers' butter and passes it on to the factory who, he said, would pay the levy and deduct the levy from the producer, so that the producer would not get the advantage of the bounty.  In the example that the Deputy took, there would be no levy at all payable.  It is laid down in the Bill that the last registered person to receive the butter is the person who pays the levy. If it goes from one registered person to another, the last registered person <Col N="133" /> who sells the butter at home will pay the levy.  If he exports the butter, he does not pay any levy.  In the case Deputy Dillon mentioned, the butter was exported in the end so that no levy was paid.</P>
      <P>It is rather tiring to try to instruct the Deputies here on the provisions of Bills.  They waste a great deal of time making speeches and attacking proposals that are not in the Bill at all.  They make cases for things that are provided for in the Bill and appeal to us to do things that the Bill provides shall be done.  In that way, we come to nine o'clock before the discussion ends.  We are quite justified in putting a levy on farmers' butter. If Deputies opposite were courageous enough to act honestly, they would not oppose this Bill.  They will not gain anything politically by this sort of backsliding.  They think that they are going to reap an advantage and get a few extra votes by saying that they would not put an impost on farmers' butter.  What is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I think, Deputy Dillon who said that butter would be 10d. per lb. here if we had not this Bill.  As a matter of fact, it is 1/5.  We have put it up 7d. per lb. by this Bill.  I am told that farmers' butter is about 2d. less, as a rule, than creamery butter. I think it was Deputy Curran who said that.  Therefore, the price of farmers' butter is 1/3.  If there were no Stabilisation Bill, that butter would also be 2d. less.  Deduct 2d. from the 10d. and we have 8d., so that the farmer who sells his butter has the advantage of getting his butter raised from 8d. to 1/3.  The supplier of the creamery is paying for that.  He has to pay the levy, and is it suggested that the farmer producer should get an advantage like that and not pay anything for it?  There are Deputies on this side of the House who do not like that provision but they will at least have the courage to face the people and say that it is a just clause.  They will not act as Deputy Bennett has done and say: &ldquo;I dislike this Bill on account of that provision but, on the whole.  I shall vote for it.&rdquo;  He will vote for it because the creamery <Col N="134" /> people in Limerick would not support him if he did not, but he wants to save himself by saying that he would not put a levy on the farmer.  If Deputy Bennett had the courage to vote against this Bill, he would not be so contemptible, but he has not that courage.  He is going to vote for the Bill and stick out for the farmer producer at the same time by saying that he does not agree with the levy on farmers' butter.  If we put a levy of 4½d. on creamery butter, is it not equally just to put a levy of 4½d. on farmers' butter?</P>

      <P>It is not enough, the Deputy says.  How is the Deputy helping me to get anything for him?  He wants to be on the popular side, not putting a levy on anybody.  This Bill does not do enough for the creamery farmer, according to Deputy Bennett. I agree with the Deputy that the farmer should get more if at all possible, but Deputy Bennett is not very helpful about providing funds to do it.  He will not allow any levy; he will not allow anything to be taken.  If the Deputy will suggest any tax, I do not care what <Col N="137" /> it is, I will submit it to the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy has not the courage to suggest any tax for fear he might offend somebody in the County Limerick.  I defy him to suggest any tax to raise this money.

The Deputy should have some courage and decency and vote against it.  I would hate to be found in the same Division Lobby as the Deputy.  He says the Bill satisfies nobody.  Deputy Curran wants an open vote.  Deputy Curran talked about the North of Ireland where they are getting 5d. and 6d. for their milk.  That is quite true since April of last year, but for two years before that they were getting 1d. to 1½d. less than our farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The North of Ireland, strange to say, has also a levy. Deputies do not know about it.  They have a levy on the retailers of butter. They get 5/- a cwt., so they are making their consumers pay for it too. Deputy Mulcahy will disagree with their scheme, I take it, because they are putting up the price on the consumer. In any case, the North of Ireland is in a different position from the Free State.  They are not exporters of creamery butter there. They import it, as a matter of fact. Our difficulty is the export of the surplus butter.  This Bill has nothing to do with the economic war.  The <Col N="138" /> Government subsidy that is paid on butter is more than sufficient to equate the tariff, and always has been.  At present on 76/- the tariff would be 20/6 and the Government subsidy is in or about 27/-.  The Government subsidy has always been higher than the tariff.  The Bill is dealing entirely with world prices.  The original measure was brought in to deal with world prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, we will proceed on the other basis now.  Deputy Belton took the figure of 72/- in Britain and I want to explain how that is calculated. We deduct 4/- for expenses, which the exporter is entitled to do.  That leaves 68/- and two-sevenths of that constitutes the tariff, which would amount to 19/6.  If the Deputy deducts 19/6 from 72/- he gets 52/6, not 43/3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is when the tariff is added on to it.  As a matter of fact 40 over 140 is the tariff.  The tariff is on the net price.  It comes to about 52/5, and at least there is that much.  If a man throws his butter into the Liffey, as Deputy Belton suggested would be <Col N="140" /> a good solution, he gets 52/5 less, so it is not a very good policy to throw butter into the Liffey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Denmark, we are told, is getting 95/-.  Denmark has to pay a tariff of 15/-, so that Denmark's net receipts will be in the region of 78/-. That is all the Denmark creamery gets. If Deputy Bennett were translated to Denmark and sat in the Opposition there he would be shedding crocodile tears for the farmers of Denmark.  The creameries there are getting something like 78/- less expenses, while here the figure closely approaches 100/-. Deputy Belton spoke of Australia altering her currency in order to give better prices to her farmers.  Australia was the first country to adopt this system of levy and bounties.  I think Deputy Belton's calculation about the cow is rather far-fetched.  He says you will replace one cow in five each year, and that the replacing of a cow now is £10 more costly than six or seven or eight years ago.  I do not think so. Cows are selling at much less now than they were six or seven or eight years ago.</P>

      <P>I want to put this to Deputy Corry and to other Deputies. They spoke of the injustice of fixing the same rate of levy on farmers' butter as on creamery butter.  That, of <Col N="142" /> course, is not necessary.  If a case can be made later on showing the yield from the levy on non-creamery and creamery butter, and when we see how our funds stand with regard to bounties, it is possible that a difference can be made.  But for some little time I am afraid no difference can be made. We must first see the yield from both figures.  With regard to the yield from the levies, I want to say that they are for the whole year, that is from the 1st April, 1935, to the 31st of March, 1936.  In the figures I gave the House I made a mistake for which I want to apologise.  The mistake was not in the total, but in the way in which the total was made up.  The total is expected to come to about £700,000.  I said that the yield from creamery butter was £400,000.  I was wrong in that figure. The figure should be about £526,000. The remainder would be from non-creamery butter.  It is merely an estimate or calculation of what we are getting from non-creamery butter.  We are not at all sure of what that figure may be, but we can give a fairly firm estimate as to what the creamery levy is.  It will amount to £526,000 at the present rate of levy.  There are exported 50,000 cwts. of non-creamery butter.  We have not any good information to go on with regard to the estimation of the consumption of non-creamery butter at home.  The figures we have may be considerably out.  If that is so it will be known within three months, and the rate of levy or bounty will have to be altered to make things right.</P>

    <P>Deputy Haslett was rather severe about the regulations that are being put on the producers both in bacon and milk production as well as on everything else.  I would like to point out that there is hardly any country in the world where these regulations are not becoming necessary.  In Northern Ireland and at any rate in Great Britain every producer is registered, and he has got to make the necessary returns.  There are more regulations there than we are looking for here. In Great Britain they are getting perhaps better prices for milk than we can give here.  Deputy Dowdall told us what they were doing in South <Col N="143" /> Africa with regard to the sale of butter. In practically all these countries there is a great deal of regulation.  The difficulty is that we cannot do anything to improve prices in butter or bacon without a considerable number of regulations.  Were it not for this, these regulations would not be looked for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are down to the four-cow man.  I do not think we are going very much below the four-cow man.  Deputy Bennett spoke of the man of one cow who would produce 7 lbs. of butter in the week.  It is true that the family of the one-cow man do not eat very much butter but I do not think there is any man with one cow who could sell 7 lbs. of butter.  A man with one or two cows is not going to come under this Bill.  Why should such men trouble to come under it? Is it not much easier for them to sell to a registered distributor?  We have had a lot of talk here about the small man.  We all feel for the small man and in drawing up Bills like this we always try to exempt the small man if it is at all possible.  I tried to exempt the small man here as far as I could.  But I must draw the line somewhere. If it is agreed, as some Deputies would be prepared to agree, that we cannot make the distributor or the grocer pay the levy you will have to deal with the very big farmer. Suppose the farmer had 200 cows, and begins to produce butter for the market.  Surely he should not be let go on producing butter from that number of cows and selling it in the market against a distributor or grocer paying a levy.  So that you will have to deal with him.  You will have to deal with the big farmer, and the line must be drawn somewhere between the big and small farmer.  If I have drawn the line too low at 5 lbs., Deputies can discuss that on the Committee Stage.  I think it is only a question of the stage at which you draw the line between the small and the big farmer.  The creameries could not carry on to any <Col N="144" /> great extent unless the big factories and non-manufacturing exporters were also subject to the levy.  That was plainly recognised when we brought in the first Bill in 1932.  They in turn could not carry on unless we put a levy on the distributors and large grocers, because the position was that these non-manufacturing exporters and factories had to buy butter knowing that they would have to pay the levy.  The grocer, who was buying side by side with them, could afford to give 1d. more, and sell at 1d. less per lb. and in that way make the same profit as the person paying the levy. After our experience in the last two years we had to take in the distributors and grocers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to deduce from the arguments the Minister has just used that he agrees with me that under this Bill the producer seller is going to be a little worse off than he was before? The Minister has explained that he got an extra 1d. per lb. by selling to the grocer before this Bill was introduced and that created an abuse <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manufacturer.  This Bill is designed to prevent that, which means that the farmer producer is going to get a little less for his butter than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer that question later.  There was a defect in the previous Bill, because we had to serve notice, and the result was that grocers sprang up every week who had not to pay the levy.  Apart from that, there is no doubt that the grocer in the small town, paying a levy, could not compete against the very big farmer who has 50, or 60, or 200 cows. We have to levy that farmer.  We could levy him under the old Act.  Then we have to levy all farmers and, as I say the thing is where shall we draw the line?  That can be discussed in Committee. To come to Deputy Dillon's point, the producer who is selling butter direct to consumers and who sells all his butter in that way will have to pay a levy under this Bill which he was not perhaps paying before, although we had power to levy it before.  There were, I believe, a few very large farmers levied under the old <Col N="145" /> Act&mdash;at least we attempted to levy a few.  I hold that at least in the districts I know there are not very many farmers in that position.  They do, in the winter, supply to consumers; but during the summer the big surplus of butter they have is sold to dealers and is sent to the factories and exporters. That particular butter will be in a better position under this system than before&mdash;that is the surplus part of the product will be in a better position.  In other words the price will be levelled out more.  Under the old system, we had perhaps farmers selling butter at 1/2 per lb. to consumers and selling their surplus at 6d or 7d to exporters. I am taking rough figures.  Now the position will probably be that they will sell at 1/- to consumers and perhaps get 9d. or so for their surplus.  In the aggregate I believe all the farmers will <Col N="146" /> be better off.  It is hard to say how any individual may fare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this occasion, on this amendment, to make an observation in regard to the Special Committee, lest any misapprehension should exist.  The Special Committee sat for three days and devoted itself to considerable examination and consideration of the Bill.  The Bill emerged from that Committee apparently unamended, because the usual procedure was adopted that, where the Minister indicated his intention of accepting an amendment, the amendment was withdrawn in order to allow the official draftsman to deal with it and put it in the proper wording.  I merely make this observation because the impression seems to have been created in the public Press that no amendments were <Col N="150" /> inserted.  Far from that being the case, I think the Minister will agree with me that almost all the amendments in his name on the Report Stage are amendments that he was good enough to approve in order to meet difficulties which were raised in the course of the proceedings of the Special Committee, or to meet amendments put down by members of the Opposition, which, at his request, were withdrawn.  I think it is only right that that fact should be made clear lest there should be any doubt in the public mind as to the care with which the Bill was considered at the Special Committee to which it was referred by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might save time, in dealing with each particular amendment, if Deputies would bear in mind what Deputy Dillon has just pointed out.  What he said is quite true&mdash;that I did agree to insert several amendments as a result of amendments that were put down by members of the Opposition and by Deputy Belton and others.  I am not sure whether I should describe Deputy Belton as a member of the Opposition. I have put in something like 51 amendments on the Report Stage, and about 45 of these arose directly from the proceedings of the Special Committee.</P>

      <P>This particular amendment did not arise during the Special Committee discussion, but on consideration it is felt that we would have a better check on figures by taking up to the 30th April, 1935, instead of the 31st December, 1934.  We were collecting excise levies from some time early in May, 1934, and in this way we would have a check on the whole 12 months for the purpose of seeing whether a minor curer qualifies or not.</P>

      <P>I do not want to press the Minister very strongly in this regard, but I submit that this constant chopping and changing of dates after the Bill has passed through so many stages may result in hardship.  When the Bill first appeared, the 31st December, 1934, was mentioned as the critical date.  The Minister will remember that, in another part of the Bill, it was proposed to make the critical date the date of the passing of the Act and the Minister found that it would have a very profound effect on the trade in general and that curers would cure far more bacon than normal in order to swell their claims for a quota under the Bill.  In order to put a stop to that, the Minister determined to refer back that date to the 31st December, 1934, to bring it into line with the date which he now proposes to change.  We find here now that the qualifying period is going to be the twelve months prior to the 30th April, 1935.  Will the Minister advise the House, in regard to this Part of the Bill, what effect that is likely to have on the several curers in the country?</P>

    <P>This amendment also is in response to an appeal from the minor curers to make it easier for them to qualify. As the section stands here, a minor curer would have to manufacture more than 2,200 cwts. of bacon for each year. We are now grading it a bit for him. I am proposing that it should be at least 1,500 cwts. the first year and 2,200 cwts. the next year, so as to give the curer a chance to build up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 9, before Section 24 (5), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where an application is made at any time for a licence in respect of any premises and the applicant satisfies the Minister that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he represents a company of not less than one thousand shareholders, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that each shareholder is a pig producer,</P>
      <P>the Minister shall, subject however to the provisions of sub-section (6) and (7) of this section grant such licence.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to give the pig producer an opportunity to start a factory if he wishes to do so. At the present time, especially seeing that the number of curers is being restricted to the men already in business, it means that they are getting a monopoly and it may be possible, in spite of any precautions that may be taken, that the bacon curers would be able to start profiteering.  I think that the Minister is aware that it is not impossible to do so under the Bill.  In case, in any circumstances, the pig producers should have reason to complain of profiteering, it should be left open to them to start a co-operative business.  I think the Minister agreed to that already.  I know that I mentioned it at the time and I think there is no reason why the Minister should not accept this amendment.</P>

    <Col N="155" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, I admit that there does not appear to be much reason why Deputy McGovern's amendment should not be accepted, but the Deputy will understand that the Minister has power, under this Bill, to register such co-operative society or company, as the case may be, and if any case can be made for the registration of such co-operative society, I am quite sure that the Minister would agree to it.  Suppose, however, we adopt the amendment, and suppose that 1,000 people, say, offer themselves as pig producers, I am afraid that no Minister could examine sufficiently into the <i>bona fides</i> of all the persons who said they were producers, and he would have to take that for granted.  Suppose he is compelled to register a new company, it might be located in one of those concentrated districts in which there are many factories.  Then the Minister would have to exercise his power and direct the Board to give a production quota to this new company. That would create great difficulties for the existing factories in that area.  There are considerations like that which make it very difficult to foresee what the position might be in a particular case.  On the whole, I think it would be preferable not to press this amendment.  As we have all the time regarded this Bill as a non-Party measure, I naturally do not want to have a Party division on it.  I do not see any very strong reason why the amendment should be rejected but, on the whole, I think that the Bill would be better without it.  There cannot be profiteering if the boards use the powers given them. After all, it is assumed that the Pigs Board will fix a price for pigs which will leave the factory a fair margin for expenses and so forth.  The Pigs Board is not going to leave big profits to the factory, so that there cannot be profiteering if the boards do their duty.  I do not think that there is any danger of profiteering.  On the other hand, if a co-operative society is organised in a district where there is no factory and where there is need for a factory, no doubt the Minister would license it.  But <Col N="156" /> it might be better to give the Minister more power to refuse to register in certain cases if the attempt were an ill-advised effort by producers against existing factories owing to some dispute.  They might be glad later that the application for a licence had been refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will see that while ten or 20 persons might, in the heat of the moment, take it into their heads to start a factory that would not be warranted by the circumstances, it would not be easy to get the support of 1,000 pig feeders unless there was need for the factory.  This section makes provision for certain other interests subject to reservations. I do not see why if 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 pig producers believe that they have a real grievance and are prepared to put down the money to start an industry in competition with men who have every advantage, they should not be allowed to go ahead.  That is not likely to occur but it will do no harm to make provision for it.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. It would do no harm to accept it.  I can foresee the possibility, if not the probability, of pig producers in general having a grievance later on. As Deputy McGovern has said, that grievance might be so universal that thousands of pig producers might decide to set up a factory against some of the existing proprietary factories.  I do not think that it is asking too much to request the Minister to accept this amendment.  Unless there was almost general dissatisfaction, it is not likely that the amendment would be availed of but it is a safeguard to the producers.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the Minister is leaving the door open to newcomers to the industry or if he is accepting in the letter as well as in the spirit the curers' recommendations. The recommendations of the bacon curers, as given in the report of the Pig Industry Tribunal, are the foundation <Col N="157" /> of this Bill.  On page 104 of that report, the following appears: &ldquo;Steps should be taken to prohibit the opening of any new bacon factories except under licence from the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;  The policy which the Minister is leaving behind him in the Department is, if not absolutely to refuse licences, at least to set up every possible obstacle to the granting of licences to newcomers.  I am satisfied that this Bill is going to create a cast-iron monopoly.  It will confine the bacon curing business to the families in that business. While I am satisfied as to that, if the functions of the two Boards are carried out in practice as well as they appear on paper, there will be machinery to check the harm that that monopoly may do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment affects the principle of which I am speaking. Amendment No. 11 proposes to give a co-operative society power to start a factory, and it outlines the circumstances in which the Minister should grant a licence.  The points I am raising about the Boards have a bearing on that, and I am urging that the Minister is establishing a monopoly. The present Minister for Agriculture will not be in charge of that Department for ever, and I suggest that his present policy will leave behind such a state of affairs as will preclude from consideration any claim by co-operators in the future to start a factory on the lines suggested in this amendment. Unless there is an unequivocal declaration by the Minister that the setting up of a monopoly in the bacon curing business is not contemplated, I should feel bound to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a matter that was discussed by the Special Committee.  The Committee considered that the fine, as set out in the Bill, was too high.  I was inclined to agree.  I said that a continuing fine would be more advisable and I think the Committee agreed with that.  I will not say that a continuing fine is fairer than a large fine.  The Committee felt that, if an ordinary farmer contravened this section of the Act by killing a pig, there was no reason why he should be fined heavily, and that on the other hand, in the case of a continued contravention of the Act, a continuing fine would be more advisable.</P>
