      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what is the rate of wages paid by the contractors erecting labourers' cottages under the schemes initiated by the Clare Board of Health and sanctioned by his Department at Quin, Broadford, Corofin, and Sixmilebridge, County Clare, and if he is aware that the rate of wages paid is not in accordance with the provisions of the legislation under which these schemes are operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. S.T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the rates of wages paid by contractors erecting labourers' cottages at Sixmilebridge, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 3rd April last.  The rates of wages paid at Quin, Broadford and Corofin are not available in my Department at present. I have asked the Board of Health for this information and will furnish it to the Deputy in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I should like to know whether or not he has taken any action with reference to what I said regarding the rate of wages paid by contractors erecting labourers' cottages at Sixmilebridge, or whether the Minister will take a note regarding what I am about to say with reference to Quin, Broadford and Corofin, which is to the effect that the authority for these places is the Clare County Council, which pays 35/- a week, and that the road contractors there are not paying that rate of wages.  Will the Minister take note of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall always take note of what the Deputy says at any time in the House.  I did have investigations made into this matter, and I found that the rate of wages being paid on the housing scheme, about which the Deputy asked me in April last, was higher than the average rates of wages generally paid in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Act provides that the rate of wages paid by the best employer in the district is the rate of wages that the Act contemplates should be given, and is he also aware that, in this case, the County Council is the authority paying the highest rate of wages, and that the contractors are not paying <Col N="3" /> that rate?  In view of the fact that that is what is contemplated by the Act, will the Minister indicate what penalties flow from the fact that these contractors do not pay the rate of wages operating in the district?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) if Michael Hickey, Clonmoney, Bunratty, County Clare, is included in one of the cottage schemes initiated by the Clare Board of Health and sanctioned by his Department; (2) whether three sites were selected in respect of the applicant, and whether one of these is sanctioned by the Department's inspector or whether the three have been rejected; and, if so, on what grounds, and if the applicant because of this will now be deprived of an opportunity of getting a labourer's cottage under either of the two schemes approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  As regards the second part of the question I would inform the Deputy that on two occasions a site was included in separate schemes, made by the Clare Board of Health and Public Assistance, for the erection of a cottage for Michael Hickey. On the first occasion the site was rejected from the compulsory purchase order made in connection with the scheme, as it was situated on demesne land.  On the second occasion the site was rejected from the order, on the grounds that the erection of a cottage thereon would cause undue interference with an already small frontage.  Accordingly the Deputy will understand that a cottage cannot be erected for Michael Hickey on either of these sites, but it is open to the Board to select a more suitable site for the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that three sites&mdash;not two&mdash;were selected in respect of this applicant, one of which was selected by himself, and that the Board of Health changed him on to demesne land, and that he <Col N="4" /> was later on changed to another site? Has the applicant any remedy?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state on what basis William Vogan, Cornasaus, was granted an old age pension at the rate of only 7/- per week, and if he is aware that the pensioner had transferred his entire property without reservation to his son, who is married and has a family, and had no other means whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided on appeal on the 23rd May, 1935, that William George Vogan, Cornasaus, Mountain Lodge, was entitled to an old age pension of 7/- per week. The means were estimated on the basis of the annual value to the claimant of the proceeds of the farm, as the case was regarded as coming within the terms of Section 4 (3) of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, and the assignment made by the claimant on 20th December, 1933, which contained no reservation for the benefit of the assignor, was disregarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in calculating the cost of living figure for the present period consideration has been given to the recent large percentage of increase, in some cases as much as 22 per cent., due to additional taxation lately imposed on the chief foodstuffs of the working classes, including the lower grades of the Civil Service; and, if not, whether he will take steps to have the increased prices of those commodities taken into consideration before the index figure is calculated for the purpose of arriving at the cost of living bonus for the ensuing six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quarterly cost of living inquiries refer to the Monday nearest to the middle of the months of February, May, August, and November. The precise date of the most recent inquiry was 13th May.  Accordingly, any increases in retail prices which may have resulted from the Budget could not have had effect at the last inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure on which bonus is paid in <Col N="8" /> each half year represents the multiple of five next above the average of the two cost of living index numbers in the preceding half year, unless the average is itself a multiple of five when the bonus figure is taken at this average.  It is estimated that if the Budget duties on sugar, tea and tobacco had had their full effect on retail prices on the 13th May, the resulting increase in the cost of living index number for mid-May would not have been sufficient to affect the bonus payable during the last half of this year.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, schemes for the relief of unemployment have been undertaken on a considerable scale in various parts of the country.  There is not, however, any power under existing legislation to require recipients of either unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance to perform work as a condition of receiving such benefit or assistance.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, Private Deputies may not move amendments which actually impose a charge or are of the nature of increases of charge actually or potentially on State funds.  For this reason many of the amendments offered to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill are out of order, since they propose either to relax the conditions and consequently increase State subventions, or to increase the rates of pensions or enlarge the number of beneficiaries.  The amendments which may not be moved are numbers 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 to 43 inclusive, 46, 69, 70, 71 and 72&mdash; 43 in all.  There is some doubt about No. 73.  However, that may be solved when reached.</P>

      <P>the expression &ldquo;the National Health Insurance Acts&rdquo; means the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1934, as amended by this or any subsequent enactment;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;appointed country&rdquo; means a country</P>
      <P>(a)  in which provision is made by legislative enactment for the establishment therein of any scheme of pensions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  which is certified by the Minister to correspond substantially to the scheme of pensions established by this Act, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  which includes provision for the payment of pensions to residents in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(b)  which is not a country with the proper authority of which the Minister has entered into reciprocal arrangements under the provisions of Part VII of this Act relating to reciprocal arrangements with other countries;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; when used without qualification means any pension under this Act;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; means a member of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann (including the Reserve), in respect of whom contributions under the National Health Insurance Acts are for the time being payable under those Acts;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;contribution year&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in the National Health Insurance Acts;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the appointed age&rdquo; when used in relation to a child means the age of 14 years, except in the case of a child who on attaining that age is under full-time instruction in a day school and continues under such full-time instruction after such attainment, when the said expression means the age (not exceeding 16 years) up to which such child remains under such full-time instruction;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;public assistance authority&rdquo; means the local authority charged by or in pursuance of any enactment with the administration of the laws relating to the relief of the poor in any area;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;unemployment assistance&rdquo; means unemployment assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933 (No. 46 of 1933);</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Unified Society&rdquo; means Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this Act.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 50, page 4, before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or in a continuation school&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, dealing with the definition of &ldquo;appointed age,&rdquo; states that <Col N="18" /> when applied to a child it means 14 years of age, except in the case of a child who on attaining that age is under full-time instruction in a day school, and continues in such full-time instruction after such attainment.  The object of the amendment is to insert after &ldquo;day school&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in a continuation school,&rdquo; so that for instance, a child's attendance at a vocational education school might be deemed to qualify the child for participation in the allowance which would be granted to that child once the child so attended that school.  It may be, of course, that in the interpretation of the section as drawn the Minister contemplates that the attendance in such a school will be deemed to cover a child up to 16 years of age.  If that is so, of course the amendment is unnecessary, but I should like to hear the Minister's view on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, under sub-section (2) I think the intention is that in respect of a person who had more than £160 per annum as a salary prior to the 1st July, 1919, the widow of that person will be ineligible to come <Col N="19" /> under the non-contributory scheme set out in the Bill.  I want to suggest to the Minister that at this stage, 16 years after the date referred to in the section, it is hardly fair to advert to the remuneration of a person at that period for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the widow to get a pension.  Under the section as it is drawn, if a person had £162 per annum prior to the 1st July, 1919, the widow of that person would be ineligible for a pension now; whereas if the deceased person had £159 per annum prior to the 1st July, 1919, the widow would now be entitled to a pension under the non-contributory scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that it is unfair, in view of the position in 1935, to assess the standing of the family in relation to this Bill on the remuneration which the husband, or the father, might have had at that period.  Consequently, I think that the Minister might, on the Report Stage, bring in an amendment to provide that any widow whose husband at any time had less than £250 per annum will be eligible for a pension under the non-contributory scheme. After all, you will undoubtedly get cases such as the following: in the case of a deceased man who had £162 per annum as a salary prior to July, 1919, his widow will not come under the scope of the Bill; later in the year 1919, say in August, 1919, you may get the case of a person who died and who had £250 per annum.  In the second case, the widow comes within the scope of the Bill, although the salary is £90 higher than in the previous case which I quoted, whereas the widow whose husband had £162 is excluded from the scope of the Bill.  References to income in 1919 seem to be quite unrelated to the circumstances of those widows today, and I suggest to the Minister that he ought to meet that point on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the widows of people who never came within the term &ldquo;insurable work.&rdquo; The Minister, himself, who is aware of conditions in the country, will know of a number of most deserving people who will probably not come within the terms of the Bill for that reason.  Take the case of a man in a small town or village, working as a carpenter, a tailor or a shoemaker, having no insurance contributions to his credit and unable to make provision for himself. He leaves his widow in a very bad way financially.  I suggest that between now and the final stages the Minister might ascertain the extent of the liability that the covering of such people would impose and, further, he could examine how far very deserving people might be placed in a position to qualify for a pension.  I suggest that the Minister might give these matters a little attention.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to take into consideration cases where sailors are on a share system.  In this connection the widows of such men are in receipt of home assistance.  The men were not in insurable occupations, and their widows would be debarred from getting benefit under this measure.  Perhaps the Minister will consider these cases sympathetically.  The men concerned would be those connected with fishing fleets.  There is another type of case to which I would like to direct attention. It is the case of a man in receipt of disablement benefit for the last six or eight years.  I am aware that a couple of men of that type died recently, and I wonder will their widows come within the terms of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the underlying object of this Bill is to relieve distress, to come to the assistance of necessitous widows and orphans, I think this section ought to be amended.  We might find a widow with, perhaps, a great number of children, whose husband was in receipt of a sum exceeding £160 per annum on a certain date.  She might be much more necessitous than a person whose husband had a lesser wage.  If the object of the Bill is to come to the assistance of widows and orphans, I suggest a basis such as £160 will cut across the intentions of the measure. If our object is to relieve destitution and come to the assistance of people really in need, we ought to take care that this does not cut out the very worst cases.  It may easily do so, and I think the Minister should earnestly consider the matter of suitably amending this section.  I think it is unwise to insert a hard and fast rule with regard to £160.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>I believe that whatever figure we fix and whatever date we arrange&mdash;and, of course, we must take some date&mdash;there are bound to be hardships inflicted; there are bound to be cases that will be a few days out or a few pounds out on the wrong side.  That happens in all legislation. In connection with any Bill that I have had to deal with, relating to pensions and payments, we heard afterwards of cases with which we would have liked to have dealt.  No matter what date you fix, or what your financial limits are, there are bound to be exceptions. Deputy Brennan suggests that we may be striking out persons much more deserving than some of those who will receive benefit.  That is hardly likely to be the case.  We had to arrange some figure and we have gone into this matter very carefully.  Under present conditions, and with finances as we know them to be, I am afraid that until the scheme comes to be revised there is little hope that anything furthere <Col N="22" /> will be done with regard to altering the date or the amount.</P>

      <P>Under the First Schedule of the Bill have we not something to determine whether people are or are not entitled to a pension?  If we are to bring that Schedule into operation it will determine whether or not a widow is able to get on without a pension or some other means of subsistence. Seeing that that Schedule is there to determine whether a widow is entitled to some assistance, I think it ought to govern the matter.  If we find that a widow with a family, whose husband was in receipt of a sum in excess of the specified amount, is destitute, what are we going to do about it?  Will not the first Schedule determine whether the people are in need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to take the view that because the father of a family had £160 per annum prior to July, 1919, the family have virtually a passport to immunity against poverty in the event of the father's death.  I would like the Minister to remember that under this section a family, the father of which had £160 a year prior to July, 1919, will be debarred from getting a pension&mdash;at least, the widow will be debarred.  I should like to mention that in 1919 the cost of living index figure was very much higher than it is to-day.  A person trying to struggle along on £160 in June, 1919, had a much stiffer problem than a person similarly situated has to-day.  The cost of living index figure was higher then and to that extent one cannot assume that the receipt of £160 in 1919 meant this El Dorado which the Minister unfortunately believes existed. Under this section the Minister will be presented with a case where the person concerned is the widow of a man who had £3 3s. 0d. a week in June, 1919. Under this Bill the Minister can say to that widow: &ldquo;You will get no pension under this Bill because your husband had three guineas a week in June, 1919.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is why the Minister will address the widow in these terms. But the Minister may meet another widow whose husband had £5 a week in August, 1919, and he can say to that widow: &ldquo;Although there is only a matter of two months between the death of your husband and the other lady's husband, you will come under the Bill for a non-contributory pension, while the other person will be ruled out.&rdquo;  The Minister can meet the whole difficulty by deleting the section, and then he will be empowered to consider applications of widows for pensions, even if their husbands had more than £160 but not more than £250.  It is the need of the widow of to-day which is the really important matter, and not the salary which a man might have had fifteen or sixteen years ago.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (2) to add the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any person aggrieved by the decision of the Minister on any such question may appeal from that decision to decision of the High Court.</P>
      <P>(b)  the Minister may, if he thinks fit, instead of himself deciding any such question, refer the question for decision to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 6 it is provided that if any question arises whether any particular employment is agricultural employment within the meaning of this Act, the question shall be referred to the Minister, whose decision shall be final.  The object of the amendment is to insert a provision to the effect that any person aggrieved by the decision of the Minister on any such question may appeal from that decision to <Col N="24" /> decision of the High Court and the Minister may, if he thinks fit, instead of himself deciding any such question, refer the question for decision to the High Court.  Under this Bill we are presented with the position that persons contract for certain benefits and, as a result of the passage of this measure, the Minister will constitute the deciding authority as to what is agricultural employment within the meaning of this section.  I suggest that it is altogether too autocratic that a Minister should possess the sole right to decide what is agricultural employment and what is not agricultural employment.  There is obviously a good case why the person concerned should be permitted to appeal to an authority outside the Minister, especially when the person concerned is being dealt with under the section of the Act which is a contributory section.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I am seeking to have inserted is not new to legislation of this kind.  In the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920 power was given to a person to appeal to the High Court if he is aggrieved by a decision of the Minister.  The power is given to refer the matter in dispute to the High Court.  As a result of the existence of that section certain beneficial decisions are being got and many persons have reason to thank that section for benefits they are getting under it, benefits that they would not have got if the sole power resided in the Minister.  I suggest the Minister should accept that amendment so as to enable an appeal to be made when the person feels aggrieved against the Minister's decision.  It is a good principle to allow appeals to aggrieved persons against the decision of the Executive.  No harm can be done by allowing an aggrieved person the right of appeal.  An additional point is that the courts possessed of superior legal knowledge in the matter will have power to construe the section, and this is preferable to having it construed by the lay mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience, both before I became a Minister and since I became a Minister, when dealing <Col N="25" /> with old age pension cases, is that there has always been the utmost fairness on the part of the Appeal Board in dealing with matters of that kind, and these matters are analogous to matters that will be dealt with under this Bill.  There was no attempt to strain the law or to keep out anybody from benefiting who was entitled to benefit.  Whenever a decision was to be taken the applicant was always given the benefit of the doubt.  That has always been my experience in the way in which these things have been dealt with by the Department.  In these cases I do not see how any legal question could arise.  It is a mere question of fact.  Questions under the Housing Acts and matters like that are dealt with in my Department without any red tape, but with liberality in interpreting the Acts.  I think this Bill will be dealt with in the same way and I do not think it will serve any useful purpose to have this amendment inserted.  If it is a case of going to the High Court you have the strict interpretations of the Acts.  When the decision is left to the Minister the Act will be given a generous and wide interpretation without being tied up with too much red tape.  This will be for the benefit of the applicant.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that in the Unemployment Insurance Act a similar difficulty arose as to the interpretation of the kind of unemployment in which the applicant was engaged.  In that Act a gardener, for instance, is excluded. No contributions are payable in respect of men employed as gardeners. I remember cases where men were employed sometimes as gardeners and sometimes as agricultural workers. The question that came up for decision was whether the person was employed as a gardener or as an agricultural labourer.  I have a distinct recollection of a case where the officers of the Department ruled that contributions were not payable.  When a subsequent appeal was made to the umpire, the umpire ruled that the person appealing was a person to whom the Act applied; that contributions were therefore payable, and consequently benefit was <Col N="26" /> bound to be paid.  I suggest to the Minister that under this Bill cases of that kind might arise, and that there is a case for an overriding authority to determine matters of that kind.  I have a personal recollection of a case I quoted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>My own view would be that if there was any doubt as to whether a person was a gardener or an agricultural labourer, or whether a market gardener was or was not employed at agriculture, I would say he was so employed.  I do not know what the High Court would say.  The Minister has power to deal with the matter in a liberal way; he is not tied down to any strict legal interpretation. That power is generally exercised for the benefit of the applicant.  I do not think it would be wise to insert the sub-section proposed in the amendment.</P>

I suggest to the Minister, if he is going to be as generous as he says he will be and as the Department is going to be, then he may not have any fear of frivolous appeals being taken to the High Court.  People will not go to the High Court merely for the sake of seeing the High Court in session.  It is an expensive kind of pastime.  I suggest to the Minister that if a person has a legitimate ground for appeal there is a very good case for enabling him to plead that appeal before the High Court.  A similar section in the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920 has been found to be of benefit to the insured persons.  The value of this Bill would not be lessened by the inclusion of a similar section here.  It would, I think, preserve the precedent set in previous legislation if this were now <Col N="27" /> included.  I ask the Minister to accept this or an amendment similar in substance to it.</P>

The contributions under the contributory scheme are payable with the National Health Insurance contribution, and the second appointed day must be the beginning of the contribution half-year, and cannot be earlier than 6th January, 1936.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>My amendment to this section was ruled out of order, and I have no complaint with reference to that but I still take exception to sub-section (2).  I should like to get back to the relevant factors which induced the Government originally to decree that the contributions from agricultural workers should not be as great as in the case of ordinary workers, because there were some factors which they took into consideration at that time. As I have already pointed out, the basis of this Bill ought to be to give assistance to widows and orphans, and I do not see any reason why there should be any discrimination between agricultural workers and other workers as to the basis of contribution.  It strikes me as extraordinary that there should be this discrimination.  Take the case of two labourers living in labourers cottages in the country, one working at agricultural employment on a farm and the other working on the roads.  Both die and leave widows. The widow of the road worker gets a bigger pension than the widow of the other man, although both are living under similar conditions.  Apparently that is because of the contributions paid.  That ought not to be the basis of the Bill.  The basis of the Bill ought to be to come to the assistance of widows and orphans in distress.  There seems to be running right through the Government's programme in every Bill some method of attack upon agriculture, although we hear very differently from the Government Benches.  It is now being brought down to the widows and orphans of the agricultural workers.  They are to be deprived of what ought to be their rights as far as pensions are concerned.  Consequently I am definitely opposing this section because of the inclusion of sub-section (2).</P>

      <P>It is very much to the point.  Although they are not getting all we would like to see them getting, they are getting something from this Government that the last Government were asked over and over again to give, and never gave.  They are getting it not alone under this Bill, but under other Bills, and more is being done for agriculture than the Deputy or his Party ever dreamt of doing for it.  And that is an attack, as the Deputy described it, on agriculture!</P>
      <P>This is a contributory scheme.  It is an insurance scheme, linked up with national health insurance, and in all insurance, public and private, those who pay the biggest premiums get the best value.  The road worker whom Deputy Brennan mentioned, usually gets a better wage than the man employed on the farm.  Usually the local authorities pay much better, and the Deputy knows that.  He is a member of a local authority and has to pay a much better wage to the workmen under the local authority than he pays out of farming, in all probability. The road workers are able to pay better and, therefore, they will get the advantage.  The agricultural worker, on the other hand, is getting a better bargain for the amount he pays in proportion.  If you take the two sets of widows' and orphans' pensions paid to the agricultural worker and to the industrial worker, you will find, on examination, that on a purely actuarial basis, a purely financial basis, the agricultural worker, for a reduced contribution, is getting much better value in pure hard cash than the industrial worker.</P>

I had not any intention of doing that.  I do say, however, that when the Government set out to treat the widow of an agricultural worker differently from the way in which they proposed to treat the widow of any other worker, it is, if you like, an attack upon agriculture.  The Minister says that they are doing what the previous Government never did.  I agree that they are.  But it is required now more than ever it was required before.  Because the agricultural worker is in receipt of less wages and can do less for his wife and family during his lifetime, is that any reason why his widow should be neglected, and why the widow of his next door neighbour should be better treated? The Minister says that the basis of this is contributory.  Unfortunately, it is on a contributory basis, but I say that there is discrimination, and unfair discrimination, against the agricultural labourer, and I say that we have that right down along the line.  I can assure the Minister that I did not want to make any Party capital out of this matter, but I assert that that discrimination is there, and the Minister knows it is there.</P>

      <P>Although an effort has been made to make this a side issue of the economic war, the fact remains that the agricultural worker has been a slave for years.  I submit that that, in itself, makes a case for doing something, if not generous, at least just, for the dependants of the agricultural workers.  The Minister has a proposal in the Bill to increase, after a certain period, the pensions payable to the widows of agricultural labourers. I suggest that the Minister might consider the whole question at a much earlier date than the date prescribed in the Bill; and, furthermore, I suggest that, if it is considered that the burden of additional contributions on the agricultural labourers, in order to make up for pensions, will be too heavy, the State should bear that burden.  I think that the agricultural labourers have been outcasts in this country for a number of years.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister wants to change that state of affairs, but I suggest that the opportunity that this Bill gives him of doing something in the way of making amends to the dependants of the agricultural workers is one that he ought not to miss, and I suggest that a more generous provision ought to be made before this Bill is finally passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 20, Sir.  I cannot refrain from raising, in this connection, many of the matters raised on the Second Stage of the Bill, which I hoped the Minister would make some effort to meet on the Committee Stage. In this section we are enacting rates of benefits for widows under the non-contributory scheme, and, again, I want to make an appeal to the Minister to do something to raise the rates of benefit that are provided in this section.  A large number of amendments <Col N="34" /> which I submitted to this section have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  Of course, I do not dispute the correctness of that ruling, but, at the same time, there is certainly a problem there to be dealt with. Under this section of the Bill, the Minister is proposing to pay rates of benefit which are grossly inadequate to maintain human existence in the areas in which these benefits are applicable.  For instance, in a rural area&mdash;which, in fact, does not mean a rural area, because an area with a population of 6,999 is not a rural area in this country&mdash;the rates of benefit to be paid to a widow will be 5/- to herself, 2/- for the first child, and 1/- for each additional child; so that a widow with four children, in a place like Naas, Athy, Kildare or Mullingar, will be expected to exist, under this section, on a rate of 10/- a week.  I say that it is quite impossible for a widow to try to exist on a miserable income of that kind.  The Committee that reported on this whole question of widows' and orphans' pensions provided in its report that the rates of benefit should be, in the case of a widow with four children, 24/- per week on a non-contributory basis; but even in dealing with that portion of its report the Committee felt itself bound to express regret that that amount was so small, and also felt itself bound to express the view that the rate would do nothing more than to satisfy minimum requirements. That Committee, as I say, was of opinion that 24/- per week would do no more than satisfy minimum requirements, but under this section it is proposed to pay rates of benefit as low as 10/- in lieu of the 24/- which the Committee recommended should be paid on a non-contributory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister that a rate of 10/- per week to a widow and four children cannot possibly be defended on any humanitarian or economic grounds.  It is impossible to conceive the kind of existence a family would be compelled to live on an income of 10/- a week, out of which rent, clothes, food, school books and provision for the thousand and one other necessaries and amenities of life must be met. Yet that is the provision which it is <Col N="35" /> proposed to make in this Bill.  That is to be the extent of the State's recognition of what these people can exist on.  I say to the Minister, and I am sure it is scarcely necessary to say it to him, that the rates of benefit in this section are unjustifiable on any ground &mdash;humanitarian or economic.</P>
    <P>While, however, that is the rate of benefit applicable to rural areas&mdash;and again, I want to emphasise that these are areas with a population of 6,999&mdash; the rates in the other areas are equally low and equally indefensible on any reasonable ground.  For instance, it is proposed to pay in the City of Galway 11/6 per week to a widow with four children.  How is a widow with four children going to exist in Galway on 11/6 per week?  If anybody thinks that a widow can exist on these rates, he owes it to all the widows in the country to give the recipe by which they can do it.  Similarly, in the City of Dublin and in Dun Laoghaire and Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the maximum benefit allowed under the Act in the case of a widow with four children is 15/6 per week.  The Minister knows the City of Dublin very well, and he knows the kind of life you could lead in the City of Dublin on an income of 15/6 per week.  The rate of benefit in this case is much lower than is paid in the case of home assistance.  The scale of benefit provided in the case of Dublin is lower than the rate of benefit allowed by the Dublin Union Commissioners, and the rate of benefit in rural areas is again, in many cases, greater than the rate allowed under this section.</P>
    <P>I stated on the Second Stage of the Bill, and it is worth restating, that the Balrothery Board of Public Assistance grants to a widow and four children home assistance at the rate of 16/6 per week.  When this Bill is in operation, a widow in the same area will get a pension from the State of 10/- per week&mdash;less by 6/6 per week than she would get from the Balrothery Board of Public Assistance. The Balrothery Board of Public Assistance, a local committee, with limited resources, limited powers and limited responsibility in a matter of <Col N="36" /> this kind, says to a widow and her children &ldquo;16/6 per week is our conception of what your minimum requirements are,&rdquo; but the State, which ought to exercise a more paternal care over persons such as these, expresses the view that 10/- per week is an adequate pension in circumstances of that kind.  Either it is right for that Board to grant 16/6 and wrong for the State to grant 10/-, or the contrary is the position.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the scale of public assistance granted in that case is by no means generous, but the State ought to be not less generous, and I think that from the point of view of relieving local rates and from the point of view of making widows and fatherless children a charge upon one source; and one source alone, there is a good case, as I said on Second Reading, for treating the persons under the non-contributory section in the same way as we deal with those under the contributory section.  Even if that is not possible at this stage, I hope the Minister will introduce some amendment to raise these rates because they are wretched rates.  They are creating a new class of poor person.  They are indefensible rates and I hope something will be done to raise them, because if the Bill leaves the House with these rates of benefit, I believe you will have a righteous yell of indignation from persons who are going to get these low rates of benefit in the form of State pensions.  The Minister, I hope, will reconsider the matter, and do something on Report to raise the existing rates of benefit.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a word to what Deputy Norton has said, and to point out to the Minister that one of the strongest reasons for a Bill of this kind is the opportunity it gives to wipe out the stain of poor law relief.  I think that poor law relief and the manner in which that service has, of necessity, to be administered is about one of the most degrading features of our social life, but I am afraid the provisions referred to will make it inevitable that poor law relief will have to be given to supplement the pensions afforded <Col N="37" /> under this section to a number of people.  I think the Minister will regret that very much and I think it will be one of the main objects of the Bill defeated, if the pensions payable under the section were so small, as they will be, in a number of cases, that the local authority will have to supplement them.  I would very earnestly ask the Minister to look into that section again and to obviate a condition of that kind arising.  It would be most unfortunate if it did, and I think the Minister would regret it, because I think he will realise that one of the main purposes of the Bill would be entirely defeated.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy have said, particularly in regard to the rates for non-contributory pensions, but I am afraid there is no use in my holding out any hope of a revision, in so far as these rates are concerned, at any rate for the present.  The Government have been anxious since we became a Government to get some scheme of pensions for widows and orphans put on the Statute Book.  We did at one time think that our resources would have enabled us to do better than is proposed in the Bill as it stands, but after a full examination over a pretty long period, we decided that we could not, for the present, do any better than is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is set out in the Bill that certain sections are to be examined at the end of a period of five years, and it is possible that, with the experience we will have gained and the exact knowledge we will have then of the cost of the scheme, and, let us hope, with better revenues for the Exchequer as a whole, big advances will be made. The one great value I see in this Bill so far as it goes is that when the House finally passes the measure we shall have got the principle of widows' and orphans' pensions inserted in the State scheme of social services.  There is no doubt in the world, as I said in reply to Deputy Norton on Second Reading, that almost every year there will have to be some reply given to the very imperative demand which I know <Col N="38" /> will arise all over the country from probably all sections of the community to improve the scope of the Bill in regard to the class of people to whom pensions are to be given and to increase the value of the rates.  That demand is bound to come and every Government is bound to hear it, in this matter and in other matters of social legislation, and as finances allow, I am certain that that demand will have to be given a very sympathetic hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 20 agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 21 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, it is possible to pay a pension to a widow with one child, subject to the child being 14 years of age, but, as from six months from that date, the child's claim to a pension lapses and automatically the widow's claim to a pension likewise lapses.  The presumption underlying that section is that it is possible for a child of 14½ years of age to secure employment in industry, but while that is the presumption underlying the section, we have already had introduced into the Dáil a Bill dealing with conditions of employment of which the object is to regulate the admission of children to industry and to prohibit the admission of young persons to industry.  I should like to know from the Minister on what grounds it is assumed that a child ceases to be a liability on a widow when it reaches the age of 14½ years and on what ground especially is that assumed in existing circumstances. According to the latest official figures, there are 127,000 people registered as unemployed at employment exchanges, of which a large number are young persons.  In the face of these figures, it seems to me absurd to assume that a child who becomes 14½ to-morrow, or next month, or next year, is likely to be able to get into industry so long as that barrier to doing so exists.  Yet under this Bill it is assumed that the child will cease to be dependent on the widow when it reaches 14½ years.  I should like to know from the Minister on what grounds that is assumed.  It <Col N="39" /> is impossible for children of that age to get into industry; notwithstanding the fact that, in my opinion, altogether too many of them are employed in industry.  I should like to know from the Minister how a widow is assumed to be able to keep herself and a child of 14½ years of age, because that assumption is there once the pension is stopped in respect of the child when it reaches 14½ years, and also stopped in respect of the widow simply because the child has reached that age.</P>

      <P>It does seem to be an extraordinary thing, when at the present time we have such a justifiable outcry against child labour, that the Minister should assume that a child, once it reaches 14½ years, ceases to be a liability on the mother. Unless the Minister really felt that, he could not introduce this section in the way in which he has introduced it.  Consequently I would urge on the Minister that in the interests of decency as far as children are concerned, and in order to show that we are in earnest in regard to keeping out of employment young children who ought to be at school, he ought to make some alteration in this section.  Certainly it is inhuman to think that a widow, because her child had reached the age of 14½ years, should cease to get a pension. I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider whatever influence has made him put down a section of that kind.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister another set of circumstances that would arise?  Leaving altogether aside the case that has been developed by Deputies Norton and Brennan I should like the Minister to consider the case of a widow with one child who has reached 14½ or 16 or 18 years of age, but who for many years after would not be fit for work.  A member of a local authority comes across numbers of cases of children crippled or invalided for a variety of reasons.  I suggest that there ought to be some provisions to ease the difficulties in cases like that.  I think it is hard to contemplate the lot of a widow who <Col N="40" /> receives for a certain period a pension under this Act, and then goes off the benefit for the years that will intervene before she reaches 60 years.  I think the Minister ought to endeavour to meet in some form or another the points which have been raised, because clearly if the section remains as tightly drawn as it is at the present time there will be very striking anomalies and very striking cases of hardship.</P>

      <P>No; we are on Section 21.  It is quite possible that anomalies will arise, but 14 is the school leaving age for children, although some of them may be occupied in school up to 16 years.  However, we have to take some age and the school leaving age is 14 years.  When a child reaches that age it has to be regarded as having left the school going age, and therefore, to a certain extent at any rate, the dependency age, although it is quite true that many children will still be just as dependent on the mother.  That is, I think, a fact which we cannot ignore, but within the limits of the money which has been provided I cannot see that we can do any more. There are a whole lot of things to be considered.  This is one of the points which will require looking into at the earliest possible date when the scheme is being re-examined, but at present, within the limits of the money made available, I cannot see any hope of doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister realises that the age of 14 or 14½ years is really a very impressionable age, and it is at that time that men are made or unmade.  If you take away from the widow at that very crucial time the means of supporting her family I do not know what is going to happen.  I myself think that a widow who would be very much in need of funds at that stage might easily go off the benefit at an earlier stage.  Children at the ages of nine or ten would possibly be <Col N="41" /> a less strain upon the mother than they would be at the age of 14 years.  Consequently, I think the wrong age has been taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in defining Section 21 or Section 22 as the case may be, suggested that the reason for taking 14 years was the fact that that is the school leaving age, and that consequently it was convenient to take it.  Even if that argument could do service for fixing the age of dependency at 14 years, I suggest to the Minister that it is not a wholly valid argument in respect of depriving the widow of her pension once the child reaches 14½ years of age.  Under this section as it is drawn a widow aged 50 with one child aged 13 will be eligible to secure a pension in respect of herself and the child. When the child passes from 13 to 14 years of age the pension will normally cease as from that date, but that would not take effect until six months after the child reaches 14 years of age.  The result is that at 14½ years of age the child ceases to be entitled to a pension.  The widow, still being under 60 years of age, automatically loses the pension, simply because the child has passed over the age of dependency.  Whatever case the Minister may make that 14 years must be taken as the age of dependency, and whatever case he may make for excluding the child from the benefits of the Act at 14½, surely he would require to make a much stronger <Col N="42" /> case for depriving the widow of the allowance?  I regret very much that the Minister could not so amend the section as to leave the pension with the child until it attains a greater age. He ought at least to provide that where the child does pass out of benefit the widow ought to be retained.  He should provide in the Bill that a widow with one child should be entitled to a pension even if the child passes 14½ years.  It is impossible to contemplate that a child of such tender years can support itself.  The only ground for excluding the widow when the child reaches 14½ is that the child can maintain the mother, or the mother can provide an income for herself.  Where the widow is not able to earn an income to provide for herself and the child, the Minister should arrange that the widow, at all events, will be allowed to retain the pension even when the child has ceased to be a liability on the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, we have to arrive at some definition as to when the child, from the legal point of view, ceases to be dependent, and the school-leaving age seemed to be the reasonable age to select.  We have examined non-contributory pension schemes in other countries and, generally speaking, none of them provide pensions for widows without dependent children.  I think the report of the Committee also recommended us not to give pensions to widows without dependent children.  Children at 14½ being, at any rate in a legal sense, regarded as non-dependent, it follows that the widow loses the pension.  It is quite possible that widows in towns might be considerably embarrassed by losing the pension at that time, and there is the possibility of the child not being able to get employment.  In rural areas, however, I think it is a fact that children go to work on the farm and help their mothers, if they happen to be small holders or agriculturists in a small way.  Even the sons of agricultural labourers go to work at a very early age and they help&mdash; whether the remuneration they get for the help they give is very much, or not, I do not know; I doubt if it is very much.  At any rate, they are of some <Col N="43" /> assistance at the age of 14, and even before 14 they give a good deal of useful help in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in the case of widows engaged in agriculture on very small farms perhaps the children may be of some use at 14 or 14½, but they will be a small proportion of the people who will need assistance.  The really necessitous people are those in the towns. I ask the Minister, outside any definition of school-going age, what does he think is the age of dependency?  Does he think it ceases at 14 or 14½?  He knows perfectly well it does not.  In the case of towns and cities it is really the dangerous age and the age when the widow most requires assistance.  If the Minister, when the child is 14 years of age, withdraws from the widow the assistance she is accustomed to get, it will have a very bad and a very evil effect.  The Minister ought to make some provision to meet at least the town cases.</P>

      <P>On Section 28, the Minister, in the course of his Second Reading speech, said it was necessary to include this section in order to prevent possible abuse of the Bill.  I think he had in mind the case of a widow over 60 marrying.  Apparently, the prevention of marriages at that time is deemed to be something calculated to stop abuse under the Bill. Could we have an idea of the circumstances the Minister had in mind when that portion of his speech was being delivered?  What is wrong with a woman of 60 getting married?</P>

      <P>In the amendments I have been credited with something I did not ask to have done.  I am credited with putting down a certain amendment to Section 63&mdash;amendment 66.  In the case of Section 28 I did put down an amendment and it has not appeared.  I really wanted to delete Section 28 altogether.  I do not think the abuses which the Minister apparently is afraid of, will exist.  We have in the country cases of men over 60 getting married to quite young girls. We have it in the agricultural community pretty frequently.  If this is carried, and if a man over 60 happens to get married and there is a young widow, apparently she is not entitled to a pension.  I do not think there is any danger that there will be the abuse which the Minister apparently wants to check, because getting married is a pretty costly experiment, and it is an experiment.  I cannot imagine any girl tying herself up to an old man for the purpose of getting the pension which the Minister suggests in the Schedule they will get; I cannot imagine anybody <Col N="45" /> trying that experiment.  I really think the section is a blot on the Bill and it ought to be removed, because there is no necessity for it at all.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a very inadequate case for the section, whether because of his modesty or the fact that the subject is one on which he might not like to dilate.  The Minister has assumed that the moment this Bill is passed there is going to be a nation-wide conspiracy on the part of young girls to marry old men&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That question should be addressed to the Minister for Public Health.  The Minister is suggesting that if this section is not included in the Bill there is going to be a grave abuse of the measure, by young girls marrying men of 60 years of age and over.  And all this conspiracy is to take place for the purpose of getting the reduced benefit provided in the non-contributory section of the Bill. Look at what the conspiracy is for&mdash;if the husband happens to die then the person becomes a widow, and of course in that case she will get no allowance under the Bill because she is under 60 years of age and she is childless.  If there is a child of the marriage, or say the widow is left with one or two children, what is the objection to giving her a pension?  Who is going to keep a widow of that kind?  Is it any consolation to the widow and children to know that the husband or father was 60 years of age when he married, or is the memory of that enough to sustain the child until he becomes 14½ years of age?  I suggest to the Minister that he need not by any stretch of the imagination fear that the girl marries the man in the hope that he dies quickly and leaves her with his pension.  In the case I have just mentioned, where there are two children the widow is to get 5/- for herself, 2/- for the first child and 1/- for the second child.  She gets 8/- altogether for herself and the two children.  One would imagine from the section in the Bill that the woman was going to have Paradise.  The Minister may rest assured that there will be no conspiracy to secure that 8/-.</P>

I would like to know from the Minister what position will arise assuming that the State contributions and the contributions paid by the persons covered by the contributory sections of the Bill are inadequate?  Is it assumed that the State contribution of £250,000 a year may be increased in order to make good any possible deficit?  And is it contemplated also that in respect to the actuarial examination of the scheme the State will accept liability to make good the deficit in the operation of the scheme, or is it possible that additional contributions may be required from the employers <Col N="49" /> and employees so as to make good the deficit?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, every year will have to stand on its own feet, but what the Oireachtas passes imposes certain obligations on the Government of the day.  How that Government would deal with the deficit would be a matter for the Government themselves, who would be responsible for meeting that state of affairs.  My own idea with regard to the obligations that will be imposed by this Bill, when it becomes an Act, is that any obligation arising out of the payment of pensions at the rate set out in the Bill to the people entitled to pensions must be met by the Government. Whether the sum be greater than the £250,000 set aside by the Government, or whether it is not, the Government will have to meet the liability arising out of the legislation passed.</P>

The Minister told us last year that it was proposed to set aside £400,000 which was the normal cost of this scheme to the State.  But, under this section of the Bill, the contribution is £250,000. Could the Minister tell us what has happened the remaining £150,000, which the Minister for Finance was disposed to give last year, especially in view of the fact that he only proposes to make a contribution of £250,000 under this section?</P>

      <P>My recollection with regard to that money is that when it was found it was not possible to get the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill prepared and drafted in time for last year, the Unemployment Assistance Bill, which was in a more advanced stage, was rushed and the money was used for that.  I was pressing very hard to get this Bill through, but with all the pressure and the anxiety of the Government and the officials concerned, we were not able to get this Bill through earlier.  When I <Col N="50" /> reported that, the other Bill, which was in a more advanced stage, was pushed on and the money which was then available, having been passed by the Dáil, was taken and used for unemployment assistance.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>I think that would hardly fit in with the facts, because the Unemployment Assistance Act was an Act of 1933, and was in operation long before the Minister made his Budget speech last year.  The Minister for Finance was making provision for unemployment assistance benefit in the same Budget.  Notwithstanding that fact, he was willing then to give £400,000 to finance this scheme.</P>

If the pensions provided for in this Bill were adequate, one might not demur at the saving of £150,000, for use in another direction, but in view of the low rates of pension under the contributory scheme a saving of £150,000, apparently in perpetuity, is something which is making this Bill less valuable than we had hoped it would be.

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 1, before the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;One half of the&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a mandatory provision for the appointment of a panel of referees, and the purpose of the amendment is to provide that the panel will contain other members than civil servants. Without any disrespect to civil servants, I think a panel of this kind ought to contain the names of people who have been prominently identified with social work, or of some people who might be said to be more directly in touch with the interests of people <Col N="52" /> whose claims will be under consideration by the referees.  I think the Minister ought to give some accommodation of this kind.  There is a very good case for making certain that this panel contains some people in whom the average person through the country, by reason of the fact that such people have been prominently identified with social work, will have full confidence.</P>

      <P>I must say I do not feel disposed to alter what is in the Bill.  I do not want to go over again at length what I said at an earlier stage about my experience of the appeal board in connection with old age pensions.  I think they will deal with this measure, with all its implications, in the same broad way.  They are people with a broad outlook and do not deal with a matter of this kind in what is usually accepted as the Civil Service red tape kind of way.  I think they are men who know the conditions in the country and who are humanitarian in their outlook.  If we get a panel from the Service, I am satisfied that they will not act unjustly and without feeling.</P>
      <P>The bringing in of outsiders would, in all probability, rather cause delay and, of course, there would also be additional expense.  I know there will be objection from Finance on that score, because you could not bring in people to do that work and not pay them and pay their expenses as well. On the whole, I think that we would get more expedition and at least as good a humanitarian outlook from within the Service as from any other tribunal likely to be set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Murphy, I do not want to cast any aspersions on the loyalty, zeal and efficiency of civil servants in discharging their duties under this section, but the principle introduced here is a new one.  Under this Bill, persons will be contributing for certain statutory rights.  Obviously, representatives of the contributors should be put on the panel of referees who are going to decide matters of this kind.  In the National Health Insurance Acts, for instance, it is admitted <Col N="53" /> that the insured contributors are entitled to representation on the committee of management of the society.  Under the Unemployment Insurance Act it is also admitted that representatives of insured contributors, or of workers generally, are entitled to representation on the court of referees, but here in this section it is sought to introduce an entirely new principle, namely, to give no representation whatever to insured contributors. I suggest that it is much more difficult for the Minister to defend a section of this kind and to plead that a section of this kind is normal than to show that the other precedents to which I have referred are abnormal.</P>
      <P>It is not so long ago since the Minister piloted through this House a Bill for the unification of societies under the National Health Insurance Acts. In that case the Minister provided for such representation, but in this Bill the Minister proceeds to provide that insured contributors will have no right of representation on the panel of referees.  It seems to me that these are inconsistent attitudes.  If the Minister was right, as I think he was, in allowing for representation under the National Health Insurance Act, he is obviously wrong in putting in such a section in this Bill.  There is a well-defined path already laid down in similar Acts to the effect that the insured contributors should get representation, but the Minister is seeking to deprive the insured contributor of such representation in this Bill.  I think that the cost of adding outside persons to the panel would be negligible, and I do not think that there would be any serious delay in dealing with the matter.  In any case, however, if the Minister wants to make sure that any such procedure will not cause delay, I suggest that he should pay a visit to the Department of Industry and Commerce for the purpose of ascertaining how unemployment assistance cases are dealt with in that Department.</P>

      <P>I agree, of course; but I suggest to the Minister that in the Department of Industry and Commerce we have an example of the way such matters are being dealt with and, if there is to be no outside representation on this panel to deal with appeals, I certainly say that it is a very sorry spectacle to see how similar appeals are dealt with in that Department.  I think that if the Minister knew of anybody who was entitled to unemployment assistance he certainly would not be able to make them any promise of early relief once they have to go through that procedure.  It is my opinion that if the people knew that there was such outside representation on the panel, it would give them an assurance that their interests were being properly looked after and I believe that it would have a very important bearing on the administration of the scheme generally and on the outlook of the community with regard to it.</P>

      <P>Under the National Health Insurance Acts the appeal is to the Minister.  There is also an appeal board, and that is where the question of civil servants enters.  Sometimes also, medical referees&mdash;not necessarily civil servants&mdash;are appointed; but the appeal, under the National Health Insurance Acts, is to the Minister.  So far as I know, there has not been any serious complaint made to the Minister in reference to any case decided on appeal.  The appeal sometimes comes to the Minister but very often it does not come to him.  Generally, the appeal comes to the civil servant dealing with the matter and, apparently, the decision is just, because we do not hear any complaint made in connection with such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, but there is another matter in connection with this. While it is true that a number of civil servants were very prominently associated in the report of the Committee that inquired into this matter and into the proposals to grant pensions and who were prepared even to go much farther than the Bill itself provides, it is also true that there was at least one minority report with which a civil servant was identified and which ruled out altogether the question of pensions.  I think myself that it was a very surprising minority report.  However, my point is that it is quite possible that a civil servant with that particular outlook might be put on this panel and, if that were the case, I should not care to discuss the prospect of the success of a claimant's appeal with regard to a pension.  I suggest to the Minister that a very good case has been made here for some accommodation and I think that the Minister ought to indicate to the House that he is prepared to give some accommodation in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted the National Health Insurance Acts as an instance where an appeal lies to persons who are civil servants.  The Minister, however, should realise that in that case the appeal to such civil servants is only made after the appeal has been turned down by a person who was himself elected by the insured contributors. In the case of this Bill, however, the insured contributors will have no representation, and it will not be a question of an appeal being turned down by a person or persons elected by the insured contributor.  In this case the appeal, if there is one, will be decided by the Minister.  In the other cases the appeal is made to the society, on the committee <Col N="56" /> of which are representatives elected by the insured persons themselves, and it is only where the committee turns down an appeal that the further appeal can be made.  In the case of this Bill, however, there is no possibility of the insured contributors being able to get a voice in the consideration of claims or appeals.  In any case, I think that there is a very good case to be made here for ensuring that there will be some persons other than civil servants represented on this panel of referees.  For instance, suppose the Minister for Finance were to issue to this panel of referees&mdash;all servants of the Minister&mdash;the same kind of instructions in respect of widows' and orphans' pensions as have been issued recently in the case of old-age pensions, namely, &ldquo;Save £100,000 per annum.&rdquo;  Do you think that any of these people could stand up against the Minister and say, &ldquo;I shall do no such thing, because I hold that the Minister's views on social legislation and matters of this kind run counter to my own&rdquo;?  I think it would be found that the civil servant who would take that attitude in regard to the Minister would be promptly removed from the panel and that the Civil Service authorities would take disciplinary measures with regard to him.  I hold that this decision to save £100,000 in old age pensions kills whatever hope the Minister might have had of justifying a proposal of this kind.  I suggest that the Minister really ought to agree to meet us on this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what the Deputy says about the instruction as to a saving in old age pensions, that instruction was merely to have cases re-examined.  Cases have been brought to my notice where people were drawing old age pensions who were not entitled to draw them. As a matter of fact, a good many Deputies on both sides of the House have told me of cases where people were getting old age pensions who were not entitled to get them.  The Minister for Finance, having heard of a number of these cases, thought that <Col N="57" /> he would be able to save more than £100,000 a year.  I told him, however, that, from my knowledge of the cases that came before the appeal board, his estimate was too optimistic and that if he succeeded in saving £100,000 as a result of the re-examination of such cases, he would be doing very well.  However, in connection with that, I do not think that anything is likely to be done in the case of the old age pensions that will take one shilling from any person who is really deserving of an old age pension.  In this case, I can only say that I go on my own experience.  I go on the experience I have had, both before I became a Minister and since, of how appeals in regard to old age pensions have been dealt with.  We deal with a great many appeals in this section of Local Government.  I think about one-third of the pensions that are granted every year come before the Department on appeal and I have yet to hear a serious complaint or grievance with regard to the manner in which the appeal board does its work and with regard to how it examines and decides on the various issues put to them.  I do not feel that we ought to change the principle.  If I thought that the men to be brought in to do this work &mdash;the panel that would be employed&mdash; would deal any less generously with the widows' and orphans' pensions than with old age pensions, I would at once give way to Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy, but that is not my feeling.  Deputies regularly meet and discuss with the appeal board individual cases of old age pensions. Their arguments are listened to and notice taken of what they say; the evidence they bring along is weighed; and I very seldom hear a complaint against the decisions of the appeal board.  I do not know yet who will be on the appeal board, but I should be very much astonished if any different attitude was adopted towards people applying for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

In that case the court of referees will be a much more independent-minded body than that contemplated by the Minister under Section 46.  If it is such a body a decision of the court of referees should, therefore, be automatically put into operation.

I think it is the very way of putting into the Minister's hands power to put into operation economies in the matter of expenditure on widows' and orphans' pensions such as, I am sure, Deputy Brennan does not want to see wielded. I suggest to the Deputy that he should not move this amendment until, at all events, we see what will be the effect of the amendment which was moved and withdrawn, on an undertaking of the Minister to look into the question of allowing outside persons to be represented on the panel of referees.

But he may not.  Deputy Norton himself has made it clear in this House that if the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the appointment of the panel of referees, says to the referees &ldquo;You reduce those pensions to a certain extent,&rdquo; they have got to do it or be fired.

      <P>The Minister himself has lauded the system&mdash;and rightly so to my mind&mdash;with regard to old age pensions.  I have the utmost confidence in the deciding officers, and it is, as the Minister said, very rarely that cases are brought to the House.  That may be due to the fact that the Minister has got to answer for them in the House.  The Minister, although he has authority with regard to old age pensions, gets very little trouble from them.  His deciding officers are really the people who do the work, and I must say they do it very fairly. That is my experience of them, and I should like to pay tribute to them in that respect.  I entirely agree with the Minister in regard to that matter. Having lauded that system&mdash;I do not see what objection the Minister has to its continuance.  Here we have the Minister for Finance&mdash;whose Department <Col N="64" /> has been pointed out as being niggardly; perhaps it is traditional with the Department of Finance to be that way&mdash;setting up a panel of referees, and I entirely agree with the Labour Party that there is a real danger of cheeseparing.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Sections 50 to 53 inclusive put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 54 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, and in his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister indicated that where a person received outdoor relief or unemployment assistance benefit pending the receipt of a widow's or orphan's pension under this Act, power would be taken to make a refund to the local authority in that case.  I want to raise on this section the whole procedure adopted in that respect. Under the non-contributory section of the Bill a widow with four children will get a maximum of 10/- per week subject to a means test.  A person may make an application to a board of health for home assistance, and as a result may be granted an allowance of say 7/- or 10/- per week.  During that period a claim is made for a pension under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, and a pension at a maximum rate of 10/- per week is granted to that person.  I should like to know from the Minister whether, if a person gets 10/- a week from a board of health in the form of home assistance, and subsequently is awarded a widow's or orphan's pension at the rate of 10/- a week, it is proposed to garnishee the 10/- under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and pay it over to the board of assistance.  If that is so, of course, it is a definite assumption on the part of the Minister that it is possible for a widow to exist on an income of 10/- a week, and to maintain herself and four children.  I should like the Minister to make it clear that it is not intended that this section will operate in such a way as to refund to the local authority or to the Department <Col N="65" /> of Industry and Commerce a sum equal to the amount which a person receives as a widow's or orphan's pension.  Otherwise there will be a definite hall-mark put by the State on the low rates of benefit provided under the non-contributory section, and a definite indication given that those rates are considered adequate to maintain a decent livelihood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This was discussed on the Second Reading.  There was a feeling in regard to unemployment assistance, a feeling on the part of a number of local authorities, that they were unfairly treated by being allowed, without any opportunity of being refunded, to continue paying outdoor assistance to people who were entitled to unemployment assistance but in whose cases delay arose in the payment of the unemployment assistance. At the end of the period, when it was decided that the person was entitled to the sum, the arrears were paid to that person and the local authority, it was represented to me, felt that they were not treated fairly in not being able to recover some, if not all, of the money that they had paid to the applicant for home assistance pending the hearing of his claim or appeal.  I do not want it to be taken that we are stating the amount set out in the Bill to be paid to a widow for pension as the maximum amount that should be given or that it is meant to be an adequate sum on which a person can live.  That is not my idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that in some cases it can be argued that a person receiving a widow's and orphan's pension will not find it sufficient to live on and it is not the full assistance that we would all like to see deserving people getting. But if there is what might be regarded by the local authority as an excess payment of relief pending the hearing of the claim for a pension or the hearing of an appeal, and if the local authority makes a claim&mdash;it may be the local authority would not make any claim&mdash; this gives power to the Minister to consider the question and to decide what amount, if any, is to be refunded to the local authority.  In view of the complaints made by local authorities <Col N="66" /> with regard to unemployment assistance&mdash;and the complaints have been pretty vocal; there has been a good deal in the Press about it in the last few months&mdash;it is only right that the Minister should consider this matter and decide whether a refund is due if payment of excess relief has been made to a person during the hearing of a claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to drop this section entirely.  It will fulfil no useful purpose and it will be a dangerous weapon to put into the hands of a minority on local authorities.  The Minister must not be aware of the fact that, comparatively speaking, there were very few cases of substantial refunds in the matter of unemployment assistance. In the bulk of cases where delay occurred in connection with unemployment assistance&mdash;and, unfortunately, delay still exists in connection with means appeals, in which cases there is no retrospective payment&mdash;the delay was not very great, a few weeks one way or the other.  In the case of an appeal against means the delay in some instances has gone on for eight or nine months and even if, at the end of that time, the appellant's case is proved up to the hilt, he does not get one penny benefit over the period.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain individual members of local authorities have been talking a good deal about this matter. The whole Unemployment Assistance Act has been made the subject of sneers by certain local authorities. The provision for free beef and milk has been the talk at cross-road meetings and certain meetings of local authorities.  We have had to encounter them in various places.  The Minister ought to realise that it would be very unfair to put power into the hands of such people to blackmail applicants who succeed in getting widows' pensions by threatening them with publicity. The best way would be to drop this section entirely, and I hope the Minister will do so.  It can fulfil no good purpose.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that in assessing damages for any action, not merely under the Fatal Accidents Acts, but under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, there shall not be taken into consideration any pension or children's allowance payable under this Bill.  The Minister has gone a certain distance by providing that such a pension shall not be taken into consideration where a claim is made for damages under the Fatal Accidents Acts, but, strangely enough, he has made it possible, by the omission of reference to the Workmen's Compensation Acts in this section, for a pension received under this Bill to be taken into consideration in assessing compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the explanation of this differentiation. It seems to me to be a case in which the benefits received under the Workmen's Compensation Acts should be treated in a like manner to benefits received under the Acts referred to in the section.</P>

In consequence of that, I am proposing in this amendment that all the words after the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; be deleted.  I think that the previous portion of that section is quite sufficient for the Minister's purpose, and I consider that there is real danger in permitting the second portion, which I propose to have deleted, to remain.</P>

      <P>I think that if the Deputy agrees that the first part of this section should be allowed to remain, he gives away his case for the deletion of the second part.  If unforeseen difficulties arise in the bringing of this Act into operation, it would be necessary to have the power that is sought in the part of the section that the Deputy desires to have omitted.  As the Deputy knows, it sometimes happens that unforeseen difficulties do arise in legislation of this kind.  It is not sought, however, to do anything to alter the Bill in principle.  It says here that this power is only for the purpose of bringing the Act into operation.  If a case were taken into court, if the Minister attempted to alter or modify or change the rates of pensions set out in the Bill, it could not be held that it was necessary to do that in order to bring the Act into operation, and the only power sought here is to enable the Minister to bring the clauses that will be passed under this Bill into rapid and effective operation.  It does not give the Minister power to alter any <Col N="74" /> substantial clause in the Bill or to alter the Bill in principle in any iota.</P>

The Minister, however, says that the intentions in connection with the section are such-and-such.  Well, of course, fortunately or unfortunately, it is not always the intentions of this House that are taken as the legal interpretation that may be placed on such things.  For example, suppose the Minister for Finance says to the Minister for Local Government: &ldquo;Here is a certain sum of money and you will not get any more; you will have to fit in that section to meet that amount of money,&rdquo; would the Minister not be entitled, on the legal interpretation of the thing, to modify the provisions of the Act?</P>

There was one case arose under the National Health Insurance Act in which we had to invoke this power to enable us to do something and if we had not had that power, we would have been held up to a considerable extent.  I have a list of Acts here relating to the British Parliament which evidently initiated this scheme.  We ourselves have used it in connection with the Local Government Act, 1925, Section 86; the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, Section 29; and the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, Section 102.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister, in regard to this section and Section 70, that in the case of persons who are voluntary contributors and persons who are eligible to become voluntary contributors, by reason of their having ceased to be in an insurable classification after having completed two years in that insurable classification, steps should be taken to bring to their notice the fact that they are eligible to become voluntary contributors for the purpose of this Act. It is quite a simple matter, since the national health insurance machinery is being utilised for the purpose of administering this Act, for the Society, when a person ceases to be an insured contributor, to notify him of his right to become a voluntary contributor and also of his right to become a voluntary contributor under this Act and the benefit to be derived, especially under this Act, from being a voluntary contributor.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 73:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part II of the Table, to delete &ldquo;2d.&rdquo; where it first occurs in the third column and substitute &ldquo;4d.&rdquo;, and in the fourth column to delete &ldquo;2d.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;nil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section in the Bill, there is a contribution of 2d. payable by the employer in respect of persons engaged in agricultural employment and 2d. by the person employed, making a total contribution of 4d. in that case.  In the case of women, there is a contribution of 2d. which is payable by the employer, the woman contributor paying nothing.  The object of this amendment is to exempt persons engaged in agricultural employment from making any contribution and it asks that the employer shall pay the whole contribution of 4d. a week.  The reasons which prompt the amendment are that at present, as everybody knows, agricultural workers are paid low rates of wages and that has been the unfortunate lot of that section of workers almost from the birth of the agricultural <Col N="78" /> industry.  It is a notorious fact that, under our present system of civilisation, the production of food for the community goes hand in hand with a wretchedly low standard of living. Under the Bill, agricultural workers will be required to pay a contribution of 2d. per week and the employer will be required to pay an equal contribution, but it will occur even under the operation of this Bill that the agricultural worker in receipt of 6/- or 8/- a week will be required to make this contribution of 2d. per week, but, under the Bill, a person in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit, which would be more in many cases than the rate of wages which an agricultural worker is receiving, will not be required to pay a contribution and the person in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act will likewise not be required to pay a contribution while in receipt of that benefit.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, to be unfair that the agricultural worker, whose rate of wages is often less than he would receive as unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance benefit, should be asked to pay a contribution of 2d. a week, when, in ordinary circumstances, a person in receipt of the higher rate of income, via the Unemployment Insurance Act or the Unemployment Assistance Act, is exempt from payment while in receipt of that benefit. I, personally, should have liked the State to pay this contribution for the agricultural worker, but an amendment on those lines would have met with the same fate as 42 other amendments met and, consequently, the amendment in the circumstances is moved in order to put the liability on the employer.  It can hardly be said that the burden on the employer is a very heavy burden. The principle is recognised in asking the employer to make the whole contribution in respect of women, and, having regard to the fact that in relation to the agricultural worker, who is paid low rates of wages, the agricultural employer is very much better equipped to meet a contingency of this kind, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further anomaly which will arise if this section is not changed.  The position will be that the widows of small holders&mdash;I think it is a very good proposal, and I think the Minister should go further along that road&mdash;would be able to obtain pensions without any contributions being paid in respect of such pensions, while agricultural labourers will be asked to pay what will be in the case of people on very small wages a fairly considerable amount.  I think the Minister will see that that is a peculiar position, and I would suggest to him that he ought to take some steps to remedy it.  On the one hand, the widows of small holders on a valuation of £8 are entitled to a pension without payment of any contribution, while there is the extraordinary anomaly that in the case of agricultural labourers, who are in very poor circumstances, a contribution has to be made.  I wanted to direct the Minister's attention to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion to abolish the small contribution that is asked for in the case of the agricultural worker, would, to a certain extent, do away with the principle which I have tried to adhere to all through the Bill in so far as it was possible to do so, and that is the contributory principle.  I know that it has not been adhered to 100 per cent., but, if it were possible to do so, that would be my idea.  I think that the whole ideology of our country is in favour of giving a man or woman an opportunity of providing for contingencies which arise through death or illness, rather than having the State doling out what would be something in the way of charity.  Although it is true, as Deputy Norton says, that the agricultural worker is poorly paid to-day and has always been poorly paid, still it is not too much to ask him to pay 2d. per week for the benefits which he and his family are likely to get.  I admit that their wages are very low in most parts of the country, but, nevertheless, they are getting a very good bargain, compared with better paid workers who pay a <Col N="80" /> higher premium; it may be called a premium.  Judging the matter on purely financial grounds, the agricultural worker is making a much better business bargain.  In proportion to his contribution, he is getting a much higher return.  His payments are small.  I know it is hard to ask the agricultural worker to pay anything when he is getting such low wages, but I should certainly feel disappointed if the House did not agree with me that it would be much better to ask the worker who is in employment to contribute money and be encouraged to provide&mdash;and, if necessary, enforced by law to provide&mdash; against the contingencies that arise. The necessity to provide for dependants will be brought home to every individual in one way or another to a greater extent as a result of the passage of this Bill.  On principle I believe in the contributory system.  I think it is better for the individual and good for the State to teach that doctrine.  The taint which Deputy Murphy talked about will not then exist.  The worker will know that he has paid something for any benefit which he gets.  His dependants will get it as a right.  Again, I agree that their wages are small, and that consequently one does not like to ask them for any contributions, but, on the whole, I think it is a better principle that they should be put in that independent position, and made to feel it is their right as citizens to get the benefits which they will receive, because they have paid for them.  I think, on the whole, the case for asking the contribution is strong, even though their wages are as small as we know them to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I share decidedly the Minister's preference for the contributory system, but at the same time it is no use shutting one's eyes to facts.  It is nothing short of a bad joke to talk of the independence of agricultural workers under present conditions.  They stand as a class apart&mdash;almost the pariahs of the community. Their wages have not the same protection as is afforded by trade union organisations to the wages <Col N="81" /> of other industries.  The conditions of agricultural labourers here are nothing short of a scandal.  I think that the House should recognise that situation frankly by not expecting them to make any contribution which they are palpably not in a position to afford.  I should not at all like to establish it as a permanent principle that the agricultural worker should be relieved from the contributory system, but I should like the House to open its eyes to the fact that the agricultural worker is not receiving a living wage at the moment. As he is not receiving a living wage, to talk of establishing the independence of the agricultural worker by this Bill is little short of nauseating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to admire the Minister for saying that it was in accordance with their conceptions of ideology that the agricultural worker should make a contribution under this Bill.  To talk about ideology to people who are getting 4/-, 5/-, 6/-, 7/- or 8/- per week and expected to maintain themselves and their families is, I think, nothing short of humorous. The plain fact of the matter is that everybody knows that agricultural workers' rates of wages are extremely low, and that, so far, this House has done nothing in the way of either creating machinery to prevent their wages from being subject to further attack, or anything in the way of creating an economic wage for them. The result is that by commission and omission on the part of the legislature the agricultural worker is to-day, from the wage point of view, the outcast of the community.  His rate of wages is wretchedly low.  The standard of life which he is compelled to accept is a wretched standard of life, which is a reflection on any conception of civilisation.  Notwithstanding that, we propose to treat the agricultural worker as if he were in a position to pay a contribution which is half as much as that paid by, let us say, the highest paid worker in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, the worker with an income up to £250 per annum pays 4d. per week.  We are going to require <Col N="82" /> the agricultural worker, on 6/- or 8/- per week, to pay half that sum.  There is obviously a serious disproportion there.  We have heard a lot of talk about the agricultural worker being in a better position to look for those benefits if a contribution has been made, but first of all, before we impose that burden on the agricultural worker, we ought to give him the wherewithal to make the contribution. I object completely to the philosophy that, if the agricultural worker does not pay a contribution, those benefits will look like charity&mdash;like something for nothing.  Good Heavens, do we not give judges and high legal luminaries substantial pensions?  Are not considerable varieties of people in the country getting substantial pensions with not the slightest title or right to them any more than the agricultural worker would have?  When it is a question of giving wealthy members of the community a pension there is no suggestion of charity, but when, in the case of the agricultural worker, we look for 8/- a week for his widow, people want to suggest that she is getting something for nothing. We are doling out hundreds of thousands for pensions in other respects and there is no talk about it.</P>
    <P>If anyone has a claim to get a decent pension for the service he renders the community, it is the agricultural worker.  The State that can pay its legal luminaries and other sections of the community substantial pensions ought not to object giving to the agricultural worker's widow a mere pittance of 8/- a week.  The Minister apparently thinks that the agricultural worker will feel better if he pays something towards his pension, but, apparently, women in agriculture are not to have any such feeling; their contributions are to be paid by the employer. If the man in agriculture is to have that feeling why should the same not apply in the case of women?  In the case of women the Minister has admitted the principle of the employer paying the whole contribution.  There is no reason why that should not apply to men whose wages are only very slightly higher than the wretched rate <Col N="83" /> paid to women.  Such wages are only tolerated both by the men and women in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>In this Bill a person with a holding not exceeding £8 in valuation will come under the non-contributory section. Some of these people would be ten times better off than agricultural workers.  A person with a valuation of £8 in Mayo would be a much more wealthy person, if anyone can use the term wealth as applied to that community, than an agricultural worker in the same area.  The agricultural worker is expected to make a contribution while the person with a valuation of £8 is allowed in without any contribution. Until such time as the agricultural workers enjoy a reasonable standard of wages, the Minister should provide that the employer will pay the whole of the contribution.  I would personally prefer if the State paid it, but that is not possible at the moment. The Minister should accept the amendment, which may be subject to alteration in the light of changing circumstances, but, in the existing circumstances, there is no reason why all the impost should be put on the agricultural worker.</P>

      <P>While I may agree on some points with Deputy Norton, I feel obliged to take exception to one of his lines of argument.  I think it is a pity to spoil a good case by using a weak argument.  He compares the claim he is making for the agricultural labourer to the case of a judge who receives a pension when he retires. We are not in this Bill dealing with old age pensions at all, and it is really only an old age pension that could be compared to the retiring pension of a judge.  There is another weakness in that comparison, and it is this, that according to Deputy Norton's principles, every class in the community would be entitled to a pension, a stockbroker, for example, just as much as an agricultural labourer.</P>

      <P>In any event, there would be no difficulty in finding certain classes that Deputy Norton would allow to live in his ideal State and who on the basis of the argument he has just used would be entitled to pensions.  I think one has to differentiate between such people and those who accept a fixed salary from the State, those who would be considered capable of earning a higher salary if they went out to work for themselves but who accept a lower figure because they regard the retiring pension as corresponding to what they would have saved if they were in business.

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Norton's amendment.  There is a lot to be said for the doctrine of individual independence.  If one contributes even the widow's mite towards certain objects one feels that he or she is paying towards benefits which may accrue afterwards and it does, I presume, give to some the feeling of lifting it from the slough of being charity.  The tuppences and other little sums that are being sought for here and there accumulate.  In view of the fact that in the recent Budget the tax on tea, sugar, tobacco and bread imposed additional burdens on the workers, this extra twopence might have a far greater effect at the end of the year. Once you break a shilling the remainder of it very easily disappears. I would like the Minister to give Deputy Norton's amendment the fullest <Col N="85" /> possible consideration in view of the hard times the agricultural workers are going through and the poor rate of wages.  It is quite a normal thing where I live, and I am surrounded by agricultural workers, because intensified tillage is going on, to have men out all the week thinning beet at 3d. a drill and getting 10/- a week out of it.  There is no doubt every tuppence means something more to them than we can well figure out in this House.</P>

I know what his position is as well as anybody in this House.  It is not to-day or yesterday or since the economic war started that the agricultural worker has been in a bad position.

If the late Government were in office this Bill would not have been brought in to help the agricultural worker, and he would not have many other things that he has been given since, such as the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Deputy MacDermot can talk about the workers now, but the Deputy was not personally very long associated with the late Government when they were in office.  The workers now have many benefits they never had under the late Government.  At any rate we are doing something for the agricultural workers that they never dreamt they would get when the last Government was in office.  There is that much practical sympathy with them.  That is not the kind of sympathy that Deputy MacDermot has with them at the moment, and that is about all he has for them.  The Deputy did not tell <Col N="86" /> us whether he agreed fully with Deputy Norton in asking the farmers to pay this additional tax for the workers.

      <P>This is not a Bill to raise the wages of agricultural workers.  What is suggested by Deputy Norton is that the additional cost or, I should say, the whole cost of paying the premium for widows' and orphans' pensions for agricultural workers should be borne by the employers.  That is what Deputy Norton suggests and that is what Deputy MacDermot said he approved of.  I took it for granted when he said that that he spoke for the Party and when I put the question to him he runs away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather painful that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should be of that frame of mind, that he thinks that every question that crops up in this House, even on the Committee Stage of a Bill, should be dealt with purely on Party lines.  I do not share that point of view.  I am very far from sharing that point of view.  I quite candidly concede that when I rose to support Deputy Norton's amendment just now I did so acting for myself and for nobody else, but I should be <Col N="89" /> surprised if a good many members of my Party were not in agreement with me in the line I took.  Deputy Norton himself said that he would prefer to place this burden, not upon the agricultural employers, but upon the State.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules of order, I understand, prevent an amendment being introduced by a private Deputy placing the burden on the State.  As between the agricultural employer and the State I would a thousand times rather it was put on the State.  I regard agriculture as being treated as the Cinderella of all our industries.  I would welcome an opportunity of compelling the rest of the community to give that small amount of assistance to agriculture in the present state of affairs.  It would be an injustice, I admit, to make agricultural employers pay this sum per week, but it is also an injustice&mdash;and of the two perhaps a greater injustice&mdash;to make the agricultural labourer pay it.  Some agricultural employers may have resources left to them, even though they cannot make a profit out of their farms, they may have other resources left to them whereby they can afford to pay such a thing as this.  We all know that the agricultural labourer cannot afford to pay anything in addition to what he is paying at the present time.  We all know, despite the brave words of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, that the agricultural labourer's condition and his wages at the present moment, are very much worse than when the present Government came into office. Not only that, but he is being pauperised and demoralised as fast as the present Government can manage to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister twitted Deputy MacDermot with the fact that he was only expressing his own views and took a reply by Deputy MacDermot as indicating that, while he would probably support this amendment, the other members of the Fine Gael Party would probably vote against this <Col N="90" /> amendment or not vote at all.  That is a possibility.  But I wonder if the Minister is in any stronger position in that respect than Deputy MacDermot. Does the Minister feel, for instance, that he speaks for all the members of his Party?  After all, I think that a good deal of the revolutionary spirit has departed from some members of the Party since I used to know them in their Opposition days.  I can imagine the Minister for Finance, for instance, making a speech in support of this amendment of mine.  Now the Minister for Local Government is apparently quite satisfied that not only is he himself opposed to putting this burden of 2d. per week on the backs of the agricultural employers, but that even the Minister for Finance has now become so constitutional that he is going to make sure that this 2d. does not go on the backs of the ranchers of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not evolve as rapidly as the Minister, in any case. If, however, the Minister for Local Government feels so confident that he represents the views of all the members of his Party on this matter, there is no better way of testing that than by leaving this to a free vote of the House.  If the Minister would agree to leave the matter to a free vote of the House, and if he is satisfied that all his legionaries will follow him into the Division Lobby, there is no difference between that and putting on the Whips.  But, of course, the Minister knows well that if he left this to a free vote of the House and the Deputies concerned understood the matter, a <Col N="91" /> substantial number of them would gladly vote for an amendment of this kind.  I invite the Minister,&mdash;as apparently he has some reason to believe there will be defections from the Party opposite on this amendment, and feels confident that he speaks for all the members of his Party, being sure there will be defections from that side, and that he has 100 per cent. support from his own side&mdash;to leave this to a free vote of the House.  In that way we will see who really speaks for the Party in the matter.  It is obviously a case of balancing the claim of the agricultural worker with the claim of the agricultural employer. It is obviously not a Party matter. The burden on the State is not increased or decreased by the amendment, and I suggest to the Minister that he might leave this amendment to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>It was rather amusing to hear the Minister speaking of the position of labour in the country to-day under the Fianna Fáil Government. He said they are better off. There ought to be some consistency amongst the Government Party.  We have had the Department of Industry and Commerce publishing figures recently which showed that the wages of agricultural labourers have gone down in Leinster to the extent of 3/- per week, in Munster to the extent of 4/-, in Connaught to the extent of 2/6, and in the three counties of Ulster to the extent of 3/-.  We have that highly subsidised county of which the Minister, I think, would like to boast, namely, Wexford, asking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister advocates extensive tillage, and he has it in Wexford.  Notwithstanding that, we have had a resolution passed by the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture asking for an extension of the free meat scheme to the agricultural workers in Wexford as they are so badly paid there and agriculture is in such a depressed condition.  We have these two things&mdash;the figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce showing that there is a lowering of agricultural wages all over the country to the extent of 3/3 per week on an average, and the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture saying that their agricultural workers are so badly paid that they ought also to get free meat.  Apparently, Deputy Norton and the Minister both forget what is responsible for all that and the attempt that is being made to put agriculturists in the position that they cannot pay wages.</P>

However, this is not the place to discuss by-elections.  Certainly it is not out of place to discuss the position to which agriculturists have been brought by the Minister and his Party, and that they are not able to pay contributions. I have been endeavouring to advocate, during the discussion of this Bill, that the widows and orphans of the agricultural labourers are not getting what they ought to get, namely, a fair deal in this matter.  I still maintain that.  Surely if any case could be made it should be this: that if the Government have pushed the agricultural community into the position in which they find themselves to-day, they ought to come to the assistance <Col N="93" /> of the widows and orphans of the agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have here an interesting document about the agricultural prosperity which Fianna Fáil has brought to this country and the enormous aggregation of benefits which Fianna Fáil has conferred upon farmers.  If the statements in this leaflet are to be taken as in any way sincere, the whole Fianna Fáil Party must be well convinced of the ability of agricultural employers to bear this burden, which Deputy Norton now asks that they should be called upon to bear in place of putting it on the shoulders of the labourers.  Of course, I am far from considering that Deputy Norton is in a position to reap any glory from this belated concern for the interests of the agricultural labourers, because he has been every bit as responsible as the Ministry for bringing them to their present deplorable condition.

Part I of the Bill consists of nine sections relating to income tax.  The provisions of the first eight sections, with slight exceptions, were embodied in Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 to 8.  There are, however, one or two minor modifications to which I may briefly refer.  In Section 3, there are two new sub-sections.  Sub-section (5), which is introduced for administrative convenience, provides that where a valuation, as increased for income tax, is not a multiple of 5 <Col N="97" /> the amount should be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5/- below the odd figure.  Sub-clause (6) enables the Revenue Commissioners to ante-date, for the purpose of Schedule A, a reduction in the poor rate valuation where they are satisfied that such a reduction would give a more accurate measure of the real annual value for the year prior to that in which the reduced valuation would come into effect.</P>
      <P>The last clause of Part I of the Bill, that is, Section 9, has not previously been before the House, but it merely provides that certain of the Revenue Commissioners' officers may, at any time, grant the usual statutory allowances, deductions and reliefs in computing income tax liability.  The necessity for this clause arises from a deficiency in the existing legislation which does not allow officers of the Revenue Commissioners to grant reliefs after assessments have been settled by the Special Commissioners.  Part II of the Bill, consisting of about 20 sections, deals entirely with Customs and Excise and the proposals embodied in Sections 10 to 22 have been before the House in the form of Financial Resolutions already.  There are, however, one or two changes here in certain of these Resolutions, one being designed to make generally clear that the duty chargeable on rice meal at reference No. 6 in the Second Schedule will not apply to preparations which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are made from rice husks.  In regard to the duty on hydrocarbon light oil which will be confirmed by Section 21 of the Bill, sub-section (12) makes provision for a penalty for contravention of the regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners under the preceding section or of any of the conditions imposed by them in such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with Section 22, which embodies the provisions of Financial Resolution No. 23, I should mention that power is taken to continue beyond 1st July next the existing provisions in regard to the issue of licences which were due to expire on that date in connection with this duty.  Sections 24 and 25 relate to the entertainments <Col N="98" /> duty, Section 24 providing for the new scale and Section 25 for an exemption &mdash;a very minor exemption&mdash;in the case of certain greyhound racing tracks. Section 26 relates to the termination of new duties and, in connection with this section and Section 27, very full notes have been circulated to Deputies setting out in detail the effect of the clauses.  The last two sections in Part II of the Bill have not previously been before the House.  Clause 28 merely provides for giving clear legal authority for the present practice of charging duty on the value of alterations or repairs on the reimportation of dutiable articles sent abroad to undergo such operations.</P>
    <P>Clause 29 increases the general penalties for false declarations in respect of Excise duties.  A similar provision has, of course, been in force since 1919 in relation to Customs duties.  Part III of the Bill relates to death duties.  Two of the clauses, numbers 30 and 32, have already been before the House.  Clause number 31 will give the Revenue Commissioners power to make estimated assessments of death duties in cases where persons liable to deliver an account of property for the purpose of such assessments fail to do so.  A similar power, of course, already exists in the case of income tax.  Under the clauses, ample powers of appeal are provided, so that the tax payer will be safeguarded against any injustice which might arise through the making of excessive assessments.</P>
    <P>As regards clause 33, which relates to the payment of money standing in the names of two or more persons, there is a widespread practice of placing money on deposit in joint names.  On the death of one of the persons in whose names the deposits stands, the money becomes the property of the other person or persons, without any formality whatever such as the production to the bank of the probate of the deceased's will.  As the existence of such deposits is frequently not disclosed in inland revenue affidavits for death duty purposes, there is a very heavy loss of revenue.  The clause accordingly requires the bank, <Col N="99" /> in cases such as I have referred to, to refrain from transferring the money on deposit to the survivor or survivors until there is produced a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners that there is no outstanding claim for duty in respect of such money in connection with the death of the deceased.</P>
    <P>Clause 24 provides for the continuance for a further period of three years of the temporary exemption hitherto granted to certain public utility concerns, to building societies and to the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited.  In Part V. of the Bill the definition under Section 48 of the Finance Act, 1920, is extended so that a member of the Saorstát Exchanges carrying on the business of dealer will be able to avail of the flat rate of transfer duty applicable to stocks acquired to be held by the dealer in the ordinary course of his business.  The clause, we hope, will effect an improvement in the market for local securities here, which is restricted to some extent by the limitations imposed by the existing definition. The two remaining clauses, numbers 35 and 36, are the usual ones relating to the care and management of the taxes and duties, and the short title to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine myself at this stage of the Bill to a few remarks and a few questions. The staggering burden of taxation which this Budget imposes is all the more alarming for want of an understanding of the Government's policy and point of view, and their general economic outlook.  In this, as in many other phases of the Government's activities, what is very specially disturbing is the fact that there are so many confusions and conflicting utterances that it is impossible for anybody, however painstaking and sincere, to arrive at a comprehension of what it is they are driving at or where it is they are proposing to get to.  We could face with more courage the prospect of expenditure on the scale which is being laid down for us by the Government if we had reason to believe that they had any sort of <Col N="100" /> sane outlook upon the general economy of the country, and if we were not distressed and disturbed by all sorts of inconsistencies in their own statements about it.</P>
      <P>Take as a characteristic and rather a key question the matter of the bounties that are being given on exports, and the fact that it is thought proper to finance part of those bounties by borrowing.  The Government have alleged, or the Minister for Finance speaking for the Government has alleged, that those bounties must be regarded as temporary and abnormal.  While they have said that, they have not given us one single reason for thinking them temporary or abnormal, and I ask the Minister in all seriousness when he is concluding the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill to let us into the secret of his philosophy about the bounties. Under what circumstances is he expecting that they will come to an end?  Is it that he is expecting a settlement of outstanding disputes with Great Britain, which will enable our products to get in without tariffs and even without quotas, or is it that he intends to give up the British market as a bad job in a year or two, and not attempt to get our agricultural products into it at all?  I think he will see that we are entitled to know which of those two things he means.  Presumably, he must mean one or the other.  I had supposed, judging by the actions of the Government over a now fairly considerable period of time, that they had become convinced that the British market meant something permanently valuable and important to us.  While they were slow to admit that thought into their speeches they did ultimately admit it into them, and were anxious to disclaim earlier speeches in which they referred to the British market as if it were a kind of curse of God which he had got to get rid of as soon as opportunity offered&mdash;as soon as we had earned enough merit to be relieved of the curse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I now find&mdash;I do not know whether it is due to electioneering influence; perhaps it is&mdash;<Col N="101" /> that their latest literature seems to go back to the old position, that the British market is gone forever; that the British market has collapsed, and has collapsed permanently; that the British buying power must be regarded as something that is going to go on declining, and that over and above that the British Government have adopted a protectionist policy which is inconsistent with the British market being any longer much good to us.  Now, if that is their view of the case, it is very difficult to explain a great many of their recent measures and perhaps, as an outstanding case, to explain their coal-cattle pact in which they went to what I think an onlooker would regard as extraordinary lengths to get additional live stock into that British market. They went to the length of actually coaxing the British to accept more annuities from us in the shape of tariffs by the bribe of a monopoly for the supply of coal to this market. When they act in this way, and when they have started again talking in another way, it is really very disturbing for anyone who has the prosperity of the country at heart, because while there may be two views about a particular economic policy proving successful in the long run, there really cannot be two views about an absence of policy proving a failure in the long run.  If the Government are constantly shifting from one foot to another and altering their point of view, what hope is there at all for the future prosperity of the country.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to touch on these matters without considerable repetition of things that have been said already, but which fundamentally are so important that repetition of them is permissible. I want to put it to the House once again that if the Government are framing their financial and economic policy for this country, assuming that they have one at all, and this conflict of statements leads one to fear they have not&mdash;but if they are framing a policy upon the view that the protectionist measures taken by British Governments for the sake of their agriculturists in Great Britain are <Col N="102" /> measures necessarily injurious to us, they are making the greatest possible mistake.  If they would only use their memories a little bit, or if they would look up debates in the British House of Commons or Irish newspapers of the pre-European War period, they would easily ascertain that the policy of protection for agriculture in Great Britain is something that was always earnestly desired by the people of this country.  The reason that the British tariff reform policy before the War was looked on with so much suspicion as it was, was because the whole tendency of that policy was to create protection for the industrialists without creating any protection for the agriculturists. The food tariffs that had been originally proposed were pushed more and more in the background and it was pretty obvious that British electoral considerations were going to push agriculture into a back seat.  But as regards agricultural protection, there was no difference of opinion in this country in thinking that it would be a fine thing for Ireland, and the fact that we have our political independence now is no cause for thinking that it would not still be a fine thing for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Ministers themselves have experienced the desire of the British to trade with us.  The British are, of course, conscious of the fact that even as compared with Australia or Canada or New Zealand the balance of trade between Great Britain and Ireland is very much in favour of Great Britain and that we are taking a proportion of their goods which altogether exceeds in proportion what is taken by other parts of the Commonwealth.  That fact gives us an immensely strong bargaining position and the further fact that in these days of wars and rumours of wars the British must be very conscious of the importance of having a prosperous Irish farming community at their doors to ensure a food supply near at hand is also immensely in our favour as a bargaining asset.  That being so, there is no reason at all for thinking that we could not turn the British agricultural protection policy to our own advantage, that we could not <Col N="103" /> get into exactly as good a position as the British farmer himself with regard to the admission of our goods into that market.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil propagandist keeps harping on the fact that the unrestricted entry of cattle into Great Britain is gone forever.  I daresay that is true, but it does not follow that unrestricted entry of cattle from the Irish Free State into Great Britain is gone for ever.  The British farmer himself has to submit now, it is true, to co-operation in various schemes that regulate production.  There has to be a more scientific adjustment of production to consumption&mdash;better organisation and better marketing.  But none of that need in any way be a hindrance to Irish agriculture.  It can, on the contrary, be a help to it and I think at any rate the Government ought to have it as their aim.  I see the very great difficulties that their policy towards Great Britain creates in achieving that aim, but I think they ought to have it as their aim to secure that Irish agriculture gets the very great advantages that ought to be available to it as the result of the new British policy of protection and restriction and organisation.  I would have more hope for the financial future of the country if I thought the Government were even aiming at that.</P>
    <P>That is the first thing I would like to ask the Minister to tell us, really what is behind his view that bounties and sudsidies are only of a temporary character, only of an abnormal character to meet a crisis, and that we can look forward to the day when they can be dispensed with.  I would like to know under what circumstances does he think it possible that they can be dispensed with; whether he subscribes to the view that the British market is something we can wean ourselves from altogether, as his pamphleteers are now informing the electors of two counties where by-elections are taking place; whether he thinks that the British market has collapsed, that the British buying power has gone, that British policy in any case is adverse to our having the footing in that <Col N="104" /> market that we ought to have or whether, on the contrary, he is optimistic about that market and believes that we will soon be able to get back in there without the aid of bounties at all.  One thing is quite certain and that is that nobody can hold the two views at once.  These views are fundamentally inconsistent and irreconcilable. The Government must either keep to one or the other.  It is only fair for them to tell us on which leg they stand.</P>
    <P>The other question I want to ask the Minister is this: I asked him this question on the Budget debate but did not elicit an answer.  I hope I will be more fortunate this time.  My question is this&mdash;what is the real meaning of this additional indirect taxation that the Budget contained&mdash;on tea, on sugar and bread?  Is it that the Government has come to the conclusion that direct taxation has reached its limit?  I think if the Government have come to that conclusion the Minister for Finance ought to tell us so quite plainly&mdash;that we have to face the fact that an increase in the rate of income tax or an increase in the estate duties or in the rate of super-tax would cause loss rather than gain to the revenue. The yield of such taxes is already unsatisfactory and disappointing, and must we reconcile ourselves now to the view that any further increase in expenditure in this country has got to be paid for by imposing additional taxes on articles of popular consumption.  I think these are fair questions, and questions that ought to be answered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a minor matter that the Minister just touched on in his Budget speech and then left severely alone, and that is the future of the sugar and the future of the motor car industry. In both cases the Minister said that their future was precarious and insecure.  I would like that statement of the Minister's developed.  I would like to know what is to be accomplished and what possibilities there are of its being accomplished in order to make these industries secure instead of being precarious.  I hope then that <Col N="105" /> the Minister will be more enlightening on these matters in winding up the debate on the Second Reading than he was in the Budget debate.  In general, I hope he will give us a better opportunity of understanding the whole economic philosophy of the Government, and if we could once understand it we might face the future with a little more confidence than we do.  Their economic philosophy may be bad.  I am certain it is bad so far as they have one, but it would be better to be sure that they had an intelligible economic philosophy than that they had none at all.  The present situation is that not only are their utterances conflicting as between each other, but different utterances of the same Minister are so conflicting about the economic outlook that it is impossible to make head or tail of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has put a question in this debate that I intended to put myself.  I will enlarge a little on it because there is some apprehension amongst people concerned in the motor car business as to the intention that lies behind the Minister's remarks and his Budget statement.  The Minister indicated that there had been a considerable loss in revenue through motor cars being assembled in this country.  I think he anticipates on this year's figures a loss of £300,000 compared to the higher figure that was obtained when cars were imported complete.  But it is felt by those in the industry&mdash;and that is only one aspect of the motor taxation&mdash;that there is an actual increase according to the Minister's figures in the amount raised in road taxes.  There is a substantial increase in the amount raised out of petrol taxes.  I think what it is desirable to explain is why that particular industry is warned that it must be prepared for an increased taxation in the future.  So far as the luxury side of the motors is concerned it must be covered by the petrol tax, the tax which brings in such a very big sum.  If the Minister agrees to that point, if he agrees that so far as luxury is concerned, the petrol tax accounts for that side of the industry and that the road tax is sufficient to <Col N="106" /> meet the expense that is required to maintain the roads for motorists, then it would seem that there is some explanation needed as to why that particular industry must be prepared for special taxation.</P>
      <P>It is held by those interested in it that the motor industry is in the same position as any other manufacturing industry after you have removed the luxury aspect from it.  Those who have put their capital into the business of assembling cars are naturally apprehensive as to the Minister's statement.  They would like to know on what grounds he holds that the revenue which was derived from the importation of cars must now be raised by excise duty.  Is that the principle of the Government's economic system, that where import is replaced by home production and where that import was yielding revenue to the Exchequer the same amount of revenue must now be raised from that industry within the country?  It is interesting from an important point&mdash;it affects a number of people who have put money into this business, and I am sure the Minister will be prepared to clear the air on this subject and give an explanation that will satisfy those who are at the moment concerned.</P>

      <P>I think it is time, when dealing with the Finance Bill, that the Minister for Finance should let us know at this stage, before we go into the detailed work of the Committee Stage, when he and his colleagues are going to stop the deceptive practices that they are practising on the people and, particularly, when they are going to stop these in relation to the very important matter of industrial development in this country.  We have had all kinds of deceptive practices on the people.  The Minister for Finance on the 15th May told us what his Budget was going to be and what the surplus at the end of the year would be. He did that after he had arranged with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, under the gentle title of a licence, a 5/- tax would be put on every ton of cement and that the Minister for <Col N="107" /> Finance would get from £65,000 to £68,000 this year.  Although he went ever the full statement of the year's finances and told us.  I think, that he would have £10,000 in hands at the end of the year, he omitted completely to say that he was going to get £65,000 in through this back-door.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, the Minister for Finance deceived us as to what the financial position was going to be at the end of the year.  He deceived us as to what he was doing.  I am only mentioning that as a sample&mdash;that on the very eve, because I think it was the eve, of his coming in here to make a statement as to what the financial position would be, both during the year and at the end of the year, he arranged with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to get from £65,000 to £68,000 out of the pockets of people dealing in cement which was to go into the revenue.  But there was nothing said about it here.  As I say, it is one of the samples of the deceptive practices of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Then the Minister for Local Government issued a statement on housing in the beginning of the year through the columns of the <i>Irish Times</i> and told us all about the great work being done in connection with housing.  He stated that during the year ended 31st December, 1934, 6,239 houses had been completed by private persons and public utility societies throughout the Free State.  That was not so.  He included in his figures an extra 1,522.  Wherever he had given a grant of, say, from £25 to £40 for the reconstruction of a house in a rural area, either by adding a bit of a kitchen or changing the roof and putting on a different one, he put that into his figures published in the <i>Irish Times</i> for the benefit of the people of this country and said &ldquo;new house built.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is one in which every Minister who is operating in this kind of way, is affecting the whole economic situation of the country, misleading the people in treading a very difficult economic road, and making a complete hash of the finances of the country and the hopes of the Minister for Finance, either for this year or next year.  Let us get to the position to which I want to come.  I consider that this is a suitable occasion upon which to ask the Minister for Finance when they are going to stop their deceitful statements and practices, particularly as bearing upon the industrial development in this country.  We see that the number of persons employed in agriculture is decreasing, and that the taxes put on the rest of the people in the State have increased by nearly £1,000,000 this year, without saying anything about the £65,000 for cement, or the other things which may come on during the year. The people engaged in ordinary industrial occupations and engaged in service in the country are the people from whom, at any rate, the finances of this country are going to be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1932, we were told about all the additional taxation that was going to come from the rich.  The Minister for Finance then put on extra taxation amounting to £3,900,000, which was all supposed to come from the rich, but it did not.  He is putting on directly this year £1,882,000 in extra taxation.  As was pointed out here, that will come out of every penny that crosses a counter to buy anything for the furnishing of an ordinary poor man's house and out of his tea, sugar and tobacco and the odd time he goes to the pictures.  I want to know, now that we are depending on that particular class of person, the person employed in ordinary industry, for the upkeep of the State, what the position of our industrial development is, and when will the Minister stop the deceptive <Col N="109" /> practices going on at present, and let the people realise the nature of the industrial development going on and the extent to which it is going on.</P>
    <P>We have been given samples of the deception going on.  The Government organ told us on the 3rd June last that under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government five cigarette and tobacco factories were closed.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in answer to a Parliamentary Question in this House some time after March, 1932, told us that between March, 1932, and March or February, 1933, 11 factories had been set up for the manufacture of furniture and upholstery.  He told us that seven of these were furniture factories established in the City of Dublin and that three were upholstery factories also in the City of Dublin.  This House was told that industrial development was going on at such a rate that seven new furniture factories and four new upholstery factories had been established during 12 months of the Minister's operations.</P>
    <P>Gradually, we are getting the preliminary figures for the Census of Production for 1933, and we find that, in spite of the allegation that seven new furniture factories and four new upholstery factories were set up in this State in the first 12 months of the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government, we had less people employed in 1933 in the furniture industry.  These figures only reached us in March last, but at the end of the year in which the Minister told us that, there were less people employed in the furniture industry and less money paid in wages than was paid before the 11 new furniture factories were set up.</P>

They have all been issued with the exception of butter, which perhaps, will not be issued; bread, which perhaps will not be issued; building, timber, metals, excluding engineering, and mines and quarries.  Altogether 21 of them are issued, and when we look at them and see the people upon which this burden of taxation is being placed and the condition in which industry is, we see that during the last years for which we have the figures £24,620 less were paid in wages in the malting industry than in the year before the Minister took office; £55,279 less in the brewing industry; £7,058 less in the distilling industry; and £26,055 less in the tobacco industry.  I see that Deputy Moore has left the House, but he probably <Col N="111" /> knows that £296,000 less were paid in wages in the coach-building industry in 1933 than in 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I shall summarise the figures.  There is a number of headings under which there is an increase in wages paid and there is also a number in which there is a serious decrease in the wages paid.  The increases in wages paid amount to £463,864 and the decreases to £438,447, and this is after two years of all the talk we have had about the alternative market that was to have been built up for farmers in order to make up for that market that was taken away from them.  Two-thirds of our farmers' market lay outside this country before 1931.  The Minister was going to provide an alternative market to replace the market that was being taken away. He was to build up the towns and so on.  Two years of his work of building up the towns has shown, under 21 out of 27 headings in which he deals with industrial activity under the Census of Production that there has been a decrease of £438,000 in the wages paid in certain lines and an increase in other lines, and that that increase has been principally in the clothing industry.  Figures have been quoted here on several occasions to show that the consuming capacity of our people in clothing, furniture, and a number of directions like that, has decreased very definitely.  The Minister for Finance repudiated that suggestion with regard to boots, and he challenged certain figures that I had given with regard to boots.  He said most emphatically that the people here were using as many pairs of boots as ever they used, although they were costing something like £256,000 less than they cost them in 1931.  I did have curiosity <Col N="112" /> enough to find out whether they were using as many, and I found out that they were; for this reason, that during the year the Minister spoke of&mdash;1933 &mdash;120,000 dozen pairs of boots came into this country that could not be described under any heading under which boots were ever described in this country before because they were the kind that cost 1/7¼ per pair.</P>

      <P>I do not know where they came from, but I suppose we could find out.  However, we were told in this House, when we were considering the consuming capacity of our people and the conditions of our people with regard to the necessities of life, that everything is quite alright; that we are saying here what is not true, and that the people are wearing as many pairs of boots as ever they wore: but now we find out that over 120,000 dozen pairs of boots, of a description that could not be found in the records previously&mdash;a special place had to be made for them&mdash;came into this country at 1/7¼ a pair.  I wonder how many people does the Minister think are going to be dependent on boots that will cost 1/7¼ a pair in future.  I wonder, when people are reduced to that condition, to what extent they are going to support taxation for tea, sugar, and everything else that the Minister is taxing to-day?  The Minister asks this country to pursue the policy he is pursuing at the present time in the hope that a very secure foundation is being laid upon which, not only the cost of government can be raised in this country, but the people themselves can lead comfortable, effective and happy lives. A whole range of industrial works has been run over, particularly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at different times; saying that the job is done.  We have over 120,000 people unemployed at the present time. In the western counties&mdash;Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry, six counties extending along the west of Ireland&mdash;there are 50,000 people in receipt of unemployment assistance to-day.  Where is the industrial and <Col N="113" /> financial policy of the Minister for Finance leading these people?  What kind of lives lie in front of them?  What kind of times are these people going to have for themselves in this country? What kind of families are they going to raise?  These are questions that we should like the Minister to address himself to when dealing with this stage of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>He told the Chamber of Commerce that, after this year, we could expect normalcy in the matter of budgets.  In reply to a question here, he said that the normalcy period was to begin on 1st April next.  Is normalcy in the matter of budgets to mean that we are going to bear the cost on the basis of the figures that are there at present and that we are going to bear that while our agricultural and industrial situation is what it is?  If it is, the Minister for Finance and the other Ministers ought to tell us that.  We ought to know, starting out this year, with the growing bitterness of spirit that is in the country, with the steps the Government are taking to squeeze the last penny out of the unfortunate farmers throughout the country and with the number of farmers whom they are now driving into a condition in which they can no longer carry on the business of farming in a satisfactory way, and, therefore, will be no good mark for taxation purposes in the future, where we are going.  The general economic situation in the country is growing worse.  The figures we are getting with regard to industrial development in the country show that a very great deception has been practised, and we ought to know where the Minister's policy generally is leading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things the Minister recently said was that five cigarette and tobacco factories were closed during the régime of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  The policy of the present Government has, as I said, reduced the wages paid in the tobacco industry by £26,000 in the two years for which we have records. On the other hand, the lie is given in the most emphatic way to the other statement when the Minister looks at <Col N="114" /> the figures quoted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself, which show that an industry in which the full-time equivalent of employment in 1922 was only 500, was handed over to the present Government's administration with 1,817 people added on.</P>
    <P>The various items of the Finance Bill will, no doubt, come up for discussion when we reach the Committee Stage, but we ought not go into that discussion, in view of all the talk there is at the moment about industrial development and in view of the importance that must attach to our industrial population in future, without being told something about the condition of things on this stage of the Bill.  In particular, we ought to appeal to the Minister from every side of the House to stop the deceitful practices carried on, and the deceitful statements made, with regard to industrial development here and to tell us the plain truth.  When we know the plain truth, we can pursue intelligent policies, make the best use of our resources and take the best plan for industrial development here to secure an increasing number of people in sound and constant occupation in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, with Deputy Mulcahy, how long he thinks he can continue borrowing for the bounty system and how long he thinks it can be good financial policy to do so.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy when he makes the assertion that the wage-earning capacity of the people has decreased instead of increased.  Deputy Mulcahy says it has decreased by some £30,000 odd, but I am perfectly satisfied that it has decreased to a greater extent in the industrial side alone.  When the agricultural side is taken into consideration, the wage-earning capacity of the people has been reduced by many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pounds.  In a situation like that, the Minister thinks it is the proper time to increase the cost of living on these people, that is hardly sound finance and that is what this Bill proposes to do.  There is no doubt that cost of <Col N="115" /> living of the family in the rural area, whether the small farmer's or the labourer's has increased by a considerable amount and it is going to impose very great hardships upon them.</P>
      <P>This has been fairly well said already, but I should like to add my word of protest against it, and in particular, against these increased taxes on sugar, wheat, tobacco and such things.  These will fall very hard on old age pensioners and on the unemployed and it is in that situation again that the Minister proposes to reduce the moneys voted by this House for the relief of these particular people.  While it may be said that income tax and the other taxes have reached the peak point, I personally feel that, even if they have and even if it may be a greater hardship on people with incomes to pay more, it is a fairer sort of tax because unless a person has an income, he will not be called on to pay the tax.  To take it from the poorer section of the community in the form of taxes on tea and sugar is a very grave injustice, in my opinion.</P>
      <P>There is another section of the community which has been very severely hit within the past couple of years and for whose relief no provision is made in this Bill.  I refer to the hackney-car owners.  They have had representations made but no consideration has been given to their point of view.  The hackney-car owners are a very useful body of citizens.  They are hard workers; they work at all hours and times and the competition is so keen that the prices they can charge are now very moderate and very reasonable.  As everybody is aware, these hackney-car owners purchased their cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am doing and I am putting it in my own particular way, which I hope will be in order.  As I say, they purchased those cars from the motor trade.  In that way they assisted the finances of the State, because the persons who sold those cars were buying new ones and those new cars brought in a revenue to the State.  In that sense they were of great help to the Minister for Finance. Those cars were bought at all sorts of prices, and they were of all sorts and descriptions of horse-powers.  The Minister himself realised some time ago that those people were a class of the community that deserved some consideration, and he did reduce the horse-power to a flat rate of £10 per car.  The number of hackney-cars registered in the country in 1932 was 3,919, and in 1934 because of the change from the flat rate to the £ per horse-power rate the number was reduced to 3,350.  That shows that they are unable to meet that particular tax, and I submit to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should not like to see them get cars for nothing; I should like to get one myself under those circumstances if the Minister would be good enough to give it to me. I know perfectly well that the wool does not grow so soft on the Minister; it is only in an odd case where it is said he has a bucket under the table full of cash that he does anything of that sort.  Those people are a very useful section of the community.  The Minister has not given them any relief under this Bill, although I submit that a very sound case has been made for giving them relief at this particular time.  As I say, they pay a tax on petrol; they pay tax on their tyres and on new cars if they buy them; they pay a rate and other taxes as well; they are hard pressed with bus competition, and I think the Minister should give them some relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass from that for the moment, and come to the various other duties that I think should not be imposed at this time.  I refer in particular to the duties on wheat and tobacco.  Wheat is the bone of life as it were; it is something we cannot do without, and everybody, rich and poor, has to pay this tax. Deputy Davin said that he was glad tobacco was taxed, and that he voted for it.  It is not the first time I have spoken in the interests of pipe smokers, and I think this is a very unfair tax. There is already sufficient taxation without this addition to it.  After all, tobacco is not a luxury to the working man in the country districts.  It is an essential part of his daily livelihood. There are several hard smokers who would do without a meal rather than do without a smoke, and I think, in view of the fact that the wage-earning capacity of the whole country has been reduced, the imposition of the tobacco tax is very unfair.  Even at this late stage I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the imposition of the duties on tea and tobacco, and give exemption from them.  At the same time I should like to urge him to give some relief to the hackney-car owners.  Owing to the restrictions of <Col N="118" /> the debate I may not have made for them the case which I should like to make, but I do suggest to the Minister that they are worthy of consideration, and that he ought to give it to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we can look upon this Finance Bill as a very practical expression of the general policy of the Government in this country. The taxation represented by this Bill&mdash;and the taxation not represented in this Bill, which, as I pointed out before, is a very considerable item and should be taken into account when considering the effect of this Bill on the country&mdash;would in any circumstances be a very serious thing for the country, but in the present circumstances, with the principal industry of the country practically ruined, with the purchasing power of the people greatly damaged, and with the taxable capacity of the community seriously decreased, this Budget, coming on top of the various other evidences we have had up to the present of the Government's reckless financial policy, can only be described as appalling.  Not satisfied with the increases in taxation which they had already put on the country, the Government proposes, in the present instance, to make further increases.  Several million pounds had already been put on by previous efforts on their part to deal with the finances of the country, and now that amount is greatly increased.  As I said, it is not merely greatly increased by the amount mentioned here or by the amount that this Bill represents, but it is greatly increased by other taxes as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of taxes that are not mentioned in this Bill, but they should be taken into account when we are dealing with the amount that the country has to meet, and with the capacity of the country to meet the charge that is being placed upon it. There is a great portion of the sugar tax not referred to in the Budget or in this Bill.  The butter tax, the wheat tax, even the extra amount that was levied for the unemployment insurance, the bacon tax&mdash;all these things which, in the normal state of affairs we might have before us, are not represented here.  The amount as <Col N="119" /> actually represented by the Bill and by the Budget would, in any circumstances, be a matter of very serious consideration for the country, but it is all the more serious because of the crisis that faces the country.  Even the supporters of the Party opposite down the country, not merely Fine Gael supporters, but men of all Parties, farmers at the different meetings, having heard speeches, have now only one question to put.  They may be appalled at, they may feel the extra taxes, but the question they are really interested in is, what chance is there of stopping the ruin of agriculture, of stopping the war that is causing that ruin?  With our principal industry brought to that particular pass, so that it is borne in upon the supporters of every Party that the thing cannot continue, to impose a Budget of this kind on the people is nothing short of criminal.</P>
    <P>I have seen the defence put forward by a prominent member of the Government that taxation and the Budget are means of securing a redistribution of property.  What is there going to be left to redistribute if the Government continues on its policy, if the Government refuse to take into account, as they are quite obviously refusing, what the people are suffering? What will there be to redistribute? Does not anybody see that when the Government deliberately adopts, as I gather from the statement of the Vice-President that it is a portion of their deliberate policy to adopt, taxation as a method of redistribution of wealth in the country, that with the present conditions prevailing, with the destruction of the main industry, that it is nothing else than using pauperisation as an instrument of Government?  I have heard of various forms of terror being used as an instrument of government; I have seen one great Government use starvation as an instrument of government, but of deliberate policy to use what, in the present circumstances, amounts to pauperisation as an instrument of government is possibly unique.  What will there be to distribute when the Government has done with their <Col N="120" /> policy and what evidence did the Vice-President find in this Budget, what evidence can he find in this Bill, of redistribution?  Take this Bill, take the new taxes that are proposed in this Bill to be put on the people, and where is the redistribution?  Possibly between individuals, but certainly not between what might a few years ago have been called the comparatively comfortable, and the poor.  Where is the evidence of the redistribution of property of which the Vice-President speaks?</P>
    <P>The new taxes are to be borne by everybody, and they fall, therefore, as indirect taxes will fall, in the first instance, most heavily on the poorer classes of the population, on the worker and even on the unemployed. What is there at the present moment that any of these people, put them in or out of employment, wear or eat or use or that they see&mdash;what is there that is not taxed, that they, out of their scanty means, do not pay a tax on to the Government, directly or indirectly?  Where is the redistribution of wealth of which the Vice-President speaks?  You have reached the end of that policy of redistribution, as was clearly acknowledged in this Budget, as was clearly acknowledged by the hints dropped by the Minister for Finance and the President. The wealthy have been raided to the full capacity already and, therefore, you have to fall back on the indirect taxation of every man, woman and child, be he poor, or be he a man with some little property.  You have abandoned your policy of redistribution and, when the Vice-President spoke the other day of taxation as a weapon for the redistribution of wealth, he was living in the past, because as the whole structure of the Budget and the Bill shows the time when it was possible, by means of taxation, to redistribute wealth from an alleged well-off class for the benefit of a poorer class&mdash;that time has passed, and the Budget is proof of that.</P>
    <P>It required only a couple of years of the Government in office, a couple of years of their policy, to empty those coffers.  Saturation point has been <Col N="121" /> reached, as has been pointed out again and again, and it is not the rich who are being taxed directly any longer. They all will have to bear it, the income tax people as well as everybody else, because this is bound to give rise to demands for higher wages.  This is bound to affect industrial investment, and, therefore, it hits everybody, but directly, in the first instance, the money is taken not, as in the first Budget, presumably, from the wealthy&mdash;though there again it would hit everybody&mdash;but it is now directly taken from everybody, from the poor as well.  Where is the redistribution there?  The tax on tea, the extra tax on sugar, the increased price of bread, the increased price of tobacco&mdash;where is the redistribution of which the Vice-President boasts?  Is there any evidence of it?  There is none, and the reason is perfectly clear. The Government, some years ago, started on a financial rake's progress. So far as money is concerned and so far as economics are concerned, the Government have continued that, and now there is nothing left in the places where they thought there was money. Whether they like it or not, they are forced to levy taxes on all the people. Last year, and the year before, and in 1932, they pretended to tax the rich for the benefit of the remainder, but now they are forced openly to tax everybody.  That is the position the Government of the country is facing to-day.  It is facing this demand of increased taxation, this demand for increased revenue at a time when the principal industry, as a result of their policy, is on the very verge of collapse, when many of the farmers are already crushed beyond the verge of collapse.</P>
    <P>There are countries in Europe that, as a matter of deliberate policy, have sacrificed deliberately the agricultural community in order to push on industrialisation. But what have you here in this country as a result of Government policy?  Not merely the exploitation of the farmer for the benefit of industrialisation, but you have the exploitation of everybody and you have the sacrifice of everybody.  The town is being sacrificed as much as the <Col N="122" /> country.  It is not the farmers alone who must ultimately bear the brunt of the fight that is now going on.  The towns must bear it as well.  That is what is so hopelessly contradictory in the Government policy.  You take up this Bill and look at it; or you turn up any week in this House and you find new taxes or new tariffs proposed. For what purpose?  Undoubtedly there is the plea on the part of these people of the building up of industries.  There are plenty of examples of these efforts in this Bill; not a month or week passes but there are new taxes put on.</P>
    <P>At the time that the Government are doing that, at the time when they are heavily taxing the people to build up these industries they are making the future of these same industries insecure and I might add hopeless and helpless.  What chance have any industries of surviving in this country no matter what tariffs you impose and no matter what governmental methods you may think up?  What chance have they of being an ultimate success if the purchasing power of the community is being ruined?  What is the situation? Heavy taxation, not in thousands and hundreds of thousands, but in millions, is being added, and that not only with the present being less able to bear it, but with the future being pawned and bankrupted as well. If, as a result of the Government policy, you determine to ruin the primary industry of the country, where are you?  Our primary industry up to the present and for a long time to come, no matter what the Government does, is the agricultural industry.  If you make up your mind to ruin that primary industry how can you expect the others to live?  You urge your policy of protection in order to build up industries here.  Do you not see that you are cutting the ground from under that policy by the way you are ruining the primary industry?  Do you not see that you are securing its failure and that you are not giving it a chance when you are destroying the purchasing power of the country? How can our manufactures, which, apparently, this Bill is meant to help and which the general policy of the Government is meant to foster, succeed <Col N="123" /> with a population unable to buy them? How can there be that wealth distribution of which the Vice-President boasted the other day if the main industry is ruined?  How can you have wealth to distribute when our trade has vanished, when our principal source of wealth has been destroyed, when the cattle trade alone in two years has lost to the extent of £6,000,000?  What is the chance for these industries? None.  What is serious is that the Government really is carrying on two conflicting policies in this as in everything else.  We have plenty of examples of that every day in the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, and we have it here now again.  In their agricultural policy on the one side they take drastic measures to secure its success and, on the other hand, they take equally drastic measures to secure that it will fail.  What are they doing? They are not merely sacrificing the farmers.  They are sacrificing the towns and the country both, not to an economic idea, not for the purpose of building up the country, but to an insensate political policy, to a dispute with their principal neighbour.  One thing is clear and it ought to be clear at this time to the Government as it is becoming gradually clear to most of their followers in the country by bitter experience.  That is that unless the markets are open for this country there is no chance for a revival of our principal industry.  There is no chance of any permanent success for our minor industries.  You are cutting the ground of any hope for any industry, great or small, unless you can open the markets.  When I speak of opening the markets I do not mean opening them to the extent of £10,000 or even £100,000.  All that sort of thing, these minor trade agreements, would be of some value if your main position was secure.  As they are they are worthless.  This is merely playacting and juggling with the situation.  When the Government has deliberately thrown away millions of trade on which the future prosperity of the country must depend, it is absurd for them to think they can counteract the evil they have done by these minor trade agreements. <Col N="124" /> What does £10,000 of an increase in trade here and £100,000 of an increase of trade in some other country matter when millions are being lost?  If you had made these millions secure, all these minor agreements would be of additional advantage. But with the deliberate policy of the destruction of our main source of wealth the thing is ridiculous.  If you think you can remedy a serious situation with the small palliatives that are scarcely palliatives at all, you are making a mistake.</P>
    <P>The Government has made no attempt to justify such an imposition of taxation as is imposed by the Budget to which this Bill is relevant. It has not attempted to justify the other methods of raising money which the Government directly and indirectly has imposed.  Many of these are not even mentioned in this Bill or in the Budget statement.  It would be a very serious proposition and bad policy for a country like this that is trying to establish industrialisation to place on the people such a burden as this Budget is placing.  If the Government is to make good the industrial position it is going a bad way about it in placing a burden like this on the people.  But you have the position that, at the very moment this burden is placed on them, their trade is yearly disappearing by tens of millions.  All that is nothing but criminal folly on the part of the Government.  There was only one respect, in so far as this Budget was concerned, in which there was some bit of hope for the farmers.  We had the alleged excuse for delaying the introduction of the Budget&mdash;that the Spring Show was coming on.  There was at that time a hope that the Government would take better counsel in the matter of their Budget.  Most of us would like to have seen the other Budget, the one that was to have been introduced instead of this Budget.  Let us hope that as bad as this Budget is it is an improvement on what was to have been brought in eight days previously.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will make his point.  He has no point to make.  I thought so.  The question of the tax was not discussed on the quota motion&mdash;deliberately not discussed on the quota motion.  The question of the tax belongs to the budgetary side of the matter.  This was a case in which the Minister could have followed by a provision in this Bill the revision of policy, if there was a revision of policy.  But this Government does such extraordinary things that you never know whether there is a revision of policy or not.  Why is this coal tax being kept on, which is heaviest on the purchasers of the smaller amounts of coal and, therefore, the very poor?  This is another method of the redistribution of wealth the Vice-President spoke of!  Where is the redistribution there, any more than you have it in the case of tea, sugar, bacon, butter, bread, or any of these <Col N="126" /> things?  Why was it put on?  It was put on as a war weapon for the purpose of hitting the British, as was clearly stated in this House.  That was the motive of putting on that tax.  It was pointed out at the time, of course, that merely slavishly copying the British was too childish and absurd&mdash;that because the British put on a tax on our cattle, which we had to pay, therefore if we put on a tax on their coal the British would have to pay.  That seems very simple.  Anybody who knows the conditions and the economic relations of the two countries can see that we pay the tax on our cattle and that we pay the tax on coal.  The brilliant war measure of the Government, that suddenly came upon them as an inspiration to hit the British with whom we were at war, with whom we are still at war, was to put a tax on the coal that our own people pay.  The revenue benefited, but the Irish taxpayer paid.</P>
      <P>Then there is a change, or is there a change?  We are still at war.  The war is on to the full limit at present and I gather from official publications of the Party which the Government represent that it is intended to keep on the war.  No surrender!  But, apparently, just as we are keeping on the war, we are also keeping on the tax on coal.  The weapon against John Bull in the coalfield is still to be used, even though we have peace with him in the coalfield, even though, not merely is the coal not to be prevented coming into this country, but it is the only coal practically we can get from abroad.  The weapon is still kept there, but, of course, now it is openly and clearly a weapon against our own people.  It is again one of those taxes that hit everybody, but that hit the poor people far out of proportion to the extent to which they hit the rich. It is a very strange conception by the Government, of which Deputy O Ceallaigh is Vice-President, of a method of redistributing wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole Budget shows you the lengths to which the Government are prepared to go, not in promoting the welfare of the country, but merely to force their own policy on the country. Financially and economically the <Col N="127" /> country can go down; but the only thing that is to stand upright is their policy of political warfare against Great Britain.  For that the country must pay; must pay in taxation, must pay in the ruin of its industry, in the actual ruining of its principal industry and, undoubtedly, in the destruction of any prospect that the other industries might have, owing to the destruction of that principal industry.  For that reason, because it does represent and well represents the policy of the Government, this Bill should not get a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>To prove too much is to prove nothing. The Deputy who has just sat down said that we pay the tax on cattle and we pay the tax on coal.  What does that mean?  According to the Deputies opposite, it means that the economic position of this country <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British nation is that they can impose upon us any tax they like up to the total difference between the market price of goods and the bare cost of continuing production.  The Deputy who has gone out probably does not understand that, but that remains a fact.  If that is so, if the economic position of this country <i>vis-á-vis</i> any other country is of that character, then it is imperative that that economic condition be altered at whatever cost.</P>

I put the proposition to the House, as I have put it, and I ask any one to contest that proposition: that if it is true, in relation to this country, what is true in relation to no other country, that any tariff put on by us must be paid by us and any tariff put on by outside people must be paid by us&mdash;if that is <Col N="128" /> true, as Deputy O'Sullivan says it is true, then it represents an economic position and an economic relation that has to be changed at any cost whatever. There is no limit to that proposition. If the statement made by Deputy O'Sullivan is true, then any cost and any sacrifice which is necessary to change the permanent continuance of that condition is necessary and is right.  The Deputy went on to say that a very serious position was revealed by this Budget.  There was a very serious position revealed for&mdash; what is the name of it?</P>

      <P>The big wind&mdash;a very serious position for them.  This Budget represents the breakdown of previously tariffed articles as a source of revenue. That is the serious thing that has happened. The tariffs that used to be put on in this House for the purposes of revenue have disappeared.  The tariffs that were put on 20 or 30 articles since this Government came in have disappeared. Why?  Because the goods which were being tariffed and from which that income was being obtained, are no longer being imported.  That is the serious thing that the Budget represents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the Minister's Budget.  He will tell you precisely the things which have ceased to produce revenue.  It is because, to whatever degree it has been successful, the policy of the industrial advance of this country has been successful, that those revenues are disappearing and as far as I can see, if there is going to be a considerable or a complete success of the industrial policy, taxes must be transferred from those things which were previously taxed to other things whatever they may be.  It is no use whatever keeping a tariff of 100 per cent. or 1,000 per cent. on boots, on wearing apparel, on underclothing, on lead pencils even, on wood screws, on nuts and bolts, when they are being no longer imported into the country if we are to have tariffs for the purpose of <Col N="129" /> revenue.  The really serious thing that has happened in this Budget is that it has been revealed that the protective taxes that were put on by this Government have been really put on for the purpose of protection and not for revenue, and that the taxes that were ostensibly put on as protective taxes by the previous Government for the purposes of revenue and not protection, have been converted by this Government into taxes for the purpose of protection.</P>

      <P>Both, if you like.  There is a transition stage and every honest man in the House will recognise that there is a transition stage.  Take the case of any industry which we want to start.  There is a fear that the mere intimation that a tariff will be put on will mean that the country will be flooded with possibly two or three years' supply of these goods.  If a tariff is put on before there is an industry to be protected, it is in order that there may be a barrier, a fortification behind which the industry, which otherwise could not grow, will grow and everybody recognises that.  I mean they ought to recognise it now.  They had no reason to recognise it during the previous régime where the taxes that were put on did not diminish in their return because they were neither of such a character nor backed by such an administration, that the industry which would extinguish them, would grow up, under them.  What has happened? There is a total, a complete change in the policy and the purpose behind taxation.  The policy behind the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been to destroy the yield of every protective tax put on by the Minister for Finance and he has succeeded in doing so.

      <P>The measure of his success is the measure of the increase of the protected industrial activity of this country.  The Deputy said that there had been an increase of taxation by <Col N="130" /> millions.  There has.  Why?  Because there has been an increase of expenditure by millions&mdash;a very simple proposition. Anyone who objects to the increase of taxation is objecting to the increase of expenditure.  There has been an increase of taxation by millions. There has been an increase of expenditure by millions.  To what portion of the expenditure do you object?  When you have said that, you have made an honest and an honourable case for the reduction of taxation and until you have said that, you have not made an honest or an honourable objection to the increase of taxation.  Mind, I am not, quite frankly, one of those people who willingly wish a large increase in taxation. I have never been and I never pretended to be.  I would like to see as large as possible a portion of the total production of any community left in the hands of those who produced it, to be used by them and through them for the benefit of the community.  I have no hesitation in saying that, and so long as the objection to an increase in taxation is put on that basis, I think a man can honourably oppose it but no man is entitled honourably to say: &ldquo;I object to the fact that the Budget this year is £2,000,000 more than last year&rdquo; unless he is prepared to allege either of two things (1) that that £2,000,000 is being worse spent than if it were left in the hands of those who produced it to be administered by them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The next thing that is said is this: if you are going to tax you ought not to tax the poor, you ought not to put it upon meat, on butter, tea, sugar, coal and tobacco; <Col N="131" /> on all those things which are consumed by the poor.  If anyone in this House can name any single thing capable of taxation which is not consumed by the poor, and which can be taxed without detriment to the interests of the State, I am perfectly sure there is a Minister sitting beside me who will be extremely grateful to hear of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if there were something strong in it.  I think the House will agree that it is extremely difficult to find anything capable of taxation some portion of which is not paid by the very poor.  I know nothing in the whole range of taxable commodities and resources which is not consumed by the poor and by the very poor.  The Fine Gael Party do not want income tax increased.  Deputy O'Sullivan, who has just sat down, told us that income tax was paid by the wage earners from whom it was not collected by the State.  He said that an increase in income tax meant inevitably a demand for an increase in wages.  I think he <Col N="132" /> reversed the proposition and was thinking in a different sense.  An increase in the price of commodities invariably means a tendency towards an increase in wages in order that the same real wages may remain.  In exactly the same way an increase of direct taxes invariably means a tendency to reduce wages.</P>
      <P>I will give the House a concrete and definite example.  At the present moment the Cork Harbour Board is losing money.  Its revenue is insufficient to maintain all its employees. Part of its expenses are in income tax which is levied even though the total expenditure of the board is greater than its income.  Part of the money that has to be made good by a reduction in the permanency and security of the labour of the employees of the Cork Harbour Board is represented by the income tax that the Cork Harbour Board has to pay.  I would like to assume that, apart from what Deputy McGilligan calls the usual skirmish&mdash;a lot of skirmishing goes on in debates of this kind&mdash;there is a certain amount of intrinsic honesty lying about and distributed over all the benches of the House, and I am asking any member of the House to tell me anything that he knows that is capable of taxation, a certain proportion of which will not be paid by the very poorest people of the country.  If Deputies are not in a position to answer that question, not merely by one item but by a sufficiently large number and variety of items upon which there can be put a tax sufficient to bring in the whole revenue required to run this State, then they are not entitled to be regarded as honest men if they use the mere argument that a tax is wrong because it is paid by the poor.  If, therefore, there is no article which cannot be taxed of which the poor do not pay a portion, everything is an article which nothing can be taxed, and there can be no revenue and the Government of the country ceases automatically.  Therefore, I take it that there is no one in this House who pretends to think that the mere fact that a commodity which is taxed is consumed by the poor is a sufficient, valid or real argument against the taxation of that commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> What can be done?  We have got to tax things that are consumed by the poor.  The poor consume coal. They do not consume all the coal.  They consume tea, sugar and butter, but they only consume them in proportion to their income.  We have got to tax things that the poor consume.  How can we redress the balance?  I will agree, and I think the whole House will agree, that the balance must be redressed: that any money that is taken from those who are too poor to have their total income reduced for the purposes of the State, except in moments of absolute necessity, it is the business of the State to restore to those people from whom, due to the imperfections of the taxation system, that money has to be collected and more even than is taken from them. That is the whole line of the Budget.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of taxation on the poor.  Where is it going? The money is going back to the poor. Far more is going back to the poor than is being taken from them by accidents and imperfections of a taxable system which compels taxation to be put on those things which they consume. I do not want to go through the list.  Somebody else will probably go through it later.  But the House does know that whether it is wise or unwise, whether, looked at from the ultimates, it is good or sound policy or bad policy; there is money going back to the people in the form of unemployment assistance, more schools and in other ways&mdash;more money than has been taken from them under any tax of this kind.  I do not think that many people on the opposite side of the House are prepared to contest the basis of the propositions that have been put to them.  But they can say: &ldquo;You are taking more from the poor under specific taxes than your predecessors did; with the inefficiency of the taxation system common to the two Governments, you have gone further in the direction of collecting from the poor than the other people did.&rdquo;  I do not think that that is true.  If Deputies would examine the actual taxes which they are complaining about, they would find that it is not so.  Under <Col N="134" /> this Budget, we are getting about £800,000 on sugar and £450,000 on tea. That is a total of £1,250,000.  In 1931, on sugar alone, £1,426,000 was collected by our predecessors.  It does not seem to be obvious that we are the criminals who are squeezing the poor.</P>

      <P>3¾d. now, and, if you deduct ¼d. from that, you will get the previous price.  The only other argument which can be put up is one in whose favour I am very much prejudiced.  That is, that an increase of total taxation means an increase of the proportion of the total production of a country which is taken out of more efficient hands and placed in less efficient hands for the purpose of expenditure.  In other words, in increasing the total taxation of a country you put into Government expenditure, as distinct from personal and private expenditure, a larger proportion of the total.  Every experience of my life has led me to believe, and every experience I have ever had has strengthened the belief, that governmental expenditure of money is not relatively an economic expenditure. To that extent, I am against the increase of the proportion of the total production of a country that is taken into the hands of a Government for expenditure instead of being left in the hands of individuals.</P>

      <P>I know of no other grounds upon which you can object to the increase in this Budget except those: that the money is being badly spent, that it is being spent for a purpose for which it should not be spent, or that it is being intrinsically badly spent, even though it is being spent for good purposes.  I put, without any hesitation, the efficiency of this Government as an administrative body against that of its predecessors. I have not the faintest desire to rake up the inefficiencies of the previous Government but, until it is alleged on specific cases in relation to specific sums that our expenditure is inefficient, there can be no objection on the other side, outside an objection to the purpose to which the money is being put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> I believed that too much money was being collected by the previous Government to be spent on the purposes on which it was spent and in the way in which it was spent. You had a perfect example of that here the other day when the Minister for Lands gave you the actual details of the sort of thing that went on, and was allowed to go on, in the expenditure of money belonging to the poorest of the people&mdash;the people in the Gaeltacht.  Sometimes three and four times as much money was paid to instructresses as was paid in wages to those they were supposed to be instructing, and overhead expenses were outrageously outside the benefits derived.  There was an expenditure of £1,000 in one particular industry, but only £125 went to the people supposed to be benefited.  That was not in the first year of that experiment. That was the epitome of triumph of an experiment in commercial organisation by our opponents.  In what branch of our activities is it alleged efficiency is lowered?  I will take a particular case that I know of.  There was handed over to me a sum of money to be spent in unemployment relief. I honestly assumed, having regard to the fact that the money had been spent in this way over a period of years, that there existed machinery and a method by which that could be done properly.  There was no method, and no information of any sort or description, which enabled a new man, myself, to pick up the threads and organise the thing.  It had to be done from the beginning.  Of £500,000 that would be spent, if you take it from the point of view that the money should go at the right time in the right place to the people who need it most, the efficiency of expenditure under the previous régime was not 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Any money that was sent to the Gaeltacht under the previous Administration, judging by the revelation made by the Minister for Lands, was money wasted.  Any money spent on a relief fund of that kind was more than wasted.  Deputy <Col N="137" /> Brennan alleged in this House the other day, in relation to a drainage scheme in which he was interested, that for five years the Board of Works, under the administration of our predecessors, had done nothing but allowed the interest to accumulate and to be paid by the people of Roscommon and Galway.  That was his allegation.  I will say this for the credit of those who were my predecessors that I know their difficulties in administering.  I know my own. Is it alleged that they tried to get rid of them?  Is it alleged that they tried to clean up the mess in land distribution?  Is it alleged that they tried to clean up the mess in the administration of the Gaeltacht?  Is it alleged that they tried to clean up the mess in the administration of other things?</P>

Deputy MacEoin tells us that the income tax is a failure, though the labourers of the Cork Harbour Board have to pay; even though it has to be collected from somebody.  There are evil factors in all good things, and one of the evil factors in the present completely protected state of existing and growing industries in this country is that income tax can be collected by those who eventually hand it over to the State.  A time will come when the State will require to see that the protections which are now given shall inure absolutely to the benefit of the community.  It is necessary for a time, with these growing and delicate plants of new industries that they should be sheltered even from the mildest breeze of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Because these things are being made here.  For a certain time, even more protection than would permanently be required, must be given to them.  But, it will be the business, and I say it deliberately, of those who look after the finances of the State, to see that all these growing industries, when they have strength and resources shall, in proportion to their strength and resources, contribute to the revenue of the country.  They are not being built up for their own sake, or for any purpose except for the purpose of the State as a whole.  They are being built up for the purpose of providing an alternative source of consumption of agricultural and other products, and they will be required to fulfil that obligation.  To-day no man is being protected in building up industries for his own sake.  No man is being protected for the purpose of enabling him to get better revenue. He is being protected in order that these industries may perform a service to the State, in providing livelihoods which are not now available for the people.  They are being protected in order that there may be built up through them purchasing power which will enable the products of agriculture and other industries to be consumed.  I should like to see a balanced industry in this country. I should like to see the primary producer, the man to whom everyone has given lip service in the last ten or 11 years, but has never tried to serve&mdash;the little farmer and farm labourer&mdash;considered, so that they should get as much return for their labour as the people in the cities get, relative to their expenditure.  I do not know any natural law which decides that a joiner shall get 84/- a week and an <Col N="139" /> agricultural labourer get only 20/- a week.  I know of no natural law behind that.  I know of no natural law that decides that the semi-skilled trades, the so-called skilled trades, the trades which any one of you could be taught in a month, should be paid so much more highly.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that any intelligent man in this House could be taught in a month to lay bricks. Is anybody questioning that?  I do not think there is any doubt about it, if they put their minds into it; but I do not think you could train an intelligent agricultural labourer in his work in a month.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the ordinary agricultural labourer is an infinitely more skilled man, a man of wider and more distributed and more balanced skill and culture in his trade, than three-fourths of the so-called skilled trades.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of bringing about a redistribution which will recognise that fact.  It is on that basis that the whole Budget and the whole policy of this Government is founded.  We recognise as a fact that, as long as we had only one possible customer for one perishable commodity sold in a single market, these conditions of the little farmer and his labourer were stereotyped for all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not be interrupting.  He should set a good example, but he cannot.  Deputy Flinn said, in the position in which we are, with a country <i>vis-á-vis</i> this country that can impose tariffs on our goods and make us pay those tariffs, our economy should be altered.  Is not that the fact?  Is not that what has been explained by a speaker over here; that the coal tax is paid by the consumer here and that the cattle tax in Britain is paid by the producer here? What have Ministers and the Government to do about it?  As I said, in my opening remarks, this Budget is the only possible one.  Why?  It is the only possible Budget because we are heading to ruin.  Will any Deputy over there get up and tell us what product is paying on its own in this country at the present time?  Last week and the week before, the President told us here, in explanation to Labour for not increasing the income tax and for putting a tax on sugar, that we had <Col N="143" /> reached saturation point with income tax and that an increase in the rate of income tax would not mean an increase in the produce of income tax.  Is not that a very simple and practical, if not a scientific, test, to apply to all we hear about the increase in industry?  The Parliamentary Secretary, who has just run out, used the argument that, because of the protection afforded to industries that were giving a considerable revenue every year formerly on the goods coming in, these goods are now being made here and consequently we are losing that slice of revenue represented by the goods we are making here.  I put it to the Minister and to the House that the returns from customs&mdash;I have not got the figures before me but this is my recollection&mdash; were higher last year than the year before.  How have they been higher if industry here is closing up the gap, and, if it is not closing up the gap, where is the loss in revenue on that account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave that point with regard to Britain being able to impose tariffs at her docks and make us pay them, that is admitted.  I tried deliberately to inveigle the Parliamentary Secretary into saying whether that was or was not the position, but he would not. He did not perhaps quite see what sort of answer I was looking for so he gave no answer, but I accept the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary as being true that we have to pay the tariff here and the tariff on the other side.  In face of those circumstances, an economic war was precipitated in this country.  Where were we going to win?  How could we win it? If we impose a tariff here, we have to pay it; if a man on the other side puts on a tariff against our goods, we have to pay it also.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his big deep voice, after a big gulp of spring water, told us that is a position that must be changed.  Why was the position not changed before we started the row? Is it any excuse for a Government when they find themselves involved in a war and heavy artillery being trained upon their forces to say: &ldquo;We have no <Col N="144" /> artillery and the position must be changed?&rdquo;  Only fools or lunatics would go to war until they were prepared for the war.</P>
    <P>Another test to put to our productive industry is the number of people that are employed.  I challenge the Minister or any supporter of the Government to substantiate their claim with any of the arguments or signs accepted in every country in the world.  Is the currency in circulation here greater than it was three years ago?  What is currency to-day?  It represents the small change, the money used for paying wages.  It represented that three or four years ago.  This Budget represents it, or, rather, the fact that there has been no increase in the note issue of this country, shows there has been no increase in the wages of this country, because if there was, it would create a demand for more notes. Because it had not created that demand, there can be no increase in the wage-earning capacity of the people. If there is in respect of one class, some other class must be losing.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that this Budget features the policy and principle of the Government who want to lift all classes, and he went so far as to shed crocodile tears for the agricultural workers and the small farmers, or the little farmers, as he called them.  He spoke of the so-called skilled man&mdash;he mentioned a bricklayer and I suppose he had a bricklayer in mind&mdash;having an alleged skilled trade which any man could learn in a month.  I hope he will get up in the Mardyke in Cork and say that. At that time, anyway, the bricks will not be used for building.  I quite agree with his general principle that there is no law that should compel a skilled farm labourer to work for £1 per week and give another skilled man £3 or £4 a week and I agree that we will have to revolutionise thought on that in this country.  I should be glad to know if the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking with any authority for his Party and for his Government when he gave expression to that principle.  It is a sound principle and a principle which <Col N="145" /> I, personally, support, and I am glad to hear it being enunciated in this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to our financial policy, we hear a lot of talk about borrowing and credit, the development of our industries and all this kind of thing and comparisons between this country and other countries.  I put it to the Minister that there is not a Minister for Finance in any country in the world in the despicable position in which the Minister for Finance in this country is. I do not blame the Minister for Finance for that.  There is not a country in this world but has, at the elbow of the Minister for Finance, machinery to control the finances of that country, the credit of that country, the note issue of that country and the borrowing and lending of that country.  There is no such institution in this country controlling the credit of this country. During the last year, a weak attempt has been made, and is now being made, to investigate that position.  The Government, elected as a Republican Government, and claiming to be a Republican Government, has so lowered the flag of independence in this country&mdash;never mind the Republic &mdash;&mdash;as to set up a Banking Commission &mdash;I think there are some Englishmen on it and some European bankers&mdash;and put to that Banking Commission the question: &ldquo;Are we going to control our own finances or not?&rdquo;</P>

I should like to hear in clearer tones what the Minister said so that we could let the country know that this Government, which shouts for a republic, is running the country financially as a Crown colony. I challenge contradiction on that by any member of the Government or by any Deputy of the Government.  The sole control for banking, currency and credit in this country, lending and borrowing, internal and external, is the Bank of England.  The submission to this Commission of Inquiry which is sitting in College Street is&mdash;&ldquo;Are we going to remain under the control of the Bank of England or are we not?&rdquo;; and, presumably, on the report of that Commission of Inquiry this country is going to be a nation or a Crown colony.  We are, I take it, entitled to discuss financial policy and its bearings on economic policy.  I submit, Sir, that there is nothing more relevant to financial and economic policy, and nothing so important to the State, as the control of banking, currency and credit within that State.  Even the little city of Danzig&mdash;a little city cut away from Germany or any other nation&mdash;has got its central bank.  We have not.  We are asking a commission, on which, I think, a number of the bankers are foreigners, whether we are going to have our central bank here or not.</P>

      <P>What is the trouble with the Minister?  The Minister is caught now&mdash;the Minister for taxation, not the Minister for Finance.  I would certainly apologise if any remarks of mine could be interpreted as disparaging to any member of that commission.  I only mentioned it to bring out the fact that we are submitting to that commission the question of whether we are going to have Irish banking control or not.  There are British bankers on that commission. Of course, we would fight the economic war before we would submit the questions involved to a Britisher, but we <Col N="148" /> are submitting what is a far more important question.</P>
      <P>The question of the income from agriculture has been discussed on this Bill.  It has been mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan that £6,000,000 were lost in the price of our cattle. The Deputy must have been only guessing, because he erred very much on the small side.  During this economic war the cattle trade has been run at a loss of at least £12,000,000.  The price-level in any country is protected by the banking institutions of that country, particularly the central banking institutions.  When the internal price-level or the price offered to that country for trade abroad is impaired in any way by the actions either of the country to which goods are being exported, or by the money policy of any other country from which goods are exported to that market in competition with ours, it should be at once the business of our Minister for Finance to get in touch with the central banking institution here, so as to give equal trade opportunities and equal price opportunities to our exporters here.  Let us take the position as it has been since 1931, and as it is at the present moment.  In addition to the tariffs imposed as a direct result of the economic war, there are, perhaps, greater losses on our trade with Great Britain, which the Minister for Finance, if he were doing his job, would look after; would take immediate power to look after. He would come to this House and immediately have a Bill passed into law to give him powers to safeguard our trade in the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how many in this House trouble about looking up the exchange rates, the exchange advantage to our competitors in the British market, and the exchange disadvantage to us?  Let us take for example a consignment of goods from, we will say, Denmark to Britain.  Let us take a cwt. of butter. I think the price in these days would be 100/- per cwt. for Danish butter and about 82/- for Irish butter.  This is neglecting all tariffs.  We get back our 82/- here; it is only 82/-.  But the Dane gets back his 100/-, and <Col N="149" /> because the Dane is working on a depreciated currency that 100/- is worth 125/- to the Dane.  Why cannot we do that?  We have the power under the Treaty&mdash;this terrible, compromising surrender of the national position.  The power is there in the Treaty establishing the national position, but the Government that continues to fight to get a national position is not using the national position it has attained and is allowing the farmer to sell his butter against the Dane in the British market at an exchange disadvantage of 25/- per cwt. I am sure the Minister for Finance is rolling over in his mind now that there would not be such a necessity to tax tea and sugar if we had 25 per cent. more of an income from the British market, if we were, in the matter of currency, on a par with the Dane.</P>
    <P>Let us go to another country that competes with us in the British market, competes with us in butter and eggs.  I refer to Australia which, of course, those who go back to Cuchulain look upon only as a mushroom colony; but, nevertheless, that mushroom colony is functioning as a nation and we are not.  That mushroom colony has its Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the farmer, when he sends butter to the British market, is able to get as good a price as we get, but he is working on a 25 per cent. depreciated currency as compared with sterling, and when he gets his £1 back to Australia it is worth 25/-, and therefore he has that much of an advantage over us.  The Minister could increase the income of agriculture by 25 per cent., and how much easier would it be for him to balance the Budget.  But he has no control over that.  The power is in the Treaty, but neither he nor the President has set up the machinery to exercise that control and they are allowing the agricultural industry here to be robbed in the unequal competition in the British market, quite apart from the economic war, and it is a bigger robbery than the economic war is inflicting on our agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance rose to a <Col N="150" /> point of order and said this had nothing to do with the Bill and it should be raised on some other occasion. The fact is, this affects the very fundamentals of national economic policy.  What legacy has the neglect of this left on the country?  It has hamstrung the agricultural industry. The present Government are aware, and the previous Government were aware, that there are probably millions of frozen debts due to the Banks hanging like a dreadful nightmare over the agricultural industry in this country, and the settlement of those debts is a very urgent matter in order to release agriculture for production.  These debts accumulate. There is not anywhere under Irish control a central institution that could influence banking and credit policy here, and we are allowed to muddle on.  We have set up a make-believe, a makeshift of a Commission. I wonder what business man would think of starting business until he had first arranged with his bankers for his credits, his bank balances, his petty cash, etc., sufficient to run the business under his control?  I wonder would he think for a moment of starting business, leaving the power to lend and borrow petty cash and ready cash under the control of his competitor? That is precisely what we as a nation have been and are doing.  Hence we have got the more enterprising and ambitious section of the farmers tied up, their lands mortgaged three times beyond what they are worth, and creating a national problem, which, I happen to know from documents I was entitled to see, must be giving the Minister for Finance some worry, as it gave his predecessor worry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that on the eve of the Budget a tax of 5/- a ton was put on cement.  Those who have to deal with cement know that all the cement was imported and the consumption was increasing.  I suppose at 5/- a ton the £50,000 or £60,000 which Deputy Mulcahy mentioned would come into the revenue.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that that was not mentioned in the Budget?  I do not think it is even mentioned in <Col N="151" /> this Bill.  I wonder how the Minister proposes to balance his Budget in the coming year when he is taxing to the extent of one-sixth, anywhere from 15 to 20 per cent., such an essential article as cement.  All we did to produce cement in this country was to pass an Act a year or two ago and hang it up.  There is no cement being produced here.  Then there is the raw material of industry&mdash;coal&mdash;and it is also used extensively in the household here, and both those commodities are taxed and there is no sign of their production here.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, when he was deprecating the action of the previous Government in taxing for revenue, to explain his position in the matter.  I do not suppose that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with the principle, but I agree that there should not be taxation under the guise of protection but in reality to produce revenue.</P>
    <P>I cannot say on what grounds the cement tax is justifiable.  It is adding to the housing costs in a falling market.  The operation of these two forces is going to diminish the income from the building trade.  The method adopted in this Bill is to tax an income that a man has not got.  That is done in one of the earlier sections where the Minister proposes to capitalise private ground rents and tax them.  He is going to tax these ground rents which were portion of the deferred price of the house and which made it easier for the buyer to purchase his house.  What is going to happen in the future?  The builder is going to sell his house at the full cost plus a margin of profit.  If the builder does not get his margin of profit he is going to stop building. The fact is that the private builders have proved that they are able to produce houses more economically than the local authorities can by direct labour.  Now the profits that were shown in the ground rents are going to be capitalised.  This would make the speculative builder put up all his costs into the price of the house and sell it.  Those costs will <Col N="152" /> be increased by the cement tax; they will be increased by the pipe tax in this Bill; they will be increased by the copper tubing tax and by the glazed earthenware tax.  There will be a tax on all these materials used in the construction of houses.  Still we want more and more houses but the money resources are drying up. A person who was able to pay £1,000 for a house a few years ago and persons who could even compete at higher prices than £1,000 are not to be found now.  Seven or eight years ago people were waiting for houses to be built and were paying the full price for them in cash. There is nobody able to pay cash prices for houses now and neither is there money available through the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act for people who wish to buy their houses. Anybody in touch with business knows that in the building trade generally it is on the ground rents that the builder hopes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would rather address the Front Bench.  I was just saying, Sir, that this Budget has in various respects very materially increased the cost of house building.  It also takes away the profits made on house building. This will interfere with the building trade by increasing the cost of building material.  This is being done at a time when money is getting scarce.  A certain class of people&mdash;<Col N="154" /> people who have been waiting to buy a £450 to a £750 house&mdash;have been rapping in vain at the door of the Corporation looking for houses. People of that class form the overwhelming bulk of applicants for houses.  Deputy Kelly will say that the basement dwellers must be first. That is right.  But the drawingroom dwellers are pushing the poorer people down into the basement.  That is because of the great competition for houses, the stringency of money, the increased cost of building materials, and lastly, because of the confiscation of profits.  For all these reasons fewer houses will be built.  I hope the Government will succeed where the local authorities have failed; but all these factors I have mentioned conspire to restrict building operations.</P>
