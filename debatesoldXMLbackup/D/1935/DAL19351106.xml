      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state whether it is the intention to discontinue, the publication of the reports of the Free State Delegations to the League of Nations, and if so, if he will state what is the reason, and if not, when it is proposed to publish the report of the delegation to the Thirteenth Assembly in September, 1932, to the Fourteenth Assembly in September, 1933, to the Fifteenth Assembly in September, 1934, and to the Sixteenth Assembly of 1935.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state whether it is the intention to discontinue the presentation to the Oireachtas of reports on the sessions of the Council of the League of Nations, and if so, if he will state what is the reason, and if not, if he will state when it is proposed to present to the Oireachtas reports on the sessions of the Council held during the years 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer questions 1 and 2 together.  It is not the intention to continue the publication of reports of the kind referred to by the Deputy, for the <Col N="434" /> reasons which I explained to the Dáil on the 4th June last in connection with the Estimate for the League of Nations.  As I explained on that occasion, these reports were little more than extracts from, and incomplete summaries of, the official League of Nations reports, which are in the Oireachtas Library.  They contained nothing that was not already available to Deputies, either in the official report itself or the public Press.  I shall, however, lay reports before the House from time to time on any particular aspect of the League's work, or on special subjects discussed at Geneva, should the Government consider it necessary or desirable to do so, or should there be a desire on the part of Deputies for any report of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand from the President that since the coming into office of the Fianna Fáil Government nothing has occurred at the League of Nations that the President considers should be drawn to the notice either of the Oireachtas or the people of this country by way of special report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is to infer nothing of the kind.  The point is that there is no report that we think is needed to supplement the information which is available to Deputies in the Oireachtas Library or in the public Press.  I might state that the position with regard to these reports was that from 1925 to 1928 stencilled reports were made available in the Library, and from 1929 to 1931 &mdash;that is, three reports&mdash;the reports were printed and published.  The cost of each printed report of the Assembly was between £40 and £60.  There were 350 copies printed and only about ten were sold, so that it seemed a waste of public money to publish the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance attaching to the League of Nations and to our membership of the League, does the President not consider it an extraordinary state of <Col N="435" /> affairs that members of the Oireachtas who wish to make themselves acquainted with the attitude taken up by our representatives or by our Government at Geneva, or who wish to inform themselves with regard to matters in which this country are especially interested, are invited by the President to go through the whole mass of reports of the League of Nations to find out information on these subjects?  Surely the President will agree that where there are special matters in which the Government of the Free State are interested at the League of Nations, both at the Assembly and at the Council, these matters should be reported on as they have been in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the League of Nations we are interested to a greater or lesser degree in all the matters discussed by the League.  To select portions would be to give a very incomplete picture of the whole situation. In the Oireachtas Library full information is available for every Deputy and unless we were to publish a very large and extensive volume a proper picture would not be got.  As I said, the reports already published were a very incomplete and inadequate picture of what was happening there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the President will admit that there is a rather restricted number of matters that bear more directly on the interests of this country and that these matters should be specially drawn to the notice of members of the Oireachtas by the annual reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have indicated to the Deputy and to the House generally that if there is any matter as to which, in the opinion of the Government, a special report is necessary, or if there is any general desire on the part of Deputies to get further information about any particular aspect, a report will be given.  Otherwise, as I say, I regard it as a waste of public money.  Before we came into <Col N="436" /> office there was an unofficial intimation from the Department of Finance that it seemed a waste of public money to provide 350 copies like that when only ten were actually sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that the Government are incompetent to pick out the matters that particularly affect this country.</P>

      <P>I am making inquiries in the matter and shall be glad to consider any further evidence regarding the prices charged generally for galvanised hollow-ware goods which the Deputy may wish to submit to my Department; I will then consider whether the circumstances warrant referring the matter to the Prices Commission for investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has treated as information the text of the question I have addressed to him in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I take it that I am to assume that that has set him on inquiry and that he will require explanation from these manufacturers of the disparity of 50 per cent., or almost 50 per cent., that exists between their prices and those quoted by extra-Saorstát suppliers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the Minister knew his job he would recognise that large quantities of galvanised buckets are coming in over the duty at the present time.  It is for that reason I have directed his attention to a situation in which one of his tariffs has broken down because of the profiteering activities of certain people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he is aware that <Col N="440" /> electrical wiremen in Dublin have been disemployed recently, not through lack of work, but through the inability of wiring contractors to get certain classes of wire necessary for carrying out the work, and if he will state why it is impossible to secure this wire now, and what he proposes to do in the matter, so that the work may progress and the wiremen be re-employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated in the first part of the question, nor am I aware that there is any difficulty in obtaining any class of wire either from Saorstát or non-Saorstát sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, in fact, unemployment in the City of Dublin in the wiring industry by reason of the fact that contractors cannot get this wire.  Do I understand from the Minister that he has not had any representations from the merchants in the city who sell this wire to the effect that the factory in New Ross is not able to provide this wire because of the difficulties put in the way of the factory in importing the wire which they import as raw material for covering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, will the Minister make inquiries of one or two of the bigger firms with a view to confirming that, because there is a considerable amount of complaint and there is a considerable amount of feeling that there is no use in approaching the Minister's Department in connection with that matter?  That complaint is definitely made and I suggest that it would be well for the Minister to probe the matter and say whether the dealers in this wire have the complaint given in the City of Dublin as a reason for persons being put off work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Many firms approach the Department regularly for licences <Col N="441" /> to import wire that is not procurable in this country, and these licences are being issued.  I think that no firm would think it necessary to approach the Department in the circumstances described by the Deputy.  No such approach has been made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total value of the (a) imports from and (b) exports to Italy during (1) the 12 months ended 31st December, 1934, and (2) the nine months ended September, 1935, and if he will state the nature of the principal articles imported and exported and their quantity and value in respect of each of the two periods.</P>

      <P>The value of the imports consigned from Italy to Saorstát Eireann in the year 1934 was £50,315 and the exports to Italy £12,863 and re-exports £437.  The imports consigned from Italy in the first three months of 1935 amounted to £10,589.  From 1st April imports into Saorstát Eireann have been compiled by country of origin.  The value of the imports of Italian origin in the six months April-September, 1935, was £82,554.  The exports to Italy in the nine months January-September, 1935, amounted to £2,834 and re-exports to £25.  I am circulating with the Official Report statements giving the quantity and value of the principal items of import and export trade between the countries in the two periods.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Nos. 16 to 20 together.  The particulars which the Deputy desires are not available for the year 1933, except as regards the quantity of creamery butter produced, which was 678,202 cwts., and <Col N="455" /> the quantity and value of coal raised, which was 105,287 tons valued at £79,104.  Complete censuses of industrial production were taken for the years 1926, 1929 and 1931, but for reasons of economy it was decided to restrict the censuses for the years 1932 to 1935, inclusive, to certain industries which are specified in the Statistics (Census of Production) Order, 1932. The industries referred to in the Deputy's questions were not amongst those included in these limited censuses. It is proposed to hold an inquiry in respect of the production of all industries for the year 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to give vocational education committees power to avail themselves of the provisions of the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance Acts, 1926 and 1928.  Before the passing of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, the technical instruction committees, the predecessors of the present vocational education committees, were authorised to associate with other local authorities for the purpose of promoting a company to provide for the mutual assurance of its members against damage to their property by fire and also liability to pay compensation or damages to workmen employed by them.  The company which has been formed by local authorities for these purposes is known as the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, Limited, and is composed exclusively of local authorities and their committees.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that application of the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Acts, 1926 and 1928, is restricted to the types of local authorities and their committees in existence at the passing of the 1926 Act and that new statutory local bodies must be given express power before they can associate themselves with other local authorities in a mutual insurance company. It is this need for specific authority to vocational educational committees that has made this Bill necessary.  The Vocational Education Act, 1930, which established these committees, does not give the necessary authority to the committees established under the Act.  There was, however, no intention to withdraw from vocational education committees the mutual assurance powers exercised by their predecessors, nor did the original Act of 1926 contemplate any restriction in the meaning of the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;committees of local authorities&rdquo; such as would exclude vocational education committees. These committees have, since they were established, assumed that they had the same powers in respect of mutual assurance as their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> The present Bill puts the vocational education committees in the same position in regard to mutual assurance as the old technical instruction committees. It validates any action taken by vocational education committees in the belief that they were in the same position. It furthermore gives the Minister for Local Government authority to confer similar powers on any local authority or on any committee of a local authority, a provision which will make the existing law more flexible and obviate the necessity for seeking express statutory authority whenever a new local authority is created.  I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Slaughter of Animals Bill, 1935, be read a Second Time.  This measure is intended to replace the Slaughter of <Col N="461" /> Animals Bill, 1933, which originated in the Seanad, and the provisions of which were not considered satisfactory from the administrative standpoint. The object of the present Bill is to provide that animals awaiting slaughter in slaughter houses will be properly maintained, and that their slaughter will be carried out in such a manner as to inflict as little pain and suffering as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill is to come into force on appointed days to be fixed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for its coming into operation in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and in the remainder of Saorstát Eireann, respectively.  The provisions of the Bill are to apply to cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, asses and mules.  It is to be noted that the term &ldquo;slaughterhouse&rdquo; will include all buildings and other places used for the slaughter of animals for sale or for conversion into products for sale. Exemption is granted, however, to farm buildings or premises which are used only for the occasional slaughter of pigs produced on the farm.  This is intended to exclude from the operation of the Bill occasional killings of pigs carried out by farmers in connection with the management and working of their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is intended to come into force in every county borough, borough and urban, district as from the time appointed, but it may also be applied to any county health district, or any portion thereof, by Order of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  On such an Order being made, statutory powers for the regulation of slaughterhouses are conferred on the board of health of the district concerned.  If a town administered by town commissioners is situated in such district the powers of the town commissioners for the regulation of slaughterhouses will thereupon pass to the board of health. It may be pointed out that such powers were originally conferred on town commissioners by the Towns Improvement (Clauses) Act, 1847, and the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, but consequent on the <Col N="462" /> establishment and development of sanitary authorities under the Public Health Acts, the powers of town commissioners in regard to the control of slaughterhouses were not supplemented, and these bodies do not now possess the necessary staff for the efficient exercise of their functions in regard to the regulation of slaughterhouses. It is also contemplated that boards of health will be authorised to make by-laws with respect to the inspection of meat intended for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The duty of enforcing this legislation is imposed on the sanitary authority and veterinary officers of each area to which it applies and power is vested in the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to ensure that this duty is carried out.  Arrangements are made for defraying expenses incurred by the State Departments and by sanitary authorities in connection with this legislation.  Wherever the Act is in force, right of entry to any slaughterhouse at all reasonable times or when work is being carried on therein is conferred on members of the Gárda Síochána and on officers of the local sanitary authority for the purpose of ensuring that the terms of the Act are being complied with.  The penalty for contravention of bye-laws for the regulation of slaughterhouses is to be increased in respect of a continuing offence.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill requires that a suitable supply of food and water shall be provided for animals in slaughterhouses while awaiting slaughter.  It also prohibits the slaughter of any animal in a slaughterhouse in view of any other animal, but exemption from this requirement is granted in favour of existing slaughterhouses if substantial structural alterations would be necessary for that purpose.  Unnecessary or avoidable cruelty in the slaughter of animals is prohibited, and for this purpose it is prescribed that a person slaughtering an animal in a slaughterhouse shall use only an instrument approved by the Minister for Agriculture for the slaughter of that particular class of animal.  Exemption <Col N="463" /> from this requirement is granted in respect of the killing of pigs until an Order withdrawing such exemption is made by the Minister for Agriculture. Arrangements are also made to exclude from the provisions of the Act the killing of animals in accordance with the ritual of certain religious denominations, and also where an animal has to be slaughtered to prevent unnecessary pain or suffering to such animal, or injury to any human being or to another animal or to property.</P>
    <P>As the instruments at present utilised for the humane slaughter of animals usually take the form of a pistol discharging a captive bolt or explosive cartridges, it is desirable that the persons using these humane slaughterers should be subject to supervision and control.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill accordingly deals with the licensing of such persons and empowers a sanitary authority to license for that purpose any person over 18 years of age who is resident or employed in their district, provided that he is considered to be a fit and proper person to hold such licence and that he pays the prescribed fee.  Power is granted to each sanitary authority to suspend or revoke slaughter licences issued by them, but right of appeal to a District Court is given to any person who has been refused a slaughter licence or whose licence has been suspended or revoked.  If the holder of a slaughter licence is convicted of an offence under this Act, the court dealing with the offence may revoke the licence and disqualify the holder from obtaining another licence for a specified period. Penalties are prescribed for the forgery, alteration, misuse or fraudulent transfer of slaughter licences. Power is given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to make regulations for various purposes in connection with the issue and registration of slaughter licences and the notification to the sanitary authorities concerned of information as to the issue and revocation of such licences.</P>
    <P>I desire at this juncture to draw <Col N="464" /> attention to a slight error in Section 9 of the Bill, where reference to Section 127 of the Towns Improvement Act, 1847, has been inserted by mistake instead of Section 128 of that Act.</P>
    <P>While it is agreed that the slaughter of animals is usually carried out in the most humane manner possible, there is little doubt that cases occur from time to time where, either through inexperience or carelessness in the handling of slaughtering instruments, much unnecessary pain and suffering is inflicted on animals in the process of slaughtering.  The aim of this legislation is to secure that, where practicable, an approved instrument for the slaughter of animals will be utilised which will ensure instantaneous death or unconsciousness and thereby obviate, as far as possible, suffering or cruelty.  The provisions of the Bill have been carefully drafted and considered.  I feel sure that this Bill will commend itself to all Parties in the House.</P>

      <P>When he was introducing the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary told us that the provisions of the 1933 Act were not satisfactory.  I think he ought to tell us, before we engage in a discussion of this Bill, in what way was it not satisfactory or how is he endeavouring to amend it by this Bill.  I am not surprised that the 1933 Act was unsatisfactory, but I would like to know how this is remedy-its defects.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy must have misunderstood me.  I said that this measure was intended to replace the Slaughter of Animals Bill, 1933, which originated in the Seanad but which never became an Act.  This is a Government measure replacing the Bill which originated in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I misunderstood the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to that matter. So far as we are concerned, we are supporting this Bill.  We want all the various matters that are laid down in the different sections carried out, and we have just the same anxiety in that respect as the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="465" /> has.  There are some things upon which I have slight misgivings.  As in the case of most Acts passed here in which the local authority is made the medium of licensing and enforcing the laws made by this House, not alone is the work thrown on the local authority but also the expense.</P>
      <P>According to the provisions set out in Section 7, all expenses incurred by the sanitary authority must be borne by the local rates.  This is really a national matter and I think the local authority should not have to bear all the expense.  We have the same sort of provision in the Clean Milk Bill and in all other legislation where the local authority is made the medium of administration.  In such cases the local rates have to carry the burden. I take this opportunity of protesting against those provisions.</P>
      <P>Those matters are really national matters and the licensing of slaughterhouses and persons who slaughter live stock and look after the preparation of human food ought to be a matter for a central authority.  If they get the local authorities to carry out the work for them, good and well, but I think it is manifestly unfair to increase further the burdens of the local authorities by asking them to pay for these things.</P>
      <P>There are some other matters which we may not have time to go into at this, stage and perhaps they will arise more properly on the Committee Stage. In Section 16 reference is made to persons who may be liable in respect of offences.  I think that under that section we might perhaps inflict very grave and serious hardships upon certain proprietors or owners of slaughterhouses if they were to be held responsible for any of the offences set out in preceding sections.  Of course, that will more properly come up on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing more to say about the matter, except that I welcome the Bill as far as control is concerned. Slaughterhouses ought certainly to be kept in a fit and proper condition, but I object to piling responsibility for all these matters on to the local authorities, and to all this expenditure having to be paid out of the rates.  At present, local authorities find it hard to carry on, and this increase in their expenditure <Col N="466" /> is bound to act as the last straw that breaks the camel's back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These kind of Bills are becoming much more common with the passing of every year, providing local authorities, or the Government, with further powers to interfere with the business of the country.  But under the special circumstances that obtain, and in view of the fact that this Bill is for the prevention of cruelty to animals, we, on this side of the House, support it because we believe that this is one of the occasions on which it is justifiable to interfere in people's business in order to prevent evils that otherwise could not be prevented, and for the purpose of putting an end to them.  But it is a type of Bill which must be examined very carefully with a view to restricting the Government to the exact purposes for which the Bill has been introduced, and to prevent them using the powers under this Bill for purposes entirely other than those for the prevention of cruelty to animals.  In that connection, I direct attention to the powers conferred upon the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the slaughter of pigs on farms.  The Minister has power under a section of this Bill&mdash;if I understood the Parliamentary Secretary aright&mdash; to prohibit at a certain stage the slaughter of pigs upon farms.  Or do I misinterpret the Parliamentary Secretary?  Are the powers restricted to the putting of that section of this Bill into operation in respect of farms in regard to the slaughter of pigs? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will inform the House as regards that particular matter now.  Would he be good enough to say whether we heard him correctly upon this matter?</P>

      <P>I would prefer if the debate did not proceed by way of question and answer; but in order to facilitate the Deputy I might say to him that no such power is given to the Minister for Agriculture as he thinks.  The Deputy probably had not time to read carefully through the Bill.  If he had he would find that sub-section (3) of Section 2 provides &ldquo;A buildine or other place situate on a farm shall not be a slaughterhouse for the purposes or within the meaning <Col N="467" /> of this Act merely by reason of the fact that such place is used for the occasional slaughter of pigs produced on such farm....&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Parliamentary Secretary's refusal to conduct this debate by way of question and answer, facts have emerged through that procedure that will probably shorten the debate considerably.  The sub-section to which I referred is in Section 13 and provides that the Minister for Agriculture shall prescribe a particular type of instrument to be an approved instrument for the purpose of Part II of the Bill in relation to pigs; but that this section shall not apply to pigs save when, and for so long as an order made by the Minister for Agriculture declaring that this section shall apply to pigs, is in force. It would, of course, be an extremely dangerous thing to allow the Minister to prescribe an instrument as being essential to the operation of the slaughter of pigs, in the ordinary course of farm management, and I think it is right, on the occasion of a Bill of this kind, to point out that, desirable as it may be to avoid animal suffering, of any kind that could be avoided, it would be a most dangerous and undesirable principle to authorise the Government to interfere in the every-day proceedings of a farm building because in that way we would open the door to abuses which might weigh very heavily indeed upon the agricultural community.  I can well imagine that certain strong protagonists of this Bill will use it to make a very strong case for extending its provisions to the ordinary farm building.  They will say: &ldquo;Why should a farmer, outside a town, be allowed to slaughter an animal cruelly while a butcher inside a town will have to follow very strict <Col N="468" /> rules?&rdquo; At first, that will sound a very convincing argument but the answer is that any cruelty that takes place in the slaughter of pigs or cattle on a farm, in the ordinary course of farm business, is an evil not susceptible to correction by legislation, and that the only way of preventing such is by propaganda and exhortation to the ordinary farmer.  Any such attempt if made, and power conferred upon the Minister, stipulating regulations under which pigs and cattle may be slaughtered on a particular farm would sooner or later enable the Minister for Agriculture, if he desires, to put an end to the slaughter of pigs on farms, using his powers under this Bill in order to stop or check, or restrict the manufacture of bacon or the consumption of pigs upon farms. And we will further find that once that is admitted every private house or tenement of any man, or every man, would be open to Government inspectors and that in all matters of that kind, nothing will be closed to them, and the carrying on of normal legitimate business of farmers will become entirely impossible.</P>
      <P>I venture to advert to that question now because I know that those who feel strongly upon this matter of cruelty to animals will demur to the differentiation made between those who slaughter beasts in slaughterhouses, and those who slaughter them on farms.  I urge their protection from propagandists of this kind on the ground that practical consideration must be given some weight, in addition to the humanitarian considerations of those who have worked so hard to bring this Bill to the stage in which it now is.  I want to urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary something in connection with this Bill to which Deputy Brennan has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become the practice of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, in a very large part of the legislation which they introduce into this House, to transfer the executive functions of it to the local authorities. This is not, in any disinterested sense, a desire to have those regulations carried out by the directly elected representatives of the people, nor is it any passion for decentralisation. <Col N="469" /> On the contrary, it is a desire to cover up the expense, and withdraw all charges which may arise from the Central Exchequer and deposit them upon the ratepayer.  Were the Minister to attempt to get a great deal of this legislation centrally administered, the Minister for Finance would be rearing up in Upper Merrion Street, and refusing to provide the money.  But where he can saddle it upon the local authorities, they are confronted with the statutory duty to provide the money, and are threatened with prompt dissolution and the appointment of a commissioner if they do not provide the money, before they fully realise that the legislation has been enacted at all.  Decentralisation has its advantages, but in this case I have little doubt that decentralisation will do a great deal to render this Bill ineffective.  Substantial penalties attach to offences against this Act.  Not only that, but odium would attach to anybody convicted of an offence under it.</P>
    <P>It is infinitely more difficult for a body which is operating amongst its neighbours&mdash;a body whose members have to meet their neighbours every day &mdash;to set the law in motion, than it is for a body like the Department of Local Government and Public Health, which is of an entirely impersonal character.  I can well imagine a county council or a board of health having its attention directed to a local slaughterhouse proprietor and to practices amounting to cruelty to animals within the meaning of this Act, and finding amongst its members one or two who would point out that this was a decent man, and that it would be a terrible thing to bring him to court and dragoon him before the whole countryside as a man who would be cruel to animals, and so you might find that no action would be taken.  Palliative arguments would be advanced; people would decide that it was as well to close their eyes to what they regarded as minor abuses, and so very undesirable practices might be allowed to continue on account of the reluctance of a local authority to bring offenders to book.  It is provided here that the Civic Guards can enter any premises, and, I presume, can prosecute.  This <Col N="470" /> Bill has nothing whatever to do with the structural make up of a slaughterhouse, except in one particular, and that is that the slaughterhouse shall be so constructed that no animal will be slaughtered in the presence of another animal, so that repeated inspection of a routine character is quite unnecessary.  It will be unnecessary under this Bill, as I see it, to maintain several permanent inspectors constantly circulating, so that the staff requisite to carry out whatever supervision may be necessary under this Bill will be very small, and I imagine could be easily furnished from the personnel of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>We would then envisage a situation in which interested parties&mdash;and there are many of them in all parts of the country, who have worked in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&mdash;would familiarise themselves with the provisions of this Bill, and would be on the <i>qui vive</i> to detect any abuses that required to be brought to book.  You would have the Civic Guards readily co-operating with them in bringing the people to book if irregularities were being allowed in slaughterhouses, and you would have a responsible official in the Department of Local Government and Public Health to whom an interested party might turn if he could not get the local Civic Guards to take such action as he thought was requisite to remedy any abuse which he believed to exist. If there were a conflict between a complainant and the local Civic Guards, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary could dispatch to the particular place in question a person on whose judgment he could depend to investigate on the spot whatever complaint was made. Furthermore, there would be constant and direct touch between the responsible Minister and the police in regard to the administration of this Act. There would be readily available to any Deputy of this House, who wished to raise any question in connection with the administration of the Act, a Minister who would be responsible and who would answer for it in the House. You would remove any danger of the Act becoming inoperative as a result of reluctance on the part of a local <Col N="471" /> authority to press it home when it ought to be pressed home, and in my opinion you would guarantee a more economical and more efficient administration of the whole Act.</P>
    <P>It appears from Section 29 that the Minister has very wide powers to direct the local authority to do whatever he thinks best.  In fact this is a perfect type of mandatory legislation. You pass a Bill here without consulting the local authority, and then you order them to do this and that.  They become a passive instrument in the hands of the Minister.  I maintain that they are, in those circumstances, not only a passive but an extravagant instrument, because you have to set up a separate machine in every one of the Twenty-Six Counties to do what could be quite as well done by the Minister himself. I submit that, where it is necessary to have all the powers which the Minister stipulates for in Section 29 of this Bill, it would be much better for the Minister to do the job himself.  He should either adopt the principle of adhering strictly, in Bills of this character, to enacting nothing but enabling legislation, leaving an absolute option to the local authorities to adopt it or not to adopt it, or in Bills of this character he should reserve power in his own hands, and where he has determined that certain things must be done he should make himself responsible for doing them.</P>
    <P>I strongly object to any Bill which compels a county council to do something whether or not the county council considers it a desirable thing to do. Those who require things to be done should pay for them and if the Minister for Local Government and Public Health deems it in the national interest that certain things must be done; then let him fight the Minister for Finance for the money with which to do them. Do not let him desire the kudos and acquire the credit of compelling certain things to be done, leaving it to the local authority to pay the piper.  In this case, the business of this Bill can best be done by the Minister himself. It can most economically be done by the Minister himself.  I suggest to him that it would be better to withdraw <Col N="472" /> all reference to the local authorities in this section, and to administer this legislation in just the same way as that legislation which is taken advantage of by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is administered.  Let the Minister be certain that, having set up here the machinery of this Act, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Gárda Síochána will co-operate with him in getting it into force.  He will have far more-effective machinery than he could hope to have if he pressed the local authorities and a variety of other bodies to do the work which he ought to be doing himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this Bill which is before the House, I should like to say that I have no real objection to it.  I think it would be a good thing if anything could be done to ensure that cattle, sheep, and other animals will be slaughtered with the minimum of pain.  The matter to which I wish to refer chiefly is the slaughter of animals on the farm.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his opening statement, mentioned that he thought the slaughter of pigs would be exempt, but more than that is required.  It will also be necessary that farmers should be free to kill a sheep or a bullock for their own use as well Now and again it happens that farmers kill a few sheep or a small bullock for their own use, and I think they should have full power to do that without being interfered with by inspectors or anybody else.  I am sure that they will do their utmost to carry out the killings with as little pain to the animals as possible.  It will not be otherwise except in case of a person of a savage nature.  Any person overlooking the business, and who is not doing the business himself will see that it is humanely carried out.  I think farmers should be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I wish to deal with is that of the expense of working the Bill.  I do not think it is fair to put all the expense on the rates.  Why every class in this country should not contribute in their own small way to the working of this Bill I cannot <Col N="473" /> understand.  I should like the Minister to amend the section so that it will be a national instead of a local charge. There is quite enough on the rates already without shoving on any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need say much in concluding the debate on the Bill.  There has not been very much criticism of the Bill, and I do not think any telling points have been made against it.  Unfortunately, most of the criticism of the Bill has been based on a lack of understanding of its actual terms.  I think practically every Deputy who spoke from the Opposition Benches emphasised the injustice of having the expense of operating this Bill placed on the local rates.  If the Deputies who are anxious on this score had read Section 6, they would have realised that the expense that will be incurred in operating this Bill will be so small that it is not worth wasting the time of the House in discussing it, because the Minister has taken power in Section 6 to assign the duties of operating the Bill to the existing sanitary officers, so that there will be no new staff required.  There is quite sufficient staff already at the disposal of the sanitary authorities to operate the Bill without incurring any additional expense.</P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Holohan earlier, it is not intended to interfere with the ordinary killings on a farmstead which constitute part of the ordinary management and work of a farmer's holding.  We have specifically excluded pigs, and it is quite possible&mdash;I will have the matter looked into very carefully&mdash;that we would require specifically to exclude other animals as well as pigs.  At any rate, the Bill is not intended at all to interfere with ordinary farm operations.  What we hope to achieve as a result of the measure is the regulation of the slaughter of animals in slaughterhouses. That is an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather difficult to follow Deputy Dillon at times.  Deputies will have noticed that I was rather reluctant to put him right when he was evidently disclosing his absolute innocence of the terms of the Bill.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo;<Col N="474" /> because it might be looked upon as offensive, but had I not intervened to explain to Deputy Dillon that he evidently had not read the Bill, and to draw his attention to sub-section (3) of Section 2, the Deputy would have delivered an equally lengthy speech on the lines he proposed to take.  Unfortunately, I pointed out to Deputy Dillon that the speech he was about to make would be altogether inappropriate inasmuch as the point was already dealt with in the Bill.  He then proceeded to make another speech &mdash;evidently he was bent on making a speech on this Bill&mdash;and it was equally ill-considered and equally foolish.</P>
    <P>At one time he tells us that the Bill will cost practically nothing to operate and that one or two inspectors from the Local Government Department could set up all the necessary machinery and carry out the administration of the Bill, and at another time he complains bitterly of the hardship that will be inflicted on the ratepayers by reason of the cost of operating the Bill.  Both lines of argument cannot possibly be correct because they do not tally at all.</P>
    <P>He tells us again that the Bill will become inoperative because of the cost and because local authorities may not operate it, and then he complains of the power that the Minister has to compel a local authority to operate it. If he has any line of reasoning at all, I cannot follow it, but I presume his foolish contribution was due to the fact that he felt bound to make a speech on the Bill, as he feels bound to make a speech on every question that comes before this House, and that he is not very concerned to acquaint himself with the subject matter he proposes discussing.  He complains that we should not entrust the local authorities with the enforcement of a measure such as this.  We are entrusting the local authorities with much more important functions, and if Deputy Dillon's argument is logical and sincere and if it represents the views of the Party which, I presume, he represents when he speaks in this House, it is an argument, I think, for the abolition of local authorities altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> Why not entrust them with the duty of enforcing this Bill, if they are capable of enforcing the very important Acts which they have to enforce under existing legislation?  However, perhaps I am taking Deputy Dillon's contribution too seriously and perhaps nobody but myself takes it seriously. I would not bother replying in such detail to him except for the possibility that people outside, reading his contribution, if there are people outside who would read it, might not understand his contribution as we understand it, and might be misled if I did not reply to his points. There is no material change, except in administrative machinery, from the Bill that was passed in the Seanad. The Party opposite were represented in the Seanad and all Parties, I think, contributed to the production of the Bill that emanated from the Seanad. We have not introduced any new principles; we have improved the machinery of administration.</P>
    <P>I did anticipate&mdash;and I do not suppose that I will be very much disappointed yet&mdash;that this Bill would be received with acclamation from all Parties in the House, with, perhaps, the exception of Deputy Dillon.  Were it not for him, it probably would have been accepted without very much carping criticism and, again, I would ask that, before we reach the further stages, some of the other members of Deputy Dillon's Party who are interested in this measure, would reason with him, and if he wishes to contribute to the debate on the further stages of the Bill, plead with him to read the Bill and try to get an understanding of what is enshrined in it, and not to be wasting the time of the House in discussing matters which are not in the Bill and will not be in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote for £150,000 for the relief of unemployment and distress of which the House, I am sure, is unanimously in favour.  They certainly would show <Col N="477" /> their practical sense of their unanimity if between now and 4.30 o'clock, when the House will take up some other business, they can get through with it and let us begin spending that money; otherwise we may have to wait until possibly next week.  Early in the financial year a sum of £350,000 was voted by the Dáil for the relief of unemployment and distress.  In the Budget statement, however, it was indicated that the total provision which the Dáil would be asked to make in 1935-6 under this heading was £500,000, and the present Estimate of £150,000 is the balance then foreshadowed. The Vote takes the form of a Supplementary to the original Vote, and no distinction is drawn between the types of work undertaken out of the original Vote and those contemplated in respect of the Supplementary Vote.  After making the necessary allowance for works sanctioned but not completed before 31st March last, the sum of £220,200 is available out of the original Vote for new works, or, if the Vote now before the Dáil be granted, a sum of £370,200 will be so available.</P>
      <P>The only point I see of any special interest is that there was spent this year about £1,500 on works of archaeological exploration and investigation, the results of which have been of the highest possible scientific value.  There are none of them sensational, but they have been carried out on a strictly scientific principle and a highly organised plan, and in every single investigation practically some point of definite and specific scientific importance, linking up the pre-historic chain, has emerged.  The Dáil has every reason to be satisfied with that particular expenditure.</P>
      <P>As to peat development schemes, a sum of £42,000 has already been sanctioned for schemes in operation this year.  There was carried over a re-Vote of about £30,000 for works not completed last year, which will leave this year probably somewhere about £70,000 to be spent on works of that character.  I cannot definitely say that that is the limit.  It may be slightly more before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, as to public health and other schemes, a sum of £100,000 is allocated for public health works of which <Col N="478" /> £88,000 has been sanctioned to date for particular schemes.  The whole of that will be spent during the year. The public health works, as the House knows, are works which take a, good deal of preparation and in the re-Vote of last year something like £66,000 worth of schemes which had not been completed, which had been initiated in the previous year, were carried over. The every case there will be carried over in relation to public health schemes a considerable proportion of the total. Taking the £100,000 now allocated and the £66,000 carried over, there is somewhere about £166,000 available altogether, not as a total for public health works, but for paying the portion of the total cost of public health works which is the grant.  In other words, for every £40,000 roughly provided out of this grant, £100,000 is spent, as a total upon public health works.</P>
    <P>Following the practice that has obtained in previous years, the bulk of the expenditure out of the Relief Vote will take place during the winter months, and arrangements have been made to begin minor relief schemes and other schemes on a large scale early in November, which will secure that an increasingly large number of workmen will be given employment between now and Christmas.  The vast majority of the schemes which will be in operation this year are now in the hands of the county surveyors ready to start probably next week.</P>
    <P>In connection with the recruitment of labour, the House will remember probably that last year, owing to the inauguration of unemployment assistance and, on top of that, the distribution of free beef vouchers, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was compelled to withdraw the services which he had previously put at the disposal of unemployment schemes for the purpose of recruiting labour and we had, very unwillingly, to revert to the system which we had abandoned, and had hoped not to see again, of recruiting in the individual districts through individual agencies.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has now been able to get back to the previous system, and this <Col N="479" /> year I hope to see the whole of the employment on these schemes recruited through the labour exchanges.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, through their local employment exchanges, will resume the task of supplying to the officers in charge of relief works the names of suitable workmen; and employment will be confined, as far as possible, to workmen who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the task of recruitment; a geographical register has been instituted by the Department of Industry and Commerce from which particulars will be readily available of all suitable unemployed workmen in each area in the Saorstát.  I think that is an enormous advance on anything we have had before, and it is the sound essential basis for any mathematically fair and just distribution of unemployment relief schemes.</P>
    <P>During the last few weeks we have been engaged in certain experimental schemes in furtherance of a purpose that the whole House desires very much to see accomplished, and that is to enable men, who at the present moment are on the home assistance register, to work for that money.  These schemes have been tried in five counties and on a variety of works and, while there are certain difficulties in existing legislation which make it difficult to get what you might call a 100 per cent. result in the matter, the results up to the present are entirely successful and very promising for the development of the schemes in the future.</P>
    <P>The total allocation, as far as we envisage it at the present moment, of the £500,000, is represented by a re-Vote of £129,000 of schemes initiated last year and not completed; £100,000 for public health; and £30,000 for roads of various characters.  The Department of Agriculture gets £18,000 for land reclamation, seeds, etc., and there is about £1,500 for new marine works. The Minister for Industry and Commerce can spend about £5,000 upon investigatory work in relation to small mineral developments and, as I have said, somewhere about £46,000 have been allocated already to peat development. <Col N="480" /> Minor relief schemes, of which I think there are about 1,600 this year, represent about £116,000.  There are special experimental schemes representing about £20,000, and the rest is now held at the bottom of the sack in reserve.  If you take into account the division of the re-Vote of £129,000, it would leave gross totals available somewhat as follows: Local Government and Public Health £166,000; roads, £30,000; agriculture, for land reclamation, seeds, etc., £22,000; and for marine works, £4,500; Industry and Commerce, for mineral developments, £11,000, and for peat £77,000; minor relief schemes £132,000; and special schemes of various kinds, somewhere about £22,000, which, with the small amount in reserve, makes the total of £500,000 of money which, in the sum both of the £350,000 already passed by the Dáil and the £150,000 which the Dáil is now asked to pass, makes £500,000 as indicated in the Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, it is very deplorable that, after all the great promises we had from the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues&mdash;the great plan they were to put into operation for the cure of unemployment&mdash;we are still driven to the temporary expedient of providing money in this way in order to relieve the conditions prevailing in the country at the present time.  A very deplorable state of affairs exists in the country.  There is no denying that; and, as far as remedying the situation is concerned, we all welcome any effort that can be made, and it ought to be assisted by any person who lives in the country and who knows the conditions prevailing at the present time in this country.  In the conditions that prevail in the country, any effort that would be made ought to be assisted by every person in this country at the present time.  Now, amongst the many items enumerated by the Parliamentary Secretary, there is one about which I should like to have some information&mdash;one at least. That is, with regard to the £77,000 that is going to be spent on turf development. We were accustomed last year and the year before and, as a matter of fact, up to this year, to seeing very big advertisements all over the country <Col N="481" /> about hand-won turf&mdash;&ldquo;Burn Hand-won Turf.&rdquo;  We were accustomed to see bags, carried on railway trucks and on lorries, branded &ldquo;Hand-won Turf.&rdquo; I understand that, as far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, he is now pinning his faith to machine-made turf.  If that is so, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us, firstly, what has become of the rosy dreams they had about the hand-won turf and what will become of all the bags they have branded &ldquo;Hand-won Turf,&rdquo; and in what way is this £77,000 going to be spent so that it will be considered a relief to unemployment&mdash;if it is going to be spent for the purpose of making bogs available for machinery, and, if it is, how much of it is going to go for manual labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also told us that, as far as recruitment for the unemployment branch was concerned, it was to be through the Labour Exchanges.  Well, we have had a lot of complaints about <Col N="482" /> that before and have had a lot of complaints about the other method, but I presume that, of the two, that is the better one&mdash;at least it ought to be. That is commonsense.  But I do not at all agree that preference should be given to a person, irrespective of what his needs or the needs of his family are, merely because he is drawing unemployment assistance, or that he must get work before, say, the father of a family who has very heavy obligations.  I think that matter was brought to the notice of the House on more than one occasion.  People who are in receipt of unemployment assistance are taken on first, irrespective of their needs, or at least irrespective of their needs against people who are not on unemployment assistance.  Is not that right?  My recollection is that a man who was in receipt of unemployment assistance got first preference over any and everybody else, no matter what the conditions were.  I think that is manifestly unfair.  It may be very fair for the Government to take them off their own fund, and that is what they are doing; but it is very unfair to a father of a family, who has much heavier demands than, possibly, a young man who has no such demands made upon him, but who, because he is in receipt of unemployment assistance, will be called before the man who is the father of a family.  It is very unfair to such a man.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would endeavour to unravel that particular plan which he appeared to have in his mind a few years ago&mdash;I do not know what it was, of course&mdash;he might be able to find some work of a productive nature which he could possibly engage those men on.  After all, all these things are really non-productive, with the exception of peat itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will see, this <Col N="483" /> is a Bill to enable the Executive Council to take the measures that it is its duty to take in order to fulfil its obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations.  Deputies will remember that fourteen members of the League of Nations were of opinion that the Covenant had been violated by one of the member States, and that that State resorted to war in violation of its contracts under the Covenant.  That opinion of these fourteen members of the Council of the League of Nations was concurred in by practically all the members, as was also their statement that one of the member States had violated its Covenants.  The members resolved themselves into a Committee to consider how the obligations which fell to be discharged by each individual member, in virtue of the Covenant of the League of Nations, might best be coordinated&mdash;that is, the measures which had to be taken to carry out these obligations. That Committee is the Committee referred to in this Bill as the Co-ordination Committee.</P>
      <P>Deputies should remember that it is not the League as an organisation that is acting in this case.  The obligation is an obligation on each particular member to act, and action is being coordinated by these members meeting apart from the Assembly of the League of Nations.  That Committee appointed a sub-committee, which was called the Committee of Eighteen, to consider and prepare in advance a scheme for coordinating these measures&mdash;measures mainly of an economic and financial character.  When these proposals have been considered and adopted by the Committee of Eighteen, they are brought before the Co-ordination Committee, on which there are representatives of all the member States with the exception of the parties to the dispute. The proposals that are here in the Schedule to this Bill are proposals that were adopted by the Co-ordination Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of the Bill is simple.  The main text simply empowers the Executive Council to make Orders to give effect to these proposals that are in the Schedule.  Section 2 (2) empowers the <Col N="484" /> Executive Council to make the Orders that I have referred to.  It also gives power to make Orders that are ancillary or incidental to or necessary for the enforcement of all or any of the Orders referred to.  Section 3 empowers the Executive Council to amend or revoke these Orders.  In Section 4 there is provision for the exemption of religious or humanitarian bodies or organisations from the operation of these Orders.  In Section 5 it is declared an offence to act in contravention of the Orders, and penalties for such action are set out.  In Section 6 there is provision for the laying of the Orders that are made, with the usual conditions, on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>That is the scheme of the main body of the Bill.  With regard to the proposals in the Schedule, Deputies will notice that the first has reference to the exporting of arms and implements of war.  The second has reference to financial measures.  The third proposal has reference to the prohibition of importation of Italian goods.  The fourth proposal puts an embargo on certain exports to Italy.  The fifth and final is the organisation of mutual support, in which is set forth what are the steps that States should decide to take in mutual support in the carrying out of these obligations.</P>
    <P>It may be asked was legislation necessary in order that our obligations under the Covenant should be carried out.  As to proposal No. 1, we could probably have, by administrative action, done everything that was necessary in regard to the arms question. As to the financial measures, by co-operation with the banks we could probably have carried out in the main our obligations in that regard.  However, both because of the exception which we have made with regard to the exemption of religious bodies from the operation of these Orders, and also because certain difficulties which could not now be foreseen, might arise, it was deemed advisable to have even in their regard legislative authority.  With regard to the proposals about trade legislation, I must say that was certainly necessary.  In any case we thought that in a matter of this kind it was only right that the members of <Col N="485" /> the House should have a full opportunity of discussing this whole matter.</P>
    <P>I think that the Bill itself is self-explanatory. There has been a good deal of publicity of League activity recently, and I feel satisfied that Deputies, and most people in the country who are interested, have made themselves acquainted in the main with the dispute and with the obligations of the member States under the Covenant.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be wise at this time to talk of any misunderstandings that may have arisen in connection with our position.  If there is to be any reference to these, perhaps it would be better to deal with them at the close of the debate. Sometimes any attempt to deal with misunderstandings at the start only gives rise to further misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>The point at the moment is that when we joined the League of Nations we really entered on an international treaty.  We accepted the Covenant and undertook the obligations which are set out in the Covenant.  The moment we decide we are satisfied that a State has violated its obligations under those Articles of the Covenant which enjoin it to seek a peaceful settlement of disputes, and has resorted to war instead, then automatically we become bound to fulfil our obligations.  If we refuse to fulfil these obligations we can only be held as having violated the Covenant and our international contracts. For your representatives in Geneva, therefore, there was a very simple question to decide&mdash;whether there has been a violation of the Covenant or not, and, having agreed that there was a violation, whether the State would carry out the obligations which follow on such a decision.  We agreed that the violation had occurred and I hold that there was no choice but similarly to agree that the measures which are set out here in the Covenant should be taken, of course, in conjunction or in co-operation with the other States.  The idea of a coordinating committee was to see that the measures which each State is bound severally to adopt would be guaranteed in such a way as would make them effective.</P>
    <P>This is not, I think, a Bill in which <Col N="486" /> much can be done in Committee.  We have not in the Schedule of the Bill the complete text of the Resolutions as they were passed at the Committee. There are parts that are really directions to Governments and things of that sort.  The full texts are available in the Library, and, if Deputies desire-it, we could have the full texts supplied. I have a copy here which was. published in the League documents. We could have these full texts copied and circulated.  The omissions are, as I have said, simply those things that it would be quite inappropriate to have here in a Schedule to an Act.  For instance, here is one omission and I take it at random: &ldquo;The Governments are invited to put into operation at once such of the measures recommended as can be enforced without fresh legislation and to take all practicable steps to secure that the measures recommended are completely put into operation by October 31st, 1935....&rdquo; It is quite clear that paragraphs of that sort do not refer to the measures which would be covered by any order which the Executive Council would be called upon to make.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to recommend this Bill to the Dáil.  I think every Member here will find himself in exactly the same position as your representative&mdash;as I&mdash;found himself in Geneva, that there was a clear case both as regards having resort to war without acting in accordance with the provisions set out in Article 12 and other Articles of the Covenant, and that it was clearly set out in Article 16 what we should do in such a case.  I am perfectly certain that every Deputy who approaches the matter in that way can only come to the one opinion, and I expect, accordingly, that Deputies on all sides of the House will vote for this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can assume that in over 30 Parliaments, all independent States who are co-operating in the work of the League of Nations, Bills analogous to that submitted to us to-day have been introduced.  I venture to state that in none of those Parliaments has so inadequate an introduction been given to a measure so <Col N="487" /> important as that which has been brought before us by the Minister for External Affairs.  We are all aware, painfully aware, of the passion the President has for having the last word. But I think he might have overcome that passion to-day and, greatly daring, spoken his mind before Deputies were called upon to deal with the issues that arise on this Bill.  He has not seen fit to do that and so it devolved upon us to state briefly our attitude towards the measure which has been brought before us.  That we cannot do without referring to the circumstances under which we entered into the commitments which make this Bill necessary.</P>
      <P>We desire to say quite explicitly that we emphatically endorse the attitude adopted by President de Valera at the League of Nations in connection with the dispute at present existing between the League and Italy.  We entered the League of Nations as a free and sovereign nation some years ago. Deputy Cosgrave, at that time being President of the Executive Council, marked the solemnity of the occasion by attending in person to represent the Government of this country and on our behalf, and with the full authority of Parliament, he accepted responsibility for all the Covenants of the League.  President de Valera, when faced with the duty of undertaking the obligations those Covenants placed upon us, did so and, if I may use a personal word, he did so in terms which to me seemed both eloquent and peculiarly appropriate to the occasion with which he was called upon to deal. It is a source of gratification, I should think, to every section of our community that, before the world, covenants solemnly entered into by an Irish Government have been so fully accepted and implemented by their successors in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that the Minister for External Affairs, in his very inadequate introductory observations, did take occasion to throw emphasis upon the fact that the action we are taking here to-day arises not directly from the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but from the knowledge that one member of the League of Nations <Col N="488" /> has failed in its obligations, freely entered into with the other members of the League of Nations.  This House is not called upon, and has not been called upon at any time to examine the merits of any international dispute. We are concerned with the action our President has taken in view of the fact that one member of the League of Nations has reneged upon its undertaking and broken solemn engagements that bound it to its fellow-members of the League.  I think, however, that this occasion should not be allowed to pass&mdash;and in this I am in a position to speak for my colleagues&mdash;without directing the attention of the President to the somewhat anomalous situation in which he has put himself and this country at large.  He spoke eloquently at Geneva and rebuked the Government of Italy for resorting to war as a means of resolving an international dispute.  He found himself associated in that rebuke with Captain the Right Hon. Anthony Eden, Minister to the League of Nations in Great Britain and with Ministers of other States attending that meeting.  If Bolivia and Paraguay, when they were engaged in slaughtering one another in the swamp of Gran-Chaco dispatched their generalissimos to Geneva to read a homily to Signor Mussolini because of his action in an international dispute on this occasion, I suggest that the whole world would rock with laughter and that these gentlemen would have to retire back to their swamps to carry on their war amidst the derisive laughter of every man in the country. Does it not occur to the President of the Executive Council, and to the Minister for the League of Nations affairs, that they present a rather ridiculous appearance for the reason that while rebuking Signor Mussolini for having resorted to a war, they have themselves resorted to war in an international dispute and that it is common knowledge that these two gentlemen have been tearing one another asunder in the face of the world for the past three years?</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a single moment that either of these gentlemen could be deflected from his clear duty to the Covenant owing to that initial state <Col N="489" /> of affairs.  But I do suggest to the House that in addition to their sanctions, if our nations presented an improved position to the several nations, to assist them in their efforts to restore peace, the League of Nations as a body would then have perhaps in its armour the most effective sanction of all and that is the moral force of the world.  Surely it is true to say that if that moral force is to operate to the best advantage, it must not be open to the guilty party in any dispute to say to those who would restrain him: &ldquo;Take first the beam from thine own eye before thou observest the mote in mine.&rdquo;  So I turn to the President and suggest that at this critical time when we are making a material and valuable contribution to the peace of the world by our co-operation in the work of helping the cause of peace in Europe and Africa, we have an additional reason to those already patent reasons that exist, for settling the financial dispute that exists between ourselves and Great Britain.  Reason enough we have for that in the great suffering that the dispute has brought upon our own people, but there is now the additional advantage in making peace so that weight may be lent to the eloquent words of the Minister for External Affairs at Geneva; and, if he has to return there, if he is called upon to do so, in the immediate future, he will be in a position to say that we not only preach negotiations in preference to war but we practise what we preach as well.  He will be able to show that we faced the situation between ourselves and our near neighbour, aggravated as it has been by bitter considerations, and a variety of difficulties arising out of the past, and that we have boldly grasped the nettle and have overcome our difficulties and suspended a war that was bringing nothing but disaster, just as this war will bring disaster not only to those engaged in it but to those all round them.  Can we not think that whatever weight attached to the President's words&mdash;and I have no doubt considerable weight attached his words when he spoke at Geneva&mdash;greater weight would attach to them now if he was in a position to speak as one who could give an object lesson to the world as <Col N="490" /> to how to settle difficult problems and as one who had discovered the very model such as he could recommend to the League of Nations at the present time.  The President has found in this matter, and in other matters vital to the interests of this country, a ready response to his appeal from this side of the House for constructive policy. Is it necessary for me to repeat that if he desires to strengthen his own hand and this country not only economically and morally, but in any representations that he may feel called upon to make by any action that he may be required to take, he will find that we on this side have the same ready desire to co-operate in order that he may be able to return to Geneva, a model for other statesmen to follow and, fortified by the knowledge that this country is recuperating from such a war as is now disturbing another part of the world?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to intervene at any length, but I cannot refrain from rising to congratulate the President and the Government warmly upon the stand they have taken in connection with our obligations under the Covenant.  No doubt it was the only thing they could do, in decency or in honesty; yet I can see, and frankly admit, that from the narrow Party point of view there might be a temptation to take a different course. There might be a temptation to take a stand like that which has been taken by Father Coughlin in the United States of America, and by some of the Irish community there, namely, that the imposition of sanctions in connection with this Italo-Abyssinian war was a monstrous and wrongful deed for which Great Britain alone was responsible.  The President might have sought to give effect to the old doctrine which has been so often preached in this country, that Great Britain's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity.  Fortunately, he realised that the present difficulty is not Great Britain's difficulty; that it is the difficulty of civilisation; and that he was called upon to take a wide and statesmanlike view of the situation which presented itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with much interest to the <Col N="491" /> remarks of Deputy Dillon, in which he pledged to the Government the emphatic support of the Opposition on this measure.  I cannot help feeling that there has been a certain change in the weather.  Some of the Mediterranean sunshine has been brought back by Deputy Dillon, and the equinoctial gales of a few weeks ago have given way to the mild breezes of an Indian summer.  Who would have thought, listening to that emphatic endorsement of the Government's attitude, that a month ago the Opposition leaders were after the President like a pack of wolves; that he was accused of pledging support to Great Britain; that he was warned against blindly and futilely following the lead of Great Britain; that the Irish people were told he was threatening them with conscription in the interests of Great Britain; that he was chided for lunching with Mr. Eden; or that he was warned that it was not his place to meddle in foreign affairs at all?</P>
    <P>When I listen to what is being said to-day, and compare it with what was said a month ago, I am reminded of a story about Cicero, well known to most schoolboys who have had anything in the nature of a classical education.  There is a speech of Cicero's&mdash;I think it is the <i>Pro Milone</i>&mdash;which has been handed down to posterity, and which is one of the most eloquent speeches Cicero ever composed.  Unfortunately, it was never in fact delivered.  The reason it was not delivered was because the powers that be were specially inflamed against Cicero's client; soldiery were brought into the Court and the Court was overawed.  Cicero, who was a man of not very great physical courage, was also overawed, and he found himself unable to deliver the speech. Accordingly, his client was duly convicted and sent into exile.  But determined that the speech should not be entirely wasted, as it had been carefully composed and written out, he sent a copy of it to his client. The client in question was in exile, I think, at Baiae, where there were excellent oysters.  He wrote to Cicero thanking him very much for sending him the speech, and saying that, on <Col N="492" /> the whole, he was rather glad it had never been delivered, because had it been delivered he would have been acquitted and would not then be enjoying the excellent oysters of Baiae.  So, too, if the utterances now delivered from the Opposition Front Bench with regard to the policy of the Government in this matter had been delivered a month ago I should not be tasting the joys of independence at the present time.</P>
    <P>However, I will say that their hand has been mended about as skilfully as it could be mended, and that there is a certain amount in the contention of Deputy Dillon that in these times of national co-operation in the cause of peace it would be very pleasant to see a settlement of our economic dispute with Great Britain.  Of course it would be very pleasant to see a settlement of that dispute at any time, but I do honestly feel, even now in spite of Deputy Dillon's contention, that for the President to have hurriedly arrived at such an agreement at the moment when we were called upon to make an announcement with regard to our attitude on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute would not have increased our moral authority in the councils of the nations.  I think there would have been considerable suspicion that our support had been purchased.  No such suspicion can exist as it is, and while I pray always for a settlement of our Anglo-Irish economic dispute I cannot feel that it is a matter for great regret that such a settlement was not in some way linked up with the attitude which we have been taking at Geneva with regard to Abyssinia.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the weight which we have carried at Geneva, or the weight Great Britain has carried at Geneva, has not in fact been in any way imperilled by the existence of this economic dispute between us, an economic dispute to which foreign nations have paid very little attention. I do not think that a single word about the matter was uttered by anyone at Geneva by way of reproach either of ourselves or of Great Britain when the President or Sir Samuel Hoare or Mr. Anthony Eden was speechifying on the subject of obligations <Col N="493" /> under the Covenant.  I feel, therefore, that the point which has been made, while superficially attractive, is really and fundamentally a pretty bad point, even now when the hand has been mended.  I think that, on the whole, the note which should be struck by all Parties in the country on this matter should be one of undiluted support and congratulation of the Government for the line they have taken.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon said, it is true that we are not called upon to inquire with great particularity into the merits of the dispute between Abyssinia and Italy.  The Italians are people for whom we in this country have a very special affection and sympathy. Nobody in this country has more affection and sympathy for Italy than I have myself, but we were presented with a case of an absolutely plain breach of the Covenant.  There has been no attempt to conceal or disguise the fact that there was a plain breach of the Covenant, and the only question which was open to us to consider was &ldquo;Are we a Member of the League of Nations or not?&rdquo; If we were, we could only act in one way. If we had started bargaining, there was no reason why 50 other nations should not have started bargaining about special problems peculiar to them.</P>

      <P>One or two may have, but they gained absolutely nothing by doing it, and they lost a good deal of prestige by doing it.  I am by no means sorry that we did not follow in their footsteps.  Manifestly, the work of the League of Nations would become impossible if, every time a matter of general interest were to be decided upon, each nation began to think up whether it could not get a bit for itself out of the situation.  I do not think there can be a shadow of regret in our minds that that was not done in our case.  The President has said that we might, of course, have withdrawn from the League of Nations long ago.  But we did not.  We might withdraw from the League of Nations <Col N="494" /> in future, possibly, but, so long as we are in the League of Nations, we have got to carry out our plain duty.  When Deputy Cosgrave made the speech at Geneva to which Deputy Dillon has referred, he quoted, I think, the motto on the tomb of Saint Columbanus: <i>Si tollis libertatem, tollis dignitatem</i>&mdash;if you take away a man's or a nation's liberty you take away dignity also.  But, as a matter of fact, you can lose your dignity much more thoroughly by your own actions than you can by somebody else taking away your liberty, and that is a consideration that ought not to be forgotten in judging of what is the proper line at any time for a Government of ours to take at Geneva.</P>
      <P>We have a very special interest in the success of the League.  Every small and relatively weak nation has a greater interest than a strong or powerful nation in the success of the League.  I am far from considering that the League has won its battle yet.  It has not; the position of the League is still terribly precarious.  I doubt whether these sanctions which are being imposed in connection with the Italian-Abyssinian war will have any great effect, but even if they do not achieve very much with regard to this particular dispute, it is perfectly plain that if the League had done nothing at all and had not taken the steps it has taken, it would be down and out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My feeling is that if penalties are certain to be inflicted they need not be very heavy.  I think that if Italy, for example, had known for certain a year ago that the result of her making war on Abyssinia would be that an embargo would be imposed upon exports from Italy to all the members of the League, she would never have gone to war with Abyssinia.  In America terrific penalties are being constantly decreed by State Legislatures in the effort to stop crime, and they do not succeed because it is not the size of a penalty that stops crime.  It is the knowledge of the potential criminal that whatever the penalty is, it is almost certain to be enforced; that public opinion is against him; that the machinery of the law is good; and that he will be caught and punished.  That is what <Col N="495" /> really prevents crime; and what really will prevent acts of unprovoked aggression amongst the nations of the world will be when they feel that they cannot escape the consequences of such aggression, and that penalties, even though economic penalties, and even relatively mild economic penalties, will, as a matter of certainty, be imposed upon them.  I think, therefore, that as the procedure of the League grows clearer, as the methods by which the League will endeavour to enforce peace become more certain and better known, the probability is that the League will gain strength and that the principle of collective security will win through in the end.</P>
    <P>As I have said, all weak nations have a special interest in that principle, but we perhaps more than others, because here we are, away on the outer edge of Europe, next to an enormously powerful neighbour, and so placed with regard to that neighbour that we seem to be destined by nature always either to be a help to each other or a torment to each other.  If the philosophy and propaganda that are at present popular in this country with regard to Great Britain continue to be popular, it is obvious that we have the greatest need of some sort of shield and protection against the anger that may some day be aroused against us among this nation, which is so much richer, so much more populous, and so much more powerful than ours.  If we go out of the British Commonwealth and throw away the security that is implied in that membership, a security that is endorsed and guaranteed by Australia, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand, we have to find some sort of substitute, and what substitute is there, or can there be, except the League of Nations?</P>
    <P>Need I say that I, personally, hope that we will not throw away the other and stronger safeguard?  But, at any rate, if we are brought into the position of doing so, it is something to know that there is the League of Nations in reserve and that we may hope that some sort of law and justice will prevail, as against merely the rule <Col N="496" /> of violence and the morals of the jungle.</P>

      <P>The speaker who has just sat down has made in allusion to heavy weather, but it is not so much that Deputy Dillon has brought back to these benches any decoction of Mediterranean sun, but more that a deep depression has moved somewhat to the East.  I do not fully understand the Deputy's allusion to the speech of Cicero, except possibly as awakening in his mind the reflection that sometimes it is good to write and not to publish.  If the Deputy had reversed the Ciceronian tradition which he has brought forward to the House, he could remember that there are still good oysters at Baiae or. at least, as far away as Baiae is.  I do not know further if he thinks that the storms that were aroused here were real storms or whether it was not so much a matter of his imagining himself like one of the old classical deities, governing the winds, and finding, in fact, that he could not unloose the storm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed, with Deputy Dillon, at the inadequate introduction made by the President to this measure here to-night.  After all, it is a big step not merely that we are taking as a nation. but that the nations of the world are helping us to take in this whole matter.  I should have thought that as in the ancient long ago, when families fought, and tribes fought, and clans fought, and when somewhere there emerged a spark of reason that led the people to believe that if they appointed men of wisdom and submitted to the decision of those men of wisdom, that was a step in advance, and I cannot imagine the leader of one of those fighting clans coming to his people and marking the change from <Col N="497" /> the old set of things to the new by such a statement as the President has made here to-night.  Because if this thing succeeds&mdash;and it is doubtful if it will succeed immediately&mdash;there is a very big change in the world, a change which, I think, might have been recognised by some fitting words from the Leader of this country, speaking in his own House, and a change which means that nations, like the families and the clans of long ago, have seen that even the victor in a fight is sometimes too weak to gain the full benefit of what he set out for, and that there is coming a better appreciation of arbitration and conciliation as a means of ending quarrels.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that the President might have said something more than this&mdash;and I waited to hear his reason for the introduction of this Bill, and we got it in the meagre phrase: &ldquo;There was a simple issue, and the choice of the Irish Free State delegation was a simple one, as is the choice of Members here to-night.&rdquo;  Does anybody feel that in what the President said here to-night he knows what the effect was, and can form a judgment as to whether it was easy or difficult?</P>
    <P>Is there anyone here with information to tell us whether, in fact, this move if successful in this present issue is likely to be of lasting good for the world, and would the President not think it quite right to emphasise that ithe issue is not an issue, as commonly understood outside, between Ethiopia and Italy but between Italy and the world in so far as the world is represented at the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>I do not throw in this for the purpose of saying that our decision was wrong.  At any rate, we might have some allusion to the fact that there is a body of opinion which thinks that if the Fascist State is stopped, and stopped severely in its present course, the Fascist State may suffer and the suffering of that State may not be confined to the borders of that country. The world may find that the issue is not so simple, although if the only standard is what was the right thing to do when Italy chose to challenge the rest of the world and if that is <Col N="498" /> the only standard, then there is a simple decision to be taken.  You cannot stop short of this.  The President might have told us also if the members in taking the choice that they did at Geneva had any appreciation of the fact that economic pressure might not be sufficient, and had they then formed a decision that if economic sanctions failed other sanctions would be applied, and whether this country would as enthusiastically support the application of the rest as they appear to be enthusiastic in taking this the first step?  These, at any rate, are some of the things that might have been glanced at.</P>
    <P>The President in his speech, that has been praised and deservedly praised, at Geneva, said that the alternative presented to him was a saddening one. He asked if we were &ldquo;to be thrown into a position of enmity with those with whom we wish to be on terms of friendship&rdquo; and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;what more heartrending alternative can there be to the abandonment of duty and the betrayal of our deepest convictions and of words solemnly given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome those phrases: &ldquo;our deepest convictions and of words solemnly given.&rdquo;  Deputy Cosgrave was the first to record the conviction for governing authority in this country in regard to such matters and members of his Government later followed in the same line and recorded their convictions and gave solemnly their words in certain respects.  Did the President regard this as a solemn assurance then?  Did he believe that that expressed the deep conviction held, or one that should be held, by the people of this country?  It is at any rate worth remarking here that it is some advance to have the President given to the use of those phrases and that he has not against him the vulgar abuse of his own Minister for Finance when he does use them.  I do not say that the President should not have paraded the fact at Geneva that he went there as our representative, but certainly there was no appreciation in the President up to this year of the fact that we had freely taken our place amongst the nations assembled separately at <Col N="499" /> Geneva.  It is always an advance, and it is worth recording the advance, to have these things said.  These are our convictions, and what we are now backing by economic sanctions are the words that we solemnly gave.  In so far as the President is following up those convictions with this measure, showing that the solemn words so given were not merely paying lip service to the ideals of the League but that they did mean something, then this Bill, for what it amounts to, is valuable.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of misapprehension, apparently, as to the common practice at Geneva.  It appears to be thought that when an issue like this comes before the League of Nations at Geneva nothing else may be spoken of, or, if spoken of, that it is bargaining.  If, what is suggested as possible of happening at Geneva is bargaining, there never yet was an issue before the League of Nations that was not accompanied by bargaining; bargaining through the corridors, bargaining by day and bargaining by night, and, generally, decisions were taken by people who had secured some fruit in their bargaining. Sometimes the bargaining was as crude as saying &ldquo;grant me this and I will do something else.&rdquo;  And sometimes it was more subtle: &ldquo;If you will only give something to a third party we can win that third party's support.&rdquo; But, apart from these things that might really be called bargaining there is certainly this at Geneva that it is there not merely for the purpose of having processions to the tribune and declarations from it and meetings in council.  There is frequent opportunity for gatherings of an intimate type as the President has found and as the President has enjoyed.  I must say that it is again an advance that the President, without drawing upon himself the abuse of his own Minister for Finance, can meet a Minister of Mr. Anthony Eden's standing and have discussions with him.  Had I done it, if there was sufficient imagination to prompt the jibe, there would be the tale of my being led up the garden of Anthony Eden, and such remarks.</P>
    <P>We do not make any such complaint <Col N="500" /> against the President.  We welcome the fact, but we do complain of this that there were no results of that meeting. We do not say that the results of that meeting could have been attained by any process of bargaining, crude or subtle, but it is proper to say, as Deputy Dillon has said, that surely it was a ludicrous spectacle to have the President and Mr. Eden declaiming about Italy's contest at the League and giving, as an example of what they were saying, some of the matters that Italy was doing on Ethiopia.  Deputy Dillon took one example.  Suppose that Japan had hurriedly left off her further occupation of Manchukuo and sought again the chance to get her voice heard at the League in order to approve of the imposition of sanctions against Italy, would there not certainly have been a burst of laughter and would not the League have been brought into greater scorn and ridicule than even the failure to operate against Italy might have put upon it? Because this country and England are not operating with soldiers, ships or aircraft, and because there has been in operation for three years a more deadly contest, as far as its weakening capacity is concerned, we can appear there and can take our simple choice. We can believe in our sincere convictions and in the words solemnly given.  We do not think that there is even an appearance of ridicule in doing all that while we persist in our quarrel and allow others to persist in that quarrel with us&mdash;the quarrel between ourselves and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The greatest good that would flow from the situation with Italy would be not a break-up of Italy, following the rigid and ruthless application of these and other measures, but that Italy should be stayed in her course because of the realisation that not merely world opinion was against her, but world opinion backed by the application of certain concrete measures. That would be the value of the position.  Geneva has the limelight on it, and people, in their peccadilloes and in their virtues, are shown up with great clarity there.  Yet our President appears to think he can parade there as an upholder of all these fine principles and submerge the whole question <Col N="501" /> of the situation between this country and England.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to allude.  I find it difficult to understand just how, with any sense of proportion, people can carry on at Geneva as the representatives of all the nations have done this autumn. Here are the nations agreeing that they will not allow the victimisation of a particular country.  They set about examining the merits of that contest, and in the end they come to a decision with regard to aggression.  They take the first step towards prohibiting any such aggression.  Speeches are made&mdash; all adverting to this matter.  There is a recognition by the Foreign Minister for Britain that there may possibly be a source of conflict in the world arising from the fact that certain nations grip the raw materials of production. He indicates a view, and promotes a discussion, as to how far nations which have unused resources of that type should be made &ldquo;free leaves&rdquo; for the benefit of the whole of the world.  He is joined in that by other nations.</P>
    <P>The only pressure against Italy thought of at the moment is economic pressure.  During the course of the discussions at Geneva proposals are made&mdash;all in that atmosphere that possibly the cause of conflict in the world may be the depressed state of the common people of the world and a recognition that that depressed state may be due to the fact that nations are beginning to live in isolation, that nations are keeping raw materials, one from another, and that nations are keeping finished products, one from another.  A suggestion is mooted by the representative of the British Board of Trade tending towards the breaking down of all this fierce economic nationalism which is so much the habit at the moment.  Before that Conference breaks up, there is a message from the United States welcoming this suggestion, approving freer international trade and definitely struck with the humanity at the bottom of the suggestion. They recognise that their own country is no better off now under rigid nationalism and isolation than it was when trade was free.  All the representatives of the nations can meet <Col N="502" /> and agree that, in an issue between the League and any one country, you have got to operate economics, but they seem to forget that, when they are at apparent peace with one another, they are more fiercely operating economics against one another.  How can there be any sense of reality in a discussion regarding the imposition of economic pressure in a more ruthless manner on a defaulter when every nation prides itself on operating economic pressure against every other nation because it believes it is for its own good?  When it is a question of preventing Italy from being the aggressor in a particular conflict, we are going to put her in the happy state of being the most perfectly isolated country in the world. At all events, it was stated that conflicts are due to evils arising from deprivation of raw materials held by certain peoples.  But there was more than that said.  There was a definite approach to the greater problem&mdash;the problem of breaking down this fierceness and this isolation and economic nationalism.  Our country is now promoting this measure to apply to Italy. in a more aggressive and more ruthless way, something which, apparently, our Government would regard as the height of perfection if it could be brought about or achieved here at home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision taken on this matter.  I think it is a sound decision. I have read what I could of the matter and I realise that there is a body of opinion which fears disaster from the application of this measure&mdash;particularly if it leads to the application of further measures.  I know that even people who fear that disaster think it is well to sacrifice even the security of peace and the security of Europe in that quarter rather than have the League challenged and fail to meet.  the challenge.  I think that the President might tell us whether he has any considered view on that question.  The President must tell us whether this is the final Bill of this type&mdash;obligations of membership type&mdash;or whether, having taken the first step, we have counted the cost and are determined, no matter what it may mean, that our obligations under that Covenant are going to be carried out and fulfilled. I should like to know whether we are <Col N="503" /> going to pursue that course so long as a substantial number of important nations pursue it, or whether there are any special considerations attaching to this country which would make us weaken our resolve and drop out earlier.  So far as it goes, this is a good measure.  So far as the President approved of the principles of the Covenant, the words were good.  So far as the President attended the League and said he attended there as our representative freely&mdash;he can give us his own words; I am merely giving the meaning&mdash;it is well to have that statement from him.  It is a pity the President would not apply to other disputes the standard he himself laid down when speaking at the Tribunal this year.  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;cannot the Peace Conference which will meet in Europe when the next conflict has decimated the nations and disaster and exhaustion have tamed some of them into temporary submission&mdash;why cannot this Conference be convened now?&rdquo; Why cannot that Conference be convened now?  Must we believe that there is never to be a conference to end the economic war between this country and England?  We believe it must take place some time. Would it not be better to have it now than later, when exhaustion will supervene?</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech Deputy McGilligan said that he welcomed this measure.  If that statement by the Deputy is intended to be a real declaration of his feelings in connection with the Bill, then I think he was rather unfortunate in the choice of his language in support of this measure, because during the whole course of his speech it was clear to everybody who was listening to him that the Deputy was walking the tightrope all the time.  The language used by the Deputy in support of this Bill was the language of equivocation.  He says that he supports the Bill now, but it was quite clear from the speech, and the attempt to drag the economic war into this matter, that the Deputy was only coerced into support of it because of the pressure of public opinion in this country and without this country. <Col N="504" /> As Deputy MacDermot asked, is it not a pity there was not an earlier declaration in favour of this measure and in favour of sanctions on behalf of small nations?  Is it not a pity, before Deputy MacDermot was compelled to resign from that Party, that it made up its mind as to where it stood in this dispute?  Is it not a pity the Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenneys and other Deputies in that Party who have been allowed to run loose around the country denouncing any interference by this country in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, had not their cards marked long before to-day, and not be subjected to the ridicule that must now be inevitable in view of the support Deputy McGilligan has given this measure? Until to-day all the spokesmen of the Party opposite have been advocating a policy of non-interference in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in many of his utterances in Mayo, has been pleading that we should have nothing whatever to do with the dispute, that we should frankly ignore our responsibilities at Geneva.  Deputy MacDermot felt that that Party was so irrevocably committed to the line of non-interference in this dispute that he felt bound to resign from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But to-day there is a change of front. The Party managers have now discovered that it is not a popular policy in the country to advocate the breaking of our word in Geneva, and in not performing our obvious duty.  Thus, in the two mawkish speeches delivered by Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan, they endeavoured to indicate that they are now in favour of sanctions. We ought to be told what induced them to take this line to-day, in view of the line which they and other speakers have been taking through the country for the past month.  I see this matter very much in the same light as Deputy MacDermot.  I see this is a simple issue, as to whether as a member of the League of Nations we are going to discharge our responsibility to the League, or whether in this testing time we are not prepared to discharge the obvious responsibility which rests upon us.  Membership of the League was thought by the Party opposite to confer benefits upon this nation.  I <Col N="505" /> frankly consider that the League does confer benefit, particularly on small nations.  But if it confers benefits with one hand, it also confers responsibilities, and if we want to obtain such benefits as we can from the League, we ought not to be hesitant in the discharge of our obvious responsibilities on the issues that we were called upon to decide in this dispute; whether we were going to insist that a breach of the Covenant of the League should be punished in the manner provided in the Covenant.  That was the simple issue involved in this dispute.  We could possibly have abandoned the Covenant; or we could possibly have decided to discharge our responsibilities at Geneva or we could possibly have decided that we would take no part whatever in compelling respect for the Covenant or the freely assumed responsibility for the Covenant.</P>
    <P>I am one of those people who believe in the League of Nations.  I believe it is an instrument of powerful good for humanity.  I am one of those who wants to see the League strengthened in every possible way, believing that a strengthened League is a guarantee of world peace, human liberty and human progress.  Anything that tends to weaken the League tends to endanger world peace, and tends to produce the same set of circumstances that produced the horrible catastrophe of the years 1914-18.  No one wants to see that catastrophe multiplied as it must be by new devices for making war. Everybody who wants to avoid a repetition of those dreadful years must be prepared to do everything in their power to strengthen the effectiveness of the League in every way that lies at their command.  The League suffered seriously through its failure to grapple effectively with the serious Sino-Japanese dispute.  Not only was its moral authority weakened in this matter, but its material authority as an instrument of peace was seriously undermined.  If the League were to allow defaulting nations to continue to take the road which Japan took on that occasion, and if it were to continue to have its moral and material authority flouted in that manner, then the League as an instrument of world <Col N="506" /> peace must cease to have any effect in a troublous world.</P>
    <P>It was because I felt that the League authority was being undermined, and its prestige being seriously diminished, that I welcome the stand which the League took in this dispute between Abyssinia and Italy.  Having decided that, we must range ourselves either on the side of those who want to flout the Covenant of the League or those who want to maintain the Covenant.  If we accept the responsibility which flows from a desire to maintain it, obviously we must make up our minds where we stand in this dispute.  We could have disregarded the Covenant, we could have dishonoured our word, and dishonoured our bond.  If we had done that, then the condemnation of the liberty-loving people of the world would have rightly been ours.  To have taken that stand at Geneva would have made our name a by-word among the nations of the world, and if the President had by any unfortunate set of circumstances been any way equivocal in his support of Abyssinia and the Covenant in this dispute, I think he would have rightly merited the condemnation of the liberty-loving people of this country.  We have, however, chosen to honour our bond and discharge our obvious duties.</P>
    <P>In taking that stand at Geneva, the President may feel assured that he has in this country the whole-hearted support of all the people except those so blinded by political malice that they will not see good even when it is staring them in the face.  An attempt has been made to suggest that the President should have used Geneva as an occasion for driving a bargain with Britain.  Speakers of the Fine Gael Party have suggested that the question as to whether he should keep his word, the nation's word and the nation's bond, in Geneva should be related to the question of whether we got a settlement of the economic war or not.  If the President had adopted that course at Geneva and made his support of sanctions conditional upon a settlement of the economic war, then I think the President would have been guilty of international bad manners.  I think the President has rightly saved himself <Col N="507" /> and the nation from having that stigma put on him and the nation in the dispute in which the world has now made its voice clear in no uncertain manner. The Opposition Party have suggested that the President is now pro-British, because at Geneva his voice happened to be on the same side as that of Britain.  All the long distance Opposition speakers have been let loose to screech throughout the country that the President has sold the nation and is now pro-British.  It would have been just as true to say that he is pro-Russian.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, but the Deputy who interrupted did not.  It would have been as true to suggest that the President was pro-Russian as to suggest that he was pro-British.  It would have been just as true to say that he was pro-Sweden, pro-Norway, pro-Denmark, pro-Belgium, pro-France or pro any of the other countries, who at Geneva expressed the same point of view as this country and Great Britain.  All this effort of trying to suggest that there has been any newfound alliance between the President and the British delegation at Geneva is just an attempt to use a serious international crisis as an opportunity for making mean, dirty, Party, political propaganda out of the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have sought to suggest that it is rather strange that nations which have been distinguished for their imperial policy up to now, are at last endeavouring to seek peace by conciliation, and that they now want to abandon all resort to war.  I agree that it is rather ironic to see some of the big imperial nations that we have, now striving to secure peace through the instrumentality of the League of Nations but that development is not an unhealthy development.  It is not an unhelpful development, and one would wish that that course of development <Col N="508" /> had come much sooner.  One can only hope that, those formerly imperially-minded nations will continue to look for peace and international adjustment through the instrumentality of the League of Nations.  There are some who suggest that we should not be on the side of some of these big imperial Powers, unless there is to be a readjustment of the world, unless there is to be a surrender of the ill-gotten gains of the past, but I suggest to those people that Abyssinian liberty and the cause of world peace cannot wait until such time as the world is rearranged.  A settlement of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute will, I think, help to bring about that set of circumstances in which it might be possible to rearrange the geographic groupings of countries without resort to the arbitrament of war.</P>
    <P>The whole policy which Italy has pursued in this matter has been frankly an annexationist policy.  Italy has said definitely that she must have some portion of the world for her expanding millions at home, and with no more moral authority than that she wants more freedom for her people she proceeds to take military measures to annex another independent country with just as much claim to freedom and just as much claim to liberty as Italy herself can urge.  Are we to allow Abyssinia to be annexed until such time as the map of the world is rearranged? Are we to allow our voice to be silent in this dispute until such time as we can get a settlement of the economic war?  Suppose those who believe that a bargain should have been made at Geneva before we committed ourselves to sanctions had their way, what would their attitude have been in the event of failure to get a settlement of the economic dispute between Great Britain and this country?</P>
    <P>Is it suggested by the Party opposite that if we could not get a settlement of the economic war between Great Britain and this country we should refuse to be bound by our word and our bond at Geneva?  If we had raised the question of the settlement of the economic war, and if we could not have got a settlement by negotiation <Col N="509" /> at Geneva, is it suggested that we should then have told the League of Nations that although we freely accepted certain responsibilities, we were not going to discharge these responsibilities, that we were going to ignore our word, tear up our bond and decline to range ourselves on the side of peace and on the side of right in the dispute that has arisen between Abyssinia and Italy?  If the President had taken that line at Geneva, he would have deserved the condemnation of everybody in this country who believes that obligations freely accepted by this country at Geneva should be honoured to the fullest and that by honouring our bond in that respect at Geneva this country could make its contribution to the cause of world peace and the cause of international amity.</P>
    <P>I believe that a strengthened League of Nations is the only hope of world peace in existing circumstances.  I believe, too, that the effort to strengthen the League of Nations is the most effective guarantee of the independence and the liberty of small nations of the world.  It is Abyssinia's turn to be selected by Italy for annexation to-day; it may be our turn to-morrow to be singled out by some other Power for annexation.  Then we may well be glad that the League will discharge its responsibilities with the same unanimity as it has rightly decided in the case of the present dispute.</P>
    <P>The President's stand at Geneva, in my opinion, was a substantial contribution to the cause of world peace.  I think his stand there has rightly merited the praise of all who want us to discharge to the fullest our obligations to the League, to the nations, and to humanity at large.  I believe, too, that the President's stand at Geneva, free as it was from all that miserable bargaining suggested by the Party opposite, has enabled us to take our full place with the other nations of the world at Geneva.  I believe his stand there has enhanced the prestige and reputation of this nation.  I believe that not only has it done that but that it has strengthened the League of Nations in addition.  By strengthening the League of Nations, I think it has <Col N="510" /> strengthened the instrument which is probably the most effective instrument at our disposal to-day for guaranteeing the continuance of such a measure of liberty as we have and prevent our country from being invaded as Abyssinia has been invaded to-day by a foreign Power.  We cannot, probably, play as big a part in showing Italy the error of her ways as other nations in Europe can.  That, however, is not our fault. We can at least, by our action in passing this Bill, demonstrate that, so far as we can contribute materially, we are prepared to do so and that, so far as we are morally concerned, we are still the liberty-loving people we are recognised to be at Geneva.  I think also that we have, by the President's stand there, enhanced our reputation as a nation and, as I said before, contributed to making still more effective the one effective instrument for guaranteeing the freedom of this country from foreign invasion in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been rather surprised at the speeches delivered on this Bill, and at all the praise showered upon it.  The President told us that forty or fifty nations met in Geneva and decided on a certain line of action. I presume that these are all representatives of free nations that decided on this course of action.  Then he told us about the machinery set up, and that finally they decided on sanctions.  It has been deprecated by Deputy MacDermot and also by Deputy Norton, on behalf of the Labour Party, that we should, before associating ourselves with the support of sanctions in this country, have mentioned our trouble with Great Britain, euphemistically styled the economic war.  Are we not here to-day to commit this country to sanctions against Italy? Has not Great Britain imposed sanctions against this country?  Are we not living under those sanctions at present?  If we are a free nation, and the League of Nations is going to be a help to small nationalities, as has been announced by Deputy Norton, what has the League of Nations done in the matter of sanctions imposed on this country by Great Britain for the last <Col N="511" /> three years?  I take it that if we, by an Act, impose sanctions on Italy, we will have to withdraw them by an Act, and so will the League of Nations. Did Great Britain consult the League of Nations before she imposed sanctions on this country?  Did our representative, the Minister for External Affairs, ask the support of the other nations at Geneva against the strong nation, England, imposing sanctions against this country, and if he did not, why not? If he did and was refused, what is the value of Deputy Norton's point that our greatest bulwark is the League of Nations?</P>

This is a Conscription Bill to send the youth of this country out to be slaughtered on some battlefield that will be chosen by the two chains of Allies now forming or which have been formed in Europe.  We are committing the youth of this country to slaughter on that battlefield.  That is the issue and let us face it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we prepared when we pass this Bill to carry out everything that naturally and logically flows <Col N="512" /> from this Bill?  In the schedules here sanctions are enumerated.  It has been stated by Deputy Norton and Deputy MacDermot that we should not strike a bargain on the sanctions imposed on this country by Great Britain, that we should not try to have the economic war settled.  Deputy Norton was eloquent in telling the House that it would dishonour this country if the President as our representative in Geneva tried to make a bargain.  Did Mr. Anthony Eden not make a bargain for British interests?  Did M. Laval not make a bargain for French interests?  Did Great Britain not ask France whether, in the event of sanctions being imposed and naval action being taken against the British Fleet in the Mediterranean, the French fleet would support them?  There was a lull in the negotiations for a few days. Then we were informed in an oblique kind of way that France would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if Great Britain would stand behind France in the case of a German invasion of Austria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They all lined up in this thing because they got something out of it. But we, who are the only country in the world against which sanctions are operating to-day, are going to commit the youth of the country to be slaughtered in a war that will be of no concern to this country&mdash;a war of slaughter and revenge, looking for colonies, looking for an outlet for the surplus population of certain European countries.  We are going to commit ourselves to that.  After every nation put up its price and got its price, it would be dishonourable we are told to ask for equitable treatment for this country before we entered into this thing.  If there was ever an instance in our history when this country was let down, it was when it was let down by the President at Geneva, and this House is to-day asked to sanction that betrayal. The President may smile, but, if my argument, that our youth will be conscripted ultimately if this war goes on, is not sound, I should like an indication from the President as to what time he would advise that this country should betray those other nations which draw out.  Let us suppose <Col N="513" /> for example, that war breaks out between two different groups, arising out of these sanctions in Europe, and that those nations, side-by-side with which we now claim to be carrying out our obligations, line up on one side; that the war lasts a year or two, as the Great War did, and the standing armies are decimated and volunteers are not coming forward; and that those nations have to conscript their youth to fill up the gaps in their armies, is the Free State then going to let down her colleagues of the League of Nations, or will the President come in here with a Bill to say that he will conscript the youth of this country to go out and fight on a European battlefield?  I think that question should be answered by the President, and that it should be answered by the President here to-day. I think this House should demand an answer on that point, and not only demand an answer from the President, but from the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is going to be supported, as has been substantially indicated already, at what stage does any responsible man&mdash;any leader in this House&mdash; suggest that we should withdraw? Does he suggest that we should carry it out to its logical conclusion?  If we are going to carry it out to its logical conclusion, then you are here to-day taking the first step in conscripting the youth of this country.  There is no blinking the fact.  We are all old enough to remember when, at the beginning of the Great War, a brigade or a division was promised by the then Irish leader.  We know how the War dragged on and how it developed. Now, if this country was unanimously behind that leader then in making that declaration, did this country not dishonour itself when it refused to have conscription?  If that was Ireland's war, and if Ireland should make the sacrifices that other nations fighting that war should make, why not face, then, what the other nations had to face, and have the youth conscripted?  We are starting now on the same slippery slope, and if a stand is not made now, and if the position is not fully stated and fully appreciated and understood, we will be committing ourselves, in passing <Col N="514" /> this Bill, to going down that slippery slope.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Let us assume, for instance, that these measures we are passing here to-day, and when applied by all the nations concerned, do not prove effective and that more stringent measures have to be taken&mdash;military measures.  Once these sanctions are imposed, a loose shot, or a bomb placed in a ship in a harbour, may precipitate, as it precipitated the Spanish-American War, a European war, and that means that we are into it.  The cry or the propaganda for that war will be to vindicate the League and to support the Covenant of the League.

      <P>Oh, now, talk seriously. This is a very serious matter, and there is no use in soap-box orators, a couple of years hence, perhaps, when the youth of the country are face to face with conscription, getting up and saying: &ldquo;We will not send out our youth to fight in these battles.&rdquo;  You are doing it to-day and not in years hence, and no cheap jibe about Blueshirts or Blackshirts or hair shirts will get you out of the hole you have just got into with your eyes open.  Would it not have been much easier, when, a year or two ago, another nation violated the Covenant, for the League of Nations to show its authority then? <Col N="515" /> It is very strange how there were no sanctions imposed on Japan when she kicked over the traces and pitched the League there.  Of course, Deputy Norton was eloquent that we will not&mdash;&ldquo;we,&rdquo; mind you; he emphasised it&mdash; allow Abyssinia to be overwhelmed. That is a historical saying.  The Deputy will go down in history for that saying&mdash;&ldquo;We will not allow.&rdquo;</P>

That is what it is coming to.  Those who read the daily papers do not want any further information.  They saw that thing coming.  The position is precisely what it was from the close of the Boer War, particularly from the close of the Russo-Japanese War, to the outbreak of the Great War.  This has resolved itself into precisely the same thing. We are committing ourselves now to the position of being in the fray and we are doing that of our own free will. But we are not free.  We are told by the same people in the next breath that we are not free, that we have not our own freedom and yet we are going out to fight for Abyssinian freedom.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;after these Kilkenny speeches.  After that anything may happen.  I still think it would not be too late before this Bill is passed if we were to say that if we have freedom here and freedom to exercise our freedom, we would then whole-heartedly support the League of Nations to preserve the peace of the world.  President de Valera a thousand times has stated on public platforms, and dozens of times I have myself listened to him stating it&mdash;that there will never be peace in Ireland until Ireland is free.  Well, then, she must be free now according to his latest definition of freedom.  In that case, let us have freedom here and let this question of sanctions between us and Great Britain be settled.  I want it understood that my view of the dispute between Great Britain and this country is not in that plan of sanctions. But that is the plan in which the President and his Party wanted to put the matter from the beginning of these troubles.  Now they have run away from that.  They have in effect said: &ldquo;We will support the League of Nations, but we will not ask the League of Nations at all to settle the dispute between ourselves and another nation.&rdquo;  If Italy were going to invade Abyssinia, and the Abyssinian representative put up that as the Abyssinian case to the League of Nations, what would be thought of it?  President de Valera, side by side with Mr. Anthony Eden, supported Abyssinia.  But why did not the President say to Mr. Eden: &ldquo;What about the sanctions you have imposed on us&mdash;is it only a matter of degree between that and what Signer Mussolini wants to impose on Abyssinia?&rdquo; But the President is silent, not a word from him, and I suppose his Party are silent behind him, and the little Labour Party is silently trotting behind them, with Deputy MacDermot bringing up the rear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had our freedom&mdash; and by freedom I mean the unity of the country, and even a united country as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations would be far ahead of the freedom we now possess&mdash;we would be as good, or perhaps better, than if we had a 32-county Republic. If we had that measure of freedom, then I would say that this Bill should get the unanimous support of this House.  But we have not got that freedom.  And we have no court to appeal to for that freedom&mdash;not even freedom for the Twenty-Six Counties. We have no court to which we could appeal if our freedom were threatened. Unless our President wants to make a case that there has been no attack on our freedom and no imposition of sanctions against us, I do not know what he means.  I am putting the case from the President's point of view, for he has maintained from the beginning that the British are responsible for the economic war and for the imposition of sanctions, and that we are not in any way responsible.  He has put the case that the British are the guilty-parties. Since he came into office he has done nothing of which I have read in print, or anything so far as I have heard to bring his case against the British before the League of Nations. After that attack on our economic well-being&mdash;an attack depriving us of our freedom and imposing on us tariff sanctions, the worst kind of sanctions&mdash; the President wants to join up with the country that is imposing them on us, to aid that country and its allies in imposing sanctions on another country without at the same time asking for any relaxation of the sanctions imposed on us.  I think the President is in an impossible position. He cither accepts the position that the row between this country and Britain is a purely domestic one&mdash;one that cannot be brought before any international court&mdash;or alternatively he feels that if he brought it before an <Col N="519" /> international court he would not get the support there that France is looking for on the Continent, or that Britain is looking for in the Mediterranean. Why did not the President as our representative at Geneva put up some case there for our economic freedom at home?  He did not do that. Now he brings in this Bill and asks the House to ignore that position as between us and Britain.  I questioned Deputy Norton when he said that the country is whole-heartedly in support of President de Valera in the stand he has taken up.  I do not believe it is. The more the country understands the significance of the President's statement and what is following as a direct consequence of that statement, the more the people realise what this Bill means, the sooner they will alter their opinion.  I repeat, if they have any leanings towards the opinion that the President was right at Geneva, they will alter that opinion.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I want to say that I do not think that we should pass this Bill unless the economic war is first cleared out of the way.  If we seriously mean all the talk we have about the Border, and if we seriously mean that we want to unite the country, we should put up two conditions before we co-operate with the League in support of the Covenant.  We are getting the same benefits out of that Covenant that other countries are getting.  If that Covenant is able to rally 30 or 40 nations behind it to support it in the case of the infringement or invasion of Abyssinian liberty, why does Ireland not get the same number of nations to support it, and thus get some benefit out of the Covenant?  Is the independence of Abyssinia, the freedom of Abyssinia, a more sacred thing than the freedom of Ireland?  If it is not, why not invoke the assistance of the League of Nations for Irish liberty?  It has not been done by President de Valera, who has committed this country to fight for Abyssinian liberty and is asking the Dáil to support him in that fight and give legislative sanction to the sending out of an army, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view of a nation's duty is that <Col N="520" /> when it considers taking a decision of such an important character it should weigh all that flows from that decision. I submit that to-day we are asked to take a step, though it is not set out in print in the Bill, and the logical sequence of events from that step is that we shall conscript, if we must, in order to defend this Covenant.  I think enough wild geese have been sent out of Ireland to fight for the liberties of other nations, and if we are going to fight now we should make the bargain and we should have the goods delivered before we commit ourselves to fight. We are all old enough to remember the lesson of the Great War, and we know that the freedom we were asked to fight for was not granted to this country when Belgium was liberated. We had the Black-and-Tan war and a terrible lot of things since.  We have not to go into history to read of those things, because we went through the events ourselves.  Why do we forget the lesson then taught us?  Can we not make our bargain now?</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the President indicate if he has put up any case, or has he taken the view that it was not an opportune time to put up a case? If he has taken that view, I am sure he has taken it honestly, and we can only differ with him and argue against him on the basis on which he took that view.  I would like to know the reasons that brought him to that frame of mind.  If he had not that view, why did he allow the case of Ireland to go by default?  There was no question of honour at stake because the other nations were doing it.  It was either Sir Samuel Hoare or Mr. Anthony Eden who said that if they had not collective support they would not be prepared to support the Covenant or fight for it.  It was a case of everybody for himself.  We were the only people who did not look after our own interests. The President may laugh at that, but what has he got for his promise?  Let him put his cards on the table.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot is not so innocent as that.  He asks what <Col N="521" /> has anybody else got.  Deputy MacDermot has read the history of the world, of the Mediterranean and of Africa.  Does he think for one moment that all this hullabaloo is being kicked up out of natural love and affection for the Abyssinians?  If he does, well he is merely a grown-up baby.  Not one member of the League of Nations cares whether Abyssinian liberty will be preserved.  Their own interests are at stake, and they are looking after their own interests.  Read the English Sunday papers and what is the case set out there?  &ldquo;We cannot allow Italy in Abyssinia or Italy in Libya.&rdquo;  Is not that the case?</P>

      <P>Then Deputy MacDermot knows more than all the editors and the correspondents of the British Sunday papers, and if he does, I bow to his superior knowledge, though I differ from him.  I suppose Deputy MacDermot will tell us that the Great War was fought for Belgian liberty. Why, he could not tell a schoolboy that now, and neither could he tell a schoolboy that in 1914.  We know that when it comes to war no nation is going to tell anybody its intentions.  Is not that the art of diplomacy?  Is not that the first victory?  What leads more to ultimate victory than concealing your intentions?  No nation ever yet won a war that did not conceal its intentions. The intentions are pretty well concealed in the present dispute.  It must have been a master stroke if Deputy MacDermot is convinced.  I would like to hear an unequivocal expression from him&mdash;does he really believe that Britain and France care a brass farthing whether Abyssinian liberty is or is not preserved?</P>

In the Great War you had the victor and the vanquished. You had one group with the spoils of war, possessing colonies extending over hundreds of thousands of square miles and having nothing in them but policemen.  You had and still have other highly-civilised nations in Europe on comparatively poor soil, crowded out.  Does any sane man think that those countries that have a surplus population with no outlet for them and that want to live Christian lives can stand by and say to the victor, &ldquo;We will have peace in the world and everybody will retain the goods he has no matter by what method he got them&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>No, the Jews got it, and I daresay there are Jews there or thereabouts in Abyssinia, too.  It beats me to see that after the lessons we have had&mdash;not the lessons of history, you might forgive a person for that, but the lessons we have had within our own experience&mdash;we are going to repeat the same thing.  The President should bear in mind that no Irishman. perhaps, was ever in the position that he is in at the moment.  The late Mr. Redmond could promise a brigade, a division, or something like that, but he could not send out one man; all he could do was to ask him to go, use his influence to get him to go.  But the President here can order out an army, and where that army goes conscripts can follow and the President can order them.  That is the serious step we are taking to-day and I am amazed that Deputy MacDermot cannot see it in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has always been very eloquent inside this House, and outside it, and rightly so, and I admire him for the labour he has gone to on the question of the abolition of the Boundary.  Does Deputy MacDermot <Col N="523" /> take up the stand that the Six Counties arc not part of Ireland; that they should not be united with the Twenty-Six Counties and form the Irish Nation?  If he takes the stand that we would be justified if we were to go out to save Abyssinia from being taken by Italy, if we are going to shed our blood in defence of Abyssinia, will the British nation with whom we are co-operating restore to us the Boundary?  Charity begins at home. If we are to give our sympathy to Abyssinia to repel the Italians, and if sanctions are applied to Italy because of its action, why are sanctions being applied to ourselves?  Deputy MacDermot said it would be dishonourable, when this matter arose about Abyssinia, for the President to raise the questions of sanctions.  Surely Deputy MacDermot knows enough about the country to know the privation, and the almost starvation and bankruptcy the agricultural community have been brought to by the application of sanctions against this industry. The agricultural community has not the means of providing to-day for the men and women who have grown up in recent years.  They have no chance of giving these young people an opportunity of starting in life.  Is the only hope that is to be held out to that population that is growing up that they are to join the conscript army which is inherent in this Bill?</P>
    <P>This is one of the most serious decisions that any representative body of Irishmen, not to mention an Irish Parliament, has ever been called upon to make.  Has it been fully considered that if we pass this Bill we are committing this country, step by step, in one way or another, to conscription or dishonour?  To-day we cannot see whether we are justified in going on with it.  I am far behind, in the work of preaching hostility to Britain, President de Valera and other members of his Party&mdash;I have no hostility to Britain.  I lived ten years in Britain, and I say that the British people are as fine a people as any in the world.  They love liberty but we should love it too.  If the British want freedom and integrity in their <Col N="524" /> country the Irish people should want freedom and integrity in this country. Why was not that put up?  I cannot understand the mentality of Deputy MacDermot when he says it would have been a dishonour if we put up our case.  Every other country is perfectly free.  There is no partition in these countries.  They were all victors in the Great War.  They put forward their price demands and got them.  But it would be a dishonour, according to Deputy Norton and Deputy MacDermot, for us to do so. I say it was foolishness and not dishonour for us not to put up our case.</P>
    <P>There is no greater sinner in the world than he who knows that he sins against justice.  We sinned when we did not make a deal when we had the opportunity.  The President took a step and a false step and he wants now to retreat from it.  I do not think this is the first false step the President has taken.  However, we will pass from that.  Immediately after he made that false step in Geneva, he, and his followers, put their ears to the ground.  A telephone message came from Geneva that a weighty pronouncement was to be made in this country by the President and that he would make it at Ennis. The whole country was waiting to hear that pronouncement and to learn what he had to say.</P>

He was received by the people at Ennis but he said nothing, and the people of Clare went home having heard nothing.  I hope that one day after his speech in favour of this Conscription Bill he will say what he failed to say in Ennis.</P>

      <P>I think the President should have explained a little <Col N="525" /> more fully the consequences that are likely to flow from this particular measure.

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That the chances are that it may mean war.  If sanctions are not sufficient, the Covenant of the League lays it down clearly what further steps are to be taken. While not opposing the Bill, I want the House to understand what they are committing themselves to.  I do not want any doubt about it after.</P>
      <P>Article 16 (i) reads: &ldquo;Should any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its Covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall <i>ipso facto</i> be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the Covenants breaking State and the nationals of any other State whether a member of the League or not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the step we are taking in this Bill.  But that is not sufficient because paragraph 2 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the Covenants of the League.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment to that.  Article 16 is amended, but it is practically the same thing, and it has this addition to it if the financial sanctions or the economic sanctions fail to secure the objective. I think it is imperative that the President should tell us whether he regards <Col N="526" /> this as the first and final step, or whether it is only the first step, and where exactly it is going to land this country.  I have followed with great care the speeches made by everybody. Whether the President should or should not have done something at Geneva is a matter about which I am not going to say anything at the moment, but if support of the Covenant is going to impose upon us certain further obligations than are contained in this Bill I do want to say that owing to the economic war we are neither economically nor militarily prepared for such an obligation. Whether in the hotel or at dinner with Mr. Anthony Eden, or wherever the opportunity arose, I think the obligation rested on the President or on the delegates from this country to say to those people that while we were subscribing to the maintenance of the Covenant it was true that we found ourselves in such an economic position, owing to their conduct, that we might not be able to subscribe to it as whole-heartedly as we should like.  That might not have the desired effect, but at the same time it is true that if a man has been beaten pretty severely, and is called upon to fight another battle immediately, it is no harm for him to say to his seconds: &ldquo;I think you ought to give me a breather.  Give me a chance.  Let me recover my wind before I am put into it again.&rdquo;  Well, it seems we are to continue the present war and go on into another.  That may appeal to theorists, and to people who are not bearing the brunt of the economic war in this country at the moment, but there are people in this country at the moment who are very hard pressed, and it is too much to ask them to throw up their hats in joy because we are going into another war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to attack anybody, but Deputy Norton said that this Party here were trying to make political capital out of a certain situation.  Well, Sir, in the course of his speech he should have made an effort at self-examination of conscience, because I never saw such an attempt as that made by Deputy Norton to derive political capital out of the present situation.  He tried to make political <Col N="527" /> capital out of the situation, there and then by referring to some of the red herrings that were thrown across the floor here between Deputy MacDermot and members of this Party.  Of course, Deputy MacDermot said that somebody ate oysters, but I think the wrong fish was mentioned.  It was certainly red herrings, as far as the debate was concerned.  Deputy Norton knows quite well that it is quite a common situation for contracts to be entered into by certain employees, and that because of a change of circumstances or some such thing they have no hesitation whatever in declaring those contracts as of no effect.  They make a demand in regard to the continuance of those contracts under certain circumstances, and rightly so.  They seize the opportunity and make use of it.</P>
    <P>Now, I say that the President had an opportunity.  It would not, I admit, be wise to have taken it at the League of Nations itself, but I know that the delegates of this country and the delegates of Great Britain were not 100 miles apart all that time.  They were not in separate locked cells in a prison.  They must have met and did meet, as it is customary to do prior to meetings of the League itself, and there were exchanges of views as to what each one was able to do.  I respectfully submit, Sir, that at that particular time it would be quite legitimate for the President to say that owing to the economic position in which we found ourselves we were not able to enter into this matter with a light heart.  I think the President had that in his mind when he said at Geneva that it was a greater hardship upon us than on most nations to take the step that he was taking, and that it was likely to impose greater hardships upon us.  I believe that in his heart of hearts that is what the President had in mind, and that that is what he was referring to.  I maintain that it would have been no dishonour, or no breaking away from national or international obligations if he had put that case to the representatives of the other nations, and in particular to the British representatives, <Col N="528" /> before we were fully committed. to this particular line of action.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I think the President ought to tell us now whether he thinks the financial sanctions or the economic sanctions which are imposed will be sufficient to achieve our objective, and if not, whether any further steps are likely to be undertaken.  I think it is essential that the people of this country and the Deputies of this House should know exactly what is being done.  We should not be run into the thing blindfoldedly. I think the obligation rests upon the President to give us that information, and I respectfully submit.  Sir, that he ought to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I never listened to a more faint-hearted debate on the introduction of any Bill than I heard this afternoon in this House.  The enforcement of a boycott&mdash;as it was commonly spoken of here years ago&mdash;of the Italian Government is no concern of the Irish people, to my mind at all events.  This is only the first step.  If this war extends to a great European or world war, the Irish people are committed to uphold the Covenant, and the pledges which President de Valera, as representative of the Irish people, has given in Geneva.  Does any Deputy in this House imagine for one moment that the passing of this Bill will bring the Italian-Abyssinian dispute to an end?  It will be of no assistance whatever to Abyssinia.  Any resolutions passed by any Government or any people when two nations are at war will not in any way bring about the conquest of one nation or the other. Deputies in this House have alluded to the economic war in this country, and stated that the President should have made more use of the opportunity presented by the present situation to bring about a satisfactory settlement of that economic war.  What is the cause of this trouble in Abyssinia to-day?  Is it the fact that Italy, with her teeming population, wishes to extend her territories to a country where Italy, France and other great powers have already established themselves?  Have they not done in the past what Italy is doing to-day?  We heard but very <Col N="529" /> little condemnation of the Japanese when Japan went to war with China and flouted her obligations to the League.  We heard no hullabaloo in Geneva with regard to the conquest of territory in China.  This country at the present moment is a nation which has been crushed down by a foreign Government for the past 700 years. Where was the freedom extended to this country which they now wish to extend to Abyssinia?  Is it for love of the Abyssinians that the British Empire and the great and mighty power of England and France is ranged on the side of Abyssinian freedom? No.  It is for the extermination of the Abyssinians, for the conquest of their country, and for the purpose of grabbing all the mineral wealth they can lay hands on.  England is ruffled now because she was not the first in the field to grab the valuable gold mines and oil fields in Abyssinia.  Would they have done what Italy is doing to-day if they were in a position to do it?  My honest belief is that they were not prepared, as Italy was, to go into darkest Africa to exterminate peoples and to confiscate valuable properties which they had their eyes on.  Mussolini did not give them time to do it.</P>
      <P>As regards this League of Nations, I have always looked upon it as the greatest farce of all time.  There is no sincerity behind any member of that League of Nations, and they are only pulling the wool over the eyes of the common people of the world.  They are biding their time and conserving their man power for the purpose of grabbing, at their own sweet will, all the mineral resources they can lay hands on.  I think there is no doubt that President de Valera, as Minister for External Affairs, acted in an honourable manner under a hereditary obligation to carry out the wishes of the people of this country, but I think he is in a very awkward position at present, because if this war develops, and, to my mind, it will, the resolutions we pass here and this very Bill before us will commit the manhood of this country to a bloody conflict in foreign lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The League of Nations is out for the <Col N="530" /> freedom of small nations.  What freedom did we ever get from them or any other power in Europe?  Here we are to-day with a boundary question unsettled and our country torn to pieces by internal strife.  I think it would be the duty of this Government and of the Irish people to unite and to put our claims before the League of Nations with a view to getting England to stop the economic war which she is pursuing in a ruthless manner. Her penal tariffs are bleeding the unfortunate farmers of this country and reducing them to a state of misery and poverty.  She should put her own house in order before attempting to get the manhood of this country or any other small nation to fight against a grand Catholic country like Italy.  As an Irishman and as a Catholic&mdash;a humble one, I must say&mdash;I will oppose this Bill, because I will not agree to the application of sanctions against Italy, who is going out to civilise and to Christianise a pagan race.  I sincerely hope that the Italian race, and Mussolini, the great leader of the Italian people, and defender of our faith in Italy, will be successful in this war.</P>

      <P>I think we are all very grateful for the fact that the President, when he was in Geneva. succeeded in getting agreement amongst the other members of the League that the sanctions should not apply to funds being sent to Italy for religious purposes.  There is, however the further question which has not been decided&mdash;the position of Irish students and professors in religious establishments in Rome in the event of Italy becoming involved technically in a war with this country.  It is quite possible under international law that these students and professors would be interned and the colleges seized and confiscated.  I think that is a matter which the Government might look into. There is that difficulty.  It is probably only a legal difficulty, which would apply to a great number of nations besides our own, but, in view of the importance of our historical institutions in Rome, we should be very care ful to ensure beforehand that their life <Col N="531" /> and continuance should not be imperilled by any action on our part.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question, I can only say that I am in sympathy with the Italian people, as I believe this is a just war on their behalf.  Unlike any other member of this Parliament, I have studied for the last 20 or 30 years the history, culture, art, literature and social and political conditions of Abyssinia, and I am satisfied that there is no such thing as an Abyssinian nation.  There is a collection of peoples there dominated by an ascendancy group who have depopulated that vast area, just as the ascendancy here depopulated this country during the last 80 years and reduced its population by half.  The methods adopted by the ascendancy in Abyssinia have been more ruthless and more cruel than those adopted by the ascendancy in this country.  There are great mounds in Abyssinia, of which I have got photographs, mounds of sand covering the bones of countless thousands of children who died as a result of the slave trades conducted by the Abyssinian ascendancy and their Arab associates. The Emperor of Abyssinia may pretend to be a descendant of King Solomon of Jerusalem.  It is more likely, in my opinion, that he is a descendant of King Herod of Jerusalem, who is famous in history for his slaughter of the Innocents.  I think that in this war Signor Mussolini is the Abraham Lincoln of Africa, and that he is out to abolish the slave trades in spite of the sentimental sympathy of Great Britain, which was also displayed in support of the Southern States during the American Civil War when Great Britain supported, financially and militarily, the cause of the slave trading and slave owning classes of the Southern States as against the will of the American people.</P>

      <P>He was mistaken. I do not know whether John Mitchel admitted his mistake, but undoubtedly England did.  Then there was the case of the &ldquo;Alabama,&rdquo; the boat which the English sent to support <Col N="532" /> the slave owners.  It caused great damage to the ships of the American people.  That case was afterwards decided by international arbitration. It is one of the outstanding cases in international law.  The English, in a very sportsmanlike manner, acknowledged their mistake.  They acknowledged that they were not justified in what they did, and paid the full indemnity of, I think, £2,000,000, imposed by the international court.  I have great hope that in this cause, which is a cause between the slave traders and the Northerners, the English will in time acknowledge their mistake as handsomely as they did in the case of the Southern States of America. I can only hope that God will bless the banners of Italy and so bring to an end, once and for all, what is a real crime and a very real blot on those States which are trafficking in human bodies.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Deputy one question before he concludes? Does not his argument simply amount to this, that Abyssinia is not fit to be a member of the League of Nations?  Is he not overlooking the fact that Abyssinia was admitted to the League of Nations mainly because of the advocacy of Italy?  Is he not also overlooking the fact that since she was admitted the other nations of the world took certain obligations in her regard, and will he explain why Italy, and Italy alone, should be allowed to disregard those obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir Osmond Esmonde Sir Osmond Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Osmond Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with there is no doubt that Italy made a mistake in advocating the admission of Abyssinia into the League of Nations.  The fact that a mistake was made only means that the members of the League of Nations must try to find a solution to remedy that mistake. I think Italy made that mistake. Abyssinia was admitted a member of the League of Nations about 1923, the year in which the Irish Free State was admitted.  That does not mean that Italy should be blamed for being too generous.  She hoped, I suppose, that when Abyssinia was admitted to the League of Nations she would become civilised, that she would take her responsibilities seriously and would <Col N="533" /> become an active member of the community of nations.  I think that is a matter that should be realised by Deputy MacDermot.  I do not think there is any provision in the Covenant of the League of Nations whereby a mistake of that kind can be remedied. The League of Nations is not a legislative body.  It cannot pass legislation to change its own Constitution.  I certainly think that if the League of Nations was, in fact, a parliament, it should by this time have introduced provisions to enable it to exclude nations which were found to be unsuitable or incapable of membership just as there are rules in our Constitution which prevent certain persons being elected as members of this Assembly. That is a matter for the future, and, possibly, this crisis will draw attention to these defects in the Constitution of the League of Nations and attract the attention of all nations to the need for amending the Constitution of the League and the Covenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told for the hundredth time by Deputies on the opposite benches how I should have made my speech, what I should have done, how I should have introduced this Bill and the subjects about which I should have spoken.  In deciding to introduce the Bill in the way I did introduce it, I very deliberately made up my mind that I would not go into the thousand and one subjects I could have dealt with.  I might have talked about the whole idea of a League of Nations, the difficulty of ever getting such a League to work, the difficulty of having obligations undertaken carried out when the selfish interest of any particular member might suggest to that member that it would be well to violate the obligations, and the necessity, in order to counteract that natural tendency, for action of one kind or another in case that tendency led a particular member to violate the obligations it had undertaken. I could have pointed out that the moment you tried to impose sanctions of the magnitude which would be effective, a loose organisation, such as the League of Nations, would, in all probability, break down.  I could have discussed all these questions, but I submit that <Col N="534" /> these are questions which should be discussed not on this occasion but on another occasion.  Speeches such as have been made by Deputy Belton, Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies would be very appropriate when the Estimates for the League of Nations were under discussion here.  They would have been proper questions for examination at the start, when application was made for membership of the League of Nations by this State, and they would have been proper questions for examination when the new Government took office and proposed to continue membership of that League.</P>
      <P>Again, I say this is not the time for consideration of these questions.  There is a very simple question now before the Dáil.  That is, whether or not, having deliberately undertaken certain obligations, we are, in fact, going to carry these obligations out.  That is the only question we have to decide here.  We are free to say whether we shall or not carry them out.  We are free to give any reasons we like for not carrying them out.  But I believe that if we refused to carry them out we would be violating the obligations to which we committed ourselves when we joined the League.  What is the extent of these obligations?  It was suggested this afternoon that this was only the first step and that we might be led on to military and other sanctions. Somebody called this a &ldquo;Conscription Bill.&rdquo;  I attempted to explain our position in regard to the whole question of these obligations in the broadcast statement which I gave in the interval between the first meeting I attended at Geneva and my second journey there.  I have only to say to those who talk about conscription that, in my opinion, we have no legal or moral obligation to engage in military sanctions.  That is the position as I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing in this Bill is very definite.  There is nothing vague about it.  The representatives of the various Governments, having come to the conclusion that a violation of the Covenant had taken place, agreed on certain measures.  These measures were considered with a view to making them effective.  To be effective, it was desirable <Col N="535" /> that they should be universal, if possible.  The purpose of this Bill is strictly limited to the carrying out of the recommendations which are scheduled here.  I could also have gone into the merits of the dispute and examined into the substance of the allegations made by each of the two parties&mdash;one against the other.  Again, I regarded that as foreign to this debate, as not a matter we had to enter into except in this respect: whether, in fact, one of the two parties had violated the Covenant.  That was the simple issue and I confined myself deliberately, in my introductory statement, to that particular question.  I hold that Italy did violate her obligations under the Covenant.  The view I took was the view taken by the representatives of 54 out of the 58 States in the League of Nations.  I think that nobody looking at the obligations that were entered into by members of the League and knowing that Italy and Abyssinia were both members could arrive at any other decision than that there had been a violation of the Covenant.  I said that we, perhaps, more than most other peoples, would regret being put into a position&mdash;as measures of this kind inevitably do put us&mdash;of enmity with another people.  We have no quarrel with Italy.  We have far more relations with Italy than with Abyssinia and know the Italian people far better than we do the people of Abyssinia, who are scarcely known to us.  But if there had been any complaint by Italy against Abyssinia in regard to the practice of slavery or anything else, there was a perfectly proper way of dealing with it.  That way was not the taking of the law into their own hands, as Italy appears to have done. Abyssinia entered into certain obligations when she became a member of the League.  If it was held by any State that Abyssinia was not acting up to these obligations or acting in an unbecoming manner or in a manner dangerous to the peace of the world, there was a way of dealing with that complaint.  If necessary, there was a way of getting united League action to settle the matter, so far as practicable. Those in other countries who <Col N="536" /> are opposed to Italy's attitude and who propose to engage in measures such as we propose to engage in here would have assisted in providing remedies if there were evils to be remedied.</P>
    <P>Again, I say the merits of the dispute, as such, are not before us.  The question is whether or not in fact a certain obligation was broken, and if so what we are to do about it in accordance with our own obligations. I am asking the Dáil to decide that the Government was right in co-operating with the Governments of other nations in fulfilment of these obligations which were freely undertaken by all the members of the League.  If there is any objection to the taking of this action, or if there is any suggestion that the measures taken, either in the present dispute or in any other dispute, might lead us too far, then the only remedy for us is to leave the League of Nations.  You cannot have it both ways.  I am not going to say that membership of the League of Nations is all to our advantage and that there is no other side to it.  I recognise that there is another side to it.  When we were in opposition, members of our Party frequently spoke here about the other side.  There is a nice balance, and the balance is one to be determined by each nation for itself.  The question ultimately is whether or not this Society or League of Nations is going to be an advantage to the world, and whether, if the advantage is general, it is going to be an advantage in particular to each nation engaged in it.  An organisation such as the League of Nations is a loose one, because the nations naturally are jealous of their sovereignty.  As was pointed out, the League of Nations Assembly is not a Parliament.  Cooperation on the part of each of the States must be voluntary if you want to get any action.  Knowing what human nature is, there is grave doubt always in the mind of each particular member as to whether other members will do their duty.  Bargaining that we heard of between France and Great Britain recently in this matter was not about some third or outside issue. Bargaining in all this has to do with the question of the extent, if one should become involved, to <Col N="537" /> which the other will fulfil the obligations of mutual assistance.  That is the real question.  It is a very serious matter for every nation to know whether or not, when engaging in any particular action, and in carrying out the obligations of the Covenant, it will have the support of other nations.  It is not enough to get one or two to engage in actions of this kind.  One of the things that will have to be considered here is the degree of unity and solidarity there is amongst the nations in the carrying out of any of these measures.  Up to date the position with regard to the measure before the House is this: that in regard to proposals one and two, 51 nations voted for; in regard to the next two proposals 49 States accepted them, and in regard to proposal five 44 States accepted.  Some of the States not included in these numbers are considering the matter, but for one reason or another have not given their final reply.  So that in regard to these measures there is substantial solidarity. One of the things that naturally will be taken into account by any State considering any measures that may be proposed for carrying out the obligations is the extent to which other States agree to co-operate.</P>
    <P>I have tried to keep the discussion here as closely as possible to the Bill. I was fully aware that the discussion could be widened and that there could be talk about all sorts of issues.  We had the question of the economic war and our attitude with regard to Great Britain brought into this discussion.  I think the Leader of the Opposition spoke outside about the inconsistency of Great Britain and ourselves in having, so to speak, a conflict which was not settled while proposing to take part in any action that was being taken by the League of Nations to settle other conflicts.  Well, there may be some blame, to put it that way, in not bringing the question to the League of Nations, assuming that there was no difficulty about bringing it there.  But that is outside the issue before us now.  I do not object to its introduction at the moment, but I am not going to be led at this stage into a discussion of all the questions involved in that matter.  For instance, <Col N="538" /> one of the things told us was that the League put us on an equal level.  Great Britain and ourselves are not on an equal level in that matter.  It is very interesting to see all who are so ready to find fault with us willing, even in this matter, to say that we are not on the same level.  At an early stage we indicated our readiness to have that matter brought before an international tribunal.  There was no reference to that here to-day.  I am submitting this Bill in the belief that everybody who seriously examines it knows what we committed ourselves to in joining the League of Nations, and knows what we committed ourselves to in continuing to be a member of the League.  Every such person has no option, in my opinion, but to vote for this Bill. Anyone who votes against the Bill will have to tell the people why he should not have voted for it.  We heard some members talking about their sympathy for Abyssinia, and others talking about the question of our not making a bargain. Sometimes when there is a possibility of further steps, each of them, no matter what these steps are, will have to be brought here for consideration.  Let those people tell us what we were to do in this matter.  Were we to refuse? Were we to say: &ldquo;We will not carry out our obligations&rdquo;?</P>

If they put themselves into that position for one or two months to see what would be the consequence of acting like that, possibly there would be no bargain and they might have quite a different opinion.  I am putting it as a challenge to every member in the Dáil to say what ground there is for voting against the Bill.  This is a plain carrying out of obligations that we entered into by being a member of the League of Nations, and of the obligations that we have by continuing to be a member of the League.  No one can vote against the Bill conscientiously, except those who stood up each time the League of Nations Estimate was before the Dáil and said that we should have nothing to do with it, because a <Col N="539" /> certain state of circumstances might arise in which we might be involved in the question of sanctions, which might lead to serious results.  No one can have any reason for voting against the Bill except such persons.  If Deputy Belton had taken up that attitude in the past, I say he would have a right to oppose the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was endeavouring to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that the suggested schemes for the relief of unemployment were not really schemes which would encourage production, that they were mostly non-productive schemes.  After all, when we come to consider the question of unemployment we ought seriously to consider what is the cause of it; whether the unemployment which we have to-day is the result of something abnormal, something that is likely to pass away, something which is due possibly to some Providential visitation or some other passing event or another.  If not, when do we expect to see the end of it, or even an amelioration of the conditions which exist?  Are the steps which we are taking tending towards that end?  These are very serious considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I feel that it is futile to expect that any steps will tend towards ending unemployment and distress in this country until the main industry of the country is put on some decent footing.  When we have the main industry living upon doles and subsidies, you are bound to have unemployment and distress.  We have all over the country farmers who were once well off, whose sons were enjoying a decent living&mdash;an easy living, if you like&mdash;on the farms.  They are on the labour market at the present time. Even their fathers are on the labour market.  Why?  Take, for instance, a cattle fair down in Roscommon, where there are anything between 3,000 and 4,000 cattle on sale.  These cattle have suffered a deterioration in price, artificially produced, of, say, £5 per head at the very lowest.  That means that the money which heretofore came into that locality every few months has been reduced by some £20,000 or £30,000.  That is bound to have its reaction on unemployment and on the comfort of the people.  If the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government <Col N="541" /> thinks that the future of this country is going to be made up on profits reaped from beet and wheat, that we are going either to be wallowing in wealth or living in frugal comfort from either one or the other, they are making the biggest mistake they ever made in their lives.</P>
    <P>We are really a live-stock country, and we must get back to the rearing of live stock.  If we are going to have tillage in this country that will give employment and relieve unemployment, we must have tillage that will in some shape or form absorb the workers.  After all, there is very little labour in the growing of wheat. There are very few people employed in it.  There are many more people employed in the production of oats, turnips or mangolds, if you feed these crops to live stock.  The Parliamentary Secretary must set his mind to that before he succeeds in inventing any kind of cure for the unemployment evil that is rampant to-day in this country.  We must put agriculture in its proper place, that is, it must be able to show a profit of itself.  After all, beet and wheat, being subsidised at the present time, are a drain upon the nation.  We cannot subsidise the main industry.  You may subsidise some items of it, but no matter what department of the industry you take to-day, it has got to be subsidised. While you have got that condition of affairs you arc bound to have unemployment. Consequently, I would say that while the Parliamentary Secretary may be racking his brains at the present time to find some way to provide employment for the thousands of people who are at present out of work, and for the thousands of people who are in distress, he should insist on the Government endeavouring to do something for agriculture, so that agriculture will be able to pay its own way.  The present condition of affairs cannot continue.  It is a drain on the resources of the nation.  It is unfortunate that we should be driven to the necessity of putting up schemes, spring, summer, autumn and winter, for the relief of unemployment, and the Government that has to find the money <Col N="542" /> has my sympathy.  If they wish to end that, they will have to tackle the bigger question.  They will have to get back to the main industry.  They will have to see that the main industry is able to support the people and that it shall show a profit.  Until they do that they are only tinkering with the question, and they are going to have this recurring liability, in season and out of season.  We are going to have this unemployment question as a permanent problem, and tinkering of this kind will not solve it.</P>

Why is there such a great scramble amongst their followers for a share and more than a share of the land that is being divided if agriculture is not paying?

      <P>In answer to Deputy Kennedy, I should like to say that on several occasions in this House I put it to the Government to set up a Commission to inquire into the position of the agricultural industry in this country.  I now issue that challenge to them and I would ask Deputy Kennedy to use his influence with the Government so that they may accept my proposal.  They can summon the small farmers of this country before that Commission and hear their evidence there on oath.  Then the people of the country would be in a better position to judge the condition of these unfortunate people.  I come from a constituency in which there are small farmers who are amongst the most industrious people in this country.  Some of them have to live on 25 or 26 acres of mountainy land.  Before this Government came into office these people were able to put money into the bank.  I do not make statements here over which I <Col N="543" /> am not prepared to stand.  I am prepared to put up witnesses whose valuation would probably not be more than £5 who, by their own industry and the industry of their families, were in a position to save money during that time.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Brennan has said, we hear a lot of talk in this country about growing wheat and beet and all that kind of thing.  What is happening to these unfortunate people to-day? They have to pay an increased price for their flour, for their sugar, and for every article going into their houses.  I have mentioned these small farmers, but this applies to everybody in the towns and cities of this country. The Government told the people before they came into office that if returned they would reduce taxation by £2,000,000 without interfering with any public service.  I say you are the greatest lot of hypocrites that ever adorned any Government Bench. The Parliamentary Secretary may sneer.  He can afford to sneer because he knows very little about the sufferings of the people as he has never lived among them.  I have lived among them and I have worked with them and I know their wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago when this question of relief schemes was before the House I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that something should be done to help the unfortunate people who have to pay 7/6 more per sack for Indian meal as the result of the Government policy.  The Parliamentary Secretary then promised that he would put it up to the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture's reply was that he could not find the money.  These people are put in the position of having to pay 7/6 more per sack for Indian meal in order to subsidise farmers in County Kildare and other parts of the country who were formerly described by the Parliamentary Secretary and others like him as ranchers.  We are told about growing wheat and beet, but the Minister for Agriculture on one occasion here told us that the more of these crops we grew the more cattle we would want.  What is the <Col N="544" /> policy of the Government to-day? They are destroying our calves and our cattle.</P>
    <P>That is the policy which we are told is going to make this country prosperous. It is all humbug.  The Government at last I believe in their hearts realise where their policy is leading the country.  Some time ago we were challenged by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to resign our seats and I accepted the challenge on that occasion.  I am prepared to accept that challenge again and to go before my constituency where the Government have two seats to our one. Let them resign these seats and test the feelings of the people in that constituency and I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that when the election is over he will not be in the position to sneer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any Deputy can very well oppose such a Vote as this for relief schemes, because we are all agreed as to the necessity for providing some work and a means of livelihood for the great proportion of our population.  I do not rise to speak about the conditions of agriculture or anything like that. There will be a time and place for that.  I would perhaps take a different view from the last speaker.  I would welcome the spending of money and the opportunity for the unemployed to earn money on useful relief schemes, but I would say that the time has come when those schemes might be more elastic.  There was a rule that such schemes as we embarked upon would not be schemes that county councils, for instance, would be obliged to undertake; that such schemes that would be embarked upon would be outside the province of county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am not out of order, I should like to say that our unemployment assistance and relief schemes will have to be examined in the light of the experience of these past years.  There is a growing feeling in the country that there is a tremendous amount of useful work which could be done and is being done through the medium of relief schemes, and that much further work could be done if the money <Col N="545" /> that is given without getting any return in work was put into the relief scheme pool to swell it.  It is not very long ago since the person whom we might call the father of unemployment assistance, or, as it was called in the early days, the dole, said in a public speech that we cannot go on forever just giving out money for nothing.  If this House on some appropriate occasion directed its attention to devoting the money that is being simply handed out without the State getting any return for it to giving employment, cither through the development of these relief schemes, or some other scheme, we could get a lot of useful work done.</P>
    <P>At the present time the county councils do not know where to turn for money.  There is no use in turning a blind eye to the facts.  It is very hard at present to collect rates and the county councils are at their wits' end to keep the necessary works going.  The result is that at the annual meetings the county councils are pressing county surveyors to cut down expenditure so that the upkeep of the roads is not being properly attended to.  There is a lot of very useful work that could be done on the roads. It is being done up to a certain point by removing dangerous bends, renewing bridges, etc.  I have the feeling that if, on an appropriate occasion, this whole matter was discussed in the House and more money was somehow provided for the doing of this work, we would be doing something useful.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enlarge on it.  I am merely throwing out the suggestion.  I am sorry that there is a necessity for these relief schemes.  I am sure we are all sorry that there is not more employment to be had and that we have so many unemployed. But, coming from an agricultural constituency, where unemployment ought to be at its lowest point, I can say that one hears continually of money being paid out in the form of unemployment assistance benefit while people are saying that they cannot get <Col N="546" /> men to work for them.  I am not here to make any charge against the workingmen, but I believe that in a matter of this kind we are not managing our affairs economically.  There is quite a lot of useful work could be done if only we had the money to do it.  I am suggesting that, instead of giving money for nothing, we should have some scheme whereby that money would be turned into useful channels, so that our people will have real employment and not be getting into the state of wanting to dodge work and being chronically unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaint I have to make, and it is a genuine complaint, concerning the Estimate before the House, is that, so far as proposals that have been put before the different Departments from my area are concerned, the amount now about to be allocated, I understand, will not go any distance to meet proposals which would relieve unemployment and, at the same time, carry out useful schemes in that area.  I am glad to notice that the Parliamentary Secretary has been touring the country.  I think it is a very useful thing to do from many points of view.  I am not going to go into the details or to give any detailed reasons in support of that, but I am glad to notice that he has been going around the country, and I should be glad to hear from him, when he is replying, whether he is genuinely convinced that the situation this year in regard to unemployment has improved as compared with the situation which presented itself to his Department this time last year.  I do not believe that the position in my constituency has improved.  I believe, as I have said before, that there are plenty of proposals in the Parliamentary Secretary's own Department which would justify the allocation of a far greater sum of money for the carrying out of useful works, and I would prefer, and all the members of this Party would prefer, that money should be provided for work rather than for unemployment assistance.  I do not believe there is any appreciable number of workless people in this country at the moment <Col N="547" /> who would prefer to receive, or to continue to receive, unemployment assistance if work was available for these able-bodied people under reasonably fair conditions.</P>
      <P>I admit that the few factories which have been started in my area have given employment to a certain number of people, but I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he makes a careful examination of the position in that area, he will find that employment is being given, to the extent of about 90 per cent. of the amount of employment given, to boys and girls, and to girls to a greater extent than to boys or men.  The seriousness of the situation in the part of the country for which I have the privilege of speaking is that the able-bodied men, or the able-bodied married men with dependents, are not getting a proper share of the work in the factories that have been established.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to survey the position all along the Barrow Valley where for, perhaps, two or three or even four years, a very large number of men were given useful work.  The work on the Barrow scheme has been completed and the work well done, and these able-bodied men who had been employed on it&mdash;I am sure that there were nearly 1,000 men employed on that scheme&mdash; are going around to-day looking for work in the towns and countryside through which the Barrow River flows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one example.  Now, has the situation improved from the point of wiew either of the farmer or worker?  I say no.  I am aware, and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny it, that the wages and the conditions of agricultural workers, throughout the midland counties at any rate, have been worsened.  The proof of that is that the Parliamentary Secretary's own Department and the Ministry of Lands and Forestry have actually attempted to justify reductions in wages of the workers employed on forestry and arterial drainage schemes by pointing to the reduction in the rates of wages paid to agricultural labourers.  I have cases in hand with the Parliamentary Secretary's Department on that matter at the moment; <Col N="548" /> cases where they have even gone to the extent&mdash;I am not sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is personally responsible&mdash;of reducing the wages on an arterial drainage scheme by 11d.  The rate of wages paid on a scheme, which has been just completed in an area in my constituency, was 28/- a week. Another scheme has just been started where the rate is 27/1, and the Parliamentary Secretary has some responsibility for attempting to reduce the rate previously paid in that area.  He gives as his grounds for doing so the reduced rate paid to agricultural workers.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will not challenge that.  In another part, the workers engaged in forestry work were paid at the rate of 22/- per week.  I raised the question here with the Minister for Lands and Forestry and, while he did not attempt to justify the reasonableness or fairness of the rate, he stated that the new rate&mdash;the new low rate, as it was&mdash;was based on the reduced rate that was being paid to agricultural labourers by representative farmers.  That is, at any rate, some proof, which must be accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary, that the conditions of the agricultural labourers have been worsened, and worsened at a time when, through other activities of the Government, the cost of living is being put up on the very same people.  The prices of flour, and bread and butter and other necessities of life have been going up at a time when the rates of wages of agricultural workers and other workers in towns and rural areas are being brought down.</P>
    <P>Now, I have studied the situation from the point of view of the farmers, and I find that the rates are increasing from year to year, compared to the rates two years ago.  Throughout the whole Free State there is an increased rate demand this year for £1,000,000 over what it was two years ago.  That is being demanded at a time when some farmers are getting uneconomic prices for what they have to sell.  At a recent fair, in a town in my constituency, the price offered for pigs&mdash;and, mind you, pigs are reared by men in labourers' cottages as well as by small farmers and big farmers&mdash;was as low as 26/- <Col N="549" /> per cwt., live weight.  No such price was ever heard of by any person living in the area.  Of course, the price charged in the same town for bacon to the consumers is at the same level as it was when the price for pigs, live weight, was 45/- per cwt.  These are things which make me feel that the situation is not so rosy as Deputy Kennedy and some others of his colleagues would endeavour to make it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I say.  If I am not presenting the facts properly, I should be glad to be corrected by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Then, a considerable number of farmers, who increased the acreage of their tillage and grew grain, have the grain lying in their barns at the present time without any offer from anybody to buy it.  That is a very serious thing at this time of the year.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the average farmer has not a proper place to keep his grain, and a very high figure is being charged for keeping it.  I understand that the Minister for Agriculture has endeavoured recently to make an arrangement with the barley buyers to purchase their surplus grain at a certain price; but I also know, and I have definite information and personal knowledge, that some of these grain buyers do not intend to carry out the Minister's scheme or to purchase the grain lying on the hands of the farmers. I am in thorough sympathy with the policy of the Government in trying to guarantee a price.  Before this Government became a Government, and before the Party that is now a Government came into this House, I, with my colleagues of the Labour Party, advocated the guaranteeing of prices to the farmers.  I regret to say, however, that, although we have guaranteed prices for some of the commodities the farmers, large and small, are producing&mdash;particularly the tillage farmers&mdash; those prices are not being fixed at an economic figure.  I would object as much to asking the farmer to sell his produce below the cost of production as I would object to a county council expecting a road worker to go out and work for nothing.  I think that <Col N="550" /> is a fair comparison.  I do not want to exaggerate, but I think all this is helping to create a situation which would put the people in the rural areas at any rate into a worse position than that in which they were 12 months ago. It justifies me in making the case for an increased allocation of money for the carrying out of relief works in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put forward schemes which came to me from the local authorities and different agencies in my constituency. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary has been responsible for the carrying out of very useful relief works, such as the drainage of bogs and the making of bog roads throughout the country.  This work has made it possible for some people to engage in turf-cutting and thus win at least part of their livelihood in the past few years.  I have discovered cases in my constituency where proposals were apparently put up to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department for the carrying out of bog-road work.  This is what has happened and I hope to find the reason for it.  The money allocated in a particular area was not sufficient to complete the job in a satisfactory way.  I know of two or three cases where the work of making and repairing a bog-road has been going on for three years.  In each of the three years a small amount, £60 or £70, was spent on the work.  The files in the Minister's Department will bear this out.  There had not been enough voted any year to complete the job, which is done bit by bit from year to year.  Now I think that is an uneconomic way of carrying out work of that kind.  I know that in one of these cases the estimate for the work was £250.  A sum of £70 was granted the first year.  I understand that most of the money was set aside the first year for raising the material for the road.  Two other attempts had to be made before the road was completed. That is an unsatisfactory way of doing the job, so far, at least, as my area is concerned.  I do not go round looking after these things but in two or three cases that is what has happened.  I hope that in future any proposals that are put forward for my area for a particular work of that kind will be carried <Col N="551" /> through in one year, that sufficient money will be allocated to complete the work, and that the work will be done within a limited period.  I think that is the more economic method of spending the limited amount available on these relief votes.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Local Government and Public Health speaking here and he is a very generous-minded man when he talks in the House.  He is generous both inside and outside the House.  I dare say it is the iron hand of the Minister for Finance that prevents him from being as generous in certain matters as he would like to be.  There are many proposals from the local authorities in my area for the carrying out of sewerage and waterworks schemes.  Since I came here I have made it my business, since the introduction of the first Estimate in 1923, to advocate the carrying out of public health works in the towns and villages of the country, and particularly in the area I represent.  There is a certain amount of opposition from the farmers to the carrying out of these schemes.  They can never see the value of waterworks and sewerage schemes in the towns, not even the need for providing pure water in the schools which their own children are attending.  I always try to argue that the townspeople who get the particular benefit from the carrying out of these sewerage and waterworks schemes are called upon in return to provide a big section of the money that is needed for arterial drainage schemes in the rural areas.  I think, and I have always said so, that the people in the rural areas should give a <i>quid pro quo</i> to the townspeople for their share in the carrying out of arterial drainage schemes.  That is one reason why the farmer should be more ready to help towards the carrying out of the public health services in the towns and villages. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows that it is absolutely impossible for the ratepayers to find the whole of the money that must be found for the carrying out of these public health works.  He would not stand for that in his own area, I am sure.  I would ask the Parliamentary <Col N="552" /> Secretary, who has perhaps more influence with the Minister for Finance than has the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to use that influence in the coming year in seeing that those schemes that are partly done and those other schemes that for years have been pigeon-holed in his Department are carried through. Some of these schemes have been lying there for two or three years.  With the exception of the few cases in which I know that sufficient money was not provided inside a particular year for the completion of these works, I have nothing but admiration for the work that has been done.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary to continue going around the country and keep an eye on the works that are being carried out.  This will tend to make the officials more careful in the supervision of the works and it will also encourage the workers to give more value for the money that is being spent.</P>
    <P>The small amount that is to be allocated to my area, and I am sure to the other areas, this year will give about four weeks' work to a very limited number of able-bodied unemployed. It does not cope sufficiently with the unemployment problem that exists in the country.  I hope before the end of the financial year the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to persuade the Minister for Finance to provide money for schemes long pigeon-holed in the Departments of Local Government and Public Health and in the Board of Works.  I dare say the Parliamentary Secretary will tell the House that he has ten times the number of schemes which would absorb ten times the amount of money that is available.  What the Parliamentary Secretary probably is thinking of is that he would keep some of the work for the following years.  That is a bad policy.  I do not see why these schemes should be pigeon-holed for a number of years.  If the money is to be made available at all it should be spent as soon as possible in the carrying out of these schemes.</P>
    <P>There is one word that I want to say in conclusion.  There is an impression here that the carrying out of housing schemes by the boards of <Col N="553" /> health in the rural areas has taken a good many people off the employment exchanges.  I have made a careful survey of the situation so far as work carried out by the boards of health in my area is concerned.  I find, unfortunately, that the boards of health in my area and in some of the adjoining areas are too much disposed to give out these housing contracts to contractors who build only one or two houses.  Now these people build houses in their spare time with the assistance of members of their own family.  I think if the Parliamentary Secretary would make a careful examination of the amount of employment given by that class of contractor in the building of houses, he will find that a very little portion of the labour has been taken from the employment exchanges.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will urge the boards of health, when giving contracts to give them to men who will be prepared to take a greater number off the employment exchanges, and thus give considerably more employment than those at present engaged in that work.  If he will see that the building of houses is given to experienced building contractors, he will find that many more men will be taken off the labour exchanges.  In that way more employment will be provided for the able-bodied who at present need unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I would like also to press the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to take up this question with the boards of health.  I am satisfied that these contractors who have been building one or two houses are (1)  not giving good value for the money, and (2) are not making any inroad on unemployment in the area, or any attempt to provide employment for the people at the present time most in need of it.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give an increased grant towards the type of works which I know are pigeon-holed in his Department, and which would give employment to many who prefer work as against receiving unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the <Col N="554" /> Minister for Finance will not pay much attention to the plea Deputy Davin has so eloquently put to the Parliamentary Secretary to increase this grant to the amount necessary to make a serious inroad on the relief of unemployment. Deputy Davin has admitted that the unemployment problem has got worse. I think he said the position was definitely worse in his own county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the experience also of Deputies in other counties.  The leader of the Labour Party on one occasion said that if the unemployment position was not cured, he would have the Ministry out in 24 hours.  The position has lasted much longer than 24 hours; the problem is still there, and so are the Ministry.  I would like to pay the Parliamentary Secretary this tribute, that I believe with the money he had at his disposal he made an honest attempt to do good work, as honourable an attempt as anybody in the circumstances could make.  So far as I know, the Parliamentary Secretary has tried to do all he has done without seeking any political advantage whatever.  I think he has made a serious attempt to cope with the situation in the country.  He travelled around the country to see for himself how the money could be expended to the best advantage. Unfortunately, the amount placed at his disposal was not adequate to cope with the unemployment position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see, the men who will get work on these relief schemes will be the men who are now on the dole. There are many other needy people in the country who might be made eligible for this work.  There are, for instance, many small farmers who are now hard hit.  Deputy Davin has referred to the conditions of distress of many small farmers who might be made eligible for relief work.  I want to refer to the case of a man who got a holding of land, and I think it will illustrate how difficult it is for men placed in such a position to get work at the present time.  A man in my <Col N="555" /> county was given ten acres when land was being distributed.  That was about five or six years ago.  About three weeks ago he came to me to know how he could get permission to sell that land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was unfortunate for this man anyhow, because he found himself in the position that he was neither a farmer nor a labourer.  He could not live on his ten acres, and he said he would be glad to get rid of it. He cannot get any work now on local schemes.  Before he got the land he usually got work in a quarry or on the roads, but now because he has ten acres he is regarded as a farmer, and he can get no work outside.  I would like to see men like him made eligible for this relief work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Haslett that this matter requires very serious consideration and I quite agree with Deputy Davin that the system of issuing relief money without getting some return in the way of work for it is not a wise system.  It would be much better if we could provide work and expend the relief money on it, and I am sure the labourers themselves would he more satisfied.  We have the anomalous position existing that many public bodies have useful works to be done but they cannot provide the money to have them carried out and yet large sums go by way of relief without any return being obtained. The farming community are in the position that they have lots of useful work to do, but because of the depressed conditions at the moment they cannot employ men to do it. <Col N="556" /> Many fields require to be drained and hundreds of fences could be erected, but this work cannot be tackled because the farmers have not the means to employ labourers to do that work.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to provide a solution for this huge problem.  All this time we have large numbers of men receiving money and doing nothing in return.  I do not intend to convey that I grudge those men the money they receive.  I should like to see some national scheme devised under which a local authority might be able to employ numbers of those men who are now on the dole on useful works, providing portion of their wages, relief money making up the balance.  It might be possible to promote a scheme in which some of those men might be made available for farming work.  Of course the farmers at the moment could not provide the ordinary wage because they have not got the money, but the scheme might be so arranged that portion of the wages could be met by the farmers.  There is plenty of work to be done, and unfortunately there is plenty of money now being spent without any definite return being given for it.</P>
    <P>If we could employ the relief money on useful works throughout the country instead of giving it to men as it is now being given, it would be a step forward in the right direction.  I am sure it would be possible to devise some scheme of that kind, and, if necessary, a commission might be set up to give the matter serious consideration.  Land improvement would lead to better conditions when the prosperous times come, as I hope they will some day.</P>

      <P>I admit that it is not easy to arrive at a solution of this problem.  A solution will not be reached in an hour or a day.  I believe that something on the lines suggested by Deputy Haslett could eventually be worked out for the general benefit.  I do not know if provision is now being made for drainage, but I would like to see as much money as possible expended on small drainage works. <Col N="557" /> Practically all the money put into a drainage scheme represents labour.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that big drainage schemes would be well outside the limit of the money you have to expend.  What I submit is that in the small drainage schemes the bulk of the money would go on labour. Where possible, I should like to see Deputies bringing these things to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am sure he will seriously consider them.  I would prefer that such work as would be done would employ nearly all labour, and in that way such schemes would have an advantage over housing schemes, because the money would go almost entirely to labourers employed on the work.  I wind up by saying that the only thing one can criticise in this Relief Vote is that it is inadequate.  We all regret the necessity for such Votes, and while we point out that this Vote is inadequate we do not envy the Government in having to find money for everything.  I do not believe that any money that the Government could find would make any serious inroads on the unemployment numbers until there is a better economic position in the country.  I do not want to develop that now.  Until such time as there is a better economic position we, unfortunately, will have unemployment with us.  The House cannot finance it, and I am not sure that other sources of relief can be found.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is open to receive from any Deputy, in an impartial spirit, any suggestions for the expenditure of this money.  Let us hope that the necessity for these grants will soon have passed away, and on that note I should like to end.</P>

      <P>I know that schemes that have been initiated by local authorities have been held up because of the inability of the Local Government Department to subsidise them. It has been accepted as part of the policy of the Local Government Department that they would give at least one-third of the amount necessary to carry out sewerage schemes and waterworks. I know that the Wexford County Board of Health have sent up a scheme involving the expenditure of nearly £50,000.  They have put on a penny rate in order to enable them to provide this money for sewerage and waterworks in the county.  When that rate was put on it was stated by people advocating the expenditure that a grant of at least one-third would be available from Government sources.  If that grant is not forthcoming now, those who initiated a scheme of that kind, and did immense work for the purpose of starting schemes of local sewerage and waterworks, would be in for a very hard time of it next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the people who would be employed on these works will be people in receipt of unemployment insurance. I can quite understand the convenience of that from the Ministry's point of view.  They will take for granted that the man who was in receipt of unemployment assistance has had his case established.  I understand, therefore, the position adopted by the Ministry, and the logic of that position.  But in many cases there are married men and single men who have made claims upon the Unemployment Assistance Fund 12 months ago, and have not got any decision yet.  These people are infinitely worse off than those whose cases are established.  The position was admitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce some time ago when he said that the machinery under the old Act was not sufficient to have all cases heard.  These people are certainly cases of great hardship <Col N="559" /> and some method should be adopted whereby they could get their cases dealt with more expeditiously, and I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary would be unsympathetic in that direction.  I understand his point of view in getting men drawn from the unemployment assistance. It is quite logical; their cases have been established; but there are other people who have no grade at all yet.  There are cases where a man was only granted 1/- per week and where the assessment was based on something that never existed.  In many cases, after nine or 12 months, the allowance to a man for 1/- a week is raised to the maximum that he is entitled to, but in such cases there is the hardship of the long wait.</P>

      <P>Yes, but it takes a very long time for a man who has only got 1/- a week to establish his case. Then again, there are busybodies who, through jealousy, report people as being at work of some kind or another. Immediately an anonymous letter goes in the man's benefit is stopped.  There is an investigation ordered, and it may take two or three months before a man gets back his benefit.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, although this is not in his province, to ask the Department of Industry and Commerce to speed up cases of that kind. I know in some cases the thing is done for spite.  I think when a letter of that kind is sent in anonymously it should be taken with a certain amount of suspicion and a man should not be allowed to suffer.  I do not think that the Minister can dismiss this matter by saying it is only those that are in receipt of unemployment assistance that will get work under relief schemes. Like Deputy Davin I am of opinion that the money which the Parliamentary Secretary is asking for is not half sufficient to deal with the problem.  There are plenty works requiring to be done in rural and urban Ireland, and I think it would be money well spent if you give local authorities, and especially those prepared to spend money on schemes of sewerage and waterworks, such subsidies as will enable the necessary <Col N="560" /> work to be done and thereby help to solve the dual problem of sanitation and unemployment.</P>

      <P>Whether officially or otherwise, I cannot say, but there is a general impression amongst the members of the House that the Parliamentary Secretary is the person in the Ministry who has been charged with producing Government schemes for the relief of unemployment.  I thought that he would have taken this opportunity of telling the House what the Government's plans were to relieve unemployment. In reply to a question which I put to him a few days ago, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that plans were at present under consideration for the expenditure of money in certain directions which it was thought would take a considerable number of unemployed persons off the employment exchanges.  I suggest that he ought now to tell the Dáil what are the Government's specific proposals in this direction.  Instead, however, of indicating to the House what the Government's plans are, the Parliamentary Secretary has come here and asked for approval of this Estimate as if it were a casual, routine matter, and as if we had not the serious unemployment problem which there is in this country to-day.  According to the latest figures of unemployed registered at employment exchanges, there are 103,000 people seeking unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that figure will probably be increased to 130,000 in the course of the next few weeks.  It is only being kept down to 103,000 <Col N="561" /> because of the fact that we have only just come out of an Employment Period Order, and that the rise in unemployment consequent on the cancellation of the Order has not yet had time to show itself at employment exchanges.  We may take it, therefore, that even subjecting unemployment to the test&mdash;and it is a pretty severe test&mdash;imposed under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, we have 130,000 unemployed men and women&mdash;men and women available for work; men and women anxious to obtain work, but men and women who, under the existing system of society, are unable to secure work.  Since society, as at present organised, cannot utilise their services, they are condemned to endeavour to exist at the miserable rates of benefit provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what are the Government's specific proposals for dealing with that serious unemployment problem.  One hundred and thirty thousand people will be registered at the employment exchanges within the next couple of weeks.  When their wives and children are taken into consideration that figure will become enormously swollen.  If we survey the problem after having made allowance for their wives and dependents, it will be found that we have got in this country an army of unemployed people &mdash;an unemployed State within a State. That is the serious problem which is confronting the Ministry to-day.  I know it is quite true that because of the existence of the Unemployment Assistance Act a considerable number of people are now registering for employment and are now claiming unemployment assistance benefit who formerly did not come to the employment exchanges, in order to seek for benefit or in order to seek for work.  In the first instance, there was no benefit available for them.  In the second instance, their pilgrimage to the employment exchanges was, from their point of view, an extremely unprofitable and disappointing one, but the fact remains that we still have <Col N="562" /> an unemployment problem indicated by 130,000 unemployed people, who satisfy the rigid and rigorous tests imposed by the Unemployment Assistance Act.  We may take it that those people are unemployed, that they are available for work, and are unable to obtain work.  Now the Parliamentary Secretary comes to the Dáil and asks for approval for an Estimate of £150,000 &mdash; £150,000 to be divided amongst 130,000 unemployed persons, sufficient only to give each a little more than £1 for one week only.  That is the extent of the provision which has been made for the relief of unemployment by this Estimate.  I think we are entitled to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what are the Government's proposals for dealing seriously with this problem.  The present Estimate is an indication of the hotch-potch method of dealing with unemployment which has been an all too common feature of administrations in this country.</P>
    <P>In asking the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what are the Government's proposals, we are not being needlessly curious.  It is not so long ago since the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that the Government had plans which would put every idle man to work.  The Minister then thought there was a danger that we would not get enough idle men in this country, and the Minister for Defence, speaking afterwards, said that we ought to be glad to have idle men in this country so that we could utilise them for the vast schemes of reconstruction which the Government had in mind.  Even if we are not satisfied with those two important announcements from two Ministers, we have the statement of the President that in his opinion unemployment ought not to exist in this country, and that there was no need for it.  I think the President was right.  I think the other two statements were optimistic ones, especially in the light of the subsequent activities on the part of the Government, but there really is no reason why we should have an unemployment problem here, if we only had the courage to organise the nation and organise the unemployed in such a way that their <Col N="563" /> services could be utilised to develop the resources of our country, the industrial and agricultural possibilities of which have so far been only barely scratched.  Instead of telling us in what way the optimistic prophecies of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were going to be realised, instead of telling us in what way they were taking steps to bring into actuality the dream of the President that unemployment need not exist here, the Parliamentary Secretary comes to the House and asks for a vote of £150,000, which, as I said before, is going to mean only a little more than £1 each in one week for the vast army of persons, numbering about 130,000, who are at present registered at employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that almost every conceivable kind of public work in the country had already been done, and that the difficulty now was to find new schemes of public works on which unemployed persons could be put to work.  On the contrary, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there is a vast untapped field of public works which is available for utilisation as a means of absorbing the unemployed persons into productive employment. Public Health works afford a very wide field for the activities of the State.  Local authorities throughout the country could be compelled to proceed with sewerage and water schemes, in some cases where they are doing nothing, in other cases where they are not proceeding with sufficient alacrity, and in other cases where they do not seem to have any real appreciation of what modern life ought to be.  There are vast possibilities and an urgent need for road reconstruction throughout the country, because, although much has been done in the matter of improving the surface of our roads, much still remains to be done in the matter of widening them.  Much needs to be done to make our roads capable of standing up to modern traffic conditions.  Much needs to be done in the way of taking off dangerous bends and corners. There is need also for considerable acceleration in house building activities. <Col N="564" /> As the Parliamentary Secretary must know, a number of local authorities seem to be oblivious of their responsibility to house the people properly.  Many of them seem to be unaware of the benefits which are made available to them under the Housing Act of 1932.</P>
    <P>Similarly the Parliamentary Secretary must know that in the matter of land distribution and the improvement and division of estates, there is a vast field of potentially useful work, not merely in the breaking up of randies and putting people to work but also as a means of taking off the labour market many persons who would be taken off if they could be set on economic holdings.  There is need for cleaning up towns and for the provision of town parks; there is need for the construction of footpaths; there is need for improvement of graveyards; and there is need for the widening of streets in towns and cities and creating arteries for traffic which are very necessary under modern traffic conditions.  In respect of the planting of our timber-denuded lands, there are again enormous possibilities which, if fully availed of, promise to give in time a substantial return to the nation at a period when, according to the experts, there is likely to be a world shortage of timber.  In the sphere of drainage, we have a country which lends itself to the expenditure of vast sums of money in respect of the drainage of swampy land and the consequent improvement of lands for tillage and pastoral purposes which would be advantageous to the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if the Government have any concrete proposals for dealing with these vast schemes of public works which demand attention to-day and what precisely the Government intend to do in order to absorb into productive employment the large army of unemployed.  In my opinion, the utilisation of the unemployed on large scale schemes of public works will do much to improve the amenities of life, particularly in towns and rural areas, and, at the <Col N="565" /> same time, create valuable national assets which will be of benefit to the whole community.  I have got a suspicion, however, and I think the reluctance of the Parliamentary Secretary to disclose the Government's plans for the relief of unemployment gives colour to my suspicion, that the Government have now got into a state of mind in which they think it is cheaper to allow the unemployed to draw unemployment assistance than to put them into productive employment on large scale schemes of public works. The Government seem to me to have become obsessed with the idea that the relief of unemployment through the expenditure of £1,000,000 per annum under the Unemployment Assistance Act is a cheaper way of dealing with unemployment than by utilising the energies, the brains, the brawn and the ability of the unemployed to create the valuable national asset which would be created if these people were put to work on large scale schemes of public works.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong in that suspicion, I am willing to be converted by a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary to the effect that the Government have some definite plans for taking people off the employment exchanges and putting them to work at reasonable rates of wages instead of the miserable pittance which many of them are compelled to accept to-day in the form of unemployment assistance benefit.  The expenditure of £150,000 will probably do something in many areas temporarily to relieve the scourge of unemployment.  It will do something to alleviate the hardships on men, women and children who do not know what it is to get a decent week's wages for many weeks in the year, and, to that extent, anything that brings even a very ephemeral ray of hope into homes such as those must, I suppose, have the benediction and good will of all parties in this House.  The Parliamentary Secretary, however, should not be under the impression that the expenditure of £150,000 on a scheme of that kind is making an adequate contribution to the relief of the unemployment problem.  It is not making <Col N="566" /> any such contribution and it is time that these schemes which the Government had in mind when in opposition were now put into practice, and we ought to know definitely in what direction the Government is working in its efforts to relieve the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin stated that in his constituency there was a serious unemployment problem.  I think the same can be said by every Deputy who represents a rural constituency.  One has only to go through the towns and villages, and through the countryside, to see the enormous congregation of men who are craving an opportunity to work and hoping that, in some way or another, some relief scheme will come to the area which may enable them to secure a few weeks' work, to be followed by a long period of unemployment, and the same cycle of hoping that a relief scheme will eventually find its way into the area.  That, as I said before, is a hotch-potch method of dealing with unemployment.  It is an inadequate method of dealing with it, and the Government ought to take their courage in their hands and say definitely what their proposals are for dealing with that serious problem.  I give the Parliamentary Secretary credit for having good intentions in this respect.  I give him credit for having applied himself with zeal to the task before him, but I am sorry I cannot give either him or the Government credit for having dealt with the unemployment problem in the courageous way we were entitled to expect them to deal with it in view of previous declarations by members of the present Ministry.</P>
    <P>Here we are asked to vote on an Estimate of £150,000 for the relief of unemployment, and there has been a singular reticence on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to telling us the Government's precise proposals for dealing with that problem. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what the Government's proposals are; I hope he will be able to tell us that the Government have at last made up their mind to finance a scheme of large scale public works, which, in my opinion, is one of the best ways of alleviating the <Col N="567" /> present problem.  Not merely will it alleviate the problem, but it will create national assets in addition, and will give many unemployed people a decent income which few of those now registered for employment have had for a very long time.</P>
    <P>In any proposals submitted to this House for dealing with unemployment in a courageous way, the Government can be assured of the support of every Party and of every Deputy in the House who wants to see that problem dealt with vigorously and courageously, but my great fear in all this matter, is that the Government here are merely adopting methods which have been adopted without success by Governments in other countries.  This Government, however, used to talk at one time of being a radical Government, and, in their wilder moments, some members of the Party used to talk of its being a revolutionary Party.  Let us have some evidence of radicalism and some evidence of revolution in their proposals for dealing with unemployment. There will be abundant support in this House for any proposals which will make war on the poverty, misery and destitution which many unemployed people are compelled to tolerate to-day, and, paradoxical though it is, compelled to tolerate in a country which, if it were properly organised, is capable of giving a decent standard of living to every man and woman in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Select Committee be set up to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government on Saorstat agricultural produce and to report on ways and means whereby the burden of the economic war will be equitably borne by all sections of the community; <Col N="568" /> That the Committee consist of eleven members who shall be nominated by the Committee of Selection;</P>
    <P>That the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion, I may say that I am sorry that we have not a bigger attendance in the House.  We have not even as full a House as we had an hour or so ago when we were debating the affairs of Abyssinia and Italy.  I am sorry that Deputy Norton is leaving after his eloquent address on the evils of unemployment.  There can be no evil without a cause, and one of the principal causes of unemployment at the present time is the subject matter of this motion.  I do not intend to go into details or to give figures that have been given a dozen times over on the incidence of the economic war, for the reason that a certain common ground, broadly speaking, has been arrived at. There has been substantial agreement here that when our Government ceased to make payments of about £5,000,000 a year on foot of the Ultimate Financial Settlement the British said that they would collect them, and set about doing so.  They published returns subsequently claiming that they had collected them.  The figures they gave have not been disputed by our Government. In fact, they have been accepted by it.  It does not appear that our Government is doing any book-keeping in the matter to see whether the British claim has been satisfied by the produce of those tariffs, whether it has been exceeded or has not been satisfied. On the whole, it has been accepted that the British have collected those tariffs.</P>
    <P>Figures have been published showing that the huge amount of £4,500,000, with the exception of about £100,000, has been collected off agricultural produce.  If that sum of £100,000 were closely analysed, it would, I think, be found that it too was indirectly collected off agricultural produce, so that it is substantially correct to say that agriculture is bearing the whole burden of the economic war.  That has been accepted substantially in debate by the President as common ground.</P>
    <P>There is a bit of a divergence after <Col N="569" /> that.  It is claimed by the Government that considerable help is being given for the growing of wheat and beet, and for the production of peat which they claim is, roughly speaking, an agricultural product.  I am not going to differ with the Government on that point. The encouragement of wheat and beet growing was part of the Government's agricultural policy before the economic war, but to put that policy into force would require inducements by way of prices or bounties, or something of that nature.  I do not differ with the Government on that.  In fact, I strongly favour the growing of these crops.  My point is that to encourage their growing inducements would have to be offered.  If we never had the economic war, and that the growing of these crops was considered to be good national economy, as I believe it is, then inducements would have to be held out to grow them, inducements at least equal to those which are now being held out in order to give the people engaged in that particular kind of economy an equal return.  Therefore, the financial help offered as a necessary inducement for a change in the agricultural economy cannot be taken as in any way compensating for the losses sustained by the economic war.  Of course, agriculture has also been called upon to bear the cost of the industrial revival.  It is quite right that it should, but then the burden has proved to be too great on agriculture in its present weakened state. I do not want to develop unnecessarily that line of argument.  I merely want to show the common ground that has been arrived at.</P>
    <P>There is, as I have said, a divergence of view.  I admit that.  I propose to deal briefly with that particular point.  The Government may think that they are right.  Their views differ from ours on that, but they ought to give us credit for honestly holding the contrary view.  I submit that the matter is of sufficient importance to warrant investigation. We are asking the Government to set up this Select Committee to investigate that divergence of opinion.  We guarantee to put up the case for agriculture. <Col N="570" /> If we fail to make our case before the Committee, then we will be silenced, and no more will be heard of this matter in the House, certainly not from that angle.  There is ample evidence of the belief held throughout the country that agriculture is bearing the whole strain of the economic war, that it is becoming impoverished and bankrupt as a result of that, while in the case of subsidiary industries that are being financed and nursed by the State, you have thousands growing rich out of them.  If it were established beyond doubt who is bearing the loss, and I think that is what the Government is afraid of&mdash;our submission is that agriculture is and that we will establish that if the Select Committee is set up&mdash;then the whole matter would be brought to a head, and brought to a head quickly, because no longer could anybody be taunted with the question: &ldquo;Do you want to pay?&rdquo; If we got the whole claim in the morning, we would have lost in the last three years more than all we are asking would be worth to us.  The remission of the annuities in the morning would not compensate for what we have lost. There was a time, perhaps, when a settlement could have been made, and the Government could have claimed a victory.  The best they can do now is to have a quick settlement, so as not to make matters worse than they found them.  One section of the community has to bear all that loss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton told us a moment ago that roads require to be made, that land requires to be drained, and that the unemployed could be engaged on that work.  Deputy Norton, however, does not realise this important fact&mdash; that land that does not require to be drained is not paying its way at present.  How would it pay the State to drain land which, at best, would be second or third rate land, if first rate land requiring no drainage, is not paying its way?  I do not want the Government to accept these statements. They will not accept them, I know, but will try to contradict them. For two or three years, we have been making that case, and the Government has been contradicting it.  To carry on <Col N="571" /> a controversy like that is pure waste of time.  It is not in that sense that Deputy Kent and I have introduced this motion.  We do not want the motion to be considered in that way. I am not going to make a case in detail to show that agriculture is bearing the whole cost, but I assert that.  I am not going to prove it, because I do not want the discussion on this motion to develop into a controversy on that question.  Government Deputies who have their ears to the ground know that farmer-supporters of the Ministry have gone to the Government and asked them to relieve them of the burden of the economic war.  They have told them that they will bear their fair share without squealing, but that they will not bear any more.  I am not going into detail to prove that the farmers are bearing the whole burden, but that is held by the farming community.  I do not want to feature that, but I do urge that it is sufficiently important to make the Government sit up and take notice.  When such a large section of the community feel that they have this big grievance, it is worth while investigating it.  What I want to establish is a case for investigation rather than the proposition that the farmers are bearing the whole cost.  Whether any particular section is bearing the whole cost cannot be settled here or on a platform.  The claim can be made, but it cannot be settled by controversy. It can be investigated by a Select Committee, and the case I want to make is for Select Committee investigation. I submit that the farmers have a <i>prima facie</i> case on which to base an investigation, and it is for that investigation I am asking.  That is what prompted this motion.  The Government have held investigations for various classes of public servants. They held an inquiry&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; six or seven months ago, into the grievances of the busmen and tramway men.  When any industrial trouble occurs in the city, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is prepared&mdash; and quite rightly&mdash;to set up machinery to investigate the cause of the trouble. <Col N="572" /> Why not set up the machinery here suggested, or any similar machinery which may suggest itself to the Government, to investigate a grievance which is held by farmers throughout the country without regard to political affiliations.  If the farmer fails to make a case, his mouth will be shut and, even if he is suffering, it can only be said that he suffers equally with the rest of the community and, therefore, has no grievance.</P>
    <P>If the Government reject this motion, I suggest that they will do so for one reason and one reason only&mdash;that they are afraid to face the issue, that they know the case for the fanners is unanswerable. They know the farmer has been cheated and robbed.  They know the economic war has failed. They know that if they had a so-called win now and England said they would not collect the annuities any more, would remove the tariffs and have free trade between the two countries, Fianna Fáil would have lost the economic war because the country has lost more in the last three years than that win would be worth.  If the Government reject this motion, it is obvious that they do not want to get the matter out of the region of controversy. While it is in the region of controversy, they can say one thing and others can say another and only those people who are interested will investigate the matter and ascertain who is right and who is wrong.  The man in the street will say that it is only a political wrangle.  If the Government think they have a 50-50 chance, or even a sporting chance, of being declared right, why not have this investigation by a Select Committee?  The farmers are not afraid to face investigation because they know what the result of the&mdash;investigation will be.  Deputy Norton, who has always voted with his Party, against motions of this kind, gave us a long lecture a moment ago on unemployment.  He spoke about standards of living and that sort of thing.  Within our resources, we would agree with that.  The farming community are 50 per cent. or a little more of the entire population of the country. Their sons and daughters have grown to be men and women during the last <Col N="573" /> three or four years, and as there is no emigration and no resources left to help them into other walks of life, they are left without an outlet.  Their whole time is given working on the farms. What remuneration do they get? None.  Slave labour is the lot of these young men and women, who cannot escape out of the trap in which they have been caught, and who must work at home for nothing, except the poor fare they eat.  They are being robbed by this economic war.  They are paying the price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton and his Party never have a word to say for these potential wage earners.  If a standard of living and of wages commensurate with what trade unions rightly demand in other trades were insisted upon for these sons and daughters, farmers could exist here.  If the economic war becomes acute, perhaps it would then be all the better as it might be settled. I do not want to make the case that agriculture is bearing the whole burden, but I am submitting that a <i>prima facie</i> case is sufficiently strong to have the matter investigated.  The issue at stake is sufficiently important to be investigated.  The number of people affected by the depression in agriculture warrants investigation as well as the importance of agriculture in the economic life of the nation.  I submit that if the Government refuses to set up this select committee, to investigate the matter, the only conclusion to be drawn is that they are doing so with a guilty conscience, and are afraid to face a free and a full investigation because they know how badly they would come out of it.</P>

      <P>A good deal of argument can be advanced in favour of this motion.  Many of the motions discussed in this House, no matter where they start, usually end on the economic war or get mixed up in it.  As one Party deals with one side, and another Party with another side, we do not seem to get any nearer each other. There is a good deal of common sense in this motion.  It asks that a select committee composed of all sections of <Col N="574" /> the House should in a calm and resolute manner examine the position, and see the implications of this economic dispute on the farming community.  It is evident that the views expressed have been coloured by political affiliations. For instance, it was stated by members of the Government Party that cattle were not as dear in the Border counties as in the Free State. That was told us in all seriousness. Of course, any one residing in the neighbourhood of Northern Ireland knows that the position is entirely the other way about.  Many things could be usefully brought out in this discussion to see how far this economic dispute has affected the farming community. As agriculture is the chief industry here, perhaps the effects of the economic dispute are slowest to be seen upon it.  If the same hardship was put on a certain industry, that industry would be wiped out in far less than the three years during which we have been engaged in this dispute.  I want to give credit where credit is due.  The Government, in proportion to the resources at their command&mdash; resources which are derived from the State&mdash;has helped.  One does not envy the Minister for Finance in having to find the money to finance all the schemes introduced for the purpose of alleviating the burden on agriculture. A great many people think because certain bonuses are given and certain contributions made towards the industry that that is meeting the demands upon agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of matters to which I would like to direct the attention of the House in support of this motion asking that the question should be inquired into by a committee representative of all Parties.  Take the production end, which was mentioned by a member of the Labour Party.  Deputy Davin dealt with the price of oats.  If I was not engaged in agriculture and heard Deputy Davin speaking about the low price of oats, 5/4 a cwt., I would ask: &ldquo;Is not that an argument to get cheap feeding stuffs?&rdquo; What is the real position? Take the meal mixture that we use largely at present.  I have occasion to meet men from Northern Ireland, and I am sometimes in Northern Ireland, <Col N="575" /> so that it is no compliment to me to know how prices so there.  Monaghan as my town and it compared very favourably with towns in Northern Ireland before the economic dispute commenced.  Last week a producer in Northern Ireland told me that he had bought maize at £4 12s. 6d. per ton. I looked up the prices and I found that was about correct.  That price or a fraction more might be taken as what we would pay in Monaghan. What does the meal mixture cost?  A farmer who produces the oats according to the Minister's plan will get 5/4 per cwt.  It will be said that is a low price.  Take 5/4 and take, say, 30 per cent. of that as going into the meal mixture.  As maize costs £4 12s. 6d. a ton, that would work out at 4/10 per cwt., against 7/3 which we are paying for meal mixtures.  That is a question which the average Deputy does not take cognisance of.  I am not out to have a slap at the millers.  Possibly they are getting a reasonable profit when they pay freight on the oats, pay for the dehulling, and for the extra trouble.  Perhaps that is in or about the right price.  The oats that farmers grow must be sold to the millers, if they want it in the mixture, and the mixture in proportion is fairly high, costing 7/3 per cwt.</P>
    <P>That is the production end, but what is the selling end?  That forms the ration for pigs together with some waste potatoes and stuff of that sort. The maximum control price for the highest grade of pig to-day is 48/-per cwt., and when the deduction is taken off that it works out at 43/7.  We buy the meal mixture at 7/3, as against 4/10, what it should be, and we are selling our pigs at 43/7 as against 56/-, what it should be normally.  I give this as one instance of where this policy is leading us.</P>
    <P>Take the other commodity which we largely produce, namely, beef.  Last week in the Dublin market I saw two bullocks of a good useful commercial weight sold at 17/- per cwt.  That left nothing to the producers, needless to say.  Take another item, which we cannot attribute altogether to the economic dispute&mdash;the item of coal. <Col N="576" /> The effect of our new Transport Act enters largely into the increased price of that commodity.  The price of coal has risen in the period from August to November about 8/6.  Then the ordinary household expenses of the farmer are also mounting up.  There is the item of flour at 16/6 per cwt. and sugar at 4/4 per stone.  These all impose heavy costs on the farmers, and the price we are getting for our produce owing to the economic dispute does not enable us to meet them.  I do not want to take up the attitude of always crying about our condition, but this is a question which vitally affects agriculture.  The resources of the country are being drained.  That is a thing that has not been brought home to the average Dublin Deputy, and it is a matter which could be reasonably investigated by a committee comprised of members of this House.  I had not intended to speak on the motion, but I think that the information which it would elicit would be very useful to the House and it might lead us to an appreciation of the difficulties with which the farmers have to contend.  I therefore support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>In bringing forward this motion we did not introduce it with any vindictive motives or for propaganda purposes.  After three years of the economic war which has been waged against the farmers of this country by means of the penal tariffs imposed by the British Government, I consider that it is time that a full investigation should be made to consider how best relief can be afforded to the farming community.  They have borne the expenses of this economic war for the past three years.  It has imposed a considerable burden on their shoulders and has involved themselves and their families in considerable loss, notwithstanding all that has been done by way of subsidies for crops such as beet and wheat.  I am 100 per cent. in agreement with the agricultural policy of the Government, but when you tot up all the expenses of production of beet and wheat, on which we are now largely depending, there is very little left to enable the producer to buy the necessaries of life for himself and his family, not to speak of giving them a decent living or education.  It has been <Col N="577" /> said here on different occasions that this country is in a very prosperous condition and that we have industrial concerns in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere which can produce an encouraging balance sheet every six months and pay a big dividend to their shareholders.  That, in itself, is a blind representation as far as the circumstances of the farmers are concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who are farmers come up here with glowing accounts of how prosperous the farmers are down the country, but that is a very false and misleading picture.  If we are to depend largely on the agricultural policy of the Government, and if we are to pursue continual tillage on our farm year after year, in a very short time the soil of this country will become as poor as the proverbial church mouse.  You must have cattle housed and fed in the winter time to consume the hay and the straw which have been grown on the farm.  You must have farmyard manure to enrich the soil and to produce a good crop.  But how does the cattle industry stand at the present moment? No later than Monday I saw myself in the town of Fermoy one of the largest cattle fairs ever held there, but the cattle were unsaleable.  Farmers who were anxious to dispose of their stocks had to take them back home again. These people were going around the town with an air of despondency.  They did not wish to be seen by the shopkeepers, to whom perhaps they owed money which they had hoped to pay by the sale of their cattle.  I, for one, hold that we do not owe one farthing to the British Government as regards a tribute.  I maintain that the soil of this country belongs to the Irish people without rent or render or without any tribute to any Government but our own.  I think the Government would be very well advised to set up this Commission of Inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be proof that the farmers are in a deplorable state at present, notwithstanding all that has been said about conspiracies, which perhaps have been set up in some counties, to defeat the ends of justice, and to get rid of their obligations, which I have never approved of and will never approve of.  We must all remember <Col N="578" /> that agriculture is the mainstay of this country.  If the agricultural community go down, and are not able to meet their obligations, perhaps through no fault of their own, this House will be shaken to its very foundations.  If the industry which we all wish to foster and encourage goes down, the industries which the Government are building up at present will have a very poor chance of existence.</P>
    <P>I second this motion moved by Deputy Belton in all sincerity.  I have always advocated the cause of the farmers from my early childhood.  In the days of the land war I suffered long terms of imprisonment in the county gaol in Cork under the Coercion Acts brought in during the Balfour régime.  I never deviated one iota from the cause which I advocated then and which I advocate now, that the tenant farmers of this country should have the right to live and to rear and educate their families in a proper manner.  As to the seizures of the farmers' cattle, I know it is painful to members of the Government, as it is painful to myself and to every member of the community, after years of struggling to bring the agricultural community to a prosperous and happy state, to see them now on the down grade.  As one who fought against landlordism and for the upliftment of the tenant farmers and who now sees the Government going round and seizing the people's property and taking their means of living from them, I think it is time for such a deplorable state of affairs to end.  I think the Government would be well-advised to accept this motion and to bring those others who are in a better monetary position into the front line trenches in this economic war and relieve the farming community from being in the front line trenches which they have held for the past three years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this motion is not brought forward in any vindictive spirit or for the purpose of political propaganda.  It has been tabled to assist the Government to find a solution and to end the deplorable state of affairs which exists in the country. If the motion is accepted by the Government it will be the means of <Col N="579" /> bringing people of different political views together.  It will be the means of uniting the Irish people and of putting up a stronger demand to the English Government to remove the penal tariffs and thus give an opportunity to the farming community to exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervene in this discussion to clear up any misconception which exists in the minds of some farmer Deputies.  I am supporting the motion.  I cannot see any valid reason why the Government should not accept it.  It asks that a committee be set up, consisting of members from different parts of the House to inquire into the matters set forth on the Order Paper.  But the misconception which I fear may arise is due to some of the speeches to which I have just listened.  One would think that the only persons who have suffered and are suffering as a result of this economic struggle are the farmers.  I admit that for a considerable period the farmers were certainly in the front line trenches, and were bearing the brunt of the battle all along the line.  But now the position is changed.  Not alone are the farmers in the front line trenches, but the working-class people in the towns and cities are also in the front line trenches.  After the introduction of the last Budget we found that tea, sugar, butter, coal and tobacco were taxed, which meant that the ordinary working-class person in the cities and towns had to pay anything from 4/6 to 9/- per week extra for the commodities which he used and which are absolute necessities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmer Deputies must remember that a coal-cattle pact was established between this country and Great Britain as a result of which everybody in the community&mdash;and when I say everybody I include some farmers, but not all of them, the people in the cities have not bogs available in which to get turf&mdash;has to pay 5/- per ton extra for coal.  According to some persons who are in a position to judge we are not getting the best British coal.  From certain information at my disposal I can say that we will be <Col N="580" /> faced in a short time with a still further increase in the price of coal. I have it on very excellent authority that after the general election across the Channel certain concessions will be made which, in effect, will mean that coal will go up by another 4/- per ton.  I never pretend to be a prophet but I am giving that information for what it is worth to Ministers. I deeply sympathise with the farmers in their struggle and in the fight they are carrying on, because I feel that, with very few exceptions, the commodities which they produce are sold in the market for less money than ever before, the exceptions being wheat and beet and, possibly, tobacco. Almost everything, however, that the farmer has to buy for the use of his household has gone up in price.  That, certainly, is a condition of things which I hope the Government will not long allow to operate in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, I feel that there is a certain sense of fair play in some of the Ministers of the present Government, and I cannot see, as I said in my opening remarks, any valid or substantial objection to the establishment of this Committee.  One useful result, at any rate, that a committee composed of members of the various sections of the House would have, is that it would bring to bear on this matter a sounder judgment, perhaps, than the Ministers themselves can exercise at the present moment, because, there is no doubt about it, they look at everything that comes from this side of the House through coloured glasses.  Nothing good, apparently, can come from this side of the House.  In this motion, all we are asked to do is to cause inquiries to be made into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government.  That is a very moderate and a modest request, and I do not see why there should be any valid objection to it on the part of the Minister.  This much, however, I want to say in conclusion; that the farmer Deputies in this House must remember that now everybody in this country is in the trenches.  The working people in the cities and towns are as much in the trenches as ever the farmers were, even in the height of the trouble.</P>
    <Col N="581" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very little to be said upon this motion, because, from the nature of the motion itself, it leaves very little to be said. When the committee is set up, that is the place to make the case, and, therefore, I do not intend to make the case here.  The committee is the place for that.  It is a fair proposal, and I cannot see why the Minister should oppose it.  I think there is nothing for him to do but to accept it, unless he is to deny fair play.  If a committee is appointed to go into the matter and deal impartially with those things, I am sure that nobody in this House or in the country is afraid that that committee would not do good.  Surely 11 men can be found to deal impartially between the different sections of the community.  I agree with Deputy Anthony when he says that more than the farmers are suffering. The repercussions of the economic war are being felt by many classes.  For instance, the agricultural labourers are suffering, and I think the Ministers are very well aware that these labourers have not the same conditions as the men engaged on industries.  They admit that they have not the same standard of living or the same certainty of work or the same conditions in any way, or any pretence to them.  The small traders, who are living by the farmers, and especially the people in the smaller towns, are also suffering.  By setting up this committee all these things would be considered and the committee could go into these matters in a cool manner and would find out who are really suffering most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is what the Government claim it to be&mdash;an economic war, that is an international war between two nations &mdash;is it not a national issue between this country and England?  If it is a national issue, why should it be made a burden on one section of the community? That is a question I should like answered.  I hold that the burden should be borne impartially by every section of the community.  I think the proper thing to do would be to end it, but if the Government is not prepared to end it, then this is the only logical thing to do.  It is the only thing to do in equity, and I think that they should <Col N="582" /> know by this time of the day, that no matter what differences they had with the farmers some time ago, the farmers are the backbone of the country.  If a man's back is broken, you know what happens, and if a country's back is broken it is the same thing.  If the farmer's back is broken, the country's back is broken.  It is on them we have to rely for the raw material, and those engaged in other industries have to sell their products to the people on the land.  The farmers and the agricultural labourers and the small traders, who are living out of the land, form the backbone.  Agriculture is the principal industry in the country.  It gives employment, I think, to something between 60 and 70 out of every 100 people who are working in this State, notwithstanding the impetus that has been given to other industries.  It is our principal industry, and must be so, and the day it ceases to be our principal industry, the other industries will go along with it.  We must all either sink or swim together.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this motion and will not have a division. I am surprised to see that Deputy Norton is absent.  He seems to be so anxious about the agricultural labourer because I saw a question down here some days ago about the conditions of the agricultural labourers.  Where is Deputy Norton to-night when this motion proposing that something should be done to help agriculture is being debated?  Where are the wages to come from for these agricultural labourers if not out of the agricultural industry; and surely, if the farmer is losing money, as practically every farmer in the State is losing it at the present time, what money is to be paid to the agricultural labourer? I know that, in the part of the country I come from, there is not a small farmer who, if he could get a job on the roads or on some other of the various schemes, would not gladly leave his farm there and take the job. They are trying to exist, and barely exist, on their farms.  I hope, as I say, that this motion will be accepted. There is no use in labouring the point. I do not know what arguments will be put up against it, or whether it is the <Col N="583" /> Minister's intention to oppose it.  I hope he will accept it, and, since I feel there is no argument to be made against it, I think there is no necessity to prolong it.  The whole matter can be put to an impartial committee, and I have no doubt they will deal with the matter.  Until such time as this economic war is settled&mdash;and I hope it will not be long until it is settled&mdash;the burden should be equally borne by all classes of the community.</P>

      <P>I hardly think life would be long enough for such an inquiry as is proposed by this motion. I am surprised, in fact, that Deputy Belton, who is an economist and ought to be able to visualise the amount of work involved and the vast scope of an inquiry such as is proposed in this resolution, submits a motion in these terms to the House.  The motion proposes:</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee be set up to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government on Saorstát agricultural produce and to report on ways and means whereby the burden of the economic war will be suitably borne by all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any inquiry, that would be so wide in its ramifications, so vague, or so impossible to carry on, was ever proposed in any House of Parliament.  First of all, take the wording of the resolution itself.  It says: &ldquo;Will be suitably borne.&rdquo; Surely, the Deputy is begging the question, because the claim of the Government is that the burden is suitably borne already.  If they admitted otherwise, they would be admitting that they were not doing their duty.</P>

      <P>It seems to be a curious suggestion altogether.  Just imagine <Col N="584" /> what the Deputy proposes to inquire into.  It is proposed to inquire as to the exact effect of every purchase that is made in the country&mdash;either in town or in country; to analyse how much of any purchase made by a farmer, for instance, goes to other farmers; how much goes to the local town population; and how much of it goes to the city.</P>

      <P>Whatever form the inquiry should take, I do not see how it could be done.  When the farmer buys seeds and manures, how can it be found out how much is to go to the local merchant, how much of it is going to the city and how much of it goes elsewhere?  Is there too much accumulation of wealth in towns and cities at the expense of the farmers and the rural population?</P>

      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> when one sees the amount of wealth there is in the towns and cities, and realises the position of the farmers, it seems there is a wrong distribution of wealth as between the town and country.  But on the other hand, when one realises the amount of poverty there is in the towns and cities, one sees that the distribution of wealth in a different form in the towns and cities would possibly leave nothing to spare for the country. No committee, not even a committee of Solons, could come to any definite conclusion on this question. The interactions are too great, and it would be too difficult to find out where exactly the spending of a pound, whether spent in town or country, finally ends.  The difficulty is too great, and I think that most people who have studied the question agree that it is almost impossible to come to any conclusion on the subject.  It would be better if Deputy Belton submitted a proposal for something that would have more practical effect.  The Deputy must have some scheme in his head.  It would be better to have a discussion on some definite proposal rather than a discussion on this vague thing in the motion.</P>

      <P>In lamenting about the position of the farmer, there is one thing that we should recognise and for which we should be grateful, and that is that perhaps never before was there a more bountiful all-round harvest than we have had this year.  In face of such a blessing as that, it looks almost like ingratitude to Providence to hear such lamentations through this House.  I think nobody in this House ever saw a more bountiful harvest.  In my experience farmers are much more appreciative of what the Government is endeavouring to do for them than are those who make themselves the farmers' spokesmen in this House.  I know it is the case that very few farmers can do more than pay their way.  It is the case that a number of farmers are in debt or have been unfortunate in other ways, and that they find the struggle too great for them. It is the duty of the Government to keep a very watchful eye on the situation, and to see that nothing that they as a Government can do will remain undone&mdash;that they will do anything they can to help the general body of the farmers and to encourage them to continue the struggle until better times arrive.  It is fundamentally the duty of the Government to do that, and I have no doubt they are doing it.</P>

There has been a very big drop in pig prices, and it is unfortunate that this coincided with the Pigs and Bacon Act.  That drop in pig prices unfortunately caused great loss to pig feeders, who in many cases are poor people.  Then there is the other fact that the corn merchants have not in many cases responded to the Minister's appeal.  I understand that they have not kept to the terms of the agreement made with the Minister. They have not purchased the quantity of barley and oats that they had agreed with the Minister to purchase at fixed prices.

      <P>I presume that we have through Deputy Moore got the Government point of view on this motion.  Like Deputy Moore, I certainly do not like the motion.  The Deputy in order to belittle it has exaggerated.  He is generally a very honest speaker.  I can pay him that tribute but when he does exaggerate he exaggerates gloriously.  This motion before the House sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee be set up to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government on Saorstát agricultural produce and to report on ways and means whereby the burden of the economic war will be equitably borne by all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I do not really need to inquire as to who is bearing the brunt of the economic war or who ought to bear it.  I am against the economic war, lock, stock and barrel.  It ought to have been finished long ago and if the Government had the courage or the commonsense to finish it they would have done so.  Deputy Moore has an objection to the motion.  In his case against it he has grossly exaggerated. He said you would have to go into every pound spent in this country, where it has gone to and whether it is kept in the towns or in the country. Of course nobody believes that, and I am sure Deputy Moore pays no heed to that himself.  Apart from that, there is no doubt a Select Committee would clear the air a lot.  If we are to pay any attention to what we have been listening to for the last two and a half years, we have quite a lot of misunderstanding, unthinking and ignorant misunderstanding, and I am afraid also we have had gross misrepresentation <Col N="588" /> with regard to the economic war, its effect on us and the manner in which we or the British are bearing the real brunt of the war.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Finance saying on the opposite benches that if the coal tariff was being borne by the consumer here, the tariff upon our cattle was being equally borne by the British consumer.  That was misrepresentation. There is no member of the Government who does not know perfectly well that the incidence of both taxes is entirely different.  If the British exporter paid the coal tax into this country, then it would be somewhere near the mark.  The Irish exporter of cattle&mdash;it is immaterial who exports them&mdash;pays the cattle tax beyond.  There is no analogy whatever between the two taxes.  I am sorry that Deputy Belton, when moving this motion, did not give us some details which would show the need for an inquiry into this matter.  He said, of course, that the proper thing was to reserve details for the Committee of Inquiry, but at least a certain amount of detail ought to be given here to show the need for an inquiry of some sort.</P>
    <P>The amount of the duties collected by the British Government on Saorstát agricultural produce was indicated in figures published some time ago by the British Government&mdash;and those figures were not contradicted so far as our Government is concerned, and, therefore, I take them as being substantially correct.  Those figures indicated that since the economic war started, and up to 31st March last, the British Government had collected by way of penal tariffs a sum amounting to £11,500,000.  That amount was collected on Irish agricultural produce.  In the same period we refused to pay to England a sum of £14,500,000.  There was, if you like, again of £3,000,000 on our side.</P>
    <P>I refuse to use the word &ldquo;retain&rdquo; or the expression &ldquo;the retention of the annuities.&rdquo;  To my mind that is merely hog-wash.  I have always objected to the use of the word &ldquo;retain,&rdquo; particularly in connection with the annuities.  You cannot retain a thing until you have it, and so far as the annuities are concerned it cannot <Col N="589" /> honestly be said that they are being retained.  The farmers are placed in the position, through loss of earning power, of not being able to meet their annuity liabilities.  In our efforts to get into the British market in the same period we paid £6,000,000 by way of bounties and subsidies, and we have lost at least £12,000,000 in our export trade with Britain.  That totals approximately £30,000,000 gone in an effort to save £14,500,000.  That is very bad business.</P>
    <P>I think if there was any kind of inquiry instituted that would bring home those facts to the people on the opposite benches, it would be very useful.  The Minister for Finance grossly misrepresents the situation, and unfortunately there are lots of people in the country and on his own benches who think he is genuine about it.  When the Minister tells us that if we pay the coal tax the English people pay the cattle tax, that is purely for ignorant consumption.  If a committee were set up it would possibly clear the air of a lot of that nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton has stated that the Government know the economic war has failed.  Of course they do.  They know perfectly well that as a weapon with which we could fight Britain it has failed miserably, and there is no use pretending it has not failed. Deputy Kennedy mentioned that agriculture must not be in a bad way because there are so many people looking for land.  I think that is a very extraordinary statement.  Deputy Kennedy endeavoured to show the House that there was more land hunger at the present time than ever there was, that there were more questions asked in the Dáil about the division of land than at any other time, thereby showing that people were so anxious for land there must be a big profit to be made out of it.  Deputy Kennedy was a member of, shall I say, the late lamented County Council of Westmeath. As such he ought to have known that last year the rates position in Westmeath was extremely bad.  I do not want anybody to say that that was due to any campaign; I am not referring to that end of it at all; I am referring to the amount of uncollected <Col N="590" /> rates that Deputy Kennedy and his friends had to wipe out in Westmeath because the farming community could not pay.  Is that evidence of prosperity on the land?</P>
    <P>It is no use trying to burk the issue, we are going down badly and the Minister knows that as well as I do.  I do not think it is necessary to press that fact home at all.  I do not want to make any political capital out of it.  I am genuinely afraid of the situation confronting this country and I am not a pessimist by any means.  If you examine the accounts of county councils, particularly the position in regard to rates, you will find that they are in a deplorable condition. If you calculate the deficits in the case of many county councils you will begin to wonder where will we find ourselves in eight or ten months' time.  Where is the evidence that we are making any advance, or that we will ever reach a position, at the present rate of progress, when the local authorities will be solvent?</P>
    <P>I think, as Deputy Haslett and Deputy Anthony have said, that although there may be objection to the motion, and the manner in which it is drafted, still a lot of good would result from a genuine examination of the state of affairs that exists in this country at the present time with regard to the incidence of British penal tariffs.  The main industry of this country must be made profitable. People do not work in this or any other country simply for the sake of working.  People will not go out on to the farm and get stuck in the mud for the love of it.  They will go out if they can derive profit for their families and will provide the means whereby they can bring up their families in comfort.  The practice in this country was that the fathers and mothers worked on the land, reared their children and endeavoured to put something aside for them in order to enable them later on to settle on the land.  What is happening now?  Is there an end to all that?  Is there any evidence that we will be able to keep on our feet so far as the farming community is concerned?  If the economic war is to continue, and we are <Col N="591" /> to suffer from British penal tariffs, as we have been suffering in the last two years, how does the Minister contemplate the situation?  I do not like to visualise the situation that will arise in another few years if there is not a great change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haslett gave us some figures which were very interesting with regard to prices on this side of the Border, and on the other.  These arc figures that have practical relationship to the British penal tariffs, and they are very interesting.  They show that there is a very big disparity between the prices on this side and the other side of the Border, whether for the purchaser, or the seller, and the reaction, in both cases, is against the Free State.</P>
    <P>I strongly advise the Government to take a sensible view of the situation and to endeavour to grapple with it.  They are going to be up against it very soon.  If the Government does not endeavour to grapple and deal with a situation that is imposing penal tariffs upon the community in general in this country, they will leave a legacy to their successors which I for one will not envy them.  Again I say that this country is doing very bad business at the present time.  The retention of the land annuities in this country while, at the same time, we are losing twice the amount, as the price of retaining them, is a very bad business; but that is what the Fianna Fáil policy has done.  We have unemployment, we have distress, we have some of the small farmers of the country underfed and badly clothed.  And these people are not the poorest of the poor.  People getting the dole are not at all worse off than these people.  The people who are suffering through the economic war were always respectable and decent people who never looked for something for nothing.  They have been in the forefront of the fight. The action of the Government, backed up by the Fianna Fáil Party, has left the farming community in the wretched position in which they find themselves to-day, and that is one of the bad results of such policy.</P>

      <P>This is a peculiar kind of motion that we are debating here to-day.  It asks:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee be set up to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government on Saorstát agricultural produce and to report on the ways and means whereby the burden of the economic war will be equitably borne by all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>That is the first part.  I candidly say I do not like that at all, nor can I support it.  I am not going to ask anybody in this country to support the continuance of the economic war.  My opinion is that they have borne it so long that they are no longer fit to bear anything.  For that reason, I cannot understand why Deputies Belton and Kent put down the motion in this form. The second part of the motion says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the committee consist of 11 members who shall be nominated by the Committee of Selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this committee to do?  They are to distribute the incidence of the economic war.  Speaking for myself, if I were to help to distribute the incidence of the economic war, more than it is distributed at the present time, I would not be discharging my duty.  I do not think there is one individual in my constituency, or in any constituency, who has not borne this burden up to the breaking point; and I think everybody would be delighted if some method were found to put an end to this thing.  Am I to be asked to give my support to a resolution of that kind?  In 1933 when the economic war was nine months in operation, I asked that it should be put an end to at once.  All wars have to come to an end some time or another, when peace is made.  But apparently those engaged in this conflict will not make peace.  When all the resources of the belligerents are expended peace will be made.  I ask why is that peace not made before we reach the depths of destruction.  In this debate here to-night.  Deputy Davin spoke, and drew a picture of the condition of the farmers and the effect upon the agricultural <Col N="593" /> labourers in the country.  We pointed out, time after time, that practically no branch of the community could escape the reactions of this economic war.  Deputy Davin told us of some small farmers who were only able to get 26/- a cwt., live weight, for their pork, but that was something at all events.  In my constituency they could get nothing at all.  Farmers brought their dead pigs to the market, but they had to bring them home again at night, cut them up and put them in salt.  Yet we have Deputies in this <Col N="594" /> House asking to have a Select Committee set up.  For what purpose?</P>
