      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the total sum under the control of the Hospitals' Commission at this date and indicate the manner in which these moneys will be allocated or otherwise disposed of.</P>

      <P>The total moneys at present in the hands of the National Hospitals Trustees amount to £4,382,322.  The moneys will be allocated from time to time as reports are received from the Hospitals Commission. Under Section 24 of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, each application for a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund must be referred to the Hospitals Commission for investigation and report, and the Minister must await the report of the Commission before dealing with any such application.  A considerable number of applications is being investigated by the Commission and the Minister cannot say how they will be dealt with individually until he receives and considers the reports of the Commission thereon.  As regards voluntary hospitals, however, it should be remembered that while the Minister has to provide for schemes of improvement he must also bear in mind the necessity for the continued maintenance and running of the hospitals. Provision for the latter is likely to necessitate the accumulation of a substantial <Col N="884" /> capital sum for endowment purposes.  The deficit for the year ended 31st December, 1934, on the working of the hospitals in respect of which applications have been received was £60,886.  On the basis of the gross deficits for the year 1934 it is estimated that the sum required for endowment would be £3,300,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the aggregate total amount of the funds in court classified as dormant balances as at the date of the last accounting period in each of the years 1930 to 1935 inclusive; and if he will state the several purposes for which any part of these dormant balances have been utilised and the amount so utilised in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the answer to this question contains a number of tabular statements I propose, with the Deputy's permission, to have it circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Subjoined are statements showing the funds in the High Court classified as dormant balances for the years 1930 to 1935, and also the amounts of cash and 2½ per cent.  Consols appropriated for various purposes under the authority of certain specified Statutes.</P>
      <P>It should be understood that there is only one general cash account in the name of the accountant in the Bank of Ireland and that all cash balances both dormant and current are held in this account.  According to the books of this office there should have been to credit of this cash account on the 30th September last a total sum of £413,378 17s. 11d., of which the dormant cash balance of £209,109 4s. 5d. forms part.  Owing, however, to the various appropriations of cash above referred to and shown in detail on the subjoined statement and a deficiency of £7 3s. 4d. in certain old accounts, the actual cash to credit in the Bank of Ireland was reduced to £88,221 0s. 1d.  The securities shown to credit of the dormant accounts are actually held by the accountant.</P>

      <P>The first part of the question should be addressed to the Minister for Finance.  The number of wage-earners employed at mid-November, 1931 (which is the nearest date before the qualifying date for which the statistics are available) by the 10 licensed manufacturers of tobacco qualified to receive rebate under the Finance Acts of 1932 and 1934 was 485. The corresponding figure for 31st March, 1935, is not available but the total number of persons engaged (including salaried employees as well as wage-earners) by these 10 firms on 1st March, 1935, was 826.  Weekly wages paid immediately prior to the qualifying date or at 31st March, 1935, are not available, but, the total amounts of wages paid by the 10 firms in the years 1931 and 1934 were £41,285 and £56,683 respectively.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why it is possible in reference to the position on 31st March or so to give the amount of wages paid but it is not possible for him to differentiate between the wage-earners and the persons in receipt of salaries?

      <P>Are we to understand from the Minister that, where a special rebate has been given in order <Col N="892" /> to secure that certain Irish companies will keep in production and operation, the Department does not take any steps to see how the number of wage-earners from year to year corresponds with the number of wage-earners that were employed before the rebate was given?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be reasonable, when a special rebate is given in order to keep firms in production, or afraid they would be put out of production, that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce should watch how the number of wage-earners in the concerns vary from year to year?  I should like the Minister to understand that, considering he ought to do that, I will put the question in a week or so to him again, because I submit it is important, if he knows the number of wage-earners that were there before they qualified and the number of wage-earners and persons in receipt of salaries there now, he ought to be able to differentiate between the wage-earners and the persons in receipt of salaries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="893" /> if he will state whether he is aware that in the beginning of last year the Controller of Prices intervened and succeeded in reducing the price of bellmen's coal in the City of Dublin from 30/- a ton to 29/- a ton; whether he is aware that the present price of bellmen's coal when bought by the bag ranges from 48/- to 53/4 a ton, and when bought by the stone is 53/- a ton; if he will state whether he has caused any inquiry to be made into the circumstances which have occasioned this enormous rise in the price of coal to the poorer classes in the city; and, if so, if he will state what the reasons are; and, if not, if he will state whether he proposes to take any action in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that through the intervention of the Controller of Prices the price charged by importers of coal to bellmen in the City of Dublin was reduced at the beginning of last year.  My information as regards prices being charged by bellmen to-day does not tally with the suggestion made by the Deputy that coal when bought by the bag ranges from 48/- to 53/4.  The Controller of Prices has the price of coal under continual review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is possible for the Minister to find out what the prices in Dublin are?  If the Controller of Prices intervened to prevent coal being charged for at 30/- per ton, surely you would expect him to keep the situation under review?  Does the Minister not know that if the Controller of Prices kept the situation under review he would know that in some parts of Dublin 3/- per bag is being charged and in some parts 3/4 per bag; that where the people have to buy coal by the stone, they are paying 4d. per stone; and that the total result of that is that over the 29/- per ton to which the Controller of Prices had the price reduced in the beginning of last year, there is an addition of 24/4 being paid by the poorer classes of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing the prices charged by coal importers to bellmen and the prices charged by bellmen to the consumers. The Controller of Prices intervened on a complaint received by him concerning <Col N="894" /> the price charged to bellmen by importers.  He has had no complaint concerning the prices charged by bellmen to consumers.  He has no power to intervene or to make inquiry except on a complaint made.  In any event, there is no evidence to support the idea that the profits realised by bellmen are excessive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General was speaking when we arose <Col N="901" /> last night, and I thought that he was going to continue.  The situation with regard to this amendment is easy enough to state.  The proposal in the Bill is to have a Supreme Court of five, and that not less than three should sit&mdash;the question of when three sit instead of five to be determined by the Chief Justice.  Deputy Costello has moved to make four the quorum in accordance with the only views put forward before the Committee&mdash;the only views in relation to the fixing of the quorum.  It is to be noticed that sub-section (3) of Section 4 includes judges who are, by virtue of Section 6 or Section 7 of the Principal Act, additional judges of the Supreme Court.  The High Court consists of six judges.  For the future the Supreme Court will have five, irrespective of the people who may be taken in from the High Court.  There is, therefore, a number of 11 to be drawn from, and the Chief Justice himself asserted that, provided the Supreme Court was going to be raised in numbers&mdash;and that is now proposed to be done&mdash;the quorum should never fall below four. The only other evidence that was given, dealing with the question of numbers to any degree, was the evidence given by the President of the High Court, who had no view of his own as to the necessity for increasing the number of the Supreme Court, saying that he and his colleagues were satisfied with the constitution of the Court as it was then.  He did offer the suggestion, however, that he would prefer five to be sitting rather than four, and that was founded on his view that we had better not have at any time an equally divided Supreme Court.  We are getting the increased numbers in the Supreme Court, and the proposal is to have four&mdash;that is, four to be chosen out of 11 available. I do not say that the 11 are available all at once, but there will be available at any moment the five of the Supreme Court, as it will be constituted, the President of the High Court, and any other judge from amongst the remaining five of the High Court.  We figure that it will be possible on all occasions to get a court of four to sit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that we have got to allow for absence through illness&mdash;we <Col N="902" /> are told that all through the Bill&mdash;or any other cause.  That peculiar enlargement of the provisions for supplementing or substituting judges has been made right through this Bill and will be the cause of comment later on. In any event, there is now, as the Bill will now stand, the possibility of drawing from the High Court, when the Chief Justice thinks fit, in order to get this number.  We suggest that, if there is a mind that is keen on the enlargement of the Supreme Court, that mind ought to follow the line of arriving at the conclusion that four is the necessary quorum.  When the evidence was given for the enlarging of the Supreme Court, it was only put up by the Chief Justice as a permanent matter, and the only other person was a member of the Bar Council who said that the Court should be constituted <i>ad hoc</i> for special matters, such as heavy commercial cases or constitutional cases; and surely it would be possible to have such matters arranged at a time when the High Court judges will not be out on circuit.  It would be a very exceptional occasion when there would be a clash by reason, say, of a heavy commercial case or a constitutional case in the Supreme Court by way of appeal. It is only in very extraordinary cases it would clash with the High Court. So it should be admitted that a quorum of four is essential.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General last night referred to some remarks of Deputy Costello on the point that in this measure there is seen a conflict between two view-points, the view-point of those who, notwithstanding the economic situation in the country and in spite of that situation, are determined to make two new appointments to the Bench.  Then, having decided to take that hurdle, they decide to take another contrary decision, and that is that they will cramp everything else in the Bill for reasons of economy.  The Attorney-General was rather vexed because it was suggested here that the views of certain officials of the Department of Finance had been imposed upon him.  Surely the words used here yesterday, particularly the words used by the Minister for Justice, showed that even if he did not think he was <Col N="903" /> reading a memorandum from the Finance Department, he got their very vocabulary.  He used phrases about fees and said it was a bagatelle, the very words used by the Finance people&mdash;that is their outstanding argument with regard to the matter of fees. The phrases used here last night were immediately reminiscent to me of the phrases used by the Finance people&mdash; such phrases as &ldquo;made to pay their way,&rdquo;&ldquo;these fees were a bagatelle,&rdquo; and so on.  The very Words used by the two people on the Government side who spoke on this Bill are the words of the Finance people.  It is clear that not merely has the view of the Finance <Col N="904" /> Department been accepted in this Bill but their arguments have been accepted in their entirety, always with this exception, that notwithstanding anything urged in the way of economy on the Government side, there are still two new appointments to be made to the judicial bench.  I suggest as a logical conclusion, and it should be so stated here, that there should be a quorum of four.</P>

If you do not allow the Chief <Col N="907" /> Justice in future to deal with them, then whatever matters used to go to the Chief Justice will go to the judges of the Supreme Court from time to time in the order of their seniority.

However I will deal with them on Section 9.  Reading through this measure there is allowance made for the substitution of one judge for another if he is unable to be present owing to illness, absence, or &ldquo;for any other reason.&rdquo;  The old phraseology brought into other Acts was &ldquo;owing to other public duties or services temporarily imposed upon such judge, or on account of illness or through absence from Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The Government here wants power to substitute somebody for somebody else who is prevented attending his duties through illness, absence &ldquo;or for any other reason.&rdquo;  But we are bringing in sub-section (2) of Section 28 and there it was illness or absence.  Who is going to determine the meaning of the words &ldquo;or for any other reason&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Surely it is possible to define the occasion upon which temporary absence of the judge might take place, allowing for the appointment of a substitute.  It ought to be possible to define illness, absence from the Saorstát or other public duties imposed upon him.  The Minister has now put in the words &ldquo;for any other reason.&rdquo;  What is the necessity for these?  Misadventure, or delegation of duties would be covered by illness or absence from the Saorstát.

You had an instance in recent times where one judge in the Supreme Court did not sit on a particular case for certain reasons, and it was held that he could not be called on to do High Court work.  I am referring to the hearing of the Erasmus Smith case.  The Deputy may remember that Judge Fitzgibbon was unable to take part in the hearing of that appeal, and his services could not be made use of in the High Court.

He may not have done a stroke of work in between.  I certainly think there was something peculiar about a man who had intermittent periods of work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there are phrases.  Amendment No. 33 has a phrase which I have taken from some of the other Acts&mdash;I think it is the Act which allows for the appointment of substitute Circuit Court judges and substitute district justices.  There the phraseology was&mdash;and it was an enlargement of the old phraseology&mdash; such that you thought of the disappearance of a man temporarily from his duties because of illness, absence from Saorstát Eireann or carrying out other public duties or services temporarily imposed on him.  I suggest that it is a very wide enlargement to say &ldquo;or for any other cause,&rdquo; I do not say this is going to be done, but it is possible, if the phrase is left in&mdash;and it is studded right through this Bill&mdash;that you are going to break down one of the points at which an independent judiciary is supposed to be a stronghold and buttress of the people's rights, namely, that the Government of the day cannot exercise any control or power over people who are permanently appointed, and who are given the permanent appointment so as to make them independent, but you can exercise a certain amount of sway or control over people temporarily appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a measure passed which allows the Government to discharge judges by temporary suspension for any cause, and to fill their places with their own nominees, surely you break down the whole foundation of the liberty of the people through an independent judiciary?  It is not, I say, a thing to be lightly done.  Suppose there was a multitudinous series of occurrences which leaped to the mind and which could not be covered by detailed phraseology, there would be something to be said for the comprehensive phrase, but, really is there anything that we should allow in respect of the substitution of a judge except illness, absence or other public duties of any type?  I may also say that there is a considerable view, and a view that is increasing in strength, that there is too much use being made of <Col N="917" /> the practice of taking judges away from the duties to which they were assigned in order to discharge other public duties.  They should be left to their own duties which have been picked for them.</P>

      <P>In page 6, Section 9 (1), lines 19-21, to delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;or, if and whenever&rdquo; to the end of sub-section (1).</P>
      <P>Taking these words out, with certain consequential amendments referred, would leave the sub-section in this way:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jurisdiction which was transferred to and vested in the Chief Justice by sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Principal Act shall on the appointed day become and be transferred to the High Court and shall <Col N="920" /> thenceforth be exercised by the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The sub-section would be left in that state if the words that I propose to delete are, in fact, deleted.  I admit that there may have to be consequential amendments made in that which may not be governed by the other phrases already in with regard to the Supreme Court, or the phrases that will hereafter be proposed to be put in with regard to the High Court.  They would certainly have to cover such things as are now covered in respect to the Chief Justice in relation to lunacy and minor matters.</P>
    <P>The main object is to have the work in lunacy and minor matters put into the hands of one person and left definitely to that person.  Up to date, I think it has been found that jurisdiction in these matters has been carried out with the greatest and most anxious care by the Chief Justice.  When he was giving evidence before the Courts of Justice Committee he stressed very much his view that minors and lunatics did require what amounted to a paternal sort of care, and that that could only be got when this work was, in the main, done by a particular judge.  If the suggestion had been made to him at the time that there was any prospect that this work would not be handed over in its entirety to a special judge, I think he would have objected in a very strong way.  The Chief Justice gave a long list of figures in relation to this type of case.  I think anybody who knows the particular outlook that he has on this jurisdiction will realise the truth of what I say, that it would be a change very considerably for the worse to have these matters thrown on a High Court judge and even then left to be done by, say, a judge who might change from time to time.  There is always discernible in the courts in specialist matters a tendency to divert special business into the hands of a special judge so that he may become accustomed to them and not to have that judge's work on those types of cases interrupted except on occasions of illness or complete absence from his duties.  Whatever considerations apply in that respect to probate matters or to any other special type of case, there <Col N="921" /> are peculiar considerations applying to minors and lunatics.</P>
    <P>I think the Chief Justice himself was questioned before the Committee about the possibility of allowing some of these matters to be dealt with in the circuit courts, and to that I think he entered a very strong objection, holding the view that in these cases there is a great deal more than what emerges in court when an ordinary application is made by way of petition or otherwise in regard to minors or lunatics. Both these classes of people, one suffering from infirmity from age and the other infirmity from youth, require that they really should have somebody with a sort of paternal mind looking after them.  I do not say that the work is going to be slung around from one judge to another.  We have not yet heard as to whether this work is going to be taken from the Chief Justice.  Again, that is a matter on which I would like to know from the Minister whether there has been any consultation with the Chief Justice and if he has responded in any way. But if the work is going to be transferred from the Chief Justice there is an immense amount to be said for having the jurisdiction fixed and centred in some special judge.  I do not think that requires much argument. The nature of the matters that will be discussed is the ground work of the whole argument.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the work should be given to the President of the High Court, that is if it is being taken out of the Supreme Court altogether.  If the work is to be taken from the Chief Justice who has so anxiously looked after these matters for so many years, then I submit that it should be given to the highest authority in the High Court and that he should be given the task of substituting, if that is at all possible, for the work done by the Chief Justice up to date.  The Bill seems to envisage a situation in which the work will be done more or less in relation to time rather than a situation in which the work will be done by an individual arranging the time to suit himself.  In the new situation, with High Court judges going our on circuit, it may not be easy to arrange that.  Some of <Col N="922" /> these matters will not brook delay, and where you have two High Court judges on circuit, I think it would be well to arrange for a break in their work when on circuit, and that if necessary the President might come back to town on a Thursday and arrange to deal with lunacy and minor matters on a Friday or Saturday.  I think that would be much better than to do what is envisaged in the Bill, because it is surely desirable to continue the special care that this particular type of case requires and has received up to date. I am insisting at the moment that this work should be centred in one judge. If that is agreed on there will have to be some consequential amendments to provide for a substitute during the illness of the special judge or his absence from work.  What I am anxious to secure is that this type of case should be dealt with, mainly by one judge. The tendency of the Bill should be to fix the jurisdiction in these matters in the hands of one person.  On the section, I propose to ask why this jurisdiction is being taken from the Chief Justice at all, and if it is being done with his consent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying idea of the section is that the Chief Justice should be as free as possible to deal with the work of the Supreme Court. It has also been pointed out that it does not seem proper that there should be an appeal from the highest judge in the State.  That could happen and has happened.  The Chief Justice has been consulted about this matter and has agreed that this arrangement is a suitable and proper one.  I agree with the Deputy that it is desirable that the same judge should always deal with these lunacy and minor matters.  I believe that, in practice, that is how it will work out.  The President can use his discretion as to whether he is going to retain that business himself or assign it to a particular judge.  I am quite satisfied that the President of the High Court will have in mind the desirability, as everybody who knows anything about the business has in mind, of having one particular judge to deal with that business at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>To fortify what I said and in an attempt to make <Col N="923" /> the Minister go farther than he has gone, I should like to refer to the evidence of the Chief Justice at page 310, question 4563.  He had spoken previously of the number of cases.  Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In point of fact, there never has been an appeal in lunacy cases. There have been only two appeals in minors cases.  The jurisdiction in lunacy formerly was exercised by the Lord Chancellor under a direct letter from the King.  After the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, that was transferred to the Chief Justice, and it was from him transferred by our own statute to the Chief Justice of the Free State.  In minors matters, the jurisdiction was formerly practically a Chancery jurisdiction.  At one time, it was regarded in the position that the Crown was <i>parens patriae</i> and had jurisdiction over minors in that way, though, in practice, it was always exercised by the Lord Chancellor.</P>
      <P>Then he spoke of certain changes made&mdash;the abolition of the term &ldquo;lunacy&rdquo; and so on.  Speaking on that, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a change were contemplated, this particular branch of work should be a one-man job.  What I mean is that one man should be always attached to this particular work.  There is a very human element about it.  A great deal of the work is done, not in court, but in chambers.  There are a great number of conferences with relatives and so on, and, in a great many of the cases, one requires, more or less, to be personally in touch.  Again, one often requires to be available in urgent cases.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a query as to whether he suggested that there should be a special registrar and the Chief Justice said &ldquo;No, but a judge.  I suggest that if there is a change made, only one judge should be attached to the position and he should be made responsible for it.&rdquo; A question arises as to how the staff is to be dealt with.  There is some phrase in the Bill about that.  The Chief Justice made a protest against <Col N="924" /> the throwing of the staff of the Lunacy-Office into the Central Office.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The staff of the Lunacy Office must be separate and independent.  The business of that office must not circulate. Absolute secrecy is essential to the working of the office.  So much is that regarded as necessary that, on the death of a patient, all the medical reports and other things of that sort are destroyed.  Similarly, when people are cured, the medical records are destroyed.  I think it will be generally admitted that that is desirable.  If you have this work thrown on an interchangeable staff, you cannot maintain that secrecy. I do urge that there should be one judge with a separate staff.  The registrar and the assistant registrar in Lunacy are required by law to carry out visits.  That is what I regard as the most important portion of the whole of lunacy administration&mdash;visiting. A great many patients are in private care, and it almost passes belief what might happen in the case of persons in private care were it not for visitors.  I have had some experience in this matter, and my experience impressed this thing very much upon my mind.  I also think that a similar system of visiting should be introduced for minors.  I think that those particular cases should be dealt with separately and a convenient title would be `Courts of Wards'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were other questions on this matter of minors and visits.  Then, the Chief Justice was asked whether lunacy jurisdiction should be conferred on the Circuit Court.  The Chief Justice replied: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, they have it, but I am sorry to say that, from my experience of it, it has not been well administered.&rdquo;  Then he recurred to the question of visitation, and said that the lay visitor had better opportunities to examine the wardrobes of patients, see that meals were properly attended to, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I quote that simply to fortify the point I made.  Possibly the matter will have to be dealt with in this way, and it will have to be left to the President to assign a judge to do this work.  I <Col N="925" /> suggest, however, that the wording of the Bill amounts almost to an invitation to the President of the High Court, if he is going to have a lot of diverse matters to attend to in his court, to allocate the lunacy business to judges <i>ad hoc</i> from time to time. I think we should indicate the view of the House that the President should either retain that work himself or assign to it a particular judge who would be known to be in charge of these ward matters.  There should be some change in the phraseology of the Bill which would indicate the view of the House and show that they accepted the viewpoint of the Chief Justice, that, in these ward and minor matters, a great deal of humanity is required, and that they can only be successfully dealt with by having allotted to them a special judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy McGilligan. When we come to deal with the section as a whole, I shall have some remarks to make on the advisability of the change proposed.  Dealing with the particular amendment before the Committee, the Minister will probably agree that, if the jurisdiction in lunacy and minor matters is to be properly or adequately carried out, it must be exercised continuously by one judge. We who know the practice that has obtained in reference to minor and lunacy matters during the last eleven years, know that the Chief Justice has himself taken a personal interest in each case both on the lunacy side of his court and on the minor side of his court.  A practice has grown up there which differs substantially from the practice that existed in the old days when the Lord Chancellor was the head of the minors and lunacy patients in this country.  The Chief Justice has given the utmost personal attention to each case.  If this change is to take place at all&mdash;and I think no change is desirable at the present time&mdash;it is absolutely essential, having regard to the practice that has grown up in the Chief Justice's office in connection with wards of court and patients in lunacy, that one particular judge should be assigned to that work.  It should be made clear in the section that it is only <Col N="926" /> in very exceptional cases&mdash;whether the particular judge in question be the President or anybody else&mdash;that this work should be delegated to another judge.  Unless that principle is clearly and definitely laid down in the Bill.  I think very great hardship is likely to arise in the administration of the affairs of patients in lunacy and wards of court.</P>
      <P>I have not heard what the Minister said in reply to the points made by Deputy McGilligan in moving the amendment, but, I do urge that amendment of the section is essential.  I am entirely opposed to the change proposed in the section, and I see no reason for it.  But, if there is to be a change, we should make clear and definite that one particular judge is to take over jurisdiction from the Chief Justice.  He will be in a position to learn from the Chief Justice and from the officers at present attached to the Chief Justice's court who are dealing with these matters what the practice was, what individual attention is to be given to cases, and how the traditions which have grown up in that Office are to be maintained at the high level which they reached during the last eleven years.</P>

      <P>While all that both Deputies have said may be quite true, is there any necessity to insert it in the Bill?  Is there a shadow of doubt that the President of the High Court will be as much alive to the considerations put forward as any Deputy present?  Anybody who has had experience of the handling of lunacy and minor matters at once realises that continuity in the judicial office dealing with them is desirable and that that personal touch to which Deputy Costello refers is of real value.  As the Chief Justice has for the last eleven years taken a personal interest in every case under his control and has become familiar with the circumstances of each case, he is admittedly in a better position to deal with applications that come before him from time to time than if he had not had that continuous contact with the cases.  Will not these considerations immediately occur to the President of the High Court?  It is open to him, under this Bill, to assume <Col N="927" /> to himself that particular jurisdiction. Perhaps that is the most desirable thing that could happen.  The duties of the President of the High Court are very onerous in a good many respects, and if he feels that he must devolve his jurisdiction on someone, surely the same considerations will induce him to leave it in the hands of a particular judge, and to allow that judge to attend to that work without interruption, unless in exceptional cases which arise?  I think that it is quite sufficient to leave the matter as it stands in the Bill, and that there is no danger whatever that any judge of any experience who is President of the High Court to whom this duty of assigning the work falls will not be alive to these considerations.  I think the Minister is quite ready to consider putting in some words which will mark that.  I understand from the Minister that he feels what I have stated is true and that there is no necessity for these other words being inserted.  I am sure the value of continuity will be realised by the President of the High Court.  I understand the Minister is prepared to consider the matter of having some words inserted.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to look at the point I raised, now that we have got that promise from him. There is no necessity to waste more time on it.  Under Section 9 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, there were assigned to the Chief Justice minor and lunacy matters, and matters that I might call comprehensively solicitors' matters, such as notaries public and commissioners for oaths.  We are now making a change.  We are taking away lunacy and minor matters and giving them to the President of the High Court with certain consequential matters that we are leaving as solicitors' matters.  When all three were in the hands of the Chief Justice there was special advertence to these things in the Act of 1928.  It was realised that we had in the Act of 1924 given these things to the Chief Justice, but that in case he was absent through illness the work was held up.  That was adverted to in the Courts of <Col N="928" /> Justice Act, 1928.  Section 2 implied that, when the Chief Justice was absent through illness, or absent from Saorstát Eireann, the duties had to be performed by the President of the High Court and, if he was absent, by a senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, so that you had definitely a hierarchy arranged for the three sets of things.  Solicitors' matters and the notaries public are still with the Chief Justice.  We have this rigid hierarchy that if the Chief Justice is away then these functions are exercised through the President of the High Court and the first, second, or third senior judges.  When we come to the delicate matter of minors&mdash;and these things will be all construed together&mdash;when we come to human matters, minors and lunatics, we find that these are transferred from the Chief Justice and handed over to the President of the High Court to be dealt with by him, or, if he so directs, by an ordinary judge of the High Court &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; assigned. I suggest that that is a most objectionable series of words, &ldquo;for the time being.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly upon anyone reading them they will create the impression that the view was that the President of the High Court should go to them one by one.  We do not mean that.  I suggest that the Ceann Comhairle is allowing the various amendments to be dealt with now.</P>

      <P>I can read that into the section.  Remember someone is going to contrast it and say it is peculiar division, solicitors left with the Chief Justice and no question of his assigning someone for the time being.  The President takes the work <Col N="929" /> if he is ill and gives it to a senior judge.  When it comes to minor matters there is no hierarchy arranged at all, just the President, or someone he assigns for the time being.  I suggest that the two sections should be looked at together.  This is the fault.  I think, of patchwork legislation.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of patchwork.  Who thinks that solicitors' matters and notaries public are more important than the performance of duties that should be assigned to the Chief Justice?  If he is absent you have one, two, three, four or five names.  When we come to minor and lunacy matters we say the President of the High Court but after that we do not care about the hierarchy. We simply say anyone he assigns for the time being.  I think this arises from patchwork, and I suggest that that phraseology, when disregarded, will not in the new form have these words, and that the President will be given the duty of assigning some judge, and an arrangement made similar to what is now in the section, four members adverting back to Section 2 of the Act of 1928, allowing for a change in a case of illness or absence and only on that.  Remember, we have a right to fix a point of view and not to leave it to the President to say whom he will appoint. We have a right to make the point and say &ldquo;you ought to take it yourself, and if you do not take it you ought to assign a judge, and there should be no change in the judges except absence through illness or some other reason.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>So far as I can ascertain from the discussion, the learned Attorney-General approves of the purport and the object of Deputy McGilligan's amendment.  Then why not embody it in the Bill so that there will be no doubt whatever about it, not only during the life of the present Chief Justice but for all future time? He knows very well that an Act of <Col N="930" /> Parliament is very often diverted into a channel which was never intended, and the only way to copper-fasten it is when the Bill is going through this House.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that the argument sounds most ingenious and subtle but, as the last Deputy said, there is no necessity for an argument about a matter which the Minister through me has indicated his readiness to consider the finding of a formula to meet the criticism which has been directed to the section by the two Deputies opposite.  Deputy McGilligan's last ingenious and subtle argument in which he draws a parallel, or compares the position which will now exist in relation to those matters which are left in the hands of the Chief Justice, and those which have been removed from him by the section is entirely fallacious.  Deputy McGilligan seems not to realise that sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 19 of the Principal Act, dealt merely with matters relating to solicitors, the appointments of notaries public and commissioners to administer oaths.  These are matters not of a similar nature to lunacy and minor matters.  They have this particularly clear difference between them and the jurisdiction in matters of lunacy and minor matters, that there is an appeal from whatever judge deals with lunacy and minor matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an appeal to the Supreme Court whereas in the case of those functions which the Chief Justice still retains and which the Deputy said go down along this long elaborate hierarchy, are the particular functions assigned to the Chief Justice under the Solicitors Act in relation to solicitors. Where the Chief Justice deals with the misconduct of solicitors and acts as the supreme controlling body for the solicitor profession in matters of discipline there is no appeal from him in matters assigned to him by sub-sections (2) and (3), there is no appeal from the Chief Justice in regard to the appointment of notaries public and commissioners to administer oaths.  It is quite rational that when the functions which the Chief Justice has under these sub-sections are to be passed on by reason of his absence they should <Col N="931" /> follow the hierarchy which is laid down in the Courts of Justice Act.  That is that they should go first to the President of the High Court and then down the ranks of the judges of the Supreme Court.  I do not think there is any analogy between them and the provision in regard to lunacy and minor matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My whole argument is that there is no analogy.  The Attorney-General says that there is an argument for transferring these functions but that there is no considered argument for transferring them in the same way.  On the other point of the elaborate hierarchy for commissioners of oaths applications, that elaborate hierarchy is assented to by the will of this House and stabilised by legislation while there is no hierarchy for the very delicate matter of lunacy and minor matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I wish to raise the whole issue of the principle contained in it.  To me it was one of the most amazing sections that could appear in a Bill of this character.  I pointed out on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill that I could see no necessity for the transfer of the jurisdiction which has been exercised by the Chief Justice for the past 11 years, in reference to lunacy and minor matters, from him to somebody else inexperienced in these matters. I also pointed out that so far as I knew there was no public demand for this change.  There was no demand from any branch of the profession for tins change and no case had been made by the Attorney-General when he was introducing this Bill for this change over.  I requested some information on these matters.  I was anxious to know why it was thought desirable, or why it was considered to be in the nature of a reform, to transfer this jurisdiction which had been exercised in such a pre-eminent fashion by the Chief <Col N="934" /> Justice for the last 11 years to some judge of the High Court.  I got no satisfactory explanation of the appearance of this section in the Bill at that time, nor have I got it since, nor have I been able to find any satisfactory explanation whatever, or any satisfying reason for this change. I repeat that there has been no public demand for this change; that there has been no demand from any branch of the profession for the change.  The fact, as I pointed out on Second Reading, that during the entire of the 11 years during which these jurisdictions were exercised there were only three appeals from the Chief Justice is a singular appreciation or monument to the manner in which he has carried out his duty in that connection.  When the Chief Justice took up these new duties a certain practice existed in the office that he took over on the transfer&mdash;a certain practice that had existed during the old Lord Chancellor days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this matter were being considered for the first time, if we were now considering the setting up of a new system of judicature in this country, some argument might be advanced in favour of the proposition that the initial jurisdiction in reference to lunacy and minor matters might be placed, in the first instance, either in the President of the High Court or some judge of the High Court.  But, when we find that the Oireachtas 11 years ago, having considered the matter and having had the advice of a Judiciary Committee, considered that the wise thing to do in reference to these lunacy and minor matters was to give exclusive primary jurisdiction to the Chief Justice, and when we find that that practice, not merely worked well and satisfactorily for 11 years, but had been demonstrated to have worked in a far better way than the old practice of the Lord Chancellor, it passes belief that now, without any proper reason or any satisfactory explanation, these jurisdictions should be suddenly transferred from the Chief Justice to some other people, who have not had the same experience as he has had in the last 11 years.  You are putting some man, whether he be President of the High Court or anybody else, into the position <Col N="935" /> of having to take up entirely new duties with which he has not had touch in the last 11 years, and you are taking these duties from a man who has had complete personal touch with every patient in lunacy and with every minor under his care in the last 11 years. You are dislocating, for no reason that I can see, and for no satisfactory reason that has been advanced, the whole practice of the office and the whole procedure that has obtained therein for the last 11 years.  Why I do not know.  I hope to hear some reason, either from the Minister or the Attorney-General, before this section is passed.  I do feel that if the members of this House took the trouble to attend here and to consider the implications in this matter, this scheme would not be passed.  No satisfactory reason, I repeat, has been given.  There are innumerable reasons why the section should not have appeared in the Bill, and why, having appeared in the Bill, it should now be gracefully withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General referred to the fact that the President of the High Court has onerous duties to perform. In the last 11 years he has had very onerous duties to perform.  He is the head of the High Court, he has to attend to jury actions, he has to attend to appeals in the Circuit Court, he has to attend in Green Street at the Central Criminal Court, he has to sit in the Court of Criminal Appeal, he has to attend to <i>certiorari, mandamus</i> and State matters, and all matters that come before him.  With all these onerous duties which he had to fulfil in the last 11 years, we now propose in this Bill to impose upon him the duty of going at least twice a year to the Assizes; and we propose to put further onerous duties on him of a very personal character, requiring personal contact with the individual patient, if the continuity of the tradition which has been maintained by the Chief Justice is to be kept up.  We propose to put these very onerous duties on the President of the High Court for no reason that has been given and no reason that I can see.  I should like to have some reason.  As no reason was <Col N="936" /> given in answer to my questions on Second Reading, I can only conclude that there is no real reason for this section.</P>
    <P>There was one reason given, an absurd reason, that it was felt by somebody, who was not named, and whom I do not know, that it was not right that in the case of the jurisdiction exercised by the Chief of the Judiciary there should be an appeal from him to the Appeal Court.  That is the only reason that was given.  As I said earlier, that might have been a good reason in 1924, but, after the lapse of 11 years, when the office has built up a new practice and tradition, and it has been handled by one particular man who knows every patient in the lunacy side of the office and every ward in the minor side of the office, that it should be transferred now for that ridiculous reason passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>This section, in my view, is one of the worst sections in the Bill.  I should like to know to what extent the Chief Justice was consulted about this matter. I should have thought that whoever was responsible for initiating this particular section would have taken the trouble to inquire into the position as it exists in that side of the court at present.  I gather from the remarks of the Attorney-General on the Second Reading, when he was introducing it, that the Chief Justice had no objection to the proposal provided certain safeguards were given to him in reference to the staff.  I should like to know, apart from being asked whether he had any objection to this proposal, whether he was consulted as to whether this was a desirable thing to do, in the present circumstances, and after the lapse of 11 years, or whether his experience over those 11 years in dealing with these matters was availed of by the Department of Justice when they made up their minds to bring this revolutionary proposal into this Bill, unasked, unsought for, and undesired.</P>
    <P>If there is anybody in this country who knows that particular branch of the jurisdiction it is the Chief Justice. I think the House is entitled to know from the Minister or the Attorney-General what the views of the Chief Justice are in connection with this <Col N="937" /> transfer.  It is not enough for the Attorney-General to tell the House that the Chief Justice has no objection. Nobody would have any objection when the Minister says to him: &ldquo;We wish to transfer portion of your jurisdiction to another branch of the courts.&rdquo; No judge would feel perhaps that he was entitled to object.  Once the head of the Department of Justice said: &ldquo;In the exercise of my duties as Minister for Justice I think this ought to be transferred,&rdquo; no judge would feel it his duty to object.  Even if he felt it his duty to object, he would only do so to the minimum degree.  If he were asked for his views as to the desirability of such a transfer, then it might be an entirely different matter.  I think the House is entitled to know whether the Chief Justice was or was not consulted on the specific point that I put, not as to whether he had any objection to the transfer, but what were his views as to the suitability, in present circumstances and after the lapse of 11 years, of making the proposed change.  I think we are entitled to get some specific answer to that question, and if the Department of Justice have had the advantage of hearing the views of the Chief Justice on this matter, then I think the House is entitled to hear what these views are.</P>
    <P>Certainly I see no reason for this transfer.  I described it, I think, on the Second Reading as a vicious proposal; if I did not, I so describe it now.  By itself it might have been, again I repeat, a good thing or a bad thing to give this jurisdiction originally to a member of the High Court. But I say that it is entirely unsound and uncalled for when a practice has grown up in an office of this nature, of the delicate kind required in connection with these matters, over a period of 11 years, suddenly to change that entire procedure and practice and to transfer it from one judge to another.  It should not be done unless there are very grave reasons indeed for doing it, and no such reasons have been given.</P>
    <P>Now, when the Chief Justice took over these jurisdictions, he found that to a large extent the affairs of patients in lunacy and wards in minor matters <Col N="938" /> were regulated by the officials.  He conceived, in his wisdom, and very properly as I think, it is admitted on all sides now, that it was his duty to interfere personally and to control personally each individual case and every aspect of each individual case. The result was that he revolutionised the entire practice in reference to the care of patients in lunacy and the care of minors in minor matters, and he has had, according to his evidence before the Joint Committee, a very busy time in connection with the transaction of this jurisdiction.  We all know that he sits there on a Friday&mdash; sometimes until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening&mdash;and that after court every evening he interviews people in connection with these lunacy and minor matters.  He has a peculiar and personal knowledge of each individual case that has gone through his office and that is in his office at the present moment.  That is all going to be taken away at one stroke by one section in this Bill and transferred to a man who has not been dealing with such matters, who cannot have the same intimate knowledge, who has been out of touch and too busy to give the same personal attention as the Chief Justice has been able to give and who, because of the additional duties that will be imposed on him by this Bill, will be unable, in my view, at all events, to give the same personal attention as the Chief Justice gave.  I do protest very strongly, Sir, against this section.  I have heard no reason for it and I await with some interest the reply of the Minister as to whether he has any reason for the introduction of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give the reason that I gave when the Deputy came in, and that is the reason he himself gave; that it does not seem proper that the decision of the Chief Justice should be subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Another reason is that I consider the Chief Justice should be freer for the ordinary business of the Supreme Court.  The Deputy is well aware, and has mentioned it himself, that this matter takes up one day of the Chief Justice's <Col N="939" /> time&mdash;every Friday.  He is engaged on the whole of the Friday dealing with lunacy and minor matters, and the other two judges are not occupied. Surely, that is not a desirable system. It means that the Supreme Court is not working as it might work under the arrangement proposed here.  That is all that is behind the section.  It only proposes to allow the Chief Justice to be freer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, this section should never have been introduced, and the Minister's remarks bear out everything I have said about the section.  The first reason the Minister advances is that it is not proper that there should be an appeal from the Chief Justice to the Supreme Court. What is being done in this Bill?  Provision is being made that there will be an appeal from two Supreme Court judges to three of their colleagues. The Minister objects to an appeal from the Chief Justice to his colleagues, the President and the other two members; but here in the new Bill he is going to make provision which will lead to appeals being had in very small cases, perhaps, from two members of the Supreme Court to their colleagues, or perhaps their colleagues plus some members of their colleagues in the High Court.  The second reason that the Minister puts forward is equally fatuous.  He says that the Chief Justice should be freer for the work of the Supreme Court and that the result of his being engaged on Friday is that the other two members are not free for that court.  Again, I would refer the Minister to the evidence of the Chief Justice before the Joint Committee, in which he said that, when he was sitting on a Friday dealing with these lunacy and minor matters his two colleagues were engaged together working on the cases standing at that day and preparing their judgments and that, when they had prepared them, they all three sat on Saturday to confer on the judgments that were awaiting determination.  In this case, what the Minister is going to do is to impose on judges, who will be already over-worked if this Bill comes into operation, additional <Col N="940" /> duties.  Some judge, be he President of the High Court or anybody else, will have to give the same amount of time&mdash;I think more time, if the work is to be done as well&mdash;as the Chief Justice has given in the past.  So that, instead of two members of the Supreme Court not being occupied, one member of the High Court will be fully occupied and he will dislocate, for one day at least, the remaining business of the High Court.</P>

      <P>The situation which the Deputy mentions will surely be quite easily dealt with by allowing such matters as arise to be dealt with by the judge who is sitting here in Dublin.  I really think the Deputy allows himself to be carried too far by some of the views he holds with regard to this and other sections of the Bill. Everybody agrees that the Chief Justice has been an admirable Judge in charge of lunacy and minor matters. Everybody who is familiar with the work done in that court knows that he has taken a keen personal interest in each case before him.  I cannot see, however, why it should be so unlikely that the President of the High Court, or such other judge of the High Court as may have these duties cast upon him, will not be equally alive to those considerations which induced the Chief Justice to take this personal interest in those who were committed to his charge.  Is it suggested that the Chief Justice has more free time to do that work than a judge of the High Court will have?  As regards the question which the Deputy put to the Minister as to the views of the Chief Justice on this proposal, if the Deputy looks at <Col N="941" /> the evidence which the Chief Justice gave before the Committee, he will see that the Chief Justice, without having the proposal put to him in any concrete way by the Committee, apparently contemplated that a change was proposed, and he did not suggest any reason against it or any of the reasons which the Deputy seems to think he is ready to give against it.</P>

      <P>I did not say the Chief Justice was ready to give reasons against this.  I did not say whether he was ready to give reasons or not.  I do not know what his views are on the subject.  What I want to know is: Was he consulted, and, if so, what were his views as to the desirability of this change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading by implication from the evidence of the Chief Justice that he did not regard it as an astonishing proposition or one to which grave objection could be made, or a proposition against which he had any personal objection. All the Chief Justice said was that if a change were contemplated one man should always be attached to this particular work.  And then he gives the reason that should be given here as to the human element in the business and so on.  I fail to see why it should be anticipated if the President of the High Court feels that he has enough time at his disposal, or if a judge of the High Court is assigned to another court, why it is that an equally keen personal interest will not be taken in the wards of court or patients in lunacy as has been taken by the Chief Justice up to this.  It may, of course, be difficult to get someone who takes such a deep interest in the cases as the Chief Justice does.  But I am quite certain it will not be found that if any judges of the High Court have this work assigned to them they will not be alive to all the considerations put forward here.  I am sure that they will continue the tradition that has been set up by the Chief Justice, and that they will give personal care and attention to the work.  The dislocation in the High Court would not be as much as the dislocation in the Supreme Court, which is put out of action one day in the week by reason of the fact <Col N="942" /> that the Chief Justice is dealing with minors and lunacy cases.  I am unaware, from anything that I have seen from the Chief Justice, from what I have read in his evidence, from any correspondence I have had from him or from what I have heard from him in personal conversation, that he has any aversion to this change arising from such considerations as the Deputy has mentioned or from any other reason.  I rather think that on the whole the Chief Justice favours this change, subject to the conditions he mentioned in his evidence and on which he feels very strongly.  The matters to which the Deputy takes such very strong objection are matters about which I am quite certain the Chief Justice does not feel any objection.</P>

      <P>I do feel that we are being somewhat fooled by phrases at the moment.  The Attorney-General on the Second Reading said that he had certain doubts as to whether this change was possible or not in the case of minors and in lunacy cases.  He told us that the Chief Justice was approached and that the matter was discussed with him.  The Chief Justice expressed his willingness provided that certain safeguards were given&mdash;such as that there should be one judge to deal with lunacy and minors' affairs, and that subject to these safeguards he expressed his willingness to have these matters transferred from him.  The Attorney-General returned to that, but he dealt with none of the objections raised by Deputy Costello.  The Chief Justice said: &ldquo;If it is going to be <Col N="943" /> changed from me, I suggest that in such matters as the registrar there should be continuity through one judge.&rdquo;  It is pertinent to inquire whether the safeguards were adopted, and I am clear now that they were not, from what the Attorney-General has said.  He talks of the dislocation of business.  But what will happen when eight judges are out at assizes on business during the year?  Who will look after these matters then?  There are going to be regular changes in the judge dealing with these matters.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>If I am personally told that the Chief Justice thinks this is a desirable change, I will not for a moment give my opinion against his. The Chief Justice has experience, and none of us are fitted to give an opinion contrary to that experience.  But if I am being told that the Chief Justice offered no violent objection to the change, I take it that he was delicately dealing with what he thought was a bad change, and not that he was acquiescing in it or favouring it in any way.  The peculiar thing to me is that from the evidence given before the Joint Committee the Attorney-General quoted the Chief Justice as saying: &ldquo;if a change were contemplated.&rdquo; It was not put to him that it was contemplated. He was all the time speaking on the point of continuity in connection with the one matter requiring the attention of one man who had enormous experience and a tender feeling for humanity.  The whole text of his argument is &ldquo;keep it in the hands of one man,&rdquo; and then he threw out the statement, &ldquo;if a change were contemplated.&rdquo;  He might have added &ldquo;keep it in the hands of one man.&rdquo; The Committee heard his evidence on that point, and they made minor recommendations.  Recommendation 95 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" />&ldquo;If provisions are to be made for a graduated percentage charge for the administration of the assets of minors and a system of visitation of minors be adopted similar to that in existence in the case of persons of unsound mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They adverted specially to the question of minors and lunatics.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice was questioned as to the taking up of his time and the dislocation of the Supreme Court, and as to whether, taking the other side of the argument, if the Supreme Court was not interrupted or the minors' work interrupted, and he said: &ldquo;No: there was no actual hold-up of business; everything was up-to-date there.&rdquo;  He said that the minor and lunacy matters were up-to-date, and he gave an answer that may not commend itself to the Department of Finance; I think their memorandum is still in the back of the minds of the two people who are speaking for the Government on this Bill.  I know that the idea that the judges do no work except when sitting on the bench, was always paraded by the sort of finance mind which appears to be rather accepted by the two people with legal experience.  They accepted the view that the High Court is being put out of action.  I did not think they would give a lodgment to the thought that because the judge is being absent from the bench, his colleagues are not doing any work.  The whole matter was thrashed out before the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the view of the Chief Justice is, but I do know that his way of administering these matters has met with universal approbation.  He has got praise from everybody for his administration of these matters.  Why is the change being made?  Two points are being stressed: one of these is the illogical situation that a member of the Supreme Court is subject to appeal.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice also sits in the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court. There have not been any of these, but that is because an unfortunate decision ruled that leave to appeal was in the control, not of the higher of the two <Col N="945" /> courts, but of the lower.  There is a recommendation from the Council of the Bar against that.  Deputy Costello has pointed out that there is a new illogicality being introduced, that members of the Supreme Court are being sent out on circuits as High Court judges and they will be subject to appeal, so that the occasions on which this illogical procedure will take place are being multiplied.  Then there is the dislocation of business.  I think the Chief Justice's answer must commend itself to anybody who knows the work of the Supreme Court.  The position is that we are going to have the High Court now with more work to do and the Supreme Court with not more work to do but with more people to do whatever is to be done.  It is proposed to take away business from the Supreme Court and hand it to a member of the High Court, which in the ordinary course is going to be given more work.  The Attorney-General made an answer which reveals a bad tendency and that is that, whoever is sitting, the High Court judge on circuit in Dublin will attend to these minor matters and matters of lunacy.</P>

      <P>It certainly means a lack of continuity.  There is no argument from the Committee, and there is no argument based on any evidence given before the Committee.  There is no argument on the illogical proceeding, when the occasions for illogical proceeding are multiplied.  I would like to stress this point again.  There was always present in the minds of the people who were opposed to any enlargement of the court system, always running through their writings or arguments, the view that nobody in the legal profession did any work except when he was in court.  There is no such thing as a man requiring time to make up his mind or form a judgment.  The recommendations of the Finance Department in all this matter amounted to making the judges sit oftener, earlier in the morning and later at night.  Apparently they thought they would get court work better done.  There was the sort of <Col N="946" /> attitude of mind that you could rule the work of a judge more or less as you rule the work of a manual labourer&mdash; what time did he spend on the job in the open.  That mentality is apparently part of the make-up of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>If the Attorney-General has the view-point that the Supreme Court is put out of action when the Chief Justice is not there, it surely is accepting some of the viewpoints of the people who think you measure a judge's work by the hours of sitting in court?  The Attorney-General spoke about the time the High Court may have to spend.  Are there not entirely different considerations? The Chief Justice, after 11 years, faced with any problem in relation to minors, will surely occupy less time on it than the most experienced High Court judge faced with the same problem and having had no experience?  Is not the question of dealing with this a matter of the association of experience and the time that has to be spent?  I cannot accept the view that anybody is going to deal with these matters, lacking experience, either as efficiently or as speedily as the Chief Justice after 11 years.</P>

      <P>On the point as to whether or not the Supreme Court is put out of action by reason of the Chief Justice sitting on minor and lunacy matters on Friday, I would like to put the practitioner's point of view to the Attorney-General.  To anybody engaged, particularly in the Supreme Court, it is an intense relief to have the Friday to do other work which must be done and which was neglected in preceding days.  It also gives one an opportunity to make up further arguments for the following Monday in the event of a case continuing.  I regard myself from the point of view of a practitioner who looks upon the Friday intermission in the Supreme Court as really a blessing.</P>

      <P>In the old days the Lord Chancellors took very little or no <Col N="947" /> interest in the welfare, the comfort or the treatment of patients confined to mental homes.  As a matter of fact, when Sir Edward Sugden, afterwards Lord St. Leonards, was appointed Lord Chancellor here, he took it into his head to visit the Richmond Asylum, as it was then called.  It was a marvellous change for a man in his position at that time to make a visit of that sort.  He arrived at the institution, walked in in all his power, majesty and glory.  He was detained for some time and he lost his temper. When the resident medical superintendent came up, he (the resident medical superintendent) eyed him very suspiciously. He looked around to see if there were any attendants in the neighbourhood, and he said: &ldquo;My dear Sir, what brings you here?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I am the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.&rdquo; The resident medical superintendent had never seen any Lord Chancellor, and he said: &ldquo;My dear Sir, we have <Col N="948" /> exactly 17 Lord Chancellors already in this house.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the present Chief Justice has revolutionised all that.  He has taken a keen, an active and a personal interest in every case, either on the minor side or the lunacy side of his court.  Everybody in the country knows that quite well, and I know many relatives of mentally afflicted persons who never tire of praising him for the charitable interest he has taken in their friends.  I do think that, apart from any other consideration, it would be very unfair to deprive him of the jurisdiction hitherto exercised by him as more or less the successor of the old Lord Chancellors without at least consulting him and getting from him a clear expression of opinion that he is in favour of the change.  That has not been done, so far as I am aware.</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8 of the Principal Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal constituted under that section may, on any occasion, consist of two judges of the Supreme Court (whether the Chief Justice and an ordinary judge or two ordinary judges) and one judge of the High Court (whether the President of the High Court or an ordinary judge), and the said Section 8 shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>

      <P>In page 7, Section 10, lines 9-14, to delete all from and including the words &ldquo;may, on any occasion&rdquo; down to the end of line 14, and substitute the words &ldquo;shall consist of three judges of the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that the Court of Criminal Appeal in the future shall consist entirely of High Court judges in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At the moment the practice is and for some time past has been that one at least of the Supreme Court judges comes into the Court of Criminal Appeal, and sits on the hearing.  We take the view that the Supreme Court should be entirely aloof; that it should be completely apart from the High Court, and that by reason of the fact that it would have or ought to have five permanent members in its composition, and of the fact that it is aloof, it would command more respect than if it were to perform functions both as an appeal tribunal and as a tribunal of first instance. It is in accordance with this principle that we put down this amendment. That principle is carried through in our amendments throughout this Bill. We believe that the Supreme Court should be entirely apart; that the High Court should do its own work, and that there should be appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court even in the case of criminal matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As things stand at the moment there is no appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal except on the certificate of the Attorney-General, or the certificate of the Court of Criminal Appeal itself.  We think it is a bad principle that the prosecutor in the case should be the person to say whether or not there should be an appeal.  We think it is a bad principle that the court from which the appeal is being taken should itself say in any case, and particularly in a criminal one, whether the case they have just decided is or is not of such importance as to warrant an appeal to the Supreme Court.  Our idea is that the Court of Criminal Appeal should consist in the first instance of three members of the High Court, and that in so far as there is an appeal from their decision the giving of a certificate should rest entirely with the Supreme Court and not with the High Court, or the Court of Criminal Appeal constituted from the High Court; in other words, that instead of this Court of Criminal Appeal, as it stands at the moment, giving a certificate, it is the Supreme Court itself that should give that certificate for leave to appeal.  We think that is in accordance with principle, and would be a good reform. When the Court of Criminal Appeal was being set up in this country for the first time, the majority of the <Col N="951" /> members of the High Court were new in their judicial functions.  A new system was being set up to a great extent, and new judges were being assigned to the new posts in the High Court.  It was felt that it might command confidence in the Court of Criminal Appeal, that it might lay down the lines along which the Court of Criminal Appeal should direct their attention in hearing criminal appeals, and that by reason of the fact that there was really no effective appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal it was right and proper that the Chief Justice or a member of the Supreme Court should normally sit with the Court of Criminal Appeal.  We think the time is now ripe for the further development of the whole system in connection with criminal matters.  We do not at all suggest that in criminal matters there should be unlimited appeals.  It would be waste of public time, and waste of public and private money, that there should be that interminable system of criminal appeal which one understands exists in the United States.  We do not stand for that at all, but we do think that in a very important case there should be appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The position as it stands at the moment is that the Attorney-General, who is the prosecutor in the case and consequently an interested party to some extent, although he represents the public, is the person to say whether or not he will give a certificate. Since the State was founded here, and the Court of Criminal Appeal established, I do not think there has ever been an instance where the Attorney-General did in fact give any such certificate.  In practice, I think the Attorney-General would never give such certificate, because it would in fact mean, or may be regarded as, some sort of vote of censure on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It really puts the Attorney-General in a very invidious position.  On one occasion when the Attorney-General in England gave a certificate&mdash;one of the few occasions on which he did give it &mdash; for leave to appeal to the House of Lords from <Col N="952" /> the Court of Criminal Appeal, he was very severely censured by the House of Lords for giving it.  I think the Attorney-General should be relieved of that task of having to make up his mind in a case of death &mdash; because those are really the cases where the matter becomes most important&mdash; whether or not he would give a certificate for leave to appeal.  It is indivious, as I say, for the Attorney-General to have that power.  In the case of death there is an application in practically every case for such a certificate.  In practically every case he must refuse it.  In every case which comes before the Court of Criminal Appeal, where a death sentence is imposed, it is certainly a matter of supreme importance for the person against whom the sentence is pronounced that he should have an opportunity of going to the highest tribunal in the country.</P>

We feel it is not right that the court which has just decided a case should be called upon to say that perhaps their decision was wrong, and that there is something in it which the Supreme Court might set right. Consequently, we are putting those amendments down with a view to consideration by the Government as to whether &mdash; now that the judges of the High Court have had considerable experience in criminal matters and in relation to appeals in criminal matters, now that the public mind has become accustomed to appeals in criminal cases, and that the practice and the law have become more largely established in the last 11 years by the Court of Criminal Appeal &mdash; the time is ripe for a further advance in having a Court of Criminal Appeal consisting of High Court judges, who have had experience of hearing cases in the Central Criminal Court; and then, in very exceptional cases, an appeal to the Supreme Court, such appeal, perhaps, only to be allowed on the certificate of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I feel that the Minister for Finance is not meeting the local bodies fairly in this matter. There is no justification for cutting down this grant, particularly this year. He must be aware of the difficulties the farmers are in at the present time. They are in a position in which they are unable to pay their ordinary liabilities, and it is not fair that they should be asked to pay more than they had to pay for the last couple of years. The figures in relation to this matter have been dealt with here by other speakers and I do not want to go into them now.  There is no use in labouring the point, but the Minister should have met the local bodies more generously in this case.  I protest against this cutting down of the agricultural grant on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I believe there is another aspect of the question which is worth considering. It is that it is being made impossible for local bodies to carry on. Increased liabilities are being imposed on these bodies by reason of their having to carry out building schemes in order to relieve the unemployment situation in the country. Various liabilities are being imposed upon them which will necessitate further grants and, instead of cutting down their grants, they are entitled to get extra grants.  At the same time, if it is made impossible for those bodies to function, as it is being made impossible, it will provide the Minister for Local Government with a pretext for abolishing them.  A certain number of them have been abolished already and it seems to be the policy of the Government to make it impossible for these bodies to function so that they will all be abolished.  I think this is a step in that direction, and that aspect of the question should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> I wish on behalf of County Cavan to protest against this cutting down of the Agricultural Grant.  I think County Cavan cannot be charged with trying to evade its liabilities.  The farmers there have always paid their way.  I do not think they deserve much credit for that, but they do deserve credit from the Government from their point of view, because they always try to meet their liabilities.  The farmers of the whole country, as a rule, are remarkable for their honesty and for trying to pay their way, but when they try to do the impossible the Government, instead of going part of the way to meet them and removing some of the difficulties from their path, throw fresh obstacles before them.  It is a question of spurring them on until there is a complete collapse.  I am afraid local bodies will find it impossible to function if the Minister will not consider increasing this grant and giving them some assistance in their efforts to get out of their difficulties. If, later on, it is found that the Minister for Local Government removes some of the local bodies, it ought to be understood that it is not the fault of these bodies, because it seems to be the settled policy of the Government to make things impossible for them so that they may be abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt at all that the present policy of the Government in asking local ratepayers to pay for defaulting land annuitants is one that is leading to a great deal of chaos. The Minister may say, of course, that it is not absolutely their policy, but that it is contained in certain Acts of Parliament.  We all know that, but we are living in times when the ratepayers find it difficult to pay either land annuities or local rates, and I suggest that the Minister and his Government ought to reconsider the whole situation, because the position is getting worse each year.  County councils are carrying over a large amount of arrears from year to year, and not alone that, but in consequence of the inability of certain ratepayers to pay in certain areas, many of the county councils are not budgeting sufficiently to meet the demands upon them during the <Col N="956" /> financial year.  The result of that is that things are going to be worse year after year.</P>
      <P>While I have a good deal of sympathy with the farmers in this connection, one very seldom hears any voice at all raised for the town ratepayer. There are a good many shopkeepers to-day in a struggling position because the farmers are not able to meet their demands.  The shopkeepers have given a good deal of credit to farmers, and I do think that, in some way, some of this grant should be made available for town ratepayers.  They are suffering in consequence of what people are pleased to call the economic war.</P>

It is not fair to ask local ratepayers to pay money in lieu of moneys not paid in the shape of land annuities.  What happens is that the person who does not pay his annuity is also the person who does not pay his rates, and the man who pays both his annuities and his rates is called upon to pay for the man who defaults in both cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like in connection with this Vote to join with other Deputies in protesting against the reduction of the Agricultural Grant on this occasion.  I think the Government ought to look at the matter from a reasonable point of view. <Col N="957" /> As Deputy Corish sat down, he mentioned a matter to which I made reference on a recent occasion &mdash; the injustice of expecting farmers to pay their rates in the shape of annuities for those who do not pay them &mdash; and the answer I got from the Government Benches was that it would require legislation to effect the necessary change.  The position of land tenure and of the Agricultural Grant down along the ages needs remedying, and if any other class of the community but the farmers was suffering so much, the Government would be called on to remedy the position.</P>
      <P>The Government say that there is a &ldquo;No Rates&rdquo; campaign on foot and that people are holding up the rates. In my own county, in 1931-32, the amount demanded from the rate-paying community, of which the farmers are the largest section, was £78,000.  This year the sum of £135,000 is demanded from the ratepayers, less, of course, the £12,000 for credit notes. That is an increase of £45,376.  Is it not plain to everyone that one of the greatest defaulters in connection with the rates is the Government itself, in the reductions which it has made from time to time in the Agricultural Grant for one reason or another?  If it is the law that the Government must deduct the amount of unpaid annuities from the Agricultural Grant, well then I think the law should be remedied, and it is time that it was.  Some Government will come into power that will remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to trace the whole history of the Agricultural Grant.  I know it goes back for long ages, and that justice demanded that it should be given.  When the members of the present Government were in Opposition they were loud in denouncing the injustice that was being done to the farmers in connection with rates and everything else.  What is the position of the ratepayer to-day or of the county councils?  I have before me a return showing the percentage of rates paid to the various county councils.  Let me take some examples at random.  The percentage of rates paid in the County Clare is only 3.8 per cent.  That is the position in the <Col N="958" /> President's constituency.  It is one of the lowest percentages in the country. There is no such thing as a no-rate campaign there, but there is an absolute inability on the part of the farmers and of other sections of the community to meet the demands that are made on them.  Deputy Corish has referred to the position of the townspeople. I am interested in the rates paid in the local towns.  Not long ago I met the chairman of an urban council who differs from me in politics.  He told me that the people in that town were not able to meet their demands. He said that his rates some years ago were 10/- in the £, and that now they were 20/- in the £.  The townspeople are not able to meet the demands made on them.  The towns are suffering through loss of trade.  Deputy Corish said, and I was glad to hear him refer to it, that the townspeople are unable to collect their debts.  It would be well if the Government and Deputy Corry would ask themselves the reason why.</P>

      <P>It is time that cry was left out of consideration.  The rate collection was never as low as it is at the present time.  In my own county, only 8 per cent. of the rates have been collected, and this is the time the Government select to reduce the agricultural grant.  I repeat what I said earlier, that the Government themselves are the greatest defaulters in connection with the payment of the local rates. That may be a hard statement to make, but I stand over it.  There is no use in thinking that things can go on as they are.  The arrears of rates are mounting up every day.  The local authorities are unable to collect them.  I suppose that in some cases they are reluctant to go to such extremes as the Government have gone to.  This is the time that the Government seek to reduce the agricultural grant.  I would like to remind them of the views they expressed in the past when they talked about derating for the farming community. I remember that when Deputy Corry sat on these benches he made a statement to this effect: &ldquo;Did anybody think that the farmers of the <Col N="959" /> North were going to come into the Free State to have the privilege of paying rates?&rdquo; I wonder what is his view on that question now?  Is he prepared to go down the country and repeat the statement he made here last night, that everything is grand? Does he remember the time when he used to denounce the big salaries that were being paid?  We did not hear him talk much last evening on the Courts of Justice Bill when provisions were passed enabling new appointments to be made at a cost of thousands of pounds to the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I realise that and I apologise.  Deputy Corry is in the House, and it is no harm to remind him of the statements he used to make when he sat on these benches.  He is now going to support this reduction of £100,000 in the agricultural grant that was intended for the relief of the farming community.  I protest against this reduction.  It is an injustice and is going to impose severe hardships on the rate-paying section of the community. The Minister for Finance has his own special care, his own special baby, so to speak, the finances of the State.  Probably he does not care where the money comes from.  I have noticed for a long time that the effect of legislation introduced by the Government is to increase more and more the burden on the ratepayers.  They are increasing the local services and the social services, but while they do that they put the burden of maintaining these services principally on the farming community.  In my opinion, if local services have to be increased the Government should seek for some source out of which to finance them other than the `farmers' pockets. Deputies may talk about the grand roads that we have, but it is immaterial to 90 per cent. of the farmers whether a man with a motor car can do 90 miles an hour or nine miles an hour on our roads.  These grand roads are of little advantage to the farmer.  His main concern is with the amount of rates he has to pay.  In conclusion, I protest <Col N="960" /> against this reduction in the agricultural grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we discussed for a period the setting up of a Select Committee to investigate the incidence of certain duties.  We can get some reflection of the incidence of those duties in the figures that relate to this problem.  In connection with this grant, there is a reduction of £100,000 in the amount we are discussing as between this year and last year. The Government consider, looking at the country through their rosy-coloured spectacles, that it is so much better off that they can reduce the amount given by way of relief of rates by £100,000. Yet, the situation as it is cannot be denied.  The figures are there to show it.  In regard to the withheld annuities, there is the sum of £750,000 that had to be met, and the county councils, faced with that, have made provision for less than £160,000.  Therefore, there is staring them in the face, unprovided for, the sum of £560,000.  That is only the arrears.  There will be further the unpaid land annuities that fall due this year to be met by the county councils.  That sum of £750,000 was not to any great extent an accumulation. It was a new default in the payment of land annuities.  Some portion of it, probably the whole of it, will recur again this year.  At any rate, there is the sum of £560,000 to be got somewhere and it will be got out of the ratepayer.  There is the possibility that the greater part, if not all, of the £750,000 that occurred last year will recur this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another figure.  There was always a certain amount of money carried forward from one year to another as rates not collected in the year in which they should have been collected and sent forward for collection the next year.  I suppose the average would be £100,000.  Certainly the average of £100,000 would be putting it too high in, say, the year 1931. We find that the sum of £330,000 is carried forward this year, and that is not land annuities.  That is ordinary rates, so that you have the ratepayer faced with this: that of last year's unpaid annuities of £750,000 there is provision made for about £159,000; <Col N="961" /> there is £560,000 yet to be provided somewhere, probably out of the ratepayers, and there is going to be added to that whatever default there is in the payment of land annuities this year.  In addition, there has been carried forward £330,000 in rates not regarded as uncollectable but to be collected this year.  We get then: £560,000, plus £750,000, which I admit is an estimate, plus £330,000.</P>
    <P>I remember that in this year the warrants struck for rates are nearly £500,000 in excess of 1931.  I am speaking now of the ordinary rates, leaving out the arrears, etc.  The rates struck in this year are nearly £500,000 in excess of what they were in 1931. With the rates up by nearly £500,000, with a carry-forward of £330,000&mdash; nearly £250,000 more than what was the average &mdash; and with the possibility of a recurrence of the £750,000 unpaid annuities, and with £560,000 definitely unpaid annuities not provided for, the Government think that this is the time to reduce this grant by £100,000. Leaving out the taxes that have been imposed on tea, bread, sugar and other things, we get from those figures a picture of the devastation that has been caused throughout the countryside. The ratepayer has to provide £500,000 more this year than in any year before through the new duties and the new obligations in relation to the so-called benefits.  There is the £750,000 in connection with the land annuities, and the possibility of that recurring this year, the £560,000 not provided for, and the £330,000 of a carry-forward of unpaid rates from last year.  That is the position at a time when Deputy Corish talks about the urban dweller, and it is at this time the Government are making a reduction of £100,000 in the agricultural grant.  That is the position in which the rural ratepayer and the town dweller find themselves to-day as compared with, say, 1931, when the amount paid by way of home assistance ran from£11,000 in May to about £12,500 in December.  Take what is being paid now by way of home assistance and unemployment assistance.  If you take the average weekly payments for the last week in one month you find that the comparative figures are: £10,000 <Col N="962" /> has moved up to £19,000 in May, 1934, and to £44,000 in 1935.  From June, 1931, the £10,000 goes up to £21,000 in 1934, and in June, 1935, it moves up to £45,000, until in the end it reaches a steady total of £34,000 a week.  That gives a reflex of the situation in the towns.  The situation in the country is as I have already pointed out, and it is in these circumstances that this grant is being reduced by £100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>I want to protest against this reduction.  I do not propose to enter into the matter very far except to draw the attention of the House to the condition in which the farmers in my constituency find themselves. The reduction of the agricultural grant in these two counties will have very serious reactions.  The County Longford is composed mostly of small farmers.  These men are very hard workers.  They are principally engaged in tillage.  They find themselves absolutely unable to meet the demands made on them either for rates or land annuities.  They are making every effort to pay their rates. Hardships are being imposed on them which they should not be called upon to bear.  In Westmeath, the situation is even worse although the increase in the rates in Longford is pretty extensive.  It is more extensive than in Westmeath.  Later on I propose to deal with the figures.  I remember well the lavish promises that were made in these two counties in 1930 and 1931. It is very hard to reconcile the promises that were then made with the manner in which effect has been given to them.  Glowing promises were made to the people at that time.  I have here a pamphlet that was issued by the Fianna Fáil Party in Longford-Westmeath during the by-election campaign at which Deputy Geoghegan was the Fianna Fáil candidate.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that it is, because I think this is one of the documents that will stand as a monument for all ages.  These promises were made and broken by Fianna Fáil in the constituency.  Here is the <Col N="963" /> sort of thing that went on: They pointed out the amount Longford paid in rates and they pointed out the amount Westmeath paid in rates. Then they told the people of Longford-Westmeath that if the Government elected by the people would only stand by the rights of the people, the farmers, householders and shopkeepers of Longford-Westmeath need not pay one penny in rates; the land annuities would do the whole thing and leave £30,000 over for the aid of agriculture.  They said, &ldquo;£1,400,000 was taken out of the pockets of Longford-Westmeath farmers.  End this robbery and vote No. 1 Geoghegan.&rdquo; There is no question that that statement was cleverly worded, inasmuch as the President, or the Minister for Finance, can say that they did not promise derating exactly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what they have at the top of the circular &mdash; I admit it is not in the body of it&mdash;&ldquo;Longford-Westmeath can derate itself.  Vote No. 1 Geoghegan.&rdquo;  I should like to know what exactly that means if it is not a promise that if the people of Longford-Westmeath did a certain thing, the Government would do the rest for them.  What has happened in Westmeath?  At that time the total assessment in Westmeath was £76,000 and the total warrant £77,600.  There were arrears of £1,800 carried forward.  At the end of the period, the total amount outstanding was only £6,000.  In 1933-34, there was an increase in the warrant of nearly £10,000.  In the present year, 1935-36, the total warrant is £116,693. If you subtract £77,000&mdash;the total warrant for 1931-32 &mdash; you get an increase of over £39,000 in rates in that county.  And this is the time that the Government decide to reduce the agricultural grant&mdash;a reduction which will hit a county like Westmeath very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will certainly hit counties like Westmeath very seriously.  Worse than that, the demand does not represent the total liabilities of the county <Col N="964" /> council and local authorities by any stretch of imagination.  The land annuities outstanding have increased to such an extent that we find for 1935-36 the total deficiency was £47,000, and of that the local authorities only budgeted for £23,000, leaving £24,000 to be carried forward.  When everything is taken into consideration the County of Westmeath will find, even though they get the full amount of the warrant, itself with £29,000 on the wrong side.  Yet at such a time the agricultural grant is decreased.  That is the position in counties like Longford and Westmeath, to which these promises were made by Eamonn Donnelly and published by James Geoghegan.  I think these promises should be encased in something and sent to the Museum as a monument of national importance to be preserved for all time.</P>
    <P>The people in these counties are hard workers.  They made efforts to meet the Government's wishes by increasing tillage but, notwithstanding that, they find themselves in a worse position than ever.  I am quite candid when I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter, and not to impose this hardship upon people who deserve better treatment.  The people now find that the pig trade, into which they entered, has burst and that at the last two or three fairs at Longford and Edgeworthstown prices were reduced to such an extent that they were heartbroken.  Yet this is the time that the Government decides to reduce the agricultural grant.  I notice that my colleague from Longford is in the House, and if he says what he believes to be true he will endorse every word of mine, as far as Longford and Westmeath &mdash; Longford in particular &mdash; are concerned.  The Minister should reconsider the matter and if he does not honour the bond which was given, he should at least restore the agricultural grant to the original figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this debate has gone on for a considerable time under some misapprehension as to the purpose of the Estimate and the ability of the House to alter it or to complain about the <Col N="965" /> amount that we now propose to vote for the completion of the scheme for the relief of rates on agricultural land, as was set out in the Act which was passed to regulate that matter in the last session, the Agricultural Land (Relief of Rates) Act, 1935.  The House heard the merits of that measure discussed at great length, and ultimately in its wisdom decided that it should be adopted and enacted as a statute.  The only thing we are empowered to do at this stage is to discuss whether or not the amount proposed in the Estimate is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Bill. However, the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; seems to exercise a baneful influence on some sections of the House. Its mere appearance on the Order Paper creates a brain storm there so that in a whirlwind of fantasy, everything irrelevant to the matter under discussion can be dragged in and debated.  Deputy MacEoin, who has left the House, excelled in that respect. He even managed to discuss the price of pigs.</P>
      <P>One thing is, I think, clear from the discussion, that most of the Deputies who spoke in this debate did not trouble to make up their case.  Deputy Brennan, who opened the attack for the Opposition, stated that things were worse this year than last year.  He implied that the rates were being collected less efficiently, that they were coming in more slowly, and yet, the very figures which he had before him, and from which he quoted, were a clear refutation of that statement, because those figures show even though the rate collection is not as satisfactory as it might be, it is better than last year.  The amount of rates outstanding on September 30th of last year was 96.3 of the total warrant.  On the corresponding date this year the amount was only 90.7.  I am not going to say that that is a fully satisfactory position, but there may be an explanation for it.  If we look at the counties we see that a couple of counties stand out in a very favourable light indeed, and they are not by any means the richest counties in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at Cavan we find that the percentage of the total warrant outstanding <Col N="966" /> on September 30th, 1935, is 70.8.  It does not seem to be very good, but it is better than the average for the whole country at September 30th, 1931.  In Mayo, which is not by any means a wealthy county, the amount outstanding was 75 per cent. of the total warrant.  That is extraordinary in two counties that have been favoured less by nature than other counties, and that are not at all as rich in soil or natural resources as Cork, Limerick or Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And parts of Clare. These two counties have done signally well.  There must be, I think, something other than an economic explanation of the fact that in some counties, and particularly in wealthy counties, the rate collection is not so satisfactory as it ought otherwise to be.  We were told by Deputy Brennan that things were worse this year than last year.  So far as the rates are concerned, while the collection is not as satisfactory as we would like it to be, nevertheless it is better than last year.</P>
      <P>Again, take the case of the annuities. The collection of the land annuities has enormously improved.  The normal collection has enormously improved and not only are the annuities coming in very much better than last year, but over £1,065,000 of the accumulated arrears have been collected as well.  Certainly, I cannot see how any person with these figures before him could contend, as far as the land annuities go, that things are worse this year than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, Deputy Brennan said that the overdrafts to local authorities were increasing.  Deputy Brennan had a question down to the Minister for Local Government on 30th October as to the total indebtedness of local authorities on 30th September last.  I think the Deputy must have forgotten the figures supplied to him on that occasion, because they indicated that the indebtedness of the local authorities on 30th September of this year was £28,000 less than on 30th September of last year.  Again I say that under the three main heads &mdash; the collection of rates, the collection of annuities, and the total indebtedness <Col N="967" /> of the local authorities, things are better than last year.</P>
    <P>On the question of the amount of the reduction of the grant, while the amount which is devoted to the relief of agriculturists in this particular form has been slightly reduced, nevertheless the local authorities have been relieved of a very great burden indeed in respect to outdoor relief and social services.</P>

The argument is this: We have reduced the Agricultural Grant by £100,000 as compared with last year, the grant for <Col N="968" /> which was higher than any grant ever given under the previous Administration, but as an offset to that we have brought in the Unemployment Assistance Act, under which, after making allowances for contributions by the local authorities and everything else, there is a net payment to the order of £1,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Act is now in operation and the money will have to be paid out this year.  The widows and orphans will have to get the pensions in any event.  We shall pay out under that heading approximately £200,000.  That makes a total of £1,700,000.  Whether the local authorities are paying more in outdoor relief or not, the fact remains that the Exchequer is putting into possession of very poor people up and down the country £1,700,000.  As they have to pay rents and rates like everybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In so far as that money is being distributed through the country; in so far as the local authorities have been relieved&mdash; greatly relieved in some cases &mdash; and <Col N="969" /> rates have been greatly reduced by the introduction of the Unemployment Assistance Act, we have very much more than offset that reduction of £100,000 in the agricultural grant.</P>

      <P>I was afraid that the Deputy was going to ask me if I agreed with what Gladstone said in 1882, because both questions would be equally relevant.  Deputy Brennan said that local authorities, by reason of the uncollected arrears of land annuities, had been mulcted in the sum of £716,000.  That is quite true, but the Deputy might have been able to make a stronger case if he had been candid and had pointed out that the Exchequer had advanced to the Guarantee Fund a sum of £550,000, which almost completely offset the amount which had been withheld in the Supplementary Agricultural Grant from the local authorities.  That, certainly, was not of inconsiderable assistance to them.</P>

      <P>Yes, as an offset to the £716,000 impounded by the Guarantee Fund, this advance of £550,000 was given in respect of funded arrears yet to be collected, arrears the collection of which will be spread over 40 years.</P>

      <P>It was agreed that as these arrears were collected they would go into the Guarantee Fund in the ordinary way and release from the Fund an equivalent amount of agricultural grants that had been stopped by our predecessors.  But it was not agreed, and no person ever gave an undertaking, that the £716,000 would be paid out immediately.  That undertaking was never given.  In fact, so far as I have any responsibility for the administration of the Guarantee Fund, it was not my intention to make any advance whatsoever in respect of those arrears.  The policy that I had mapped out was that, as the arrears came in, then the county councils, in whose areas they had been collected, would get credit for them.  But, as I say, in view of the amount of current arrears that had accumulated rapidly, <Col N="972" /> we have reversed that policy and made a very substantial advance in respect of those funded and uncollected arrears to offset the £716,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not finding fault with the Minister or with the Government on that point.  What I was endeavouring to show was that £716,000 was withheld from the local authorities, that there was £550,000 of that unprovided for in the estimates of the local authorities and, as a result, the county councils were faced with a terrible situation, irrespective of what you gave last year or any other year, by way of moneys out of the Guarantee Fund, which does not affect that situation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does.  I think it has helped them very materially. There is just one other point that I ought to deal with before I conclude, and that is, that there seems to be some apprehension, as a result of the reduction in the Supplementary Agricultural Grant which we have made this year and of the provisions of the Act under which the money has been voted, that the small farmer would suffer.  The fact of the matter is that the farmer of £20 valuation and under cannot possibly be in any worse position than he was last year. Furthermore, I think that so far as the farmers who are entitled to what is known as the employment allowance are concerned they will not suffer either; it is only the people, in fact, who do not give employment commensurate with the area of land which they hold who will be hurt.  Therefore I think that the prophecies which have been made here as to the devastating effect which the reduction in the amount of the grant is going to have on agriculture generally <Col N="973" /> are not well-founded.  I am perfectly certain it will be found that the provision which we are now making will be ample and will be sufficient to enable all farmers who are genuinely attempting to work their land to meet their obligations to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>With regard to this section, Sir, it provides that every veterinary officer, appointed under Section 11 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as amended by Section 22 of the Local Government Act, 1925, and so on, shall perform such duties as shall from time to time be assigned to him by the Minister or <Col N="975" /> by the sanitary authority concerned with the consent of the Minister.  Now, during the Second Reading I drew attention to the operation of this section, or rather to Section 7, with regard to expenses, and the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the expenditure would be light on local authorities as, under Section 6, provision was being made for the execution of those duties arising under the Act by the existing officers.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if the extra duties entailed are going to be paid for by the Minister.  Local authorities have appointed officers to do certain work such as meat inspection, milk inspection, dairy inspection, and other work of that nature.  When these positions were advertised, they carried with them certain obligations for the applicants which the applicants, on appointment, are fulfilling.  Now, new duties are being cast upon them, and who is going to pay them for these additional duties?  Is the Minister going to assign the duties to these people who are servants of the board of health, and compel the board of health to pay for them?</P>

      <P>If any additional expense is incurred as a result of the enactment of this measure, it will, of course, as Deputy Brennan anticipates, be borne by the local rates.  Under Section 6, however, as the Deputy rightly points out, the Minister has power to assign the duties of enforcing this Act, but it is not anticipated that the carrying out of such duties, or the enforcement of this Act or any of the regulations made under it, will involve increased remuneration to the sanitary officers.  The veterinary officers who will operate this Act are, under existing regulations, required to visit slaughterhouses as part of their duty at the present time, and the Act does not entail or will not entail any further work on them than that. Accordingly, I still maintain and repeat that the expenses that will be incurred in operating this Bill are negligible, and the Deputy need not worry unduly about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be able to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's view that it will not entail further expense, but I have a very clear recollection of veterinary officers being appointed in the early '20s when there was a suspension of the bovine tuberculosis regulation, and I also recollect its being brought into operation again in, I think, 1926, when the local authorities were authorised to increase the payment of all veterinary officers.  After all, even though veterinary officers, under another Act, have to visit slaughterhouses and so on, for the purpose of meat inspection, there are many more matters contained in this Bill of a different character, such as the construction of buildings, the instruments to be employed for the purpose of slaughtering, and so on; and I do not at all agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is not going to be an increased expenditure.  I protested before and I protest again now against the central authority passing Acts of Parliament and forcing the local authority to bear the expenditure of carrying them out.  I think that a matter like this is really a nationals matter and that the expenditure ought to be borne by the Exchequer and not by the local authorities.  Consequently, I am objecting to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to the increased taxation.  However, there is something in Deputy Brennan's point that the Parliamentary Secretary has not answered.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not answer it but he tried to glide over it by pointing out that veterinary officers, under other Acts, are bound to visit slaughterhouses. We all know, however, that the veterinary surgeons &mdash; as far as I know at any rate &mdash; are not the best paid service in the world for the particular duties they are supposed to do.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;supposed&rdquo;, because I know full well the category of work the veterinary surgeon is supposed to do for a very meagre salary. In fact, while I do not want to say that the work is not done, I do say <Col N="977" /> that it could not be satisfactorily done for the amount of pay they get from certain local authorities.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that this work will be done by the local veterinary surgeons under the local bodies and that, probably, there will not be any extra charge.  If the veterinary surgeons are called upon in this connection, there is going to be extra work for them to do, even if it is only the drawing up of some form or another, and there will probably be some such form in connection with this particular Bill.  Knowing, as I do, that they are an underpaid section of the community for the jobs they do at present, it is very likely that they will demand an extra sum for fulfilling their obligations under this Bill, and, like Deputy Brennan, I am loath to see any extra expense thrown on the local authorities, and I should like to add my protest to his in that respect.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come to the kernel of this Bill. The Bill is supposed to be &ldquo;An Act to make provision for securing the more humane treatment of animals in slaughterhouses, and to make further and better provision in relation generally to the slaughter of animals.&rdquo; Now, Section 11 (1) lays down that no person shall slaughter any animal where such slaughter can be seen by any other animal.  Then sub-section (3) lets out anybody and everybody who has been in the habit of slaughtering animals in the presence of other animals.  Sub-section (2) enacts that a person guilty of this offence shall be liable to a certain penalty, while sub-section (3) says that it shall be a good <Col N="980" /> defence to such a charge that the premises in which the act was alleged to have been committed had been used as a slaughterhouse immediately before the commencement of this Act and that substantial structural alterations of the premises would have been necessary to enable the slaughtering to be carried out without a contravention of this section.  In no part of the section do we find any provision made for future alterations.  The defendant puts up the defence: &ldquo;I have been accustomed to doing this for years in the presence of other animals, and it would cost me quite a good deal of money now to make the structural alteration.&rdquo;  And that is a good defence to the charge.  If we are going to pass a Bill which is supposed to do away with certain abuses, surely there is no use in letting out people on the plea that they have been all their lives committing that particular abuse. That certainly should not be.  The man should put up his own defence, whatever it is, and let the court decide the matter.  If this House passes a Bill to meet a certain situation, and then if this sort of thing is said to be a good defence, where are we?  I do not see any point in passing a Bill at all with such a proviso.  Consequently I move the deletion of these sub-sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the amendment for the reasons stated by Deputy Brennan and for other reasons as well.  If the Dáil is to express its view on any particular matter, it ought to do so definitely and pass legislation which will be put into effect.  In other Bills passed here we have been lax in our definitions.  We have had loosely-drafted sections that give power to Ministers to do more than is in the section.  Here, while we allege that a certain thing is an offence, we are putting into the hands of the offenders the defence they are to set up.  In fact we are making the defence water-tight for 75 per cent. of the people who possibly may be accused. That is no exaggeration.  I do not care what views Deputies have on this particular matter.  I have one view and I am in favour of the principle on which the Minister is trying to insist. Usually when the Dáil accepts a principle the Executive is drastic enough <Col N="981" /> in enforcing that principle.  But this section fails to carry out the principle. There is a loophole here for anybody who wants to get out of any charge brought against him, and most of the offenders will.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputies Brennan and Bennett. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give the amendment his consideration. That it is definitely and grossly an offence to slaughter an animal in such a position that the slaughter can be seen by another animal, is an expression of opinion about cruelty that is not challenged in civilised countries. But in giving that opinion the Dáil should not take the whole force out of the legislation by stating that such an abuse against civilisation which has gone on for years should be permitted. What this section says is that where such a disgusting custom has gone on for years in the case of a particular slaughterhouse, that in itself should be a good defence for it to go on in the future and for ever.  I think Deputy Bennett is quite right that this sub-section (3) would give a complete defence to the great majority of the people who commit this offence against human kindness.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider it, will consent to withdraw sub-section (3) from this section and take away this defence, and prevent the perpetuation of a very gross habit.</P>

      <P>I would like the House to read the preamble of the Bill in conjunction with sub-section (3). This is what the preamble sets out: &ldquo;An Act to make provision for securing the more humane treatment of animals in slaughterhouses ...&rdquo;  We all know that as a result of the Slaughter of Animals Act enacted here about a year and a-half ago there are sufficient slaughterhouses to meet any demands that will arise in connection with the slaughter of animals, so that practically no new slaughterhouses will be built.  This Bill seeks the more humane treatment of animals in <Col N="982" /> slaughterhouses, and then it sets out that all a man has to do is to go to court and say: &ldquo;I have been slaughtering animals in this place all my life, and perhaps my father was there before me.&rdquo;  Then he sits down and it is all over.  In brief, that is what this Bill means.  Whoever was responsible for drafting it overlooked the preamble when they came to Section 11, sub-section (3).  The Parliamentary Secretary should seriously consider modifying that part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I might take the House into my confidence to the extent of saying that personally I would prefer if sub-section (3) were not in the Bill.  I confess that all the logic is on the side of the people who say that sub-section (3) should be deleted.  As I mentioned on the Second Reading, this Bill is based on a Bill that was already passed in the Seanad, and the only essential alterations in the Bill as passed in the Seanad are in relation to machinery and facilities for the better administration of the Bill when it becomes law.  The principle that Deputies criticise now was incorporated in the Bill as passed in the Seanad, so that I will have to shift responsibility on to the people who drafted the Bill for the Seanad for the fact that the same principle is incorporated in the Bill now before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is represented by the people interested in securing the retention of this sub-section that if we insist on rigid regulations right at the start in regard to slaughterhouse construction, we will inflict hardship on a lot of people engaged in the business.  I confess that if we have to choose between continuing hardships on the animals slaughtered under undesirable conditions and the hardships that may be inflicted as a result of the passage of this measure on the people engaged in slaughtering animals, we ought to come down on the side of the animals.  If there is general agreement in the House, as there appears to be, I am quite prepared to accept the principle suggested, but I would like to have an opportunity of looking into the full reactions of the deletion of this sub-section. I repeat that personally I <Col N="983" /> would be better satisfied if that sub-section were not in the Bill.  I do not know how the Seanad will take to it when it goes back with that sub-section deleted, but I suppose we can afford to wait and see.  Perhaps they might change their minds in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I feel that if it were made too water-tight we might, perhaps, come down unduly on some people.  That might happen.  I would be quite prepared if the sub-section were to read like this: &ldquo;Where a person is charged with having committed an offence, it shall be regarded as a good defence to prove that it was a first offence.&rdquo;  I would not have any objection if that principle were embodied and let it all stand after that. A man might be prosecuted for an offence and there might be no objection if he were let off in the first instance; but to say that he could use it as an excuse for continuing offences would be ridiculous.</P>

I think the Probation Act could well be applied to these cases and leave the matter to the justices. If the position of a door is contrary to the provisions of the measure, there is no hardship entailed in the opening of another door.  I do not think that is a serious hardship on anyone.</P>

      <P>8.  In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we pass sub-section (c), for instance, of Section 1 we shall certainly be creating an extraordinary situation. Let us suppose a man has his own private slaughterhouse, in which he slaughters cattle for other people as well.  He certainly ought to be responsible for the instruments he uses in slaughtering and for the condition of his slaughterhouse.  But the man who owns the cattle and who may live a couple of miles away, and who sends them in and pays for the slaughter of them, ought not to be liable to conviction for an offence under this section.  The words of the paragraph are &ldquo;every person who aids or abets.&rdquo; Take, for instance, an ordinary yardman or labourer who is in the service of the butcher and liable to dismissal, at an hour's notice, if they do not do what they are ordered to do.  Are they to be held responsible?  I think the whole object of the Bill could be met by making the owner of the slaughterhouse liable.  There is no reason why his yardman should be responsible.  The owner must be <Col N="986" /> licensed to carry out the slaughter of animals, or he must have somebody else licensed for him, who will carry out the slaughter of animals.  Surely between the owner of the slaughterhouse and the person who does the slaughtering you can fix the responsibility without putting it on an ordinary yardman or assistant, who if he does not attend to his work and carry out his orders will be fired from his job.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to say that people who are not, and ought not to be liable, should not be made so under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an ordinary criminal offence: it is a felony; and it is not right that words which apply to accessories before and after the fact should be in this Bill. It is the person who has done the act that should be guilty.  This is not a case of house-breaking or murder or manslaughter which are cases in which the criminal law makes people accessories before or after the fact liable.  The proposals in this section are very drastic.  A man employed as a drover to drive the beasts of the slaughterhouse may be made liable. Under the law, as set out in this Bill, they could be brought in and made as responsible as the man who gets the licence under the Act.  But he is the licensed person.  If a man owned an abattoir perhaps he may employ somebody else to do the work for him. He may employ his son and that person may become the licensed person. Perhaps the man owning the abattoir may be sick in bed.  I think it is very drastic in legislation of this kind, which is not of a very highly criminal nature, that we should drag into the net everybody who even looked at the beast from the moment it left the grass and reached the slaughterhouse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must venture to differ a little from Deputy MacMenamin in his representation to the Parliamentary Secretary because I would go so far as to include the owner of the abattoir or slaughterhouse.  I do not think you could divest him of responsibility for what takes place in his slaughterhouse.  Although he may be temporarily indisposed, a very grave duty devolves upon him to appoint <Col N="987" /> some deputy who will ensure that the work will be carried out in accordance with the law.  If he fails to appoint somebody not sufficiently careful who allows breaches of the law to take place, the owner should be responsible.  But I do impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary to agree to the deletion of paragraphs (b) and (c).  They go beyond what is necessary to ensure the main principle of the Bill.  If a man brings a beast into a licensed slaughterhouse he is entitled to assume that the man who is to do the work, and holds himself out as ready to do it, will do it in accordance with the law.  He cannot be expected to stand over every man in the slaughterhouse and discharge the functions of a member of the Civic Guard, or an inspector.  Paragraph (c), I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, is much too wide. It places a burden upon a large number of people who normally would have no experience of slaughterhouse work to do what the ordinary regulation requires, and would make them liable if they lent a hand, in what appears to them to be a perfectly legitimate proceeding.  It is perfectly true that you may find many casual people in slaughterhouses who lend a hand under pressure of business at Christmas time and the like.  These people may not be in the slaughterhouse again for months.  There is no obligation upon them to acquaint themselves with the provisions of the statute and yet they would be brought within the scope of this Bill, quite unwittingly.  I, therefore, suggest that while paragraph (a) might be retained in the section, paragraphs (b) and (c) might be left out unless after the Bill is in operation for some time someone may see reason for reintroducing them.</P>

      <P>The intention of paragraph (b) which amendment No. 7 proposes to delete was to induce the owner of an animal to select a slaughterhouse where killings would be carried out under humane conditions. I am inclined to think that the position with regard to paragraphs <Col N="988" /> (b) and (c) is safeguarded by paragraph (a) of sub-section (1).  I did foresee the possibility of hardship if, as some of the Deputies have said, the owner of the animal, who lives perhaps some couple of miles away, is to be held responsible for the manner in which the person holding the slaughter licence carried out the slaughtering.  Similarly, if we hold the owner of the slaughterhouse liable for the conditions under which the animals are kept while awaiting slaughter and the conditions under which they are slaughtered, I confess I do not see that there can be any necessity for raking in any of the people who may be about the premises. I think this amendment and the following amendment, to delete those two paragraphs, are sound, and I am quite prepared to agree to them.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is really good policy.  I think after all that members of this House have a perfect right to know what fees are going to be charged to people who want to get a slaughter licence.  I think the Ministry are really ill-advised in advocating that type of legislation.  Let the House take its responsibility for the fee.  This House ought to know whether the fee is going to be £1 or 1/- per licence.  Section 23 sets out that for the reissuing of a licence which has been lost or mislaid there will be a fee of 6d.  There is a definite sum stated there.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to take the House <Col N="989" /> into his confidence.  I think it would be a wise thing for the Ministerial Party to tell us what fee they propose charging for slaughter licences. Licences are to be issued by the local authority, and we do not know what the Minister is going to say ought to be charged for those licences.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that on the Report Stage he ought to be in a position to tell us what fee is proposed to be charged for a slaughter licence.  When another Bill was before this House recently&mdash;I think it was the Pigs and Bacon Bill&mdash;it was definitely stated what certain fees were, and I think that procedure should have been followed here.</P>

      <P>The only reason, I suppose, why the fee is not incorporated in the Bill is that conditions change from time to time, and even money value changes.  Once the fee is fixed, and incorporated in the statute, of course it cannot be varied.  The fee will be fixed by regulation, and the regulation will be placed on the Table of the House.  Deputies will of course have ample opportunity of discussing the fee which is fixed.  If they are not satisfied, of course, a resolution could be moved.  I think it is better machinery.  I may say that the fee will be a nominal one.  The fee we have in mind is, I think, 5/-.</P>

      <P>Section 24 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a sanitary authority is satisfied that the holder of a slaughter licence issued by such sanitary authority has ceased to be <Col N="990" /> a fit and proper person to be engaged in the slaughter of animals such sanitary authority may, subject to the provisions of this section, suspend.... such slaughter licence,</P>
    <P>but the holder must get one month's notice, according to a further sub-section. If a person is not a fit and proper person to carry out the slaughter of animals in the way in which we want them to carry it out, is there any sense in allowing him to continue for a further month slaughtering animals in a way in which they ought not to be slaughtered?  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A sanitary authority shall not suspend or revoke a slaughter licence under this section unless or until they have given to the holder of such licence one month's notice in writing.</P>
    <P>Surely there is something really wrong about that?  Suppose a complaint comes from the Guards or the veterinary officer that such and such a person has caused undue pain in the slaughtering of animals, and is not a fit and proper person to slaughter animals, he cannot&mdash;according to that sub-section&mdash;be suspended for one whole month, or possibly for five or six weeks, allowing time to serve notice on him.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to see that on Report Stage that section is amended.  As it stands, it really nullifies the whole thing, because a man who has been declared not to be a fit and proper person to slaughter animals is allowed to continue slaughtering them for another full month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree with Deputy Brennan in his attitude on this matter, although I have agreed with him this afternoon upon a number of things.  A sanitary authority might, for a variety of reasons which I need not attempt to enumerate, be of opinion that a person who holds a licence has ceased to be a fit and proper person.  I notice Deputy MacEoin smiling.  Apparently he has in mind some of the reasons which might operate in such circumstances. It ought to be borne in mind that the <Col N="991" /> person has already been adjudicated, in the opinion of the sanitary authorities, to be a fit and proper person; he has already been given a licence. Seeing that the sanitary authority has already deliberately decided that the person is a fit and proper person, I think a little time should be allowed to elapse before the sanitary authority would be allowed to declare that such a person has suddenly ceased to be a fit and proper person.  There is provision later on in the Bill for an appeal to the courts.  I think that is a further reason why the hands of the sanitary authority should be tied for a time, in order to give the licensee an opportunity of putting up his defence, and showing why he considers that he is a fit and proper person to hold a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the local authority might pass somebody as a fit and proper person to hold the licence, he might cease overnight&mdash;and very seriously&mdash;to be a fit and proper person, owing to some reason or another.  Suppose the holder of a licence becomes unbalanced in his mind, for political reasons or anything else; suppose there is an election on; suppose he becomes unbalanced overnight, and that a complaint is made by the Guards or veterinary officer that he is not a fit and proper person to slaughter animals, would the local authority be obliged to allow him to continue for one month?</P>

      <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary on Second Reading what is the meaning of this paragraph.  He said that the meaning was that the Minister would see that nobody got a licence for slaughtering animals who already held a licence.  Considering that licences are to be paid for and that there is a prescribed fee set out for licences, I cannot imagine anybody rushing into a courthouse and buying two, when one is as good as ten, any more than I can imagine anybody paying for two drivers' licences to drive one car.  There must be some other motive for having the paragraph there and I should like to know what it is. Personally, I cannot make head or tail of it and I do not know what its use is.

      <P>The paragraph under discussion is intended to ensure that a sanitary authority will not issue more than one slaughter licence.

Once a licence is issued by a sanitary authority it will be operative in the area of every sanitary authority.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello has spoken in support of the two amendments, Nos. 15 and 17, which are designed to create a Court of Criminal Appeal consisting of three High Court judges.  In the discussion of the proposed amendments, he went into the whole question of the present position of criminal appeals.  The section as drafted alters the provisions of Section 29 of the 1924 Act by enabling the constitution of the Court of Criminal Appeal to be two judges of the Supreme Court and one of the High Court.  That is to say, we moved in the opposite direction to that desired by Deputy Costello.  I do not agree at all with what Deputy Costello has said about the desirability of moving in the direction he suggests.  Section 29 of the Courts of Justice Act provides that the determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal shall be final.  While there may be something in his view, that this was a tentative arrangement, that it was new and that we are now in a better position to see how it works, I do not think any argument has been advanced to show that the working of it justifies the radical change which he wishes to make.  With the personnel of the High Court and the Supreme Court as they are, the setting up of the Court of Criminal Appeal had the effect of putting out of action the Supreme Court.  We feel now that, with the provision that three judges of the Supreme Court can constitute a quorum for certain cases, you can have your Court of Criminal Appeal with two Supreme Court judges and one High Court judge and thus cause the minimum of <Col N="996" /> dislocation both to the Supreme Court and to the High Court.  As the Court of Criminal Appeal is, in practice, as Deputy Costello admitted, the final Court of Appeal, it seems desirable to have two judges of the Supreme Court on that court.  Of course, he suggests that that should not be the final Court of Appeal, that there ought to be more freedom about the granting of leave to appeal to the Supreme Court than there has been hitherto.  As Deputies are aware, an appeal does not lie from the Court of Criminal Appeal save on the certificate of that court or the certificate of the Attorney-General.  I think that a certificate has been granted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in only one case, and on only one occasion has the Supreme Court been called upon to review the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. There has been no instance of the giving of a certificate by the Attorney-General to enable an appeal to be taken where the Court of Criminal Appeal refused to give a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section circumscribes very much the cases in which an appeal can be taken from a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The provision which states that such a certificate shall only be given where the court or the Attorney-General certifies that the decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court, emphasises what is stated in the first part of the section, that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal shall be final. Incidentally, Deputy Costello referred to the provision that allows a certificate from the Attorney-General to be given as being of little use here or in England.  I think he is wrong with regard to England.  Although there may be one case in which the House of Lords criticised the granting of a certificate, there was a very interesting case recently in which a certificate was granted by the Attorney-General and in which a very important decision was given by the House of Lords on the hearing of the appeal.  There could not be any suggestion that the certificate was not properly granted because <Col N="997" /> the appeal was, in fact, allowed.  In practice, whatever the position may be in theory, we are all aware that the Court of Criminal Appeal is the final court that deals with criminal matters. Deputies opposite suggest that the procedure should be radically altered. One of their amendments suggests that we should alter the provision about the granting of certificates and allow the prisoner to apply to, the Supreme Court for a certificate for leave to appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand, but I do not think a case can be made out for that amendment. So far as I can see, consideration of the application would entail the opening up of the whole case in the Supreme Court.  At present, when a case is concluded in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the person concerned may, and frequently does, ask for a certificate to entitle him to go to the Supreme Court.  If the suggestion made by Deputies opposite were adopted, on refusal of that certificate, the person concerned could go straight away to the Supreme Court and ask for a certificate entitling him to appeal to that court.  The procedure would be almost analogous to that which prevails in connection with ordinary criminal appeals, where an application for a certificate is made to the trial judge and he refuses the application.  At present, the vast majority of criminal appeals are taken from refusals by the trial judges to grant certificates entitling the prisoners to appeal.  If the suggestion of Deputy Costello were adopted, I do not see how you could cut short the hearing of the application in the Supreme Court.  At present, the hearing of the appeal from the refusal to grant a certificate is no shorter than it would be in a case where a certificate had been granted and the appeal proper was being heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I was thinking of how such a provision would operate, and I had in mind a recent case where application was made to the Court of Criminal Appeal and later to myself for a certificate for leave to appeal.  It seems to me that it would be very difficult to avoid opening up the whole transcript of evidence on the application and having a full-dress hearing.  It may be, as Deputy Costello suggests, that the court would devise ways in which the issue would be narrowed down.  I am not aware of any general feeling amongst practitioners at the Bar or others who have been before the Court of Criminal Appeal that that court has declined improperly to grant certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>If the provision of the Act as it stands at present is satisfactory, if the Court of Criminal Appeal has considered these applications fully and fairly and no complaint can be made against its refusal of certificates, why open up another court to appellants?  Why discard this practice and go to the Supreme Court for a certificate? It seems to me that a Court of Criminal Appeal, constituted of two judges of the Supreme Court and one judge of the High Court, provides a very satisfactory final tribunal.  Where the questions involved are of exceptional public importance and it is desirable in the public interest that they should be considered by the Supreme Court, there is a way of having that done.  There are, of course, two points of view but, in practice, I do not think it has been found that the working of the Court of Criminal Appeal has been unsatisfactory.  The point that Deputy Costello makes&mdash;that it would be valuable to have the Supreme Court as the ultimate tribunal&mdash;is, to a large extent, met by the fact that the tribunal to be constituted under the provisions of the section will consist of two members of the Supreme Court and one High Court judge.</P>

      <P>This is a matter on which I am only attempting to state <Col N="999" /> views which I have gathered in conversation with other people.  As a matter of experience, I myself know nothing of it.  I gather that there is a distinct feeling not only in respect of this Bill but in respect of the system generally that where this procedure exists of getting leave to appeal, it is bad to have to seek leave to appeal from the court which has decided against you.  In other words, in every case where there is an appeal to a higher court and where leave has to be sought for that appeal, the granting of that leave should lie with the court you are going to and not with the court you are leaving.</P>

There is a definite feeling amongst practitioners that it is not a good thing to be obliged to apply for leave to appeal to the court whose decision you are attempting to reverse.  The application should be to the court to which you are attempting to go rather than to the court which you are leaving.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. There would, of course, be a solid objection to this proposal if you made this procedure almost a matter of course.  You would have a Criminal Court hearing, an appeal to the Central Criminal Court and the further possibility of appeal to the Supreme Court, if the case went against the criminal.  But the amendment which Deputy Costello has moved imposes a very distinct limitation. That is that you must get your leave from the Supreme Court on the double point&mdash;that the decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable <Col N="1000" /> in the public interest that the appeal should be taken.  The Attorney-General says that, when you open before the Supreme Court your application for leave to appeal, you will have to deal with the whole case and that expense will be incurred by the State in meeting the case.  Surely, that is not so. The Attorney-General drags in the analogy of the cases taken on appeal from the Central Criminal Court to the High Court Circuit, but, there, the ground is that the case is a fit case for appeal. Naturally, on that ground, the whole case is open to review.  The whole facts may be gone into and the whole evidence read.  All you have got to substantiate is the ground that there is a fit case for appeal.</P>

      <P>All they have to certify is that the decision involves a question which is a fit subject for appeal to the Supreme Court.  That is not as limited as the provision in the amendment.  Under the amendment, two things have to be established to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court and it is not necessary to open up the whole issue.  Surely the Attorney-General knows that, under the present method of hearing Circuit Court appeals, the first question one is likely to be met with on making such an application is &ldquo;What are you appealing on&mdash;is it fact or law?&rdquo; If there is the slightest hesitation in answering that question there is almost immediately an atmosphere engendered against you, because the court believes you are trying to bring in some matter of fact under the guise of a point of law and you are brought sharply up against the question: &ldquo;What is your point of law?&rdquo; In this case the court would very soon <Col N="1001" /> bring counsel or the prisoner up against the question: &ldquo;What is the point of law of exceptional public importance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;On what are you relying in your attempt to show that an appeal is desirable in the public interest?&rdquo; That is a very narrow issue on which to have the case opened.  There is a distinct feeling that right through the whole Courts of Justice system, where an appeal lies and where it is limited by a provision for seeking leave, the application for leave should be not to the lower court but to the higher court.  If this is going to be the new situation there is no doubt that there is every argument for making the Court of Criminal Appeal more or less part of the High Court system and making the Appeal Court the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I understood the Attorney-General to say that he objects to any change in the composition of the court.  I should like to direct the attention of the Minister and the <Col N="1002" /> Attorney-General to the fact that this section, as it stands, is really inconsistent with the whole scheme of the Bill.  I gathered from the Attorney-General that he is in favour of a Supreme Court of five judges and that it is because of the exigencies of the financial situation that he and the Minister are averse to this compromise solution.  In principle, he agrees that the Supreme Court should consist of five judges.  Here you are providing that the Court of Criminal Appeal may consist of two Supreme Court judges, plus one High Court judge, and from that tribunal there may be an appeal on the certificate of the court, or on the certificate of the Attorney-General, to the Supreme Court.  But two Supreme Court judges are already there, having heard the case, and one other Supreme Court judge may have heard the case in Green Street from whom this is an appeal.  Therefore, all you have to get on an urgent public matter is two members of the Supreme Court, and they have to drag in two or three High Court judges to constitute the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>And I am objecting to it.  I want the Supreme Court to be kept apart.  This section proposes to assimilate further the Supreme Court to the High Court in the matter of criminal appeal.  If there is going to be even the remnants of an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of tremendous importance, you are not really going to get the ultimate Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court. There are two Supreme Court judges and one High Court judge there.  They give a certificate of appeal but there are only two Supreme Court judges left to hear it.  That is a matter of principle upon which the Attorney-General should have at least an open mind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the words &ldquo;and reasonable to be retained therein&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;fit to be prosecuted in the High Court&rdquo; where the latter words twice occur in the said section, and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object in putting down this amendment was to give the High Court jurisdiction to retain for hearing a case <Col N="1004" /> which would appear to be and did in fact come within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, but which by reason of the issues of law that it might raise, would be more appropriately prosecuted in the High Court than in the Circuit Court.  The view I take is that judges of the High Court, when there are applications to remit actions within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which were brought in the High Court, have universally remitted these actions, once it was apparent that they are within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  There are occasions, however, not very frequently, when an action involving an amount of money which appears to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, in fact involves very serious questions of law, on which it would be desirable to have a decision of the Supreme Court.  If the view of the High Court hitherto is adopted, and the case is transferred to the Circuit Court, from an appeal to the High Court, and if the persons against whom the decision goes endeavour to get a certificate from the High Court for leave to appeal, as is sometimes the case, if they get it, it goes to the Supreme Court.  If it goes to the Supreme Court it is a matter involving very serious issues.  The object of the amendment is to make it clear that the High Court can retain, and ought to retain, actions of that kind for hearing, without transmitting them to the Circuit Court.  Under the old system where the County Court had jurisdiction only up to £50 when an application to remit an action which was started in the High Court was made, the court invariably considered whether notwithstanding the fact that the amount claimed was under the £50 mark, the issues involved in the action were such as to make it more appropriate that it should be tried in the High Court.  If the court thought the action was of such a character as to make it more appropriate that it should be determined in the High Court rather than in the County Court, they retained it in the High Court.  I know one case where a civil bill was issued for a penny, but it involved very serious law issues.  Actions of that kind might be held in the High Court.  This <Col N="1005" /> is merely clarifying the position and making it clear to the judges that their jurisdiction is extensive in character in this respect.</P>

      <P>It does seem as if it was to be interpreted that as far as possible future actions in the Circuit Court should be commenced there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee was very precise about it.  They said that their attention had been called to it. Their remarks are worth quoting:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee were, however, referred to a case of Hosie v Lawless in which the Supreme Court, reversing the decision of a judge of the High Court, held that this was not the true construction of Section 25 of the Act of 1924, and that in view of `the policy' of the Act the question for the court on an application to transfer an action from the High Court to the Circuit Court was not whether the action was fit to be prosecuted in the High Court but `whether there is anything in the action which takes it out of the general policy and makes it more fit to be tried in the High Court than in the Circuit Court.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was interpreted as meaning that there should be as large a distribution of the cases as was possible through the Circuit Court.  They continue:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee were informed that the effect of this decision has been that the Circuit Court has now practically exclusive jurisdiction in all actions which are within its jurisdiction, and that no action is <Col N="1006" /> retained in the High Court which is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They passed over what they called the constitutional aspect and went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee, therefore, consider that on an application to remit or transfer an action from the High Court to the Circuit Court the question for the court should be whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it was reasonable that the action should have been commenced in the High Court, and the Committee recommends that this should be provided for by the necessary legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is evident from the questions asked the two witnesses who gave evidence, Mr. Price and the Master of the High Court.  It is evident that the Committee had the view that there was no policy in the Act of 1924 such as was declared in the attitude in the Hosie v Lawless case.  Their view was that if it was a reasonable matter for trial in the High Court, the High Court should retain it, but they left the decision on that point to the High Court when a remittal motion is brought before it. It does not seem to work a big change. They have recommended it and the arguments brought before the Committee were entirely in favour of the proposed change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I represented the Bar before the Committee.  I know well that the Bar are very much interested in this.  Though it may seem a small matter, and though the amendment does not strike one as having any radical effect, I think that Deputy Costello and perhaps Deputy McGilligan, will agree with me that it is a very radical amendment and that its effect on the present system would be considerable.  I think that Deputy McGilligan is wrong in thinking that the court in considering the Hosie v Lawless case did not very carefully consider the policy of the 1924 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Col N="1007" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's view apparently is that the Committee, considering the Act, thought that the court went too far in reading into it the policy which underlies Hosie v Lawless. I was interested at the time when the Hosie v Lawless decision was given, and at the time the Committee sat I was anxious to see that the law should be changed as Deputy Costello suggests, and that there should be a reversal to the position such as previously existed on a remitting motion.  I do not think that this amendment can be lightly treated as something of very little importance or that one can ignore the fact that if this amendment were to be adopted it would make a rather revolutionary change in the courts system.  It would give the High Court grounds, in fact compel them to consider grounds, for the retaining of actions in the High Court which are not at present open to them.  The court considered that the policy of the 1924 Act was that persons who had actions within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court concerning amounts or concerning property of the value in respect to which jurisdiction was given to the Circuit Court, should be compelled to go to the Circuit Court unless there were reasonable grounds for retaining the action in the High Court.  It was in pushing that interpretation of the 1924 Act to its logical conclusion that the court came to the decision they came to in Hosie v Lawless.  In order to justify reversing that judgment I think it would be necessary to make a case stronger than was made here by Deputy Costello.</P>

      <P>I recognise that I am here in a dual capacity, and if I were to look at this from the point of view of a member of the Bar, as <Col N="1008" /> Deputy Costello is looking at it, I would favour the amendment very strongly because it is in the interests of the Bar that as many actions as possible should be tried in the High Court.  But, unless the Government is deliberately to come to the conclusion that the spirit of the 1924 Act is to be departed from in this respect, this amendment cannot be accepted by them.  I certainly do not want anybody to misunderstand the position.  I think the Minister's position is that a case has not been made for a reversal of the judgment or that he is not satisfied that the intentions of the 1924 Act are given effect to by adopting the amendment.  That is the sole reason why this amendment is not welcomed and adopted.  The case which Deputy Costello suggests as having been the subject matter of a civil bill involving a minute amount of money, a penny, although it involved an important point of law, I do not think would justify this amendment, even if instances of that type of case could be multiplied.  Supposing there is such a case, involving even far more money, and that the plaintiff desires to have it litigated in the High Court.  He starts the action in the High Court and the defendant moves to have it remitted to the Circuit Court.  Then the High Court even under the Hosie v. Lawless decision could retain it in the High Court if they consider that there are special reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is impressed by this position under the Act as it stands, that it is not such a tremendous penalty for a person to have to go to the Circuit Court even if an important point of law is involved, because, as Deputy Costello knows, it may come back on appeal to the High Court, to be heard by two High Court judges.  Under our proposed change now it will come back to the circuit-going judge&mdash;a judge of the High Court&mdash;and he can, under a provision of this Bill, give a case stated on a question of law, that case to be taken straight to the Supreme <Col N="1009" /> Court, so that though theoretically a case can be made out for the amendment, in practice I do not think there is any real hardship on a litigant who has an important point of law to argue in compelling him, in the first instance, to litigate it in the Circuit Court.  He can take it to the Appeal Court if necessary and from that take the important point of law to the Supreme Court.  I am afraid it would take stronger reasons than have been given to induce the Minister to adopt this amendment which, as a member of the Bar, I would like to see adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations in support of this amendment.  The present position is that it is open to a litigant to start his proceedings in the High Court or Circuit Court, even though the case may be within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  If it is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court an application can be made to the High Court to transfer to the Circuit Court and under the decision in the Hosie v. Lawless case, which has been referred to, the High Court on that application can consider practically nothing more than whether the case is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  If it is, then it must go there.  The amendment merely proposes that in addition to determining that matter, the High Court should be able to consider whether it is reasonable that it should be kept in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been observed by Deputy Costello that there are cases where the amount involved is small or, at any rate, small enough to give jurisdiction to the Circuit Court.  But there are other reasons, which it is unnecessary, perhaps, to deal with at very great length, why particular cases should be kept in the High Court.  One particular example that occurs to anybody is a case in the nature of a test case.  The amount involved may be small, but, nevertheless, if decided by the High Court there and then, it may rule a great number of other cases.  If that case has to go to the Circuit Court, is going to be tried there, and there is going to be an appeal to the High Court, certainly in the existing conditions <Col N="1010" /> that means a very great delay. I do not know whether the system which this Bill seeks to bring is going to make that period of delay less, but, even if it is, that case must eventually go back to the High Court to be determined.</P>
    <P>Another example that might occur in a particular case would be where the parties desired to secure prompt hearing because of illness, perhaps, the necessity for taking the evidence of a particular witness before death might supervene, or before that particular witness might have to leave the country, or for any other reason.  I think it is true, as the Attorney-General said, that the amendment is an important one; it is not a trivial amendment; but, at the same time, it is not effecting a very great change in the law to give the High Court, which I suppose would be regarded as a responsible institution, power to examine the circumstances of a particular case.  If, for any reason which the court is satisfied is one which ought to be taken judicial notice of that case ought to stay in the High Court, I think that, although that may effect a substantial change in the law, it is not an unreasonable change in the law.  I therefore support the amendment and urge that the Minister should take into account this consideration before he determines to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on this occasion I will address my remarks to the Minister, because it is quite obvious that the Attorney-General in reference to this amendment is merely acting the part of an advocate and not actually giving his true views at all; that it is really the Minister who is the villain of the piece in this respect in opposing this very reasonable and entirely unrevolutionary amendment.  What is proposed is that it should be allowed for High Court judges to say whether or not it is reasonable that a case should be heard in the High Court rather than sent to the Circuit Court. What is revolutionary in that?  Is it revolutionary to give power to High Court judges to say, on a given state of facts being presented to them, whether or not it is reasonable to retain a case in the High Court.  I <Col N="1011" /> fail to see how that can be regarded as a revolutionary proposal.</P>
      <P>Apart from the cases referred to by Deputy Lavery, and very forcibly put by him, I should like to remind the Minister of the sort of case that may perhaps have come within his own particular experience.  Take the case of an ordinary action for defamation between two people in the same town. It would be quite impossible for one side or the other to get a fair trial of that particular action in the local venue.  These cases have occurred in our own experience.  Either side will ask for a jury.  If the plaintiff does not ask for it the defendant will. Either side will square that jury, or else they will have pals on the jury, if they do not square it.  It will be quite impossible for anybody to get a just decision in that case.  I am not talking treason in saying that a jury can be squared.  They are very human in the country.  As the Minister will agree, sometimes a jury will allow knowledge which they acquire outside the court, if I might say so, to affect their decision in a case.</P>
      <P>I know of one senior counsel who came to me in a state of tremendous indignation when he discovered that a defamation action which he started in the High Court had been remitted to the Circuit Court.  His attitude was that the only thing to do for his client was to discontinue the action because of the local feeling in the matter and the local influence of perhaps one party or the other.  If that case is retained, and facts are put before the High Court which enable them to say that it is both fit to be prosecuted and reasonable to be retained&mdash;because that is what the amendment says&mdash;then if the plaintiff does not make out a fit case on the plenary hearing of the action he can be mulcted in costs and the defendant will not in any way be penalised.</P>

      <P>One difficulty is that there should be less ground now for making it more easy to bring cases to the High Court.  Under the system which will operate under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, there will be an appeal to a judge on Circuit. There is some force in what Deputy Costello said as to a case where there is a jury in a local town.  I quite agree with him in that aspect of it, at any rate, in cases of tort arising out of defamation of character.  I could not, however, undertake at present to accept the amendment, but I certainly shall reconsider it in the light of what has been said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the section deals with the procedure on appeals from by-laws made <Col N="1013" /> under the Fisheries Act, and I know that very great difficulty did arise by reason of a rather peculiar tribunal set up under the Fisheries Act in reference to the matter, and that it did call for some sort of provision such as is contained in this section.  I entirely agree with that, but I should like the Attorney-General to consider whether or not the difficulty which arose on the first case brought under the old system to that extraordinary tribunal which was set up does not still exist in this section, namely, what is the procedure to be adopted and what are the powers now of the High Court under this section, and formerly of that queer tribunal?  When the first case was brought it was impossible to tell whether or not all the evidence which had been given against the by-laws when the hearing locally was being had in the first instance was to be gone all over again in the appeal, or whether there were to be notes, or what was to be done at all.  I forget at the moment how the High Court ultimately determined the matter, but my recollection is that they decided on some sort of a compromise hearing and settled some sort of procedure of their own.  I think I should direct the attention of the Attorney-General to that fact that, under the section as it stands, the procedure to be adopted is left ambiguous.</P>

      <P>There are very unusual cases which, no matter <Col N="1015" /> what procedure is followed, will be very complicated and difficult.  The particular case to which Deputy Costello referred presented great difficulties and took a long time.  A great mass of evidence was produced, and I think the decision was to hear evidence and they took oral evidence. This sub-section allows for the hearing by one, two or more judges in the High Court, as may be convenient. If you are going to have these long-drawn-out-cases&mdash;and cases of that nature are almost inevitably long-drawn-out hearings&mdash;it would impose a very heavy burden on the parties concerned if there had to be a further long-drawn-out appeal; and the compromise is there, that, in order to have a satisfactory hearing, the President of the High Court may assign one or two or more judges for the hearing, and it is thought that already the matter has been the subject of a hearing or a ruling by the secretary.</P>

I think I can speak with some knowledge on that, and I think the present Attorney-General will agree with me.  It is also very doubtful whether it is constitutionally permissible or not, and I think that the doubt ought to be settled at the earliest possible opportunity.  I think this should be left in, and if the Committee, subsequently, determines on some other procedure, then it can be changed.  I think, however, that the situation calls for urgent remedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the Master must be raised somewhere in this measure and it must be raised in a detailed way.  As far as I can make out, in other countries there are functionaries who have duties like what were intended to be given to the Master here, but owing to a particular decision of the courts here the Master has been left almost entirely without jurisdiction.  He calls himself, speaking in a rather crying way, something in the nature of a rubber stamp, a higher kind of official, court official, or something like that.  That is an anomalous position.  Functionaries who hold analogous offices in other countries do discharge quite a lot of functions. There is a feeling, certainly, amongst practitioners, that the Master could be made a useful court.  There is a difference as to whether or not he is to discharge judicial functions&mdash;that is as to whether he is a judge.  There is one way out of that and that is to make him a judge.  But that is a sort of amendment or proposal that I would not be allowed to make because there would have to be some difference in the salary owing to the changed conditions.  But we can discuss that.  There is a way of raising it.  That court could be made a useful court.  There is no objection in principle, from anybody with whom I have spoken, as far as I can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no objection to the Master himself and no criticism as to the efficiency with which he has carried out the limited duties he has been for some time discharging.  There is quite a volume of opinion, and it is becoming very wide, as to the position of the Master.  I know that there is a limited number of people who practise in that court on account of its limited nature and it is for that reason that the full effects of the Master's curtailed powers are not being realised. For that reason there is not such a wide body of opinion in regard to him as there is in regard to other people.  If that body of opinion, however, were allowed to develop there would be as much outcry about the Master as there is about any other section of the courts&mdash;the High Court or <Col N="1020" /> the Supreme Court.  There is a lot of useful work that could be done by the Master which would result in shortening the time that is occupied between the period when people make up their minds to bring an action in court and when the action comes on.  Because of the present situation the time has been lengthened.  A mass of relatively unimportant work has been sent down to the judges to discharge which could be discharged by the Master if this constitutional barrier that has been raised were removed.  The judges would unanimously or almost unanimously approve of having that work sent to the Master.  This is quite an anomaly which should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Then the question of the Master's pension and such other things arise at the same time.  Has it ever been considered what reactions will follow from making the Master a judge and giving him judicial status?  Let it be of some court; that can be considered afterwards, but let him clearly be a judge and capable under the Constitution of performing judicial functions. Again, I think, that when the Master's position is considered it will be recognised that certain limitations have been imposed on him.  I do not think that anything can be lost by making the Master assume the position of judge and making the necessary change in everything else regarding his judicial office.  I do not think we would lose at all by having the present occupant raised to the position of judge and given a judicial charge.  If the Master were made a judge I have no doubt that by degree the office would grow and quite an amount of real judgment could be sought and got in that court which of course cannot be got at the moment because of the limitations put upon him.  That would involve certain statutory changes.  There should be a decision taken as to what branch of the judiciary he should belong.  But these are the hurdles to be got over at the moment.  The office has very limited functions indeed at present, but it could be made quite a clearing house or a clearing-house station for most of the detailed work.  It was thought <Col N="1021" /> that for that detailed work an individual with the practical experience of the Master and with his capacity to discharge that work would be of much use in the courts.  Instead of that we find the Master with next-to-nothing of importance given to him to do and with always that fear hanging over him that no matter what he does there may be a new approach to the High Court or the Supreme Court with regard to it, and that there may be objection on the ground that he is over-stepping his functions.  The Committee's recommendation was because they had got the position of the Master disclosed.  They made the recommendations in the circumstances as disclosed but they did not approach them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with a great deal of what the Deputy has said as to the position of the Master.  There is no doubt about it when the position was created it was thought that a great deal of work of the nature the Deputy has described would be discharged by the Master.  Had the position been developed in the way in which it was designed a great deal of time would be saved and the Master would have been quite a useful official.  As the Deputy has said, the rulings of the High Court on the position of the Master have had the effect of practically depriving him of a great part of the functions which it was hoped he would discharge.  The position is, as the Deputy says, quite anomalous at the moment.  I practised in the Master's Court before his jurisdiction had been challenged and the volume of his work reduced to the extent it has been.  I agree with the Deputy that the practitioners before the Master were very satisfied with him. There is no doubt he is a most excellent officer.  But I doubt if the solution which the Deputy puts forward will meet the situation.  Apart from amending the Constitution, there seems to be no other way of solving the difficulty than by either allowing the office to fall into desuetude or making the Master a judge. That solution has not been put forward seriously before.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete Section 15 (1) (a), lines 7 to 14 inclusive.</P>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the limitation of costs.  The whole section has, I think, been considered by the General Council of the Bar and they have made a recommendation in regard to it.  They have recommended that the section as drafted really should disappear and instead of it there should be adopted provisions as to costs prescribed by Order 28, Rule 2, of the High Court Rules, 1926.  If that be not accepted they suggest that there should be special provision made and there is a certain reference to sub-section (2).  I think it might be better to discuss together all the amendments down to Section 15.  What I seek to delete by amendment No. 22 is the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in any action of tort or of breach of promise of marriage, where the amount of the damages recovered by the plaintiff is not less than £100 and not more than £300 the plaintiff shall not be entitled to recover more costs than he would have been entitled to recover if the action had been brought in the Circuit Court, unless the judge hearing the action grants a special certificate under this section.</P>
      <P>I want information as to what is the underlying reason for making these provisions with regard to the limitation of costs.  Why is it necessary to pick out actions of tort or breaches of promise of marriage where the sum claimed is not less than £100 nor more than £300, and where the plaintiff was only to be allowed certain costs?  The Ministry have divided up these limitations of costs under certain heads and I am asking for information in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that it is considered that the special certificate which the judge has power to give as to whether it is reasonable that the case should be brought in the High Court is a sufficient safeguard.  The underlying reason is to discourage actions that might be brought in the <Col N="1027" /> Circuit Court from being brought in the High Court.</P>

      <P>I am going mainly on what the Committee said.  I think the view of the Committee generally was that they did not agree that it was the policy of the Act of 1924 that actions to a greater extent should be brought in the Circuit Court.  An enormous mass of evidence was given on the point that if there was to be Circuit Court jurisdiction of the same limit as at the moment, there should be what is called concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court.  The Committee definitely accepted that.</P>

      <P>Where the sum is less than £100 the Committee's recommendation was that the plaintiff should not be entitled to more costs than damages, unless the judge granted a special certificate.  In the Bill paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 15 reads:</P>
      <P>Plaintiff not to be entitled to more costs than whichever of the following sums is the lesser:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The amount of such damages.</P>

      <P>With regard to the liquidated sums the Committee made an identical recommendation in paragraph 31 of the report.  Section 15, paragraphs (e) and (f) of sub-section (i), carries out the recommendation. Paragraph (d) goes further.  It limits, in cases where between £100 and £300 is recovered, the costs to the Circuit Court scale unless the judge grants a special certificate.  In contract, Section 15, paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) carries out the recommendation precisely.  The next is the ejectment recommendation. Section 15, paragraph (g) of sub-section (1), carries out the recommendation precisely.  Except where recommendations are carried out exactly there is a special certificate by the judge that it was reasonable that the case should be brought in the High Court and it was considered that that was sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle had that view earlier, but I do not think he held to it.  The Ceann Comhairle's note to me was that he would allow amendments Nos. 1, 2, 27 and 34, but that they ruled certain others.  I am quite in agreement that the remarks which were passed on Nos. 1 and 2 would be the only arguments that could be used again on this, except that there is this matter in relation to the Circuit Court.  Up to date what has been decided by the House is that in so far as the measure is in relation to the appointment of new judges to the Supreme Court, available for work in the High Court, that should take place immediately on the passing of the Act, or at some appointed day. The House is now definitely faced with a decision as to whether or not it should bring in the Circuit Court provisions at the same time.  They are not necessarily interlocked.  It is intended, as the scheme is put before us, that they should be interlocked, but it is not necessarily so.  We could have the enlargement of the Supreme Court, and those extra members of the Supreme Court allowed to do certain High Court work, without the appeal system being interfered with, and there is no special reason why the two should be joined together.  I speak very definitely again against this whole system of the appeal from the Circuit Court, and all the changes which are consequent in Circuit Court procedure by reason of that.  I would urge that it should be left over for some better consideration.  I know there is a very big number of people who are disappointed with the present Circuit Court appeal system, and there is a very big number of practitioners who think that the change brought in by the 1924 Act was a change definitely for the worse, but there is another body of opinion.  I am not sure, if opinions are canvassed in that matter, that it will not be found that they have been formed by reason of circumstances peculiar to some of the circuits, and that there is a great deal of personal point of view dependent upon what particular man travels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never yet been able to get any answer to the question as to why the <Col N="1031" /> people of this country need a re-hearing and the parading of witnesses a second time in very small types of cases, when apparently no other country has decided to have it, and when England, who saw it tried out here, decided clearly not to have it in her own system.  There has to be agreement on the other point which was urged here on Second Reading, that if you are going to have a fact appeal you have got to see the witnesses.  There cannot be a proper appeal on fact taken by way of the note, but there is before us the recognised practice of other countries that in this manner of case you have your facts tried once; you have them heard by a judge who sees the witnesses and hears them giving their evidence. After that, the matter of fact is finished for all practical purposes, and there is only an appeal by way of case stated&mdash;an appeal on a point of law or something like that.  The view expressed before the Committee, that the people of the country wanted this, has prevailed, notwithstanding the answer that was made to it that they only desired it because they had got accustomed to it, and had got accustomed to it because of a peculiar historical procedure&mdash;a small type of case being tried by a man who was not a judge at all.  Then there emerged the viewpoint that at any rate those cases should be given one hearing before a judge.  There then occurred what was called a re-hearing or a re-trial.  There are other points which can be urged afterwards, but there is this point to be made at the moment&mdash;that it would be very well to let this scheme take form in the Bill and suspend the operation so as to give some better time to develop a point of view on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I should only like to say one thing in reply to what the Deputy has said.  I wonder if he has gone through the evidence which was given before the Committee. If he has, he must have been struck by the almost unanimous views put forward by the witnesses there with regard to the present system.  The views given expression to were those of people who were not all <Col N="1032" /> drawn from the legal profession.  I have looked through the list of witnesses, and every one of them was there in a representative capacity.  Some of them represented the Chambers of Commerce.  Take, for instance, Mr. Clark, who represented the Chambers of Commerce; at question 2329 it will be seen that he gave his view that the system of appeals was unsatisfactory. Mr. Cobbe, who represented the County Councils' General Council, said that his body was unanimously opposed to the present system.  Mr. Cogan, representing the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, gave the same view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The overwhelming majority of the witnesses who gave evidence before that Committee voiced dissatisfaction with the system of appeals on stenographers' notes.  One witness&mdash;I think it was Mr. Ryan&mdash;said that a vote of his Bar association showed them almost unanimously against it.  You have the evidence of men like Mr. Binchy&mdash;I forget whether he was at the Senior Bar at the time&mdash;Mr. William Carrigan and Mr. Patrick Lynch.  Mr. Fitzgerald gave his opinion in favour of an oral rehearing, and he at that time had experience of sitting as a commissioner hearing appeals.  District Justice Cussen gave his opinion against the present system.  Mr. Gaffney, solicitor, Limerick, favoured re-hearing; and so on, with very few exceptions.  Some of them, of course, were important exceptions, such as the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, but it is striking with what unanimity the other witnesses condemned the present system.  While Deputy McGilligan may have satisfied himself from examination of the statistics, and from approaching the matter from the viewpoint of wondering why this country wants a system which apparently is not to be found elsewhere, there are the plain facts with which his Government was faced at the time this Committee reported, and upon which, I understand, they were prepared to act.  I understand that a Bill giving effect to this particular <Col N="1033" /> recommendation of the Committee would have been introduced by his Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to make any point about what stage the Bill was at.  This was a Committee which that Government had set up, and their report favoured this change. Their report was based upon the evidence of this large number of persons who as I say were drawn from every walk of life.  They were not merely country solicitors, who might have an interest in changing the system, or members of the Bar, who might have an interest in changing the system, but even such bodies as the General Council of County Councils and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce pronounced themselves dissatisfied with the system of appeal on the notes.  Why there should be such a complete reversal of that opinion by some people, I do not understand.  I believe that had the Deputy's Government come into office at the general election which was held the following year, some such Bill as the Bill we have here would have been introduced.  It might have gone the length which Deputy Costello wishes us to go in this Bill and increased the Supreme Court and High Court, but certainly, unless they wished to ignore the findings of their own Commission, they would have had to meet the demand for this change which was so clearly voiced by the witnesses who came before the Commission and which was given effect to in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, whether it is a matter to be deplored that the country should demand the appeal by way of rehearing, there it is, and those of us who have had experience of the working of such a system do not see anything like the objections to it that Deputy McGilligan sees in theory.  I have heard urged against the system&mdash;and the Deputy, I think, repeated the statement <Col N="1034" /> frequently made against this system of appeals without the stenographer's note, by way of rehearing&mdash;that it encouraged perjury.  That is grossly exaggerated, from my own practical experience of the working of the system of appeals.  It is quite unlikely that, in any case of any importance, a witness would have the hardihood to change his story between one court and another, and risk the exposure which he must suffer at the hands of a vigilant solicitor or vigilant counsel who had been in the court below.  I do not know if the Deputy has had experience of a witness attempting to change his story, and being faced with a person who he knows was listening when he told a different story in another court.</P>

      <P>It might not trouble him, but I have no recollection of any case in which a witness got away with a case on appeal by changing his story or in which he hoodwinked the judge on appeal into the belief that the story he was telling in the appeal court was true.  I have had no practical experience of that particular evil which has been so much referred to in these discussions as to the advantage or disadvantage of the appeal with the stenographer's notes. There the matter stands.  I said last evening when discussing this, and I have said it before, that it may be that the present system has not got a long enough trial to enable us to judge as between it and the old system, but when this Committee sat, the body of opinion was altogether in favour of a return to the old system, and witnesses of the standing I have just mentioned, men who cannot have had any reason for giving their opinions beyond a belief in the statements they made and their desire to see the change made, all favoured the proposals which are embodied in this Bill and which have been so roundly denounced here as something emanating from a perverse and uninspired Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice has taken the Committee's report and attempted to give effect to <Col N="1035" /> its recommendations, and I do not see why there should be such a fierce attack upon them as there has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite right for the Attorney-General to say that the attack, if it can be called an attack, on this change back to the old system was made in any sense along the lines he has stated, as being brought in by a perverse and uninstructed Minister for Justice.  The criticism has gone along the lines of principle, as to whether or not, in principle, the new system set up by the Act of 1924 was better than the system it superseded.  I think it was along those lines that the discussion went, and it is on those lines that there are very considerable grounds for differences of opinion on the matter.  I think it is quite correct for the Attorney-General to say that a number of people had very strong views on the virtue of the old system as against the evils of the new system.  I look forward, I confess, with considerable perturbation to having to trek around the country again on assizes. It offers no inducement to me, either from the point of view of comfort in a country hotel or of the remuneration that might ensue, but other people think that they are going to make their fortunes.  Other people want the new system because they object to the particular circuit judge dealing with the case at the moment, and when you discuss this matter with them, and push their reasons down to bedrock, you find that it is not the system they object to but a particular individual or individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Attorney-General refers to the number of eminent gentlemen who gave their opinions before this Joint Committee, I think everybody will recognise that most of these opinions were coloured, either by conservative ideas or their own hopes of what might ensue to their practice as a result of the change in the procedure of the Circuit Court.  I think the Attorney-General is not at all correct in his statement that the attack on this system is actuated by any suggestion that this decision to <Col N="1036" /> revert is in any way a perverse decision. There is, undoubtedly, room for differences of view on this thing. I take the view that the system under the Act of 1924 has not been a success, much as I am in favour of it.  The reason why that system has not been a success is not because of the system itself, but because of the methods by which that system was operated and construed by High Court judges.  I think the system did not get a fair trial, not because of the lapse of time, but because of the way in which it was administered and construed by High Court judges. They gave, in my view, too narrow an interpretation to their powers.</P>
    <P>It might be that that could be met by enlarging their powers and by making it clear that they had powers of hearing these cases on appeal on questions of fact as well as on questions of law, but I certainly think that, in a few years' time, when people have had experience of this new system, we shall have a demand in this House for a commission to inquire into the question of whether we ought not to go back to the system under the Act of 1924.  I can envisage what is going to happen.  When assizes go out for the first time, there will be a grand crop of appeals.  A lot of legal gentlemen will perhaps have a little rake-off for the first time, but these will disappear like snow before the sun; at the second assizes, there will be fewer appeals; and at the third assizes, there will be practically none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that it is quite wrong to speak of the proposal in the Bill as being a reversion to the old principle?  The old County Court had jurisdiction of £50, but the procedure then existing was that, from the hearing by the County Court judge, there should be a rehearing by a judge of assize.  £50 is a substantial sum but it is still only 1/6th of £300 which is the present jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, and there never has been in this country, or in any country, a system which allowed litigants to have substantial cases involving a sum of £300 tried twice, and, if they failed to secure a decision <Col N="1037" /> in their favour at the first trial, to put the whole matter in issue again before another judge.  I do not know why it should be thought that a better decision is going to be got that way. I do not know, when a circuit judge has heard witnesses, has given careful consideration to the case and has made his decision, why that decision is to be nullified and wiped out by the simple service of notice of appeal which will bring the case before another judge.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the present constitution of the Circuit Court, and the expectation that in the future the Circuit Court will be manned by persons of equal ability, I do not know that it is likely that you are going to get better results by that system.</P>
      <P>Now an appeal, by way of a rehearing, is a very suitable method of appeal in very small cases, and at present, under the 1924 Act and, I think, under the Bill at present before the House, an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court is by way of rehearing.  No person can quarrel with that because the district justices have to try a very great number of small cases.  Decisions have to be come to rapidly and, in most cases, a decision is quite simply arrived at. But, if and when a very complicated, difficult or doubtful case arises, the litigant who has had his case summarily disposed of before the District Court can take an appeal to the circuit judge and make his case before him.  But, what is true of the £10 civil bill or even the £25 civil bill in the District Court has no relation to the circumstances where people have to litigate about such large sums as £300, and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that it is well worthy of consideration that no case of that kind, which ought to be carefully prepared and presented to the Circuit Court judge, ought to be wiped out by the simple service of notice of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General is not in the House.  He has said that he has no recollection of difficulties being found under the old system or of its being discovered that witnesses changed <Col N="1038" /> their evidence.  Well, I think that both the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General are long enough in the profession to remember the civil bill appeals as heard by judges of assize.  Certainly, in my experience, one of the commonest questions asked of witnesses on the hearing of civil bill appeals was: What did you swear in a court below?  The question was so often asked that it became absurd and no judge paid any attention to that question, or made any attempt to discover what the witness had sworn in the court below, because there was no record and no means of testing what he had sworn in the court below.  It was only counsel who could not think of a better way of presenting his case that addressed that question to witnesses because it became so much discounted. I think this question is really worthy of reconsideration, whether the present system ought not to be maintained, and, if possible, improved upon by extending the powers of the High Court judges in the hearing of appeals on notes, or whether some alternative could not be discovered of allowing rehearings in certain small cases, while preserving the present system as regards the substantial cases, say, of over £100.</P>

      <P>According to the statement of the Attorney-General it has seldom, if ever, happened that a person won a case by changing his evidence.  There is no possible way by which a judge can get official cognisance of what exactly a person said in the court below.  There should be some means of securing that.  That is a very important point and one worthy of reconsideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the opposite side speakers have persisted in describing this as a vicious attack on an uninstructed and perverse Minister. I entirely disclaim the use of that phrase for myself.  The Attorney-General told us of the big number of witnesses who appeared before the Committee and wanted a change. Why did they want it?  If you go deeper than merely counting heads, why did the two representatives of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and <Col N="1039" /> other commercial organisations speak as they did?  For this reason: the time delay in the hearing of appeals. That was the point that weighed with them.  The attitude of certain classes of commercial men in this city and Cork is: give us an immediate hearing for our cases and hang the expense, but when you set up a system they are the first to complain about the expense involved.  They were impressed by the delay as between the first hearing and the hearing of the appeal.  I quoted statistics about the business in the courts.  You were thinking then of the mass of appeals which never got below 200, and 200 was regarded as about a year's work. Those were the appeals that were coming from about 14,000 cases, then the average work of the Circuit Courts.  They were going to the High Court that was dealing with a number of cases originating in the High Court and averaging about 7,000.  The situation we have now is that these appeals have been so eaten into that, even with certain mishaps with regard to the illness of judges and so on, there are only about 150 appeals outstanding. The volume of Circuit Court work has dropped by about one-third and so also has the High Court work. There is less High Court work and less Circuit Court work to be done.  There is not the same probability of appeals, so that even if we get an improved procedure there is not likely to be the same number left over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing was the expense.  Of course, the cases that the Minister quoted the other night were quoted and made great use of by the Committee, but the Committee having heard a number of these examples formulated this opinion.  They believed that in the smaller case, the £10 case, the costs were undoubtedly much more severe than they used to be but that that was a fallacious comparison, and they said this that there was no evidence produced which impressed them that in the higher range of cases the cost of appeals was anything more than what it used to be.  The costs were mainly due to the stenographer's notes and to the fees of solicitors and counsel. <Col N="1040" /> They recommended the keeping of the notes.  The Ministry have now added a new item, and that is that they are going to increase court fees, and if litigation is going to be cheapened, that is going to be at the expense of the legal people employed.  That is the aim of the present Government.</P>
    <P>A number of people who gave evidence before the Committee were in favour of going back to what is called the old system of appeal because they were impressed by the point of delay and the point of expense.  The Committee had not made the point of expense because they recommended a type of rehearing which would involve as much expense, and the time question, I hold, would solve itself. The judges would get on top of the appeals, and as the appeals were likely to diminish in number, with less work in the High Court to be done, there would be an opportunity of dealing with the appeals and getting rid of them.</P>
    <P>The question of perjury was undoubtedly raised before the Committee, and the Committee was impressed by it despite what the Attorney-General thinks.  They say in the report that they thought that the arguments about perjury were rather strained and exaggerated, but remember they did this&mdash;they changed suddenly in their recommendation. Look at what they did.  They had been impressed by the talk of expense, and particularly the expense relating to the notes.  Yet they recommended keeping the notes.  Why?  I think that anyone who goes through the evidence and studies it in detail will find the reason: that there is a growing impression revealed towards the end among the members of the Committee in which they express the view that there is one way of meeting the perjury aspect and that is by keeping the notes.  They changed away from the other view which they had held when economy was uppermost in their minds at one time, and recommended the retention of the notes because they were impressed by the arguments about perjury.</P>
    <P>I do not care what view one may have about how naturally truthful the <Col N="1041" /> people of this country are, but if a man has a case in court and sees that it is going to be tried again, that he suddenly discovers he is going to be given an opportunity of mending his hand, then that is going to be a terrible temptation to him.  The Attorney-General takes the point about a man going to be blatant in his perjury. That is not what happens.  I am a novice in this, but I have read the report and the comments of experienced people and I am satisfied that it is not what happens.  I think it was the President of the High Court who, in the course of his evidence, spoke of the artful perjurer trimming his case, taking away a little of the things that he found were against him at the first hearing and coming in at the second hearing with a story well arranged and all the small points cleaned out.  It was to meet that kind of thing that the Committee recommended the keeping of the notes, even although the retention of the notes meant that they were going to involve a new type of appeal and an expenditure which, first of all, they wanted to avoid.  Reading through the Committee's report, I was impressed by the number of people who stood against that current of opinion and were definitely in favour of keeping the new system.  A very large number were in favour of that course.  I do not want to make odious comparisons between the witnesses who appeared there, but I certainly thought there was more reason given by those who wanted the new system held than by those who wanted to return to the old system.  The people who wanted to return to the old system founded themselves on the argument that the people have got used to it, that they do not understand the procedure of appeal in Dublin many months after the first hearing and that they wanted to go back to the old system.  I want to quote from the evidence of one witness &mdash;I mentioned his name last night&mdash; the Registrar in County Monaghan, who had been a solicitor of considerable experience and eminence.  He was quite definite and clear about this proposal. In the first place, he said that he did not think the system of appeal <Col N="1042" /> on stenographer's notes should be altered.  Then he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I admit, if you like, that there is some advantage in a judge looking at the witness but it seems to me such a strange thing that a number of people are anxious&mdash; cost what it will to peasant or small shopkeeper &mdash; to enjoy the great privilege of having two judges of appeal looking at them face to face instead of the present method.  If that be a good thing and if it be necessary to have judges of appeal, why is it then that the large merchants and people of high standing who are litigants in the High Court are not also given the same privilege?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have never heard an answer to that question.  The registrar went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Never, so far as I know, in the history of the High Courts in either England or Ireland have these people been favoured with an appeal by way of rehearing.  Their only appeal in the biggest cases tried in England or Ireland has been an appeal on notes, and these were the judge's notes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, he spoke of his experience of certain judges.  I pass from that.  He was asked what the remedy was if the stenographer's notes were wrong, and he said that that would be obviously a case for a new trial motion. He indicated later another point of view for which there is a great deal to be said.  Speaking of appeals generally, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I respectfully submit that, if I may use a County Monaghan phrase, we are `polluted' with appeals all over Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said the reason why there were so few of these appeals in Dublin&mdash; he was referring to the evidence of the Registrar of County Dublin&mdash;was that the bulk of the litigants in Dublin were intelligent and fairly educated people, whereas, in the country, the appeals were concerned largely with small family feuds, or &ldquo;title cases,&rdquo; as they are called.  He thought that these appeals should not be facilitated. He expressed the view that there should be as free an appeal on <Col N="1043" /> questions of fact as, and no freer than, there is in the High Court on questions of fact from the verdict of a jury or the judgment of a judge of first instance in the High Court sitting without a jury.  He explained that that really meant no appeal at all on questions of fact.  Again, he adverted to the historical reasons for the old form of appeal and he very definitely agreed with what the President of the High Court had said, that there was hurry and rush in connection with the old civil bill appeals, particularly towards the end of the assize period. Some of the witnesses&mdash;I think it was this gentleman&mdash;adverted also to the fact that it was never possible to quote the decisions on the old civil bill appeals, that they were not regarded as authorities.  He alluded to his precis of evidence and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The County Court was merely a trial gallop, a morning canter before the real race, and the real race was at the assizes.  That is the way the people looked at it. So long as you give them an easy appeal by way of rehearing at their own doors, no matter how good a judge you give them in the Circuit Court, the people will appeal to that tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was asked if he considered it unwise to give a real appeal on fact and he said he thought that cheap appeals were as bad as cheap drink. I am merely quoting from answers to a series of questions, and I am not quoting them in sequence.  Mr. Murphy was tackled on all ends of that problem.  As to the question that has been raised about the likely decline in the education of practitioners and, eventually, of the bench if you have not judges going on assize, he derided that point of view and gave reasons for his attitude.  He tackled this question generally on grounds of principle.  There has been no answer to the question I have asked on several occasions: &ldquo;Why is this appeal on matters of fact required in this country when it is not required in any other country?&rdquo; If we decide to have it in these small cases &mdash;£50 was the limit formerly &mdash; why <Col N="1044" /> should we not have it in the bigger type of case?  When we have enlarged the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to £300 and enlarged the scope of the appeal by way of rehearing to £300, why do we stop there and not give the same rehearing on questions of fact in High Court cases?  The whole thing is illogical and the only reason that is given for it is that it was the old system.  The researches which the Attorney-General has carried out in departmental records must not have been satisfactory.  That report was presented to the last Executive Council early enough.  On every point, other than about three, on which the Committee made recommendations, there was almost a unanimous feeling and that feeling was by way of approval.  There was the question of increase in the numbers of the Supreme Court and there was the question of Circuit Court appeals On that, there never was a decision taken and the reason why there was no decision taken was that we felt the new system had not got a sufficiently long trial.  There was a cleavage of opinion.  Some people thought that the new system should be abolished and that we should get back to the old system.  Others were impressed by the views of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court as well as by the views of persons like Mr. Henry Murphy, that the new system had not been given a fair trial.  But a decision was never taken by the last Executive Council to reintroduce the former system, and I doubt very much if the present Bill would have been introduced in so far as it deals with the scheme of appeal from the Circuit Court.  There never was any decision taken on that and the reason was that there was a definite body of opinion in the Executive Council that the new system had not got a sufficient trial and that there was no argument on principle which should drive people back to the old system.  I do not know if there is another view as to the mentality and morality of the people.  But we were certainly warned by a number of people that perjury was rife enough in the country and that we were going to increase it if <Col N="1045" /> we adopted the recommendations of the Committee.  We had that put up to us by a number of people but some people were not impressed and thought that that danger was exaggerated. It seems that there is a desperate temptation to mend the case on the rehearing.  We had no definite opinion taken on that.  Our view was that the new system had not been sufficiently tried, that it was a good system and that it should be given a further trial.  The Government now take this further swerve.  The Committee, no matter what they thought, decided in favour of the stenographer's notes, because they were impressed by the evidence.  The Government is throwing aside the stenographers and is opening the door still wider to the evil that we have discussed.  I cannot speak from experience in this matter, but I said previously on this Bill, and I say now what is the layman's view, and not from a particular study of it, that anything I gathered in conversation makes me still more definitely of opinion that I should like to see the new system tried out for a while longer.  I recognise that there are numbers of people keen on a change. I think you can get reasons here and there to pick and choose in different circumstances.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy means Dublin, and so far as that is concerned, there is no intention whatever of making any alteration.  There is no misunderstanding about it.  We cannot tie ourselves down so that we may not alter other circuits.  There were originally eight circuits in the country, and later two judges were appointed who were supposed to be movable judges, who would go about the various circuits when arrears had accumulated.  In practice it has turned out that the two judges appointed were assigned to particular areas.  It is not intended to do so under this section without prior consultation with the judges.  We asked them for their views about this matter and nothing will be done without that.  There may have to be alterations in the areas.  The statistics will show that in some areas there is a certain number of cases, while in other areas there is a smaller number. I suppose it is quite right and perhaps proper to say that some judges may operate faster than others.  Whether that accounts for some of the arrears it is not for me to say.  The intention is that the areas will have to be altered in some way to try to fit them in, and instead of having eight circuits it is intended to have nine.  It is intended that movable judges will be assigned to circuits.</P>

I recognise that the circuits are going to be changed so that there should not be any difficulty in framing an amendment to meet the changed circumstances. <Col N="1047" /> I ask that a judge should be given this choice, that he will be left in the area which most nearly corresponds with his old circuit if he so desires.</P>

      <P>I suppose this question will arise later.  I raised a point already on the section with regard to the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission.  The point is this, that the Principal Act and amending Acts allowed for the substitution of a temporary judge instead of a permanent appointment, but allowed for such substitution only when the permanently appointed judge was ill, or out of the country, or possibly engaged on some public duties which were imposed upon him, and which it was found necessary that he should take up.  The Government have studded through the Bill the words &ldquo;or any other cause.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 10, at the end of Section 17, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person appointed under this section to act as a judge of the Circuit Court shall, during the period for which he was appointed hold office by the tenure by which a judge of the Circuit Court holds his office.</P>
      <P>I want to get information about the position when persons are appointed temporarily as judges in the Circuit Court.  Is it to be understood that they have any tenure or are they appointed for a particular period, or from day to day?</P>

      <P>A warrant of appointment is issued by the Executive Council and it sets out that they are only holding the temporary position of Circuit Court judge during the period that the other judge is absent.

      <P>Let us take the Circuit Court, and that a person is temporarily appointed to that court for a period.  Is it the practice that the appointment then is, so to speak, that of a new Circuit judge, and only limited by time; in other words that the position as regards salary, emoluments and removals, are just the same as if he were a Circuit Court judge?</P>

      <P>The reason for bringing forward this section was that we found that judges of certain circuits <Col N="1050" /> were available and were quite willing to deal with arrears in the City of Dublin where the business of the Circuit Courts had got into arrears. These judges, however, had no jurisdiction except in the areas to which they had been first assigned.  The object of this section is that if we find that there are arrears in Dublin, and that there are judges in other circuits who have disposed of the business in their areas then, if these judges are willing to place their services at our disposal in Dublin, we can assign them to the courts here in order to enable arrears to be wiped out.  That also applies to other areas where the same position in regard to arrears arises.</P>

      <P>Certain representations were made to us in regard to the matter dealt with in this section and I gave some sort of undertaking that it would be dealt with.  It appears that in the last ten years there was only one winding-up case in Cork. You cannot expect officials who are not getting practice in such work to be able to deal with it with the same expedition as it would be dealt with in Dublin.  Such work is now being transferred from the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, before Section 22, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Paragraph (ii) of Section 48 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the sum of £150 in lieu of the sum of £300 mentioned therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, as appears clearly on its face, aims at reducing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from the present figure of £300 to £150.  The Attorney-General, in the course of his observations on this stage of the Bill, has repeatedly referred to the fact that he can support his arguments by reference to strong bodies of opinion in <Col N="1051" /> favour of the point of view he has put forward.  I think there is the strongest possible body of opinion in favour of the amendment I am now putting forward.  Certainly I think he would find practically complete unanimity in both branches of the profession for the reduction of the Circuit Court jurisdiction from £300 to £150. While it is possible to make a case on the merits for the reduction of the Circuit Court jurisdiction from £300 to £150, and while the experience of the working of that system also tends to confirm the view that the jurisdiction should be reduced, I think it is unarguable that the system which is now proposed to be reintroduced, the system of rehearing which is embodied in the Bill, will inevitably require that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be reduced from £300 to £150. I am quite convinced and satisfied in my own mind, however much I object to the new system of rehearing, that it will never work unless the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is reduced.</P>
    <P>You have the position that experience has shown that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is rather too high. The evidence given before the Joint Committee was to the effect that the vast majority of cases that came before the Circuit Court were in fact cases involving amounts less than £150, and that there were very few cases coming before the Circuit Court that involved £300.  I believe that evidence was given and it satisfied the Committee. In this country an action involving anything over £150, certainly an action involving £200 or £300, is a very substantial action indeed.  Across the water there are actions involving bigger sums of money, but here in this country anything involving a claim of £200 or upwards is a very substantial <Col N="1052" /> action.  The argument that the costs of such an action in the Circuit Court are considerably less than the costs of a similar action in the High Court, is wholly fallacious.  If there is an action involving a considerable amount of money, such as an action for £200 or £300 is in this country, it will be found in practice that the litigation of such an action in the Circuit Court, followed by the inevitable appeal, will ultimately result in costing both parties to the suit very much more than if the action had been started in the High Court.</P>
    <P>I think if there is any objection to reducing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £300 to £150, that that objection, in so far as it has any substance, can be met by applying a special scale of costs in actions up to £150 or £200 which are determined in the High Court.  There can be no possible objection if an appropriate scale of costs is provided in the High Court.  As I say, there is a case apart from the provisions of the Bill, for reducing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  The evidence before the Joint Committee was that the vast majority of the cases heard in the Circuit Court, since the new system was set up, were in fact equivalent to the old £50 civil bill in the county courts, having regard to the fall in the value of money in recent years.  When you consider that you are going to have a complete rehearing for cases within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the argument for the reduction of the jurisdiction, in my submission, is conclusive.</P>
