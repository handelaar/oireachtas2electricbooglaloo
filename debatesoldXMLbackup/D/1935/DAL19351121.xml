      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow this Bill, containing Section 43 in its present form, to pass through the House without making a very strong protest.  Section 43 (2) in its present form is not only subversive of the principles upon which the administration of criminal justice is based, but it seems to me&mdash;I think it is hardly open to question&mdash;that it is opposed to the principles of natural justice itself.  I shall read the section to the House:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for an employer to employ a worker to do any form of industrial work on any day on which such worker has done any form of industrial work for another employer, except where the aggregate of the periods for which such worker does industrial work for each of such employers respectively on that day does not exceed the period (exclusive of overtime) for <Col N="1222" /> which such worker could lawfully be employed to do industrial work for one employer on that day.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever an employer employs a worker in contravention of this section, such employer shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and such worker shall also be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>When this Bill came before the House on Committee Stage, and this section was inserted as a new section, I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that the wording of sub-section (2) did not provide for the insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;employs&rdquo;.  I gathered from the Minister's attitude then that he would consider the representations I had made to him in a favourable light, though, on looking through the report, I find that he did not say so.  Unfortunately, on the Report Stage he did not give effect to the impression I had gathered.  On the Committee Stage, I pointed out the effect of the absence of this word &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; and the Minister's answer was that if the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; were inserted, it would be impossible to obtain convictions.  I am not much frightened by that, because the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; appears in many statutes, and it has not been impossible to get convictions under them.</P>
    <P>Knowledge, meaning thereby intention, is at the basis of our criminal code.  I suggested to the Minister that &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;by the exercise of reasonable care,&rdquo; or &ldquo;after making due inquiries,&rdquo; should be inserted, and I make the suggestion to him again to-day.  As it stands, this is a horrible sub-section and is subversive of the principles on which our law is based.  Let me take a concrete example so that the House may understand the working of this section and what it may lead to.  A man's car breaks down; he goes to a garage and finds it closed. He meets a mechanic belonging to the garage and asks him to set the car right.  He tells him that he wants to start off early in the morning and that he will require to have the car put right before the garage opens.  The mechanic tells him that he will work a couple of hours on the car before the garage <Col N="1223" /> opens next morning.  He does so and is duly paid.  He goes back to the garage in which he is employed, and works during the whole time that he is permitted by law to work in that garage.  The employer has no means of knowing anything about the repair of the car.  Subsequently, the Guards walk in with a summons for the employer and state that he employed a man in his garage for the whole period permitted by this Bill, that man having worked a couple of hours for somebody else.  The employer says that he could not conceivably have known that his employee worked for somebody else.  The answer will be: &ldquo;That does not matter in the least; you have broken the law and you are liable to a fine of £10; here is your summons.&rdquo;  That is absolutely unjust. A man should not be deemed to have broken the law when he does some thing which he could not have known by the exercise of reasonable care or precaution was a breach of the law.  An ordinary employer cannot be expected to engage detectives to see that his permanent employees do not do any work from midnight until they turn up at their jobs in the workshop.  I leave it to the Minister to say whether the imposition of a fine in a case like that would not be extremely unjust. The employer, when brought to court, will say that he had no means of knowing that his mechanic had worked for anybody else, and he will be told that his knowledge does not matter, that the offence consists not in knowledge or in carelessness but in the act itself.  No man should be punished for doing a thing when he could not have known at the time he did it that it was wrong.</P>
    <P>We have a precedent in this Bill.  I have never seen a clause like this in a statute before, and I do not believe any such clause has ever been inserted in a statute.  If this section passes, it will be a precedent which may be followed in other instances, and it is absolutely subversive of the elementary principles on which the administration of the criminal law in this country is founded. The whole administration of the criminal law in this country may be said to be based upon an old Latin maxim &ldquo;Actus non facit reum nisi <Col N="1224" /> mens rea.&rdquo;  It is not the doing of the deed which makes the man a culprit, it is the guilty intention.  Guilty intention is necessary for the commission of every crime.  If a man shoots another, the very fact of his doing so does not make that a crime.  The shooting may be due entirely to accident.  The gun may have gone off unexpectedly.  The man may have fired thinking, as a reasonable person might, that he was perfectly safe in doing so.  If he killed a man, the mere fact of the shooting would not make the occurrence murder; it would not make it a crime at all.  The verdict of a coroner's jury would be &ldquo;death by misadventure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to take that as an illustration. You can take plenty of other examples to show that it is necessary, according to our criminal law, to have a criminal intent before you can get any crime.  Taking the two assumptions of the law, one, that a man tends only to the probable consequences of his acts, and the other that a man knows the law, here you have that whole principle completely upset.  You have a man with no guilty intention, a man who, in the instance I have given, has done nothing wrong, a man who endeavoured to the best of his ability to keep within the law.  Yet, through the action of a third person, unknown to him, he has become a law breaker.  I press the Minister as strongly as I can, now that the Bill is leaving this House, not to allow this principle to become permanently embodied in the statute in its present form.  He should take advantage of the opportunities he will have in the Seanad to amend this sub-section. He can secure that guilty persons will be convicted by amending the section, but, it is perfectly wrong that there should be a sub-section in the Bill which makes persons who have not broken the law in any way, persons who are perfectly innocent in act and intention, law-breakers. I say that that is a very bad principle, and I appeal to the Minister to promise that, when the Bill is going through the Seanad, he will take steps to put the section right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is leaving this House, I think, very much better than when it was introduced.  The <Col N="1225" /> utility of the Bill has been enormously improved as a result of the close examination made of it here.  There are certain features in it, however, which I wish to see improved still further, notably the section which makes provision for the granting of holidays to workers, and also that portion dealing with the regulation of hours of work in industry.  In respect to holidays, it is true that for the first time we are now providing holidays with pay for industrial workers, but we are providing the inadequate number of six days.  The Minister on the Committee Stage endeavoured to mislead some organs of the Press into the belief that this was the only country where legislative sanction had been given to the granting of holidays to industrial workers.  I expect the Minister has had time to consult his officials on that matter, and if he has, I think they can produce a list of countries with a catalogue of legislation, showing that many of them have long since adopted legislation providing for the granting of holidays to industrial workers.  Indeed, some of these countries did not limit the granting of holidays solely to industrial workers, and in many of them the holidays are longer than those provided in this Bill.  We are now providing six days' holidays with pay for industrial workers.  While there may be some employers&mdash;and I think they are in the minority&mdash;who regard this as an unjust imposition upon industry, most industrial employers and social workers recognise that a piece of legislation of this kind is calculated to give us a better industrial system and physically better workers; and is not calculated in any way to impede the legitimate progress of industrial development here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that there was no credit side to the account, the cost of a reform of this kind will not entail more than about 2 per cent. of a charge upon industry.  That percentage is indeed a small one to pay for the social and economic value of granting holidays to workers.  We know that workers who get recreation from the long weary industrial grind are not only better workers, but that there is also a substantial return to the nation, in the way of improved health, <Col N="1226" /> and the avoidance of the necessity of spending money on public health services, which are rendered necessary by the long dreary fatiguing industrial work, unrelieved by any recreation, to which so many workers are condemned to-day.  On the Second Stage the Minister indicated that he was favourable to the idea of increasing holidays from six days to some higher number.  I noticed that at a function which he attended in the city he indicated that the six days provided in the Bill was the minimum, and he hoped that that minimum would be substantially increased in practice.  The Minister should during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad take power to prescribe by statute increased holidays for industrial workers, so that it will not be necessary at some future date to come back to this House to secure alterations in the Bill, in order to secure something more than is now provided for.  If the Minister does that, he will have made a contribution to the physical well-being of the workers, and the proper development of industry here, which I feel will react beneficially not merely upon the country, and not merely upon the physical well-being of the workers, but upon the healthy growth of our industries.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is the question of a reduction in working hours.  Judging by a speech made by the Minister outside the House, he has committed himself to a belief in reducing working hours, not merely that workers might share in the benefits which have been made possible by mechanical and scientific progress, but in order that a reform of that kind might make its own contribution to the relief of the unemployment problem.  During the discussion of the Bill in this House the Minister indicated his sympathy with the idea of a reduction in working hours for the purpose of making some contribution to the relief of the unemployment problem and also making available greater leisure for the workers.  I am sorry the Minister has not seen fit during the passage of the Bill to provide for a maximum working week of something substantially less than 48 hours. <Col N="1227" /> It is a far cry back to 1919, but the Washington Hours Convention of that year visualised as from that date the establishment of a maximum working week of 48 hours.  The world has learned much since then.  Even the artificial security of that year has been replaced by plenitude that has amazed even the most optimistic who saw in increased mechanisation and increased scientific discovery the ultimate possibility of a plentiful supply of the necessities of life amongst the communities of the world. We are now enacting legislation providing for a maximum working week of 48 hours, a reform which was first envisaged in 1919.  This Bill, far from outstepping the Washington Hours Convention of that year, is merely repeating in 1935 a reform that was regarded as practicable sixteen years ago.  The Minister was pressed at various stages to provide for a reduced working week, to establish a working week substantially less than 48 hours, but he resisted all amendments designed to achieve that objective while at the same time he indicated a certain sympathy with any movement designed to bring about a reduction in working hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officers must be aware of the fact that there is a worldwide movement towards a reduction in working hours, not merely because it is now realised that mechanical and scientific progress has made it possible for a reduction in working hours to make a practical contribution towards the relief of unemployment, but that in addition the same mechanical and scientific progress has made it possible to share amongst the workers benefits in the form of increased leisure which have flown from that progress. Here, however, we seem not fully to realise the possibilities which scientific and mechanical progress has made possible for our own people.  Many other countries in Europe have, by legislation and by executive acts, adopted working hours substantially less than 48 in the week.  Many countries, notably the Scandinavian countries, have insisted by legislation on fixing a working week in industry much less than 48 hours.  The Minister, <Col N="1228" /> who boasted on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage of the Bill that it was a pioneering measure, has apparently been able to retain sufficient conservatism to insist that the most this House will do is to fix a maximum working week which was first regarded as practicable in 1919 by the various nations represented at Washington.</P>
    <P>I believe that a reduction in working hours&mdash;and I have said so repeatedly in this House&mdash;will make a substantial contribution towards the relief of unemployment.  If the Minister does not believe that that remedy will make that contribution towards the relief of unemployment, then we are entitled to have from the Minister his idea of what remedies must be brought to bear on the problem of unemployment if the country is to be relieved of the serious evils which are flowing from that problem.  It may be, of course, that when the Bill passes, by means of conferences with trade unions on the one hand and employers on the other, the Minister may use his influence to secure the introduction of a working week of less than 48 hours.  Any movement by the Minister in that direction will have the wholehearted support of the trade union movement.  Might I suggest to the Minister that when he is going into conferences of that kind, he ought to go in with clean hands and in the knowledge that he is entitled to hold his head high?  The Minister will not be able to go into them holding his head high or with very clean hands while the State itself is employing workers for 48 hours per week and in some cases for substantially more than 48 hours.  One of the first acts which should follow the enactment of a Bill is that the State should set its own house in order.  I hope it will not be long before the Minister for Industry and Commerce reminds his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that he at all events should conform, in respect to the working hours of his employees, with the conditions which this Bill is going to impose on private employers.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has had a claim for two years for the reduction of the working hours of certain of his employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have it out with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I rest content, Sir, in the belief that with the passage of this Bill the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will see fit to comply with some of the conditions that are imposed on private employers under this Bill.  In any case when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is discussing with employers the reduction of the 48-hour week for industrial workers, they should not be able to point behind his back to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and say, &ldquo;There is the Minister for Posts who employs men for 48 hours a week and longer.&rdquo;  In this country at all events we have a unique situation which entitles us to expect that the benefits made possible by restricting the home market to private industrialists and by mechanised and scientific progress, should be shared by the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of tariffs has resulted in the whole of the home market being conserved for private industrialists, and I suggest, in return for granting them that concession, it is not unreasonable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should require private industrialists to conform to reasonable standards of industrial employment.  It is not unreasonable for him to expect private employers to make their contribution to the relief of unemployment by consenting to a substantial reduction in the working week, not merely to retain their existing employees in industry, but in order that additional workers might be absorbed by the reduction of the working hours of those who are already in employment.  Not merely is the Minister entitled to expect that private industrialists will do that, but also that every corporation and every local authority in the country should be required to give a headline to private industrialists.  I hope the Minister will not lose much time in bringing home to public authorities and to corporations such as the E.S.B. and the Sugar <Col N="1230" /> Company, the desirability of conforming with the intentions of the Legislature as set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe a reduction in working hours is not merely possible because of the progress which has been made mechanically and scientifically, but such reduction is imperative if we are going to retain in industry even those who are at present employed to-day.  The introduction of machinery during the past ten years has resulted in the disemployment of many workers. The introduction of the same machinery has resulted in the substitution of male adult workers by underpaid women and by youths.  If that tendency is not going to have a ruinous effect on the livelihood of workers, it is imperative that, complementary to the introduction of machinery into industry, there must be an evergrowing demand by the Minister and by the Legislature for the reduction of working hours in order to make good the casualties in industry which are imposed by the introduction of mechanised methods.  If this House and the Minister are to take the viewpoint that machinery is to be introduced into industry subject to no control, then we can all visualise that in a short time the livelihood of many workers engaged in industry to-day will not merely be sacrificed, but that we can look forward to an unemployment problem even of greater magnitude than we know to-day.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, the Minister will make it part of his philosophy, and part of the policy of the Executive Council, to ensure that, side by side with the growth of mechanisation and scientific effort in industry, employers will be required, either by executive action on the part of the Minister or by legislation, to make their contribution to the relief of unemployment by gradually reducing the hours worked in industry and in that way making it possible for all who are available for work to make their contribution towards providing the nation with its human and physical needs.  If the Minister would adopt that line, I believe that he would in the course of time make a greater contribution towards the relief of unemployment than many of the illusory panaceas <Col N="1231" /> that are being tried to-day.  I hope, if he is not prepared to do it by means of an amendment of this Bill in the Seanad, the Minister will at all events prepare private industrialists in this country for a drastic reduction in the working hours as the contribution which the State expects them to make towards the relief of unemployment, and which the State is especially expecting them to make now that they have been substantially protected in their own markets, and after the State on its part has made substantial sacrifices in order to rehabilitate these industries and retain them in existence.</P>

      <P>This Bill should not leave this House without some comment being made not only on what it does, but on the many things it fails to do. When we talk of improving the working conditions in this country, it is well for this House to bear in mind that the application of this Bill is to an infinitesimal minority of the working classes of this country.  While we are providing minimum standard conditions for industrial workers, we are doing it in the knowledge that the vast body of the workers, the agricultural labourers, are working ten and 12 hours per day, for 18/-, 19/- and 20/- per week.</P>

      <P>It is true to say, I think, that part of the cost of this measure has to be borne by those sections of the community who will consume the products of the industrial workers of this country.  To improve their conditions is something to which all sides of the House have lent a hand, but it is wrong, in my opinion, that a Bill of this character should leave this House without Deputies realising that in improving their conditions, as we all determined it was right to do, we have laid the burden of the expense on the shoulders of the community.</P>
      <P>I conceive myself to be entitled to say that a very large part of that community are agricultural workers.  Is there not justice in the representation that if we are to improve the conditions of workers in industry we ought also to consider the condition of the persons at whose expense we are going to improve those conditions?  Is it fair or equitable that we should improve the conditions of the industrial worker and stop at that, when the people who have to pay for these improvements are those labouring for ten and 12 hours per day for 18/-, 19/- and 20/- per week?  Surely some consideration should be given to the source from which the money to finance these reforms is to come?</P>

      <P>I am tempted to intervene for a moment by the speech of Deputy Norton.  I am a warm supporter of this Bill and have been from the beginning.  I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the skill and energy with which he has piloted it through the House.  I supported the Labour Party amendment for increasing the number of holidays provided for by this Bill, and also, on general principles, I am strongly in favour of reducing the number of working hours in the week further than the hours provided for in this Bill.  But I think it is legitimate, in view of Deputy Norton's speech, to say that the possibility of doing these things depends upon maintaining and improving the purchasing power of the community as a whole, and that it is not irrelevant to point out that the welfare of the agricultural community must be the condition of further social advances on the lines <Col N="1234" /> Deputy Norton and I would like to see come about.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced in the Dáil last April, and it has had a very long passage.  It has been discussed at considerable length and in great detail in all its stages.  I think I can agree with Deputy Norton in saying that it has been improved by that discussion.  As tributes are being paid, I want to participate in the paying of them by congratulating, in particular, the members of the Labour Party and the members of the Opposition Party, particularly Deputies Beckett, Dockrell and Good, who have taken a very careful interest in the Bill and who have contributed largely to the amendment of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a question in relation to Section 44.  I do not know that that point of his has much substance in it.  In order to appear to give it substance, he had necessarily to imagine a rather unusual type of case in which the regular employer of a workman was his second employer in the day.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that the practices against which the section is directed take a different form.  The section is designed to prevent workers in regular employment seeking occasional employment in the same class of work after their normal working day has ended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the detriment of their colleagues and of employers in the industry.  Such employers, in these circumstances, can ascertain without difficulty whether the worker has been employed.  All these workers are required to insure under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and any person who employs them is under an obligation to place an insurance stamp on the book in respect of such employment. In any event, the general practice of employing workers in such wise is to be discouraged.  It is detrimental to the interests of the regular employers and to the interests of the workers, and it was by agreement from all sides of the House that this section was included in the Bill.  Now, even in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred, it is clear that we must put <Col N="1235" /> some obligation upon the employer of the worker to ensure that the provisions of the Act are being carried out. The insertion in the section of the word &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; which the Deputy suggested, puts upon the person who is instituting proceedings against that employer a very different obligation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will understand that one cannot regard offences against this Act in the same light as one would regard offences against the common law.  In many sections of this Bill, as well as in many sections of other enactments, we are prohibiting, in the interests of social order, certain things being done, the doing of which are not in themselves offensive except in certain circumstances; and the prohibition contained therein is designed to bring it to the minds of all persons interested in such matters that these things are undesirable and that there is an obligation on employers as well as on workers to ensure that they are discouraged. In any event, the powers under which we can proceed against employers, in such circumstances, are such as will enable a certain discretion to be used.  As I explained yesterday, in a great majority of cases proceedings will not be instituted except at the suit of the Minister, and he is not obliged to institute proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I think it is not desirable that it should be done. I think the point is covered by making <Col N="1236" /> it an offence for the worker to work excessive hours under these circumstances and for an employer to employ a worker under these circumstances. It is shown clearly that it is undesirable. I do not think that Deputy Norton's remarks call for any special comment from me at this stage.  I do not say that this is the only country in respect of which some type of legislation dealing with holidays for workers exists, but I think we can justly claim that this Bill puts this country in the forefront of those countries which have legislated for improved conditions in industry, and I do not think that that fact can be contradicted by reference to publications from any source. Neither do I think that Deputy Norton quoted me correctly when he said that I had expressed the opinion that, by a reduction in working hours, a solution of the problem of unemployment could be found.  I do not think that a solution of that problem could be found in the reduction of hours alone.  I think that any examination of the effects of a general reduction of working hours in industry will show that, as a solution of unemployment, it is not likely to be very effective.  I agree that the workers are entitled to share in the benefits of industrial progress and increased output due to new technical processes, and that, where the output is increased by new technical processes, the workers engaged in such industry are entitled to share in that by increased leisure.  I think that some amelioration of unemployment conditions may be secured by reduction of working hours, but unless coupled with other measures, which it is not necessary to discuss now, it is my opinion that a reduction of working hours alone will not alter substantially the conditions of unemployment, and I think that that has been the experience in the United States of America, where a substantial reduction of working hours has been attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the flower of Deputy Dillon's oratory has been nipped in the bud.  Evidently, he hopes to have another opportunity, and I am sure he will enjoy it. <Col N="1237" /> Deputy MacDermot, of course, was quite right in saying that the standard of our social legislation must depend on the general level of prosperity in this country, but I am quite certain that the present level of prosperity here can bear this particular piece of legislation and that when, as we anticipate, the degree of prosperity enjoyed here increases and the standards of living of all classes of people continue to improve as they have been improving, we will be able to move forward from the position which this Bill takes up to a more advanced position.  But it is not seriously contended by anybody, I am sure, that the wealth which this country possesses&mdash;the wealth which it is enjoying, such as it is&mdash;is not capable of supporting the standard of living for industrial workers which this Bill lays down.  Everybody knows that it is, and unprejudiced people know that the position has improved.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. As the House is aware, in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 1 of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, an Order made under the Act which does not merely revoke the Order previously made, ceases to have statutory effect upon the expiration of eight months from the date of making, unless in the meantime it is confirmed by the Oireachtas.  This Bill proposes to confirm ten Orders set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The general subject matter of each Order is enacted in the Schedule.  The earliest of the Orders to be confirmed is Order 68, which expires or is due to expire on 25th December next, and it is necessary that the Bill should become law before that date.  The other Orders, in the normal course, would have a longer currency than Order 68, but, in view of the dates of some of them, it would not be practicable to defer giving statutory effect to the duties to which they relate until the Finance Resolutions and the Finance Act of next year. Their inclusion in the Bill at the present stage will obviate the necessity later on of introducing further Confirmation Bills.  I assume that any detailed discussion which would take place on this Bill would take place on the Committee Stage.  I, accordingly, move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>It would be more convenient and it is our intention to raise matters of detail on the Committee Stage.  But at this stage I should like to ask the Minister one question: that is, why is it not the practice to enact all outstanding Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders on the occasion of such a Bill as this?  There are several Emergency Imposition of Duties <Col N="1241" /> Orders in addition to those appearing in the Schedule which will have to be enacted sooner or later.  If they are to be made permanent, why not include them in this Bill and have a clean job made of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them have in fact already been dealt with in the Financial Resolutions and the Finance Act of this year.  Order 69 revoked a number of Orders, the duties imposed by which were implemented in the Finance Act of 1935.  Order 71, which reduced the rate of Excise duties on pig carcases, was wholly revoked by Order 79.  Order 70 was superseded by Order 79 and so on.  In general the Deputy will find that is the reason why a certain number of Orders are allowed to lapse, and that the duties imposed by them which are not to be put on a permanent basis are not in this Bill.</P>

      <P>That is why I raised the matter.  It does give rise to a very difficult position.  We are glad to co-operate in getting the business through, but we cannot be a party to the introduction of legislation which is for the purpose of covering up the Minister's tracks.  This Bill ordinarily ought to include an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order that was made <Col N="1242" /> for the purpose of levying, not a tax really but a fine on a firm who perfectly legitimately imported thread into this country.  What are the facts? Some time ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;started negotiations with an English combine to set up a thread monopoly in Westport.  At a very early stage it emerged that the monopoly had no intention of manufacturing thread at all; they were simply going to import thread, put it on spools and sell it.  They were to be known as the Irish Thread Company. While these negotiations were going on, Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats, of Paisley, who are participants in a large thread combine called the Central Agency, in Great Britain, approached the Minister indirectly to know if they might set up in Dublin in the thread manufacturing, thread dyeing and thread reeling business, and they were told no licence would be made available to them because it was the Minister's determination to make a monopoly of this business for Westport. Before the Minister for Industry and Commerce had made any monopoly order, Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats and other firms connected with the Central Agency, Limited, of Great Britain, imported into this country considerable stocks of thread.  When they were doing that, there was no reason why they should not.  It was a perfectly legitimate trade.  There was no law against it and no possibility of prosecution, because nothing had been done which any court would hold was an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats forgot the fact that a new offence has been created in this country, and that is the offence of vexing Mr. Lemass; not outraging the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his official position, but vexing Mr. Lemass.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce discovered that, Mr. Lemass notwithstanding, somebody had actually brought in considerable stocks of thread and had them in the country.  Possibly some Deputies will say that this was an act <Col N="1243" /> of sabotage, and it meant that these huge accumulations of thread would be there and the Irish Thread Company would not be able to dispose of their production.  Nothing is further from the fact.  The truth is that the Irish Thread Company cannot fill the orders of any of their customers.  The Irish Thread Company have orders to-day for as small a quantity as 100 gross of reels.  They have had that order for three months and they have been unable to fulfil it.  They have been giving out dribs and drabs to a variety of customers.</P>

      <P>I will, and I will astonish you when I do.  There was nothing of a reprehensible character in the act of Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats bringing in considerable quantities of thread, because they are passing into consumption and, at the same time, the Irish Thread Company is unable to meet the demand for thread.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, placed an Excise duty on thread in such a way that nobody would pay the Excise duty but Messrs. Coats, because he stipulated that it should apply to no thread unless the thread was in the ownership of a person who had more than £1,000 worth, or else £500 worth in his possession.</P>

      <P>It does not matter.  The purpose was not to raise revenue, not to protect the home market, but to penalise an individual who had done something which, at the time of its being done, was a perfectly legitimate thing to do.  He did, in fact, collect under that order thousands of pounds from this individual firm and he now says it is the intention of the Government to let that Order lapse.  Having wreaked their vengeance on one particular individual, they now intend to let the Order lapse and they thereby admit that they had no other purpose in view than to mulct this firm.  It is <Col N="1244" /> quite unnecessary to go into the merits of the matter, but it is evident that in future if you vex Seán T. Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry to hear it.  I had hoped one would be permitted to differentiate between the extraordinary activities of that gentleman, Mr. Lemass, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce constitutes himself prosecutor, judge and jury between himself and any individual citizen.  He makes up his mind that the personal pride of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been outraged by something that has been done by a citizen of this State, and then fines him in any sum that he thinks necessary.  There is no appeal, no legislation to support it, and the matter is never brought before the House, because the Order is allowed to lapse before the statutory time comes for its enactment.  We had lettres de cachet by the pre-revolutionary Government in France, and a Star Chamber, but at least they went through some kind of formality and stated boldly that they were going to victimise certain individuals. But in this country the Revenue Commissioners are to be used for the purpose of despoiling anybody of any sum that the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks proper to take from them, if they should vex his person or if they should in any way resent the tyrannical activities of the Department over which he presides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What astonishes me is that into that kind of conspiracy the Minister for Finance allows himself to be drawn. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to bring before the House every Emergency Imposition of Duties Order on the assumption that they were all made with a view to the permanent good of the country.  It is to <Col N="1245" /> his discredit that he has allowed himself to be dragged into this conspiracy to victimise one individual.  It is to his discredit that he allows the Revenue Commissioners to be used to exact heavy fines on individuals whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not happen to welcome here.  It is a great abuse of the powers conferred on the Government to use them in the way the Minister for Industry and Commerce uses them here.  Unless the Minister for Finance is prepared to say in future that he will not tolerate the use of the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of venting personal spites of that character, I will challenge a division on this Bill.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said in the course of the debate, it emerges that this Bill is primarily designed, not to implement the Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders but to cover up the tracks of the Minister for Industry in the discreditable assault he made on an individual in this State for what was a perfectly legitimate act when the act was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene to say that the firm mentioned by Deputy Dillon was not concerned in the matter at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made with regard to the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 70) Order discloses an astounding state of affairs. Just look at the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 74) Order, which purports to put a customs duty at the rate of 6d. per square yard on (a) paper felt (whether saturated with bitumen, tar, or other similar substance, or not so saturated) exceeding seventy inches in width and imported in the roll, and (b) floor-coverings (whether completely or partially manufactured) which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, have a hard surface, and (c) cork carpets and cork carpeting, and (d) floor-coverings made wholly or partly of rubber, artificial rubber, an imitation of rubber, or a substance containing rubber as an ingredient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tax of 6d. per square yard was put upon those items.  Information that was published in reply to a question asked by Deputy Peadar <Col N="1246" /> Doyle, on 30th October, indicates many other things with the quantity and value of the linoleum imported, in the six months March 1934-35, and showing a decline in the number of square yards, and in the value of the linoleum imported.  It showed in respect of floor-covering, not elsewhere specified or included (not of wool, jute or fur) that a very substantial increase in the number of square yards and value of the import had taken place.  Linoleum fell in value from £46,249 in 1934, to £41,256 in 1935.  That was a very substantial fall in the value of the import in spite of the fact that so many new houses were being built under the Government housing programme the like of which was never heard in any other country. Imports of floor-covering of a cheaper form were greatly increased, and rose from 67,171 square yards in 1934 to 438,723 square yards in 1935 and in value from £4,032 in 1934 to £15,686 in 1935.  The new rate of 6d. covered these items that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>But if, perchance, there is some other form of floor-covering not included in these four classes, and if somebody in the trade imports a large quantity of that, and the Minister finds out that he forgot to include it in these Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders, an excise duty can be produced immediately.  That trader can be fined for taking action, perfectly legitimate from a law and trade point of view, and this House can never effectively discuss the matter; because the Minister can issue an Emergency Imposition of Duty Order of an Excise type, operated for a month or two or three as the case may be.  Then when he has done his damnedest the thing, automatically, goes out of existence if he does not bring it before the Dáil in eight months, and gets the Dáil to deal with it.</P>
    <P>So we have now a new weapon in order to penalise people engaged in legitimate trade held over their heads by the Government.  This has been operated in exactly similar cases to the one which I suggest.  It can be operated in the future having regard to the attitude of the Ministry in regard to any of their Customs Duties <Col N="1247" /> Orders of which they make a botch, and we have no guarantee that it will not be extended beyond that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is difficult to deal satisfactorily with these particular matters upon this Bill.  From the way Ministers are handling matters that come before us under these Emergency Orders Imposition of Duties, we can see how many people in the country run a kind of danger if they are engaged in trade or business in connection with floor cloth.  Of course questions can be put to Ministers in respect of these Orders.  One of the Orders we are asked to deal with now is an Order by way of the Emergency Imposition of Duties on such things as almonds.  A crisis developed in our native land.  Almonds had to be kept out except they were brought in by one particular person.  It is, moryah, such an important industry that an Emergency Order had to be issued to keep out almonds generally.  A duty was imposed on hollow ware, floor-covering, cotton thread, and a certain class of sports requisites&mdash;windscreens and requisites for windscreens.  I think we were informed, in reply to questions, by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that these duties were imposed for the purpose of financing industrial protection.  One question was asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to whether he would give some information as to the number of people employed in a particular industry here.  When asked questions of that kind his general line is that he does not know what the amount of the import of these articles is, and the Minister for Finance, when questioned, does not know what the Customs Duties were that were charged.</P>
    <P>These duties, we are told, are imposed for the purpose of creating new industries.  When the Minister knows that a new industry is to be set up, he does not know what employment it is going to give.  If we give any credit to Ministers for dealing in a bona fide way with the House, and for being prepared to give the information they have to the House&mdash;if we are <Col N="1248" /> prepared to believe that&mdash;the only conclusion we can come to is that some friend of theirs comes up to them and says: &ldquo;We are prepared to go into this particular industry if you will put a tariff on it.&rdquo;  And without knowing any more about the situation than that, they immediately impose one of those Emergency Imposition of Duty Orders. I do not know that we should take it for granted that Ministers treat the House fairly in a matter of information of this kind.  Ministers say they do not know what the value of these imports is.  Ministers say that they have given licences to persons to import what they consider the normal requirements of the country.  But in most cases they refuse to tell the House the quantity of the articles in respect to which they issued licences for imports.  Surely it is that information that is desirable. Surely if an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order is put into force, and the Minister knows nothing at all about previous imports, and about the prospects of employment under the Order, he ought to come to the House to change this condition of things.  He ought to be able to tell the House that he has been persuaded that the normal requirements over the last three months, say, were such and such, because he issued licences for imports of these things.  But there is not one single one of these things upon which the Minister gives the House any information.  He comes here and tells us that he issued licences for the importation of some of these articles free of duty.</P>
    <P>Some of these items will have to be discussed separately upon Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to tell the House the process that is gone through in examining either the position with regard to linoleum or cotton-thread or almonds or wind-screens and placing import duties upon them.  What are the initial processes gone through either between persons in his own Department, or between his Department and members of the commercial community, before a decision is taken to put a duty on any of these things? If a policy is being pursued of developing industry by means of recurrent impositions of duties of this particular kind, we ought to know something <Col N="1249" /> of the departmental processes that are bringing about what the Minister hopes will be the creation of additional industry here.  It is essential that the House should know that. There is another aspect of the matter too.  Both the Minister last year came into this House at Budget time, and again this year, and stated that they anticipated they would receive a certain amount in Customs duty.  Last year the figure swung very much above the estimated figure.  The Minister, in fact, balanced his Budget by imposing from time to time during the year additional Customs duties that he knew were going to bring in an additional amount of revenue, which he was going to use to balance his Budget. This year he deliberately withheld from us information with regard to the cement tax, and all through the year he has been putting on those enormous imposition of duty taxes.  When he is asked what is the estimated increase in revenue which he expects as a result of those taxes he says it would be most undesirable to tell us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I remind the Deputy that yesterday he asked me a series of questions in relation to the duties imposed under those Emergency Orders, and to the best of my recollection my reply was that the amount of revenue derived from them would be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Then let us take a particular example; let us get back to floor-coverings again.  I asked the Minister, in connection with the imposition of duty on floor-coverings, what would be the increased amount derived from Customs duties, and he told me &ldquo;I do not consider it desirable that information as to the estimated yield in a financial year from the duties under a particular head of revenue should be furnished by way of Parliamentary question and reply.&rdquo; Does that refer&mdash;we may take it that it does&mdash;to almonds, hollow-ware, floor-coverings, cotton thread, sports requisites, leather and springs?  I say that the Minister is denying this House information with regard to estimated revenue, contemplated revenue, and designed revenue, which the House is entitled to receive.  The Minister is <Col N="1250" /> patching up his Budget by the duties imposed on those items.  Will the Minister explain why discrimination is made between floor-coverings, on the one hand, where the tax is made an effective one, and hollow-ware on the other, where, according to the Minister for Finance, the tax is not made effective in respect of normal requirements? Those duties are being imposed, as far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, for the purpose of balancing his Budget by taking amounts which he is not prepared to tell the House he is taking; they are being imposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for goodness knows what reason.  If they were for the purpose of any serious industrial development here, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not have to tell us that he cannot give us any information as to the amount of additional employment which he hopes will be created in the country by the imposition of each one of these duties.  The whole attitude of the Ministry in regard to dealing with those matters in the House is an outrage on Parliamentary procedure, but I must say it pales into insignificance in the light of the discovery made here to-day as to the way in which an Emergency Imposition of Duty Order can be operated when it is an Excise duty.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to follow Deputy Mulcahy, because I think he so overstated his case that he has made his presentation of it ridiculous.  The latter part of his argument was that we were introducing those duties, not for the purpose of allowing a new industry to have a chance; but for the purpose of bolstering up the Exchequer.  Does Deputy Mulcahy seriously believe that the public credit is going to be saved by a duty on blanched almonds?  It seems to me that he did not intend himself to be taken seriously; otherwise he never would have addressed himself to the discussion of this matter in the way that he has done.</P>

      <P>At the same time I do think that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy have done a public service.  They have directed the attention of whomsoever may be concerned in the matter to the fact that this Government is not going to permit newly-established industries to be sabotaged for private gain.  Deputy Dillon, in referring to this question of the cotton trade, related a set of circumstances, and made the comment upon them which, I think, every other Deputy in the House would make&mdash; that, at first sight, the action of certain people in importing huge stocks of the commodity in question in those circumstances would appear to be an act of considered and designed sabotage. I do not think that anything which Deputy Dillon said in the course of the debate would remove that impression from the mind of any Deputy. Here was a case where, in pursuance of the Government policy to decentralise and to ruralise as much as possible Irish industrial development, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had determined that a certain new industry about to be established here would be sited in a certain town. Other people came along and suggested that a very highly urbanised district should be the site of that industry.  The Minister did not accede to their request and, according to Deputy Dillon's statement, those people&mdash;during the period when they were in negotiation with the Minister &mdash;proceeded to import large quantities of the commodity which was to be manufactured by the new undertaking about to be established.</P>

I do not know whether or not the <Col N="1252" /> Deputy takes very much interest in industrial development.  If he did, he might have read the speech of the chairman of a company which was recently being promoted to manufacture a certain article in this country. He pointed out that during the early portion of this company's history, after they had got into production, they were faced with very great difficulties indeed because of the fact that people&mdash;having realised that this industry was about to be established&mdash; had forestalled the initiation of the company's manufacture by importing huge stocks of the article which was about to be put on the market.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and others who, in this House, have bandied about charges in relation to the Government and its friends might consider who are associated with that undertaking.  In any event, the argument I want to drive home is that the chairman of this new industry, responsible for securing from the public a large investment, had stated that they had experienced very great difficulties indeed by reason of this practice of forestalling on the part of retailers and wholesalers of the article they were about to manufacture.  In the case of this cotton-thread industry, was the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other responsible member of the Government, with the lesson which he derived from that experience before him, to sit idly by and see the new factory at Westport sabotaged by the process which Deputy Dillon has detailed to this House?  I think, as I said before, the Deputies have rendered a public service, because they will bring home to everybody this fact, that if any person attempts to nullify the policy of industrial development which the Government is pursuing, by <Col N="1253" /> taking action of the sort to which Deputy Dillon referred in the House to-day, the Government has a weapon in its hand which will at any rate deprive those people of what I would believe to be the illegitimate profit which they seek to secure.  It is just as well that we should all understand that and, so far as I am concerned, and so far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, there would be nothing to apologise to the House or to the country for.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 11, before Section 22, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (ii) of Section 48 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the sum of £150 in lieu of the sum of £300 mentioned therein.&mdash;(Deputy Costello.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment before the House is, I know, one upon which there is a considerable difference of opinion.  I submit to the House, however, that this amendment to reduce the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £300 to £150 is a sound move and a move in the right direction. An action for anything over £150 in this country is a very serious and substantial action.  The old jurisdiction of the County Court was, as we know, £50.  An action for over £50 had in those days to be tried in the High Court.  Granting that there has been some change in money values from the time at which the County Court Acts were passed and that £50 does not now represent exactly the same thing as £50 did some years ago, still the increase from £50 to £300 is, I submit, altogether too large.  If you take £50 as it then was, the value roughly of about £75 now, and double the latter figure, you are giving a very substantial increase in County Court jurisdiction. My submission is that it is quite an inadequate increase.  Every action over £100, and certainly over £150, is in this country a very substantial action, an action that requires, and ought to get, very careful consideration. It is an action that ought to be fully argued out.  Such a thing is not being done in the Circuit Court and cannot really be properly done there. To begin with, in the Circuit Courts there is a very terrible rush.  It is <Col N="1256" /> impossible for a Circuit Court judge, when fixing his list, to know how much time is to be given for the hearing of cases in any particular circuit town. The result of that is that sometimes the Circuit Court judge has an abundance of time at his disposal.  At other times he is so rushed that he must either run into very heavy arrears of work or else he must give the cases before him a very short hearing indeed, not that adequate and full hearing out that very substantial actions deserve.</P>
      <P>I myself happened the week before last to go down to a Circuit Court to defend some prisoners there.  One of the cases took two days.  In another case there was, fortunately, a direction in the middle of it, and a third case was adjourned, but had that not taken place at those particular sittings, there could not have been any hearing at all of any civil business.  As it was, the bulk of the civil business had to be adjourned.  That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.  There were some civil actions for hearing.  One was a very substantial civil action to be tried by a jury.  It could not go on and had to be adjourned until next sessions. As a matter of fact, it was a case that had already been adjourned several times.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Circuit Courts at the present moment, certainly some of them, are not quite able to cope with the amount of business which they have got, and that cases involving big sums of money, cases that ought to be fully and adequately tried out, and if fully and adequately tried out in the High Court would take two or three days, are supposed to be disposed of and must be disposed of in a few hours in the Circuit Court if the business of the Circuit Court is to be conducted so that all cases can be heard.  To my mind, it is impossible to do that unless you increase the number of Circuit Court judges, and especially in view of the appeal system which this Bill brings in.  That appeal system is a reversion to the old appeal system which, as far as I am personally concerned, is, I think, sound.  I think that the appeal on notes was unsound, and, personally, I am very glad that it is to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> That is a matter on which I know that people have different views, but now you will have actions of £300 tried on appeal before going circuit judges of Assize.  I have had experience of going judges of Assize.  The Minister for Justice has had similar experience and the Attorney-General had experience, not at the Bar but as solicitor, of going judges of Assize. I put it to them to consider whether the rush and hurry of assizes and the necessity for getting through business in a very short time will make for the full and adequate hearing of actions of real substance such as actions between £150 and £300.  I do not think it will.  I know that it is argued that it is much cheaper to have cases heard in the Circuit Court than to have them heard in the High Court. I do not agree.  I do not think that there is a substantial difference in the costs in the two courts.  Circuit Court costs in big actions run to a very high amount.  In the Circuit Court, there will be in an action for £150 a first hearing.  The costs of that hearing, with witnesses' expenses, will be high.  You will then have, almost inevitably, a second hearing on appeal.  Witnesses' expenses are the important item in many Nisi Prius actions.  You will have not only heavy expenses for witnesses in the two trials but you will have a double set of costs.  The savings to litigants will be very trifling, indeed.  It would be far more satisfactory to persons who are litigating about very substantial sums to have their cases heard out in Dublin in an atmosphere in which there is no hurry or rush and in which the cases can be thrashed out to the very end.</P>
    <P>Another consideration applies to small actions as well as large actions. A case can be very much better done by the advocates if, in the first place, they are not tied to time and if, in the second place, they have behind them the full resources of the Law Library.  The Attorney-General knows perfectly well how extremely difficult it is to argue a law point when you have not got the resources of the Law Library behind you, when you have not got the Reports and all you can do is cite to judges sentences <Col N="1258" /> from text books, which may or may not be accurate.  Difficult points of law will arise in these cases and you cannot, I may say, argue law at all upon circuit.  You can assert before the judge such and such a proposition and read out your authority for the proposition, but a full and adequate argument is quite impossible on circuit. Therefore, Circuit Court justice must be a sort of rough and ready justice.  The hearing cannot be as complete or adequate and the decision cannot be as correct as it would be in a case heard in the courts in Dublin. For these reasons, amongst others, I submit that a jurisdiction of £150 is ample.  If I were trying to decide for myself what would be in the interests of litigants I should fix the maximum jurisdiction at £100.  Here you have a sum of £150 and surely that ought to be adequate.</P>
    <P>Though there may be a great deal of clamour amongst what I may call lay people, who have got the idea that the Circuit Court is a cheap court and that law ought to be extremely cheap, that clamour is, I think, ignorant clamour.  It comes from people who do not know the difficulties which judges have in doing justice between man and man.  That uninstructed lay opinion is opinion to which the Minister could easily give too much attention.  It may be more popular to give attention to it than to ignore it but I am not looking at the matter from the point of view of what is popular or unpopular.  I am looking at the matter from the point of view of what is calculated to make for the efficient administration of justice.  I think that it will be a very big improvement in the administration of justice if the present £300 limit is cut down to £150.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being considered an instructed amadán. I must say that I was very much surprised to see the amendment that is now submitted by the ex-Attorney-General and supported by the ex-Minister for Justice.  Let us for a moment look back and contemplate the jurisdiction of the old County Court.  The County Court had jurisdiction in equity cases up to £500 and nobody knows better than Deputy <Col N="1259" /> Fitzgerald-Kenney that equity cases frequently involved very difficult questions of law and of fact.  In malicious injury cases, now called criminal injury cases, the County Court had unlimited jurisdiction.  Everyone knows that the Workmen's Compensation Acts are most intricate and that more litigation was caused under them than any other Acts passed by the British Houses of Parliament.  There was no restriction as to the amount of compensation that might be granted.  The court had jurisdiction in lunacy matters up to £700, in contract cases up to £50, and in cases of tort with the exception of defamation, breach of promise and crim. con. cases up to £50.  Let me say that the old County Court judges, notwithstanding the fact that they had certain political prejudices, did their work very well.  After mature consideration the old County Courts were replaced by circuit judges under the new dispensation and those who planned and framed the Act of 1924 extended the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court judges.  In my honest opinion, and I have some little experience of it, the extended jurisdiction has been exercised well and wisely. The best proof of that is that there have been very few successful appeals against the decisions of the Circuit Court judges.  Under these circumstances, I see no reason whatsoever why there should be any modification of the jurisdiction which is now exercised by Circuit Court judges.  It is very easy to make provision to deal with extraordinary cases such as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to. I am sure that the case to which the Deputy referred was an exceptional one.  Therefore I appeal to the House and to the promoters of the Bill to reject the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stated, there are two views about this particular matter. The amendment has been discussed in the light of trying to arrive at what would be most suitable in the conditions obtainable.  While we might benefit from the experience of the past, we have to bear in mind what the position is as we find it now.  It is not correct for Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney <Col N="1260" /> to say that in resisting this amendment we are conceding something to popular opinion.  The Deputy knows that the Joint Committee which was set up by him when he was Minister for Justice heard evidence largely from legal men, and other people representing chambers of commerce interested in this matter, and in their Report the overwhelming body was for leaving the jurisdiction as it was.  Amongst the witnesses examined was the Chief Justice, who stated that when dealing with the 1924 Act he had considered that the jurisdiction might be £500. Numerous other witnesses were examined.  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I was struck by the reference to costs.  That is a big consideration in dealing with this matter.  Evidence on that was given by a gentleman who was quoted by Deputy McGilligan the last night the Bill was before the House in connection with another section. That gentleman was Mr. Henry Murphy, the County Registrar for Monaghan.  Having regard to his experience, his evidence would be a complete answer to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's question.  When he appeared before the Joint Committee Mr. Murphy gave the following evidence, on page 131 of the Committee's Report, question 1890:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Coming to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, what is your opinion as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court?  Should it be left as it is, or should it be altered in any way?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His answer was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am of opinion that it should be left as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chairman: Would you give us shortly what your reason for that is? &mdash;Before the Circuit Court was introduced, the peasant farmer or village shopkeeper whose entire property was not worth, say, £500, if he wanted to recover either damages or a debt of, say, £250, £299 or £300, was compelled&mdash;I speak from my own personal knowledge&mdash;to employ one solicitor and two senior counsel.  Of course, I will be met at once with the statement that one senior counsel would do.  I have no hesitation in saying that I never went to Dublin with the virtuous intention, when I <Col N="1261" /> was a solicitor, of doing a case on the cheap with one senior and one junior counsel, but that the senior whom I briefed, immediately after he got his brief, told me, &ldquo;Oh, I have three or four courts to attend to on the day fixed for this case.  I cannot give it sole personal attention and you must have another K.C.&rdquo; It was almost unheard of in a common law action, during the years I practised, to employ only one senior counsel.  It was the invariable practice to have two seniors even on cases as low as £100 or £150.  Judging from the newspapers, that is not the case over the water.  Over the water, I see quite big actions fought with juniors.  However, I do not want to introduce that practice into Ireland and never did.  But certainly employing two seniors is not so usual in England in the same class of cases as it is here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Yes, but their fees are on a different scale.  Your objection is on the ground of expense?&mdash;Yes.  The effect of that was that the man who lost a case had to pay two solicitors, four senior counsel and two junior barristers.  I think that was a monstrous system in cases of the value I speak of, where the amount in dispute was small.  I hope I shall not shock you, but I do not think it is fair odds that a man going for £250 should have to risk £250.</P>
    <P>The costs of a High Court action such as you describe on both sides would be £250?&mdash;On a conservative estimate.  In many cases they very much exceeded that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, in question 1896, he was asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Have you any other reason for objecting to the reduction of the jurisdiction?  Take a case from your own experience in your own district. Do you think that one of these larger cases is likely to be as well tried, I do not mean by the judge, but as well tried in the Circuit Court as it would be in Dublin?&mdash;Practically.  If you ask me absolutely, of course, I say no, because there is talent at one's command in Dublin that is not, perhaps, procurable elsewhere.  At least it would be so costly to bring <Col N="1262" /> it to the local venue that it would be out of the question.  But I say that the difference is, if I may put it so, only fractional.  If you have a competent judge and a competent advocate, though not a super-brilliant advocate, I believe that every material fact will be elucidated, and that justice will be done, even though some further facts might be brought out by some abler man....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I quoted that evidence was that Mr. Murphy was quoted here on the last night by Deputy McGilligan, and any of us who know of his experience certainly would not question his evidence.  The other aspect of expense that has to be borne in mind is that of bringing up witnesses. As everyone knows, it is certainly much cheaper, as far as the witnesses are concerned, to have the case tried locally instead of in Dublin. There is considerable expense incurred in bringing witnesses to Dublin.  In addition, under the new system of appeal proposed in the Bill, with which I notice Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney agrees, if any mistake occurs on the trial before the Circuit Court judge, litigants have a further chance of having the matter brought up before a judge of the High Court on an appeal for rehearing of the facts, when any matters that have been ignored or overlooked in the first trial can be remedied and dealt with by perhaps senior counsel who will be available for dealing with these appeals.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that, except in the Dublin Circuit Court, there are any considerable arrears at the moment or that there would be any improvement if these cases were tried in Dublin instead of in the Circuit Court.  In some of the areas, the judges may work more expeditiously than others, but at present, according to the returns we have got, there are very few arrears outside Dublin circuit.  The judges, as far as I know, are able to clear off the lists.  We have the instance of one judge who may be able to dispose of his cases, say, within sixty days in the year, spread over the four sittings.  In another area a judge might sit ninety days or so.  In my experience there was very little rushing in these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> They were not tied down in any way and were able to sit for a couple of extra days to clear off the arrears.  I am speaking from personal experience. I know that some of the judges did clear off the arrears and people were not obliged to wait to recover debts, or anything like that.  Since this amendment was debated on the last night, I had a letter from the Limerick solicitors and they say it is the unanimous opinion of the Limerick Bar of solicitors&mdash;not only that, but that when it was previously discussed it was the desire of all the Bar Associations in the South of Ireland&mdash;that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be left as it was.  That is based on their experience as to the costs and expense incurred in having actions tried in the manner suggested here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister comes to consider this matter he will find that Mr. Murphy first dealt with the old actions in the County Court.  He could not, of necessity, deal with the present system or what happened in the High Court in actions between £150 and £300.  To say that in the old days every record of the High Court over £50 had two seniors in it, and was never fought with one junior, certainly goes against my recollection, and I am perfectly certain it is against the recollection of the Minister and of the Attorney-General.  I have been in High Court actions led by only one senior.  The Minister and the Attorney - General have frequently fought High Court actions in which they briefed only one senior.  They have fought High Court actions with a junior, without any senior, and if I might say so, I am personally aware of the fact.  That does not get away from the matter which seems to me to be important.  An action is going to be <Col N="1264" /> tried in the Circuit Court.  It is a heavy action and demands the bringing down of senior counsel specially.  The fee of senior counsel going down to Cork or to Kerry specially is going to be very much higher than the fee he is going to receive on his brief in Dublin and is very much higher.  Yet, if there are big actions between £150 and £300, in most instances senior counsel will be brought down specially, and brought down upon a special fee.  When it comes to a question of appeal, if it is a case of weight, you will again have one or two senior counsel.  Very often if it is a case between £150 and £300&mdash; in fact I hope it will be the general instance&mdash;there will be two senior counsel on appeal.  On the argument of economy, the Minister has left out of consideration the fact that Mr. Murphy was only dealing with one set of witnesses.  The expense of bringing the same set of witnesses twice is not a matter that was dealt with at all.  I submit to the House that the Minister has not made a case against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Would this have any effect on this amendment?  I refer the Deputy back to No. 16, an amendment of Deputy Costello.  That was on the Hosie and Lawless case in regard to remittal.  I have been considering that matter with the Attorney-General since.  I am trying to see if I can meet Deputy Costello with regard to it.  I am not quite definitely accepting it, but that is the inclination at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would make a very big difference.  May I point out, first of all, that in these statistical returns Deputy Costello stressed it had been revealed, as shown by an appendix presented in the Reports of the Courts of Justice Committee, that by far the greatest number of cases fought in the Circuit Court, even under the extended jurisdiction of £300, were in the class of £50 and over, £100 and over, and up to £150.  That is where the amount of claim was the test, but where the amount awarded was the test, the discrepancy is still larger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> There is an appendix in the Courts of Justice Committee Report which shows the position up to a point.  I got that further extended by a question dividing these several cases, according to the amount claimed in the period from the Michaelmas sittings, 1932, to the Trinity sittings, 1933, and the results are again somewhat amazing.  Out of a list of 6,000 cases in that period, there are very nearly 5,000 cases where the amount claimed was up to £100.  There are 5,200 cases where the amount claimed was up to £150.  Where you get the figures for the actual awards the discrepancy is still more striking. As I read the report, quite a number of witnesses who went to give evidence before the Committee were of the opinion that the new Circuit Court system had failed.  I think an overwhelming number of the witnesses had come to that conclusion.  The reason for objecting to the Circuit Court system was the ground of expense, and, secondly, the ground of delay.  I think the delay has been met in a certain way, but the expenses certainly under this report are not going to be mitigated.  I think the biggest percentage of those who gave evidence before the Committee, and who claimed that the Circuit Court system had failed, were of opinion that if there was what was called concurrent jurisdiction the whole difficulty could be met.  In other words, the remedy was, keep, if you like, the Circuit Court jurisdiction by consent up to anything, have a pointer as to what you want to go to the Circuit Court by saying £300, and allow concurrent jurisdiction all the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister is meeting that to this extent: he is going to leave it to the High Court to say if the matter is reasonable and proper to be retained in the High Court.  The evidence given before the Joint Committee went a point further.  The evidence of the big majority of witnesses was really this: fix your Circuit Court jurisdiction at any point, but give concurrent jurisdiction in the High Court at the option of either party.  The Minister is not doing that.  He is leaving the £300 jurisdiction and making a person move to have the action either brought in the High Court or kept in the High <Col N="1266" /> Court and leaving it to the judges of the High Court to determine whether it is reasonable and proper that it should be heard there.  The witnesses wanted to have a situation that you could go at the option of either party to the High Court.  They did not specify just what amount for which they wanted compulsory Circuit Court jurisdiction.  There was a sort of mixed view as to that.  Undoubtedly there was a big bulk of opinion that the best way to solve this was to leave concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court, then let it be up to litigants to go by consent to the Circuit Court for anything.</P>
    <P>We must fix some point, if we are going to have Circuit Court jurisdiction at all.  I suggest to the Minister that he might consider having concurrent jurisdiction, that is to say, either party can choose or object to go to the High Court as long as the case is over £150, and between the old civil bill jurisdiction and the £150 mark, which we will put as the new pointer to Circuit Court jurisdiction, then allow the High Court to determine whether it was a matter reasonable and proper to be tried in the High Court or in the Circuit Court.  If you like, get back to the old point of over £50, or revalue it at the present standard of money and say £100, and have £100 more or less compulsory in the Circuit Court.  Under that system the Circuit Court jurisdiction would be £100.  Even inside that £100, one might move in the High Court to have an action heard there, and achieve a hearing of the action in the High Court, on good cause shown to the satisfaction of that court and for anything beyond the £100, or the £150 mark, let it go either to the Circuit Court, or to the High Court on either party desiring to go to the High Court, and then block any attempt to go to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that might be considered as a way out of the difficulty. This is the amendment which gives us the best ground for discussing the whole matter.  While there was through the report a feeling of this new system not having succeeded, there was a vehement expression of opinion that the best way to amend <Col N="1267" /> the whole matter was to have concurrent jurisdiction.  There must be some point established, and I suggest £150 or £100.  I think the figures show that, in fact, the Circuit Court, in the main, has only been used for cases up to £100.  When you have, in the period I speak of, nearly 5,000 cases out of 5,960 tried claiming only £100, it surely shows that the Circuit Court has not been availed of to any great extent by claimants for amounts above that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the number of occasions on which this has been considered, the evidence which we have had before the Joint Committee, and the discussions here, I do not think it is possible for anyone to devise a system that will eliminate hardship on some individuals, no matter what way you provide for limiting the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said.  In fact the arguments which he advanced here this evening were more or less the arguments which I advanced when giving evidence before the Joint Committee.  At the same time I feel with the Minister that, whether you are to call it lay opinion and uninstructed opinion or not, there is no doubt that there is quite a body of opinion in favour of retaining the present limit of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.  I find myself in agreement with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that in the long run, perhaps, it is not best for the litigants, even though they may imagine so themselves, and that cheap litigation is often very dear in the end.  The suggestion which the Minister has thrown out I think goes as far as one can possibly go to meet the point raised and to devise a system which can be tried out which will be elastic, which can be adjusted to meet the circumstances as they are found to exist, when the system has been working for some time.  The Minister's suggestion is that the law as regards the remittal of actions to the Circuit Courts should be amended so as to go some way, if not the whole way, to meet the suggestion contained in Deputy <Col N="1268" /> Costello's amendment on the remittal section.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan wants to go further and wants to have a system of compulsory Circuit Court jurisdiction; that is practically, I suppose, to leave the thing as it stands at the moment with regard to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in claims up to £100 and above £150 to allow either party the option of choosing the High Court in preference to the Circuit Court.  When he says either party, I presume, he means the plaintiff&mdash;that the plaintiff shall have it open to him to bring his action in whichever court he chooses.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is acceptable at all, because the position might be that a wealthy plaintiff, who is able to afford a High Court action, would launch an action for a figure such as £150 or over against a man who could reasonably afford to fight an action in the Circuit Court and would be very frightened at having to fight it in the High Court.  I think the Minister's suggestion is a much more practical and a much fairer one, that if a plaintiff brings an action in the High Court for an amount within the Circuit Court jurisdiction, a defendant can ask the High Court to remit the action to the Circuit Court, and if, in whatever circumstances the section will allow, the High Court consider it ought to be retained in the High Court, they will retain it; and if they think it is a case with no particular difficulty either of law or fact, it will be remitted to the Circuit Court.  One must realise that measurement by amounts is not a wholly satisfactory standard for deciding in what court a case will get the best trial.  Very often you have cases which involve large amounts where the issues are comparatively simple and could quite as readily be tried in the Circuit Court as in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill allowing unlimited Circuit Court jurisdiction in respect of any claim where the parties agree to have it tried there. The justification for the section is that both parties may be quite satisfied that the Circuit Court judge, either with or <Col N="1269" /> without a jury, provides a satisfactory and adequate tribunal to try an issue between them, even though the amount may be above the Circuit Court jurisdiction. So that I think it is much more reasonable to devise a system whereby the High Court shall be entitled to say whether, in their opinion, an action should be tried in the High Court or should go to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It will take some time to discover what the difficulties are in working this system, and I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that some of the difficulties which he pointed out will very likely be discovered in the course of the working of the system.  It will be found that certain cases will take up the two days of a High Court circuit judge's time and that the effect of that will be to shut out certain cases and the forcing of cases from High Court circuit to High Court circuit with consequent inconvenience; but experience by the High Court judges, in going around the circuits, will inevitably provide them with some standard or measure for deciding as to what cases are likely to engage the attention of the court over a long period and which can be judged important enough to be held in the High Court when remittal motions come before them. Although difficulties may be experienced in the early years, I imagine that the experience of the High Court judges in going out on the High Court circuits will enable them to devise ways and means by which it will be possible to apportion the business between the High Court and the High Court circuit in such a way as will segregate cases of importance, both of law and of fact, which ought to be tried in the High Court, from those which can be reasonably left to be dealt with in the Circuit Courts.  It will be understood, however, that under any system difficulties will crop up, and we can only devise the most smoothly working system we can find.</P>
    <P>On the point which Deputy McGilligan makes about the small number of cases in the Circuit Court which are above the £150 limit, the argument on that, of course, can be said to cut two ways.  I suppose the Deputy means to convey that the Circuit Court cases <Col N="1270" /> are so little above the limit and are of such a nature that no widespread hardship will be suffered by taking such cases from the Circuit Court.  I have had some figures&mdash;probably they are the same figures Deputy McGilligan has had&mdash;and, in conjunction with other figures, I worked out that the average cases over a number of years, in which decrees were made above £150 and under £300, is about 60 a year for the whole Circuit Court area.</P>

      <P>I have not examined the list to see how they are distributed, but probably one would find, if one analysed the list further, that the bulk of such cases were in, Cork and Dublin.  Cork Circuit Court, undoubtedly, strongly favours the increased jurisdiction, and I think that Cork solicitors, as a whole, are happy in having to have their cases tried in the Cork Circuit Court, and agree frequently, in cases of much larger amounts than £300, to have them dealt with in the Circuit Court there.  I imagine that the bulk of the cases over £300 would be found to be between Cork and Dublin.  Again, however, we cannot take the numbers there as a proper test of the value to litigants of being able to go into the Circuit Court in those cases, because most of those cases which are over the £150 limit are cases which take up time in the Circuit Court.  They are important cases and take up much more time than their numbers would show.  I should say that, if one were to work out a time analysis, it would be found, probably, that more time was taken on the cases between £150 and £300 than on the whole of those under that figure.  With regard to that large figure referred to by Deputy McGilligan, I think, the <Col N="1271" /> year 1932-33, of 5,000 cases, roughly, under £100, and 1,000 cases, roughly, above £100, I should imagine that more time was spent on those 1,000 cases than was spent on the cases below the £100 limit, and there is no doubt at all, if one looks through the evidence given before the Joint Committee, that, with remarkable unanimity&mdash;perhaps not unanimity, but at any rate by a very large majority&mdash; the witnesses who gave evidence were in favour of retaining the Circuit Court jurisdiction at its present limit, and the finding of the Committee was definite on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, developing along the lines of what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, I know that the feelings of a good many members at the Bar are in favour of the reduction of the jurisdiction.  I do not think their desire in that regard is to be brushed aside merely on the suggestion that it is a question of personal interest.  I do not think it is a question of personal interest in Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's case.  He is a man who has had, in my own personal knowledge, considerable experience of the working of the old County Courts. Few men in Ireland can have had more experience than he has had of the working of the County Courts and of the Assize Courts.  I briefed him myself when I was a solicitor, and I think his opinion is entitled to the highest respect.  I believe what he has stated here has no element of self-interest in it at all and that he really believes that the system would work better if the limit of jurisdiction under the Circuit Court were reduced to £150.  He did not, I think, appreciate the effect upon his arguments of what the Minister said.  I was one of those before the Committee who suggested this idea of concurrent jurisdiction. I do think, allowing for objections made against this jurisdiction of £300, it allows at least any person, who wishes to choose the Circuit Court, to choose it.  If the ordinary man in the street prefers the Circuit Court he is entitled to choose that venue for his action.  On the other hand, he will not be compelled to go to the High Court if he can show that his case can <Col N="1272" /> adequately be tried in the Circuit Court.  I do not know that there can be very much force in the objection to leaving the jurisdiction as it is in view of what the Minister says he is prepared to do in connection with the remittal motion.</P>

      <P>I should like the Attorney-General to get it out of his head that there was anything like unanimity in keeping the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I went through this evidence in considerable detail.  I do not propose to weary people with copious extracts from that evidence.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

      <P>Which included Mr. Murphy of Clones who was against it, if you keep the present system of appeals.  Then there were certain others who said, &ldquo;Keep it as it is, but we want certain things provided.&rdquo; Then we had the commercial community speaking through the chambers of commerce.  One witness said he did not get sufficient speed by the appeals and then he added, &ldquo;But mind you, we want no extra expense involved.&rdquo;  The commercial man wants speed in the hearing of cases but he jibs at any extra charges and you are faced with the demand from them to get the new system but let it be a speedier system which will involve the payment for more duties but it is not to cost any more.  These people are not to be counted in favour of the present system.  In the whole Cork area there were two solicitors and the Registrar of the courts in Cork; I think some other people spoke for the Cork area certainly.  There were five of them altogether.  Cork has a view that the present jurisdiction must be maintained.  They were very definitely of that opinion.  Senator Lynch said he thought the jurisdiction should be reduced to, I think, £50.  The next witness was a member of the Senior Bar and he wanted the jurisdiction reduced.  You then had two solicitors representing the Incorporated Law <Col N="1273" /> Society and one of them more particularly than the other was in favour of a considerable reduction, down to £100.  He was followed by a member of the Senior Bar who was distinctly in favour of a reduction.  Then there was a solicitor from Limerick in favour of the present system and so on down through all the witnesses.  If you segregate properly all these witnesses the phrase about unanimity disappears. Mr. Murphy of Clones, listed as being in favour of a change in the system, had this idea, &ldquo;If there is one hearing only, let it be £300 in the Circuit Court and finish with it.  Have no appeal on the question of fact.&rdquo;  With a single hearing he said the present system would work out well and appeals must be done away with or if there are appeals, let them not be on questions of fact; leave it, as is the English system, to cases stated or to appeals on point of law.  The earlier witnesses &mdash; half-a-dozen witnesses &mdash; were almost unanimous in the view that the jurisdiction ought to be reduced, but when pressed on it we can see what their answers were.  When asked if they were in favour of the present jurisdiction of the District Court the matter was passed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question was, &ldquo;Are you in favour of the present system of Circuit Court appeals?&rdquo;  The third question in the series was, &ldquo;Are you a believer in the idea of concurrent jurisdiction?&rdquo;  The evidence would have to be analysed to get a real view of it.  Those who had objection to the present system thought that everything would be solved by having concurrent jurisdiction in the High Court. There are certain witnesses whose evidence I do not discredit.  One was a Circuit Court judge.  I do not dismiss from my mind the fact that he is a Circuit Court judge.  But taking the independent witnesses I think there was a big confusion of opinion and there was a criss-cross division.  There were men who objected to the present system altogether and wanted the old system brought back.  There were men who objected to the present system on the ground of appeals and there were other witnesses who objected to it on the ground of expense.  As it was, the biggest bulk of opinion was in favour of a reduction from the limit <Col N="1274" /> of £300 to a £200 limit; some of them were down as low as £50.  Those objecting on these grounds added on this as their second line of argument: &ldquo;If you keep the present system as high as £300, then you are to have concurrent jurisdiction in the High Court.&rdquo;  That ran through their argument. I would refer particularly to the evidence of Mr. Murphy of Clones. Question 1891 was the special reference given.  The statement there is definitely taken out of the main trend of Mr. Murphy's argument.  He was in favour really of what is a new system entirely&mdash;that is a Circuit Court with a jurisdiction of £300, the judges hearing these cases to be free from appeals on the question of fact. He would allow an appeal only on a question of law except in rare instances where the litigant can go and make a case for a new trial motion and get that agreed to by some branch of the High Court.  But there was no unanimity about their evidence in this matter of the present system.  Then the bulk of the people who were in favour of keeping the £300 jurisdiction had some reservation with regard to it, the reservation being, &ldquo;Give us concurrent jurisdiction in the High Court or keep the present system as it is and do away altogether with appeals to the High Court.&rdquo;  If a glance is taken at the figures a pretty good distinction will be found to be apparently made by the litigants themselves.  Some claim that the jurisdiction should be £50.  Others are between £50 and £100; then some others between £100 and £150.</P>
    <P>A good bulk of the cases were in the lower category, and then there are a number between £150 and £200.  They are small, but there are a good many claiming £300.  That £300 is a false figure.  When a litigant claims something less than the maximum he really is basing his claim on some constant figures with regard to damage or loss. But when the claim is put in at £300 it is the same as saying: &ldquo;We make this a Circuit Court case, but we do not know what we will get.&rdquo;  The special evidence with regard to the £300 case went to show that between the Michaelmas sittings and the Trinity <Col N="1275" /> sittings there were five cases in the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it was over £200 and up to and over £300, there were 67 cases in the whole country and in the next year there were 60 cases. Where claims were made for over £250 and up to £300, in Dublin City and County in the two years there were 233 cases.  There were 217 cases in Dublin alone where the claim was over £300. There were only 67 cases in the whole country in which awards were made within those limits.  It is known in practice that the £300 claim is a claim made without any real appreciation of the amount likely to be awarded.  It is not a serious claim; it is not so serious as when the amount is set out in any of the lower groups.  These figures will stand a great deal of cross-examination. There were 4,913 cases between the Michaelmas sittings of 1933 and the Trinity sittings of 1934. The total of all cases is 5,960.  There were only 700 cases in which the amount claimed was over the £150 mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The awards give another picture, and it might be suggested that they favour the keeping of the Circuit Court jurisdiction where it is.  That argument may be used either way.  It may indicate that there is no necessity to lower the Circuit Court jurisdiction, because it is not being used very much above the £150 scale.  I suggest it is a clear indication, when the whole Report is supposed to be based on what litigants desire, that we would be moving in accordance with what litigants desire if we reduced this jurisdiction to £150. It would be useful if we could get forward notice of what the Minister proposes on this question of reduction or non-reduction of the Circuit Court jurisdiction and the circumstances in which one would be able to have these cases under the £300 mark and up to <Col N="1276" /> some point taken in the High Court, with the High Court always to be the judge in the end, whether it is fit and proper to take the case there and whether it is reasonable to be tried there.  I will ask the Minister to go further, to go along the lines suggested by Deputy Costello, associating a different scale of costs, if necessary, for High Court trials of cases between £150 and £300.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

      <P>That, of course, will do away with some of the objections with regard to the expense entailed in going to the High Court in connection with cases between £150 and £300. There were other objections on the ground of bringing witnesses to Dublin. We are going in for a new system in which the witness will be brought from the locality to a central point in that locality.  Other questions are very definitely interlocked.  I suggest that this matter of concurrent jurisdiction should be better examined, and if the evidence is analysed it will be found there was a big volume of opinion in favour of that.  The Bar Council has recommended a reduction in the jurisdiction. The Circuit Court judges' evidence is not to be regarded as entirely independent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to press for this amendment.  I do not agree with the suggestion of the Minister to reconsider the proposal with reference to enabling certain classes of cases to be retained in the High Court, if a case could be made out for such retention on the ground of the importance of the points of law involved, or the difficulty of getting a fair hearing in the local venue.  I do not think that <Col N="1277" /> suggestion will meet the case made on behalf of the present amendment. They are linked to a certain extent, but I think they are two distinct amendments to meet entirely different cases.  It has to be stressed in considering this amendment to reduce the jurisdiction that we are not going back to the old system of appeals.  We are doing something more.  We are giving a new hearing to a case of considerable importance in classes of cases where such a rehearing was never given before.  The old rehearing at Assizes was confined to actions under £50. Over that amount they were heard in the High Court and they could only go by way of new trial motion to the then Divisional Court, the Court of Appeal, and perhaps to the House of Lords; but there was no rehearing. What this amendment proposes to do is to equate the old £50 jurisdiction and bring it up to date, to equate it with the suggested jurisdiction of £150. I think it is making adequate allowance for the cases to be heard in the local venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to expenses, I think it will be found that it works out more expensively in the Circuit Court to try a big action involving £300 than it would to try it in the High Court.  A graduated scale of costs might be fixed in reference to cases between £150 and £300. Practically the whole of the expense involved in an action is in reference to the cost of the attendance of witnesses. Speaking generally, the costs of solicitors and counsel in big actions of this kind in the Circuit Court and the High Court are more or less the same in practice.  If you look at what actually happens on the hearing of a case involving £300 in the Circuit Court, it is almost impossible to get a special day fixed by the Circuit Court for the hearing of that case and the result, in practice, is that witnesses have to come in for several days in succession from their homes to the local Circuit Court town and that may be as inconvenient to get at as it would be for the witnesses to get to Dublin. They have to come in at almost as much expense and as much expense is incurred by going to the Circuit Court town as in coming to Dublin.  Normally speaking, people who get a case <Col N="1278" /> fixed for Dublin will know the date on which it is to come off.  That is possible in practice.  Even in connection with jury cases, which are the most difficult of all in that connection, it is possible to get an approximate idea&mdash; and so save expenses&mdash;as to when the actual case will be heard and determined. It is not possible to get that in the Circuit Court.  There is the further difficulty, in connection with the Circuit Courts, that two or three days' expenses will be incurred in connection with the assize hearing. Deputies may take it as a certainty that the amount of time that must be spent on the rehearing of cases that come before the assize judge, under the new Bill, will be vastly in excess of what they were under the old system.</P>
    <P>No judge or county registrar can anticipate how many cases can be got through by the assize judge on particular days.  If there are two judges hearing, concurrently, in an assize town, that will only add to the difficulty and cause more confusion.  As I said in moving this amendment, there was always the case that perhaps the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was fixed too high.  If it is proposed to give a rehearing in these big actions&mdash; because, as I said, an action involving £200 or £300 is a big action&mdash;the case for this amendment is unanswerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing I doubt is that in practice there is an enormous amount of difficulty in fixing the dates for hearings in the Circuit Court.  I have not very wide experience of the Circuit Courts, but I have knowledge of them in two or three counties.  In the West, in Circuit Judge Power's Court, a working arrangement was arrived at which enabled one, with almost certainty, to know when the case would come on. I think it would be found possible to set out a list which would be almost acted up to, and to provide that a case came on exactly as scheduled by the judge.  In Dublin there may be some difficulty though I think the Deputy said the difficulty was in places &ldquo;other than Dublin.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know certain difficulties do arise in Dublin.  The Deputy's point, I think, was that sometimes it costs people more to go to Circuit Courts than it would cost to bring them to Dublin.  That, I think, is a slight exaggeration.  Everyone with experience of the High Courts knows that very often when people come to Dublin for a High Court action in the middle of the week, it does not come off, and they may have to go back to the country and come back again in the following week.  That does not often happen.  I know it is possible to fix a case here in Dublin with sufficient certainty to know when it will come off; but in most cases witnesses are kept one or two or three days waiting in Dublin for a case to come off; and having country witnesses spending their time in Dublin, is much more expensive than travelling backward and forward to the Circuit Court town on successive days.  I do not think, in the county I have had experience of, that there is any difficulty in fixing the Circuit Court lists.  As regards expenses, it may be that there are cases in the Circuit Court in which there are issues with more money involved and in which litigants provide themselves with the luxury of senior counsel.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that there were cases in which two senior counsel were engaged.  But I would hazard a guess, if you were to take a case here in Dublin, and compare it with a case in the Circuit Court, then as regards time spent, and take everything else into account, the cost would be much more considerable in Dublin.  Witnesses' expenses cannot be anything like the same amount for rehearing of cases in Mayo, Cork or Kerry or in any of the counties over 50 or 100 miles from Dublin that they would be if witnesses had to travel to Dublin.  I do not think that the fees to counsel are on the average anything like as high in Circuit Court cases.  I am afraid there is not a great deal of force in the argument that costs in cases of over £150 are as high in the Circuit Court as in the High Courts. It will require a great deal to convince me of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is force in a good deal of the argument advanced, but I suggest to <Col N="1280" /> Deputy Costello that the Minister's concession goes a long way to meeting the point raised.  It would enable the High Court to get rid of cases that ought to be tried in the Circuit Courts, and would leave in the Circuit Court cases involving amounts in excess of £150 and up to £300 where, as Deputy Costello will admit, very often the issues to be tried are more easily solved than those involving a £5 note.  I think after the system is working a few years the Assize Court system will be welcomed by solicitors and litigants as the tribunal in which to try appeals and keep down costs and not to add to costs.  In only 60 cases in the whole country were decrees given for over £300.  The bulk of these were running-down cases where the only issue was one of negligence.  The Circuit Court judge is quite well able to try that issue.  If not the assistance of a jury could be had.  There is objection to try jury actions in the Circuit Court to which Deputy Costello referred already; but I think it will be found if the Minister's amendment is accepted it will be possible to select the odd case in which there are questions of fact and of law involved of sufficient complexity to induce a High Court judge to say that it would help the proper administration of justice that that case should be tried in Dublin rather than in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The inducement to go into the Circuit Court and not to select Dublin as a venue is further strengthened by the scale of costs which is put into a section in the Bill.  Suppose a litigant thinks that he would prefer a Dublin venue for his action and starts his action in the High Court, successfully resisting a motion to remit; notwithstanding that, if&mdash;when the case is being determined&mdash;he recovers a sum which is within the various limits fixed under the section, the High Court judge will allow him only the costs on the Circuit Court scale.  The defendant who has been brought to Dublin, either unwillingly or willingly, will have the consolation that he will not be called on to pay anything more than Circuit Court costs where the amount awarded exceeds a certain sum, unless the judge certifies that it was a fit and proper <Col N="1281" /> action to be tried in the High Court. In all, looking at the matter from every point of view, I do not think that any great injustice will be suffered by anybody in leaving the jurisdiction as it stands, and that, on the balance, it is fairer to the people generally that they should be allowed the freedom of access to the Circuit Court which the present limit of jurisdiction allows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I always like to face facts, and it is quite obvious that the Minister is not going to accept this amendment or to meet it except in the direction indicated.  Consequently, I should like to get as far as I can in the direction in which he has intimated that he is prepared favourably to consider the matter.  I should like that, when he is considering the previous amendment about the jurisdiction of the High Court retaining for hearing actions which are within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, he would not adopt the wording of the amendment I proposed, because it is not anything like as wide as I should like, nor do I think it would, in the form I proposed originally, go as far as the Minister appears to be prepared to go in connection with allowing the High Court to retain actions that they think ought to be heard in the High Court.  What I really want to avoid is another decision on the policy of the Act.  I want to make it clear, on the face of the section which the Minister puts in, what is intended, and that the construction of the Act will be given by the judges not on the wording of the Act, but upon some sort of policy about all cases going to the Circuit Court and all that sort of thing.  If the Minister is prepared to consider the amendment on those lines, I would be prepared&mdash;for want of better, I admit&mdash;to accept that. In the same connection I should also like him to consider an amendment of mine which will be ruled out of order when we come to it because it is a direct negative of a section.  It is amendment No. 37.  Perhaps, with your permission, Sir, I might refer to it, as it is related to the subject matter which we are discussing now. It is an amendment to Section 23, which says that when an action is <Col N="1282" /> remitted from the High Court to the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction to go over the £300. We felt that that was a direct invitation to the High Court to remit every class of action which they could possibly remit, because they would say, &ldquo;No great injustice will be done by this.  If a man is awarded £15,000 the Circuit Court can give it to him.&rdquo; It would open the door wide, and offer facilities for transferring actions which ought to be retained in the High Court.  As that section is related to the previous matter I would ask the Minister to reconsider that section also in the light of the facts which have been put before him.</P>

      <P>May I have this last word?  Two representatives from the Junior Bar visited this Committee. The Attorney-General was one of them.  His colleague gave evidence before it, and he was asked the definite question, &ldquo;With regard to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, are you of opinion that the present jurisdiction should be diminished?&rdquo;  He replied, &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;  In reply to the question, &ldquo;To what amount would you suggest?&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I suggest that £100 would be quite sufficient in ordinary common law cases&mdash;contract and tort.&rdquo;  He was asked to explain that, and he did so at great length.  Later on in the course of that explanation he says, &ldquo;I do not think that cases involving serious questions of law and fact and involving large sums of money can be satisfactorily tried in the Circuit Courts.&rdquo;  He stone-walled very definitely on every question put to him to try and get him to change that opinion.  He was asked did he not think that a better provision of rules would meet the matter, and he replied: &ldquo;My own opinion is that this system is a bad system, that the jurisdiction is too high, and that no rule-making will make it better.&rdquo;  That is at question 5028.  He was asked finally about the stenographers' notes, and he said that stenographers ought to be available to take the evidence, and then possibly that the judges, having that before them, would be in a position to break down any attempt at perjury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> The present Attorney-General said he would not go over the same ground, he so thoroughly agreed with his colleague. I take it then he was in favour of diminution of the jurisdiction.  At any rate he agreed with his colleague, and would not go into it.  I quote this phrase of his: &ldquo;Although people say it is more convenient to try cases in local centres, and that consideration of expenses, and so on, should induce the Legislature to spread the courts all over the country, I think the people who urged that view do not realise how much they are injuring the administration of justice by doing that.&rdquo;  He further said: &ldquo;It follows from what I have said that the jurisdiction of the local court should not be extended except under absolute economic pressure.&rdquo;  And he went on to say that it was easy to exaggerate the value of cheap law.  If the Minister for Justice cannot find any arguments here, will he, at any rate, go to those extracts from the Report?  There were very wide arguments put up in those days in favour of reducing the jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we had the view that the present court system had not been properly tried out.  I for one had that view, and was responsible to the extent of one person's voice in the Executive Council for preventing any Bill being brought forward to amend the system.  On this matter I speak entirely apart from the profession to which I belong at the moment.  I do not know what their views are.  As far as the junior members are concerned, they would probably be in favour of keeping the £300 and having a new system of appeal.  I do not pretend to represent them in any way.  I speak simply with the layman's view on this matter.  The Chief Justice was very strong in his evidence, and it is evidence which must have impressed itself on the mind of anybody who read it.  Then there was the evidence of the President of the High Court, and that of Mr. Henry Murphy added to that.  It was not a question of keeping the old system of appeals which we are now getting <Col N="1284" /> away from, but even going further and abolishing those appeals, and only having appeals in matters of law.  The Chief Justice wanted the jurisdiction increased, I think, to £500, but he did that again, like Mr. Murphy, of Clones, in the atmosphere of keeping the present system.  I accepted that point of view.  It may have been right or wrong, but that was what moved me in holding out against any Bill to implement this Report on the matter of appeals.  To return to the Attorney-General, he had another point of view which I would like to recommend to the Minister.  He thought the stenographers' notes should be kept&mdash;that at any rate they should be available to the judge.  It was pointed out that that meant having a stenographer in court, and he agreed.  His final view was that in regard to the cost of the transcript in every case the State should be prepared to bear it.  That should be set against the present idea of having court fees increased.  The Attorney-General then thought that the State should bear more, and it was a good view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already intimated to the Minister the view we wish to put forward on Section 23.  The section proposes to give a Circuit Court judge full jurisdiction, where a case is remitted, to give damages in excess of £300.  That, in our view, opens the door wide to the transfer of actions on a pretty generous scale, to put it no higher, from the High Court to the Circuit Court, because a High Court judge, hearing a motion to remit an action to the Circuit Court, will say: &ldquo;Even if I do remit it, no great injustice will be done, because the man can get damages up to the sky.&rdquo; There is a complete addition to the jurisdiction of the circuit judge under this section.  Instead of a jurisdiction <Col N="1285" /> limited to £300, he has now a jurisdiction without limit in a remitted action, and all a person has to do is to bring an action which is obviously unmaintainable in the High Court, have it remitted to the Circuit Court, and get considerably in excess of £300 from a sympathetic country jury.  That will be one of the methods of enabling sympathetic country juries, in cases in which they know the parties, to give very excessive damages.</P>
      <P>Of course, I recognise that there may be an appeal from that to a judge who will be sitting without a jury, and there is therefore some check, but at the same time I do not see any particular necessity for this section at all. In fact, we wish to achieve the position that the circuit judge should have no jurisdiction to entertain any application, or to grant himself, nor should any jury be entitled to give, damages in excess of £300 on a remitted action. I do not see why a remitted action should be in any different category from an action properly started, and started in the first instance in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that considerable difficulty would arise if there were not some such provision as that.  Suppose we start off on the basis of a jurisdiction of £300, subject to what is stated with regard to amendment No. 16 which the Deputy has introduced.  Such a provision with a more limited jurisdiction obtained under the County Courts Act of 1887. Under Section 52 of that Act, where an action was remitted to the County Court, it had jurisdiction to give damages in excess of the ordinary jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as it was then, but since that was the jurisdiction at that time and we consider £300 a reasonable jurisdiction as proposed in the Bill, it is right and proper that this provision should be inserted. When an application is made to have an action remitted to the Circuit Court, affidavits have to be lodged and so on.  The judge hearing that application has not the opportunity&mdash; he certainly has not the fullest opportunity&mdash;of enquiring into and seeing <Col N="1286" /> all sides of the case with a view to ascertaining whether or not it would come within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and I can see that in many cases hardships might arise from that.  If a case were remitted&mdash;supposing it were a running-down case&mdash; it might be found that the injuries became more serious or there might be evidence produced before the Circuit Court to show that the case was much more serious than was brought to the notice of the judge who tried the action for remittal.  The point I emphasise is that since the jurisdiction is proposed in this Bill to be maintained at £300, it follows as a corollary to that that what obtained under Section 52 of the 1887 Act, when the jurisdiction was £50, should apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot give it, the return I quoted from would appear to give the answer because, from the Michaelmas sitting, 1932, to Trinity sittings, 1933, in the Circuit Court, there were only five cases in the whole country in which awards of over £300 were given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but there were only five, and there were only six in the next period&mdash;in what amounts in all to a year.  The Minister has quoted the Chief Justice to us.  He was entirely in favour of keeping the present system.  He wanted the present system kept and the jurisdiction raised to £500.  Naturally, that mind brought to bear on the Courts of Justice Bill would be in favour of it because the whole tendency of the <Col N="1287" /> Chief Justice was towards further decentralisation and, therefore, he would be in favour of not having this bar, that a man could only recover damages up to whatever was the limit. The Minister used another bad analogy when he quoted the £50 jurisdiction of the old County Court.  That was so remarkably small that undoubtedly there was unmistakable reason for allowing damages to be given somewhat in excess of that.</P>
      <P>There are two contrary opinions in conflict here.  We are unfortunately loosening up whatever moorings there were tying us to certain fixed things, and the whole tendency of this Bill&mdash; not merely what has been put into the clause itself, but the inherent tendency of the whole measure&mdash;is towards greater decentralisation, and this is another pointer in that direction.  We had this fixed system here.  It was objected to as being bad and we are changing it, but we had that system, that if a case was really within the limit of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it was sent there immediately. There was this barrier against sending down other cases where the damages claimed were not precise, that a man could only recover&mdash;I am not speaking of the consent cases&mdash;whatever was inside the upward limit, but now we are going to loosen that, and we are to have a completely new system under which a judge of the High Court will no longer be deterred from sending cases down by the thought that there is a prospect that a man might recover more than £300, and we give him leave to give any amount.  You might have £1,000 judgments being awarded in the Circuit Court, and this section will aid the tendency that is written into the Bill in every clause.</P>
      <P>Surely if we are not going to stop the movement towards decentralisation, we should not, without greater thought and without some better aid from the evidence of witnesses, assist decentralisation. The best evidence given before the Committee was against further decentralisation.  The bulk of the opinion, I say, was in favour of a lowering of the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.  This moves away from the Report in this whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any of the dangers that Deputies see in this section.  It is really put in on a suggestion which came, first of all, from the Chief Justice.  Deputy Costello referred to the false analogy between this and the old system.  The Chief Justice referred to it, and I do not think that his answer, though Deputy McGilligan skilfully endeavoured to show that his attitude on this was tied up with his attitude to the whole system, can be said to be what the Deputy suggests.  I refer to his evidence on page 325 of the Report, Question 4729.  He volunteered the suggestion, because the Committee asked him:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is there any other matter before we pass on to the question of jurisdiction? On the question of jurisdiction, Chief Justice, what is your opinion?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Chief Justice answered:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is an amendment, no matter how you fix the jurisdiction, that is very necessary: It arose also in the County Courts in cases of remitted actions.  In the case of a remitted action, under the Common Law Procedure Act, 1870, the jurisdiction of the County Court was £50. If you sent down an action, under the remittal section, of the Common Law Procedure Act, the jurisdiction was still only £50.  Although it might turn out at the hearing in the courts that the party should get more, still you could not give him more.  They then passed an Act in 1887&mdash;it is Section 52 of the County Courts Act of 1887&mdash; which provided that in the case of actions remitted, the court to which it was remitted should have the same jurisdiction in the case of unliquidated damages as the court in which the action is brought.  That did not enlarge the power of remitting, but it prevented injustice when the action was remitted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello wants to suggest that the new section, as it stands, will enlarge the power of remitting.  My recollection of the period when this old system was in operation is that it was not relied on to enlarge the power of remitting.</P>

      <P>Many a time a judge has said, in the case of a remitted action, if this case goes down and more than £50 damages should be given, then the County Court will give them, and the judge sent it down on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have said that in answer to a plaintiff who was unable to satisfy him on the grounds as to why the action should be remitted at all.  In a case of that kind, a judge may have said: &ldquo;If the case goes down you are going to be in no worse position because the County Court can give you £1,000 damages, if necessary.&rdquo;  I do not think, as the Chief Justice says here, that it is likely that it actually narrowed the remitting motion very much.  It probably would have some effect.  I will return to that point, but let me give a further quotation.  The Chief Justice gave an instance.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Take the case of a person who is run down by a motor car.  The injury at the time the action is brought in the High Court does not appear to be much and the evidence goes to show that the damages may not be more than £50.  By the time the action is tried, however, you find that they may be more than £500 or £600, but the court has no jurisdiction to give a decree for that amount.  No matter what limit you put on a court jurisdiction, that amendment is necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Brown said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That is to have a similar section as the one in the County Courts Act of 1887?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Chief Justice answered:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Exactly.  It is a thing we think very necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that, when the Chief Justice said &ldquo;we&rdquo;, he was thinking and speaking on behalf of the judges as a whole.  That might possibly, as Deputy McGilligan argued, be affected by his view about the system as a whole, but I do not think so.  If you go back to the old County Court, it does seem rather odd that Section 52 of the 1887 Act should not have been repeated in the 1924 Act.  I think it is reasonable to put it in here.  I see that when <Col N="1290" /> Judge Davitt was asked about the matter he seems to have been taken rather by surprise.  On page 334 of the Report, in Question 4875, we find this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is another way in which the present state of affairs is not satisfactory.  If a case is transferred from the High Court to your Circuit Court you cannot, except the parties agree, give more than £300, though it turns out in the hearing in the Circuit Court that there ought to be a larger sum.  When the old County Court was working, there was an Act of 1887...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and the question goes on to refer to the old sections.  Judge Davitt asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Independent of the agreement of the parties, do you mean?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Brown answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and Judge Davitt said: &ldquo;I can imagine cases in which it would be advisable.&rdquo; Senator Brown added to that, &ldquo;They have occurred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no particular instance of it given undoubtedly, but in view of the fact that, on consent, the Circuit Court has unlimited jurisdiction, can it be said that in allowing jurisdiction, where an action is remitted, there is anything novel in it, or that it introduces any new argument as regards policy; that it allows argument to be based on the policy of an action on remitted motions?  I do not think it does.  I know that this particular suggestion has been mooted from time to time by several people in the hearing of cases in which difficulties have arisen, where actions have been remitted to the Circuit Court and it was found that the £300 limit was too small for the amount of damages incurred.  Take the case of a plaintiff who sues in the High Court and his action is remitted on the grounds that the judge, on the material stated in the affidavits, is not satisfied that he should recover more than £300.  If he goes to the Circuit Court in consequence of that order and that his evidence&mdash;in, say, a running-down case &mdash;and the evidence of the medical witnesses establish much more serious injuries than are apparent in the affidavits, it seems rather hard luck that he should not be entitled to recover adequate compensation simply <Col N="1291" /> because, on the reading of the affidavits on the remittal motion, the judge took the view that he should not recover more than £300.  I doubt it this section will create any difficulties or do the damage suggested.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Attorney-General has dealt with the remarks that I made that it will tend, to put it no higher than that, to make High Court judges freer in remitting actions to the Circuit Court because they will salve their judicial consciences by saying: &ldquo;Well, if anything does transpire in the course of the case that does not appear in the affidavits, then there is the Circuit Court, and it can give an amount of damages in excess of the £300.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to put this aspect of the matter to the Attorney-General. The Minister and the Attorney-General will recognise the fact that it is impossible to present a person's case on affidavit adequately.  Anybody who has had experience in dealing with running-down cases, negligence actions of all kinds, will know that when you read a doctor's or a surgeon's report in your brief, in so far as it is comprehensible at all, the evidence will not appear as it will when the doctor himself is in the box, so that High Court judges, reading affidavits, have no opportunity of finding out what is the real position in the case.  If those actions are to be transferred, let us take the case of a person injured.  He has been attended by a city surgeon or a city medical man.  That action is transferred.  It will be impossible for a litigant, who is not well off, to bring down these eminent surgeons or eminent medical men from the City of Dublin to the local venue.</P>

      <P>So have I, but the normal course in these running-down <Col N="1292" /> actions in the Circuit Court is for a local doctor to give evidence, and some of these local doctors are extremely good.  But the surgeons with greater names and more eminence carry greater weight with judges and juries than the others, and, if an action is remitted from the High Court to the Circuit Court, the result will almost certainly be that lower damages will be got than would have been got in the same action if it had been retained in the High Court.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the proposal made by this section either goes too far or does not go far enough? What has been said about remitted, or transferred, actions might be equally true about actions which are commenced in the Circuit Court.  A man may be injured by the negligence of a motorist and may institute his action in the Circuit Court.  It may turn out that he has suffered greater injury than would be sufficiently compensated by £300.  Why is that man not to get the benefit of this section just as much as the plaintiff who has started in the High Court and whose case has come under the review of a judge, the judge determining that £300 will be the limit of his compensation?  If the Minister proposes to give the Circuit Court limitless jurisdiction in cases of unliquidated claims let it be understood, but why is the man whose case has been held by the High Court to be fit only for the Circuit Court to have a right to unlimited damages while the man whose case has not been so determined is not to have that right?  That is one sufficient answer to this section.  Either it goes too far or it is not necessary at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any analogy based upon the old system is quite false and could only be made by a person who was not familiar with the procedure under which actions were remitted under that system.  At present, when a case is brought in the High Court, it can only be transferred to the Circuit Court if the judge is of opinion that it is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and fit to be prosecuted therein.  That is all he has to consider.  As the Minister and the Attorney-General will probably remember when their <Col N="1293" /> attention is directed to it, there was no similar provision under the old system.  In cases of tort, which are the ordinary cases of unliquidated damages, the application to remit was an application that the plaintiff should give security for costs or, otherwise, that his action should go to the County Court.  In other words, the governing factor with the High Court in the case of tort, which is the case dealt with by this section, was the poverty, or as it was put in the section, the &ldquo;want of visible means&rdquo; of the plaintiff.  Under the old system, a plaintiff who could give security for costs could keep his action in the High Court no matter how trivial it was. It was thought just and right, if a poor man brought his action in the High Court and was transferred to the County Court, that the County Court judge should have unlimited jurisdiction. Surely that was fair.  The question of riches or poverty no longer enters into the case.  When this section was put into the Bill and when the Minister supported it and sought to justify it by some analogy with the old system, this factor must have been overlooked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the reason is that injustice would be done to a plaintiff who had his action remitted because the judge took the view that it was one fit to be prosecuted in the Circuit Court as he was not likely to recover more than £300 damages.  It might emerge in the Circuit Court that the judge in the High Court was wrong in that opinion and it was felt that the plaintiff should not suffer thereby.  Deputy Lavery has made the point that this section goes either too far or does not go far enough.  I have already dealt with the question as to whether or not it goes too far.  Deputy Lavery says it does not go far enough but I do not quite follow his reasoning.  He says that, if we are to be logical, we should have no limit on the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court at all.  He instances the case of a man who brings his action in the Circuit Court and it is found in the <Col N="1294" /> course of the trial that he made a mistake and that he should have gone to the High Court.  That error can be corrected in either of two ways.  He may withdraw his civil bill in the Circuit Court before it comes to hearing, discontinue his action and start in the High Court.  Or he can do what was done, I think, in a running-down case the other day&mdash;move before the circuit judge under Section 48 of the 1924 Act to have the case sent into the High Court on the ground of a miscalculation as to the amount of damage suffered.  That was done successfully the other day.  That has been done, I think, in only a couple of cases.</P>

      <P>Surely the position will be ludicrous if the two courses of procedure are to be allowed to stand side by side.  One action is remitted from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  When it goes down, it appears that more than £300 damages should be given.  That is dealt with by the circuit judge.  Another action is started in the Circuit Court and, during the course of the proceedings, it transpires that more than £300 damages should be given.  The circuit judge is not to give £300 but he is to send the case up to the High Court. Are these cases to be going up and down in that fashion?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the section goes so far as that.  Section 48 says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that any party to an action commenced in the Circuit Court, and pending therein may at any time apply to the circuit judge that the action may be sent forward to the High Court, and thereupon in <Col N="1295" /> case the action is one fit to be prosecuted in the High Court and the High Court appears to be the more appropriate tribunal in the circumstances, the circuit judge may send forward such action to the High Court...</P>
    <P>It does not follow automatically that because a plaintiff claims that he has not sued for the amount he should have sued for, he would be allowed to go to the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the circuit judges think that the High Court judges are sending them too much work and they commence to send up their actions to the High Court on the ground that fair exchange is no robbery, what is the position to be? Will a further remitting application be made in the High Court to transfer to the circuit judge an action the circuit judge has sent up to the High Court? The position would become ludicrous. As Deputy Lavery, behind me, says, the two might collide on the way.  The Attorney-General has not answered Deputy Lavery's point on the question of the poor man.  He has not answered the point that this section, as I pointed out, is supposed to be justified by analogy&mdash;a false analogy, as Deputy Lavery has fully demonstrated&mdash;with the old County Court system.  That is pointed out as being founded on the fact that the plaintiff had no visible means.  Anybody who could show that they had visible means or could give alternatively security for costs in a small sum could retain the action in the High Court.  The principle attempted to be put into this section is entirely different.  An attempt is being made to justify the new section by analogy with the old section.  There is no analogy.  The Attorney-General has not answered Deputy Lavery's point.</P>

      <P>I do not agree.  I think I have answered Deputy Lavery.  It does not matter what the grounds for remitting were.  It was thought that the law should be amended, and when a case was remitted the County Courts got unlimited jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle why should the jurisdiction be so extended to the County Courts under a system where the ordinary jurisdiction was £50?  Although the amount may be different, why should not they be able to hear these cases, particularly when under the section the jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Courts on consent is unlimited?  That did not exist in the County Courts.  Under Section 48, on consent, there is not any limit as to amount of the claim or the value of the property.  It does not seem to me to be illogical to allow the Circuit Courts to give more than £300 in cases which the High Court has remitted.  By agreement between the parties, the court can have jurisdiction unlimited, and has frequently exercised it. Although the reason for introducing this section may be different to that which led to the introduction of the section under the Act of 1887, I do not see that there is anything illogical about it, or why jurisdiction should not be widened in the particular case that the Chief Justice mentioned in his answer, and which I accepted as an instance of hardship, following leaving the law as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was taken midway in the Chief Justice's evidence. He pointed out that he wanted that jurisdiction and that if there was any move it should be towards an extension to £500.  Following the point in the question mentioned by the Attorney-General he said that the ordinary run of cases should be tried locally.  He expressed that point of view before.  The example quoted by the Attorney-General went to show that the whole mentality of the Chief Justice was that the jurisdiction if it was to be given at all should be by way of enlarging it.  Naturally under these circumstances the Chief Justice would not pay any attention to arguments based on a tendency towards decentralisation.  It is that tendency I am speaking of.  I think it is harmful. I do not think the Attorney-General has met the point that was <Col N="1297" /> put here.  A case goes to the High Court and is discussed with a view to seeing whether it should be remitted.  The High Court judge forms an impression as to whether it is a fit, reasonable or proper case to retain in the High Court.  He has passed some sort of judgment on it. He sends the case down, and yet in that case which has passed a court test a Circuit Court judge may award more than £100.  In a case which people start themselves, within the limits of the ordinary jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, although he finds it a great hardship, the court cannot immediately enlarge the damages beyond £300.</P>

But when a recommendation of the Bar Council contrary to the section is produced, they just pass it by as being of no account.

      <P>In page 12, Section 25 (1), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; line 4, down to and including the word &ldquo;consent,&rdquo; line 6 and substitute the words &ldquo;if requested by any party to any matter pending before him unless he considers the request frivolous.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>This amendment is merely to provide that it shall be the duty of the circuit judge to state a case for the opinion of the High Court, if either party to the suit requests him to do so, unless he is of opinion that the application <Col N="1302" /> is vexatious.  I think the Circuit Court judge at the moment has power to state a case for the opinion of the High Court, which can ultimately go to the Supreme Court, in revenue matters.  If that jurisdiction is to be extended, and I certainly have an open mind as to whether it ought or ought not to be extended&mdash;in view of the change of the system I am rather against giving him jurisdiction to state a case at all; I think it should be the judge at assizes who should state the case just the same as in the old procedure&mdash;but if it is given, it ought to be given in such a way as to be completely operative, so that either party might get a case stated for the opinion of the High Court with the possibility of going to the Supreme Court, in a just and proper case.  It should not be dependent merely on the consent of the parties.  As I said. I think the authority to state a case by a Circuit Court judge is of little or no importance if the system of rehearing is to obtain; but I do think that what should be considered is the power of the judge of assize hearing a case to state a case either for the opinion of the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy points out, under a later section the judge on circuit can state a case on the application of either party for the Supreme Court.  There would be very little point in giving the Circuit Court judge the same jurisdiction, as the Deputy says.  The cases considered worth providing for are cases in which a decision on a question of law will <Col N="1303" /> rule the whole matter or a considerable part of it.  It is thought, where that is the position and where both parties agree that that is the position, that it would shorten the proceedings and expedite the disposal of the case to allow the Circuit Court judge, by agreement between the parties, to state a case for the High Court, the decision on which by the High Court judge becomes final, unless the High Court gives leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.  The section has that advantage, that it will enable parties to get a High Court decision on a single or more points of law and have the matter disposed of without the necessity of going through the procedure of trying the whole case out in the Circuit Court and of going to the High Court judge on circuit and asking him to state a case.  In view of the fact that that power is given to the judge going on circuit it is not considered necessary to provide that a case should be stated on the application of any single party.  It is only where the parties consent that the Circuit Court judge should be allowed to state a case.  The Minister suggests that the section should be amended by giving a discretion to the judge, so that even where the parties consent he shall not be bound to state a case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would not improve the section at all.  I think it would be rather a detriment to the section.  I agree that the case put by the Attorney-General is one that ought to be met, but I do not think it is met in this way.  There may be cases in which there will be merely a net issue of law between the parties, where the facts are admitted, and where it is desirable to get, in as speedy a manner as possible, the ultimate tribunal to decide the issue.  Under the section as it stands at present, that can only be done by consent.  If one of the parties objects, it cannot be done.  It has to go to the judge at the assizes, and he then must state a case on the application of either party.  The actual result of it is to put the additional expense of hearing before a judge of assize on one or other of the parties ultimately, and also to bring about a considerable amount of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The suggestion I made is that, in cases of that kind, where it appears to the Circuit Court judge to be a proper case, on the application of either party for the application of the rule of a case stated, he should have power to send it direct to the High Court instead of putting the parties to the expense of going to the judge of assize, who will then state a case, and it will come up in 12 or 18 months in the High Court, instead of allowing it to go in the course of a month or two without the interposition of the judge of assize.  It is not a matter upon which I have very strong feelings.  I am merely pointing that out.</P>

      <P>Does it not seem absurd, in a case in which one litigant feels there is a point of law to be determined and wants to get that stated in such a way that the High Court can determine it, that in order to achieve that against his opponent's wish he has to go to the trouble of an appeal and then, on the appeal to an assize judge, he can get it on his own application if the judge considers it right?  Why should this not be allowed, possibly limiting the power to cases other than those considered to be frivolous?  Why put it that the only way in which one litigant in the court can get a case stated on a point of law for the determination of the High Court is by going to the roundabout of taking an appeal and then getting it via the appeal judge on circuit? Why should it not be direct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say any more than I said.  I think it is only very rarely that there will be a case in which a single point of law will decide the whole matter.  This simple method of getting it decided is put in, in addition to the power for deciding it which is provided under the ordinary appeal system.  The Deputy asks why should a man be put to the trouble of going via the Circuit Court and the Assize Court to have a case stated, instead of going this short way.  But in a good many cases, <Col N="1305" /> probably, the necessity will not arise at all.  He may be satisfied with the High Court judge on circuit on the point of law.  If he is dissatisfied with that, even though his opponent opposes he can get straight to the Supreme Court and have the point decided. This is not a thing upon which one can take up a strong line, but I think, on the whole, this is adequate to meet the particular type of case we have in mind.</P>

      <P>Take a Circuit Court case where the judge is of opinion that the point that determines the whole matter is a point of law and indicates that he would like to have it decided by somebody other than himself. In that case, if one of the parties objects, the party who wants to get it, even with the will of the judge, cannot get it taken direct.  He must go on appeal and in this roundabout way go to the Supreme Court.  Supposing we were limited to giving the judge a discretion to wide out the phrase &ldquo;if the parties consent&rdquo;, so that it was not peremptory on the judge, on the application of one person, to see that the other parties concerned in the matter consented, but that the judge could refer the question of law if one party to the case stated it: is not that better than by going in the roundabout way?</P>

The Deputy says that it should be done on the application of one party, but, on the other hand, why should that person's opponent be forced to agree to that if he prefers to go about it the other way and may have good reason for doing so?  Is not this section useful where the parties concerned all agree that a decision on a point of law will decide the matter and consider that it is best to take the short course of going to the High Court, from which there is no appeal except by leave of the High Court?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12, Section 25 (2), to delete line 11 and substitute the words &ldquo;Supreme Court gives leave to <Col N="1307" /> appeal in which case an appeal may be brought to the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is merely another instance of the court, from whom the appeal is to be taken, having the right of saying whether or not such an appeal shall or shall not be taken.  It comes within the general principle we discussed here the other night as to whether it is proper for the High Court, in cases of criminal appeals, to have the power of saying whether or not in a particular case there shall or shall not be an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point in regard to that is the point I made before with regard to leaving it to the Supreme Court to decide whether an appeal shall or shall not lie.  It really means that the Supreme Court, in order that they may be able to decide that point, must have all the facts placed before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong.  If he had had any experience of the tribunal that used to be known here as the Privy Council, he would known that, if they had an application for leave to appeal they took a very short time to deal with it&mdash;generally not more than a quarter of an hour. That is what we envisage in connection with this question of the leave to appeal&mdash;possibly <i>ex parte</i>&mdash;and on that the Supreme Court would say whether or not they would hear it.  In a number of cases they would say that no issues of importance were involved and that the case might be heard <i>ex parte</i> with no expenses on the other side at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only case with which I am concerned.  The principle underlying this amendment is one that lies more appropriately to be considered in connection with the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I do not wish it to be discussed or even decided on this particular issue here, in which I am not particularly interested, if at all, but I do say that the only <Col N="1308" /> thing I envisage is an <i>ex parte</i> appeal to the Supreme Court on which the party concerned would have to make out a strong case to the Supreme Court in order to get leave to appeal from the High Court.  That is the only thing I am concerned with, and I think Deputy McGilligan agrees with me on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not.  Of course under the system of criminal appeals there is an application for leave to appeal.  In practice, that has worked out as the full hearing of the appeal, but that is only the practice that has grown up in that particular court as a matter of convenience, because they give leave in 99 per cent. of the cases brought before them. However, it could be made clear by the words of the section that what is envisaged is not the full hearing, with costs, of both sides, but perhaps an <i>ex parte</i> application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

      <P>As I said before, I would be strongly opposed to granting liberty to go to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal against a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, because in that section which allows an appeal to the Supreme Court there are very strict words of limitation.  They are only allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court where the matter involved is shown to be a matter of public importance and one in which the public interest is concerned.  This section, and analogous sections which existed in the old Act, I think, are on a different footing, and I do not feel disposed to hold with the Deputy as <Col N="1309" /> strongly on the question as to whether permission should not be given to go to the Court of Appeal itself.  I think, however, that a very important factor to be taken into consideration is the question of expense. If it were to entail, as it has entailed in the case of appeals from the Central Criminal Court and from the Circuit Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the opening up of the whole case, it would be difficult to justify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put forward the proposition that the Supreme Court should entertain the application for leave to appeal in such a way as to spend a week hearing the whole case.  What I had in mind was something like the appeal to the Privy Council where one had to make out a strong case.  The Attorney-General points out that the present Bill contains strong words as to limitation.  These words could still be retained, and it would be a matter for the Appeal Court to determine whether or not the decision of the High Court did involve a matter of great public importance and that an appeal should be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have added that on this section I certainly should oppose any such amendment here for this reason, that this is the course chosen by all parties by consent.  They choose this short cut to the High Court in order to have the point of law decided, whereas if they wanted the Supreme Court to decide on it they could have gone to the judge of the Circuit Court and got from him an appeal to the Supreme Court.  If they choose this short cut, I do think that the High Court should have the power to refuse an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us count the courts until we see the short cuts. Starting with the Circuit Court, by consent as it is now, we go to the High Court, and having got to the High Court you have later on to obtain from the High Court leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.  I would suggest that as to Deputy Costello's idea of going to the Supreme Court <Col N="1310" /> for leave to appeal you would remember this&mdash;this matter started in the Circuit Court and in every case an appeal was allowed to the Supreme Court if the parties wanted to go there.  The suggestion now is, that Deputy Costello would bring, in addition to the Circuit Court case stated for the High Court, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and then go to the Supreme Court.  The other suggestion sends us round the world. You started in the Circuit Court. You go on appeal to the High Court and you get those people to decide the case one way or the other.  There was an action of a very big amount bearing on this point brought under the system established in 1924.  The claim was that it was the right of every citizen to go to the High Court and that the onus was on the person who wanted to stop him to show why. Why should there be any prohibition against an appeal?  Why should it not be open in every case to a litigant beaten in the High Court to go to the Supreme Court?  I make a big distinction between that and the Court of Criminal Appeal because the Court of Criminal Appeal was an innovation. There was then a recognition that there might be points of law of exceptional public importance involved, and, added to that, it might be desirable in the public interest to take your appeal to the Supreme Court.  The appeal will be within those limits&mdash;that there is involved a point of law of exceptional importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that a man beaten in the High Court should be allowed to take his case to the Supreme Court without having to get leave to appeal from the High Court.  The litigant should have the right to go to the Appeal Court once he is beaten in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that in several cases, and the point was advanced by several witnesses before the Committee&mdash;the point that it was the right of every dissatisfied litigant to resort to the Supreme Court.  As a practising barrister, I should welcome the granting of facilities for increased litigation.  But in the public interest surely the Deputy <Col N="1311" /> must realise that restriction are placed upon the right of the citizen to resort to various courts.  In certain cases you cannot get beyond the District Court and in other cases you cannot get beyond the Circuit Court. The decision of the Circuit Court in such cases is final.  The various classes of courts through which a man may drag his opponent are in the public interest limited.  It is not fair to the man who has won his case in the lower court that he should be dragged to the High Court and that, later on, he may be dragged by his dissatisfied opponent to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well in theory to advocate that, but in practice it might work great hardship, and in a good many cases it would create an abuse.  It is only on these grounds that one can put up a defence against allowing the actions of litigants to go to each court from the District Court to the Supreme Court.  It must be borne in mind that as regards the High Court in this and in other instances, there is committed a discretion to the judges who are appointed to do this work by the State.  You give to these judges discretion to say whether a man should be allowed to go to a higher court&mdash; whether the case is of sufficient importance to allow him to appeal or not. There may theoretically be objections to allowing the court which has heard the case to refuse to the applicant the right to appeal and take that case further.  It may possibly be held that the judges who have decided the case one way or the other do not want their decisions reviewed, that after all they are only human nature.  But that is a very theoretical objection.  In practice, I do not think it could be shown that the High Court has refused a certificate in any case in which an unbiased examination would justify the granting of a certificate for leave to appeal.  The Deputy must realise that the judges to whom this right or power is delegated are themselves the guardians of the rights of the citizens. They must be expected to see that the man who has a serious point of law to bring forward will not be unduly <Col N="1312" /> restricted in his theoretical right to take his case to the Supreme Court. It is on that basis that such restrictions should be put in, and they are very properly put in.  I altogether resist the suggestion that we should throw the doors open and allow dissatisfied litigants to take their opponents through the courts up to the Supreme Court without first satisfying the High Court judges that they should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to have an appeal at all, and that appeal is to be restricted, it surely is wrong in principle that leave should have to be sought from the body from whom you are appealing and from whom you want the appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and they have decided one way.  I think, as human beings, they would be prejudiced against giving the litigant any further right of appeal.  They are not going to approach the consideration of the right to appeal as freely as a new body that has not heard the case and has not come to a decision on it.  The other body is approaching it with an open mind.  If that is the only point, I think there would be no gainsaying that particular statement.  There is the other side, that you do not want a multiplicity of appeals.  It is wasteful of people's time and money and it is wasteful in connection with the courts also.  The suggestion is that leave should be sought from the higher body instead of the lower body.  The objection to that is that if you are going to look for your leave to appeal from the higher body, it means opening the matter once more.  The only way of meeting all these difficulties is to have narrow limitations put upon the points of substance you can raise before the Appeal Court.  There must be some point of law, some point of exceptional importance.  In such circumstances you are either shortly victorious or shortly disposed of.</P>

I do not see why, in these exceptional circumstances, one should not be allowed to go to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court. My suggestion is that there should be no restriction except the restriction inherent in the section.  There must be a point of law and it must be taken with the consent of both parties. Have the right of appeal dependent upon leave granted with regard to the appeal, but if you are going to have leave granted, get it from the higher body and not from the body before whom you have suffered defeat.  I do not see why there should not be an unrestricted right of appeal to the Supreme Court.  I have found a considerable body of opinion moving in this direction, disposing entirely of the Court of Criminal Appeal and having an appeal direct to the Supreme Court, cutting out the High Court.</P>

The suggestion <Col N="1316" /> in the amendment is that the judge of the Circuit Court in which such actions are pending may consolidate them.  Look at the alternatives. He may transfer such an action to the High Court unless the parties agree to proceeding in the Circuit Court, when the action shall continue to be tried and determined in the Circuit Court.

    <P>This amendment is designed for the purpose of getting into the scope of appeals to the Circuit Court judge, the Revenue Commissioners on every possible point that these commissioners may decide.  At present there is an appeal from the Revenue Commissioners on the question of income-tax. Tucked away, I have discovered, there are certain matters that the Revenue Commissioners deal with and in regard to which they allege there is no appeal.  Those matters are tucked away from the knowledge of the public.  There is an appeal from the Revenue Commissioners in most matters.  Some matters, inadvertently or otherwise, have been left out, and I want them brought in.  One of the matters on which there is no appeal at the moment from the Revenue Commissioners is the question of allowances in arriving at assessment of income-tax.  I want to provide that there should be an appeal in a matter <Col N="1320" /> of that kind and on all other matters within the jurisdiction of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is very doubtful, to put it no further, if the Revenue Commissioners exercising their functions, having reference to the terms of the Constitution, exercise functions that give them judicial powers.  There ought to be an appeal in every one of these respects.  I think the intention was that there should be an appeal in such cases.  I want to make it clear that everything in the jurisdiction of the Revenue Commissioners who, after all, are only two civil servants, such as income-tax and taxes analogous, the Circuit Court judge should have jurisdiction to hear and to determine on appeal.</P>

That argument appears to me quite clearly to be an argument which has been put up by the Revenue Department&mdash;&ldquo;Do not touch us.&rdquo;  We are putting through an amendment to the Courts of Justice Bill, dealing, amongst other things, with the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court on appeal from various people. One of the appeals to the circuit judge is the appeal from the Revenue Commissioners. I think that has nothing to do with the Revenue code at all. &ldquo;The Revenue code&rdquo; is a very high-sounding expression, which, in fact, means nothing except it means all the things that the Revenue Commissioners want it to mean.  When you say you do not think anybody should put their hands on the sacred Revenue code, I do <Col N="1321" /> submit to the Minister that in considering the Courts of Justice Bill, and the jurisdiction which the circuit judge has, he ought to consider whether or not some of those things which have been left out from the jurisdiction of the circuit judge in the matter of appeals might appropriately be considered on the hearing of such a Bill. I do press this amendment, because I think it is a matter of very vital importance. There are some veryfew things which are left out in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court judge.  I think this is the appropriate moment to consider the matter, and that it should not be brushed aside by saying &ldquo;Hands off the Revenue code&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I say that the words &ldquo;Revenue code&rdquo; are very clearly understood by most people who have anything to do with Revenue matters.  It may be improperly and loosely so described, but the law regulating the incidence of taxation, the methods by which taxation is to be levied, and governing the operations of the Commissioners, is something which, I think, can be conveniently, if somewhat loosely, described as the Revenue code.  The fact that the circuit judge is allowed certain jurisdiction to inquire into the decisions of the Revenue Commissioners is an accident. It is only accidentally that the courts come into contact with the rulings of the Revenue Commissioners, and not the other way round.  The Deputy seems to suggest that there had been taken away from the courts decisions which properly belonged to the courts. Apparently the tendency of legislation has been to commit to the body known as the Special Commissioners, and to the Revenue authorities generally, the regulations, say, as to the amount of income-tax which is to be collected from particular individuals.  Whether, in doing so, they are acting unconstitutionally, is a matter on which I do not care to pronounce an opinion.  If they are, it seems strange that they should have been allowed to go unchallenged for such a length of time. I certainly would hesitate to touch this particularly thorny subject in this Bill. I think the Minister is quite right in saying that it is something which is appropriate to another Bill.  We have certain information as regards the position, and I could go at more length into it, but I think that it is really unnecessary to do so.  After all, Deputy Costello was familiar with the position for a number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I only discovered recently that certain matters are excluded from the jurisdiction of the circuit judge, and I took the earliest opportunity&mdash;which is this opportunity &mdash;of raising the matter in the House. The position at the moment is that the jurisdiction as transferred to the Circuit Court under the Act of 1924 was that everybody who is assessed to income-tax had his appeal to the Special Commissioners, and from the decision of the Special Commissioners there was an appeal to the circuit judge.  That, I think, should be, and everybody believes it to be, a full right of appeal from the decision of two civil servants to a judge on the amount of his income.  The position at the moment is that there are certain matters which are excluded from the jurisdiction of the circuit judge on the hearing of that appeal.  I have given an example of one of those matters, namely, the amount of the allowances that a person is entitled to get before his assessment is reached.  That is a matter which ought not to be left to two civil servants, and this is the proper time to remedy that state of affairs.</P>

He raised that matter before the Committee, and the Committee recommended that this power of the Revenue Commissioners to imprison should be removed.

There either is at the moment, or there is not, such an appeal.  If there is, the amendment does not add anything to the law, but if there is not, the amendment simply sets out that there shall be a right of appeal to the Circuit Court from the decision of the Revenue Commissioners.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very definite objection to this section.  As Deputy Costello has stated, despite all that we have been told from the other side, this section is definitely trying to close down any question of appeal from any enactment relating to a tax or duty under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  For fear there might be any doubt about that, we have now this special section rammed into this Bill which is not supposed to deal with the Revenue code. Why not leave the Revenue Commissioners as they were if we could not get the small point of justice that was asked in amendment No. 46, that there should be an appeal to the Circuit Court from the Special Commissioners? The Special Commissioners have no judicial authority.  They are only civil servants.  If we could not get that, it is not right to go and copper-fasten the Revenue Commissioners in their present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, by way of reinforcing the remarks already made, that when the argument is put up, as it has been put up, that this is not the appropriate moment to touch the sacred Revenue code, that in sub-section (2)  of this section there is an express provision that no appeal is to exist in Revenue matters except such appeals as already subsist.  While I am prevented by the argument of the Minister and the votes of his Party from providing that it should be made clear that, in all matters, the circuit judge shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant no disrespect, Sir.  By the decision of the House, as the Ceann Comhairle properly points out, the position has now been reached that the Revenue Commissioners can in this section put in some part of some provision which will copper-fasten their sacred Revenue code, and we are not allowed in any way to touch that by making it clear that the Circuit Court judge has full jurisdiction to determine the matters which we think he ought to determine.  Under sub-section (2) of this section there is an express, very clear and definite provision that no appeal is to lie from the Circuit Court judge from any decision <Col N="1329" /> on appeal under any enactment relating to Revenue, except cases stated. As regards cases stated, it is held, I believe, by the Revenue Commissioners that the circuit judge has no power to state cases on certain matters.  Now I think that ought not to be so.  I do not see why sub-section (2) of Section 34 should be placed in this Bill.  I think it is a wrong provision to have in the Bill.  The only purpose of inserting it is further to reinforce the Revenue position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Would the Minister say what is the necessity for preserving the existing position if it already exists?  Why put in that section if there is not some point in doing it if the law is at the moment as I judge the Minister to state it? Why put it in again?  There must be some point in doing so.  That sub-section was obviously inserted at the request of the Revenue Commissioners. They must have had some reason for requesting it to be put in, and I want to know what the reason is.</P>

      <P>The alternative method of appeal provision raises doubts that possibly an appeal would lie where hitherto it had not been allowed.  The section has been deliberately put in for the purpose of preserving the <i>status quo.</i>  No one has suggested that the position with regard to appeals to the Circuit Court in revenue matters should be touched, and I frankly confess that it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know, in view of the fact that all other judgments of the Circuit Court are being made, with the exceptions mentioned in the Bill, the subject matter of appeal to the going judges of assize, what is the case for taking Revenue cases out of that category?  Why, in matters involving income-tax, which are of vital importance to the payer of the tax, should he not have the same right of appeal to the going judge of assize as the man sued for £5 for breach of warranty of a cow? I do not want to be told what the <Col N="1330" /> distinction is in principle.  I merely want to know why that section is put in.  We are told, with a flourish of trumpets, that a new system is being put into operation.  Why is not this done?  Why does it not apply to Revenue cases the same as other cases? I have got no answer to that question except that nobody made the case that it should be applied.  I am making the case that there is no distinction between Revenue matters and breach of warranty of a cow.  They ought to be in the same category and subject to the appeal given in this Bill&mdash;a rehearing before the going judge of assize, subject, of course, to the practice which subsists of a hearing <i>in camera.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not suggest that the preparation of this Bill demanded that we should investigate every case in which appeals lie and do not lie and the particular restrictions on appeals, with a view to seeing whether these rights should be extended or further restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  Before bringing in a new system, I think you should have considered the whole field of appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>That would have opened up a very wide field, and, surely, the field we have opened up is wide enough.  This particular part of the Bill is, in the main, an alteration of the procedure with regard to appeals.  It provides a different form of appeal and a different type of Appeal Court.  Apparently, it was suggested to the Revenue Commissioners, or they were advised, that if they did not have this section inserted to safeguard the position as it is at the moment, it might be held that an appeal did lie in the way the Deputy desires it should lie.  I should hesitate to say that, with one gesture, we should sweep in all Revenue matters and decisions of the Special Commissioners; that, because we are substituting one form of appeal for another, we should allow an appeal in every type of matter which comes before the Special Commissioners.  I <Col N="1331" /> do not think that the Deputy can make a case for that.  Whether you regard the code as a code or not, undoubtedly it has been worked out with great care and is very detailed. The Deputy says that certain provisions are tucked away and difficult to find, so that it would take some trouble to say what are the matters in which appeals lie and what are the matters in which they do not lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see if we can make the case briefly.  The objection to what Deputy Costello has urged has been on two grounds.  The first ground is that, as we were changing the procedure in regard to appeals, it might develop that the judges going circuit in the future would find themselves obliged to take this sort of appeal from the Revenue Commissioners and that that would not be desirable.  Why is it not desirable?  If we are to have the High Court judges sent round the country on circuit to hear appeals in regard to cases of an ordinary type, and if we are to give the people concerned an opportunity to parade their witnesses for a second time and to have <Col N="1332" /> matters of fact disposed of for a second time, is it not proper that Revenue matters should be included in that framework and that they should also be subject to review?  I think the onus is on the man who says it is not proper to prove the negative.  A simple amendment would be that suggested by Deputy Costello&mdash;that there should be an appeal from every decision of the Special Commissioners of income-tax. Does that strike anybody who thinks of the trouble we used to have as to people being taxed in an unfair way, as unfair&mdash;that there should be an appeal from two non-judicial people on the amount of taxation a man should pay?  Does it appear unfair that there should be an appeal to a judicial person on that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second ground of objection by the Attorney-General was that you might give an entirely new appeal on tax matters.  We are giving a completely new appeal on a tremendous number of matters.  There never was, up to date, in this country, an appeal on fact in cases over the £50 limit.  We are giving such an appeal as between £50 and £300.  We are giving a completely new appeal in all matters which are above the limit of £50 and below the limit of £300.  Why stop short at that and say that you will not have this new system touch in any way on the Revenue Commissioners' rights to tax the people?  Again, it must be stressed that, however valuable and experienced the Revenue Commissioners may be as civil servants, they are not judicial persons, and the only question raised here was as to whether it was desirable or not to give an appeal from them on any matter handled by them to the circuit judge.  We can deal with what would happen when it got to the circuit judge afterwards.  I doubt if anybody can say that, as between the people and the Revenue Commissioners, there should not be a right of appeal from the Revenue Commissioners to a judicial person.  History in every country is littered thick with conflicts over methods of extorting money from people contrary to the law or in arbitrary fashion or by walking warily beside the law, but, perhaps, outside it.  Let us have the test of a judicial person passing his judgment on <Col N="1333" /> these matters on appeal.  That is all that is asked.  So much for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In this section there are included two other points on which the SubCommittee of the General Council put up recommendations.  One was that the matter at the end of sub-section (1) should no longer stand there&mdash;that is to say, from &ldquo;nor from any judgment....&rdquo; to the end of the last line.  These four lines should be deleted.  They also recommended that the existing right of appeal in valuation cases dealt with in sub-section (3) should be retained. Incidentally, is not the valuation code not as well thought out and as carefully built up over centuries as the income-tax code?  Is there not a valuation code which is almost as esoteric a matter as the Revenue code?  Under Section 33 we passed the whole question of workmen's compensation which could be said to be somewhat of a code by itself.  The only horror that strikes any sort of fright into the minds of the Minister and the Attorney-General is when the Revenue Commissioners are mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 34 and 35 agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this is the appropriate section on which to raise this point, but I think there are strong enough grounds for doing so now.  Right through the measure one finds time and time again that the Minister for Justice is given certain powers, sometimes after consultation with, say, the President of the High Court, sometimes by agreement with other people, and sometimes on his own.  This whole question of Ministerial powers, and the use of them, has been somewhat in the limelight recently in connection with leases of State property.  I should like to know if there is any standard laid down by the Executive Council for their guidance in this matter.  We found it related on sworn evidence before a select committee that a great many of the powers and duties imposed upon Ministers by statute are in fact carried out by civil servants. <Col N="1334" /> I had it in mind at one time to put down a variety of questions on this subject, where I found that the Minister for Justice or the secretary of a Department, of alternatively the Minister for Justice himself was mentioned, to see if I could get some fixity with regard to the matter.  Under this section there is the question afterwards of grouping circuits.  Has the Minister any views as to whether he will deal with them or hereafter leave them to civil servants?  Where is the line drawn?  There are also matters of assigning duties to servants which might seem from the levity view of the Executive Council to be a matter for a Civil Service department. If there is to be any real interest taken in the duty of retainers attached to the judges, it might be a matter for the Minister to inquire into in a precise manner.  Is there any line of departure as to when the Minister is to handle these things or not? Opinions have been given previously.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister going to deal with them?  I understand that under old statutes which were not passed by this Parliament, and under statutes at present passed by the English Parliament, there occurs a phrase, generally in a concluding section, that where power is given to a Minister or to a Secretary of State that that power may be delegated by him to the head of the Department or to someone in his name.  Our legislation has not proceeded on these lines.  We do not include such a phrase.  I always understood that the omission of that phrase was intended to mark the new phase, and that when a statutory duty was imposed on a Minister he had to attend to it.  Does the Minister propose to interpret it in that way?</P>

      <P>I should like to put the point of view of the practitioners in connection with this matter.  Speaking for myself, and, I am sure, for a considerable number of my brethren at the Bar, and perhaps I might include the Attorney-General, I do not want the circuits on which we will have to work for the purpose of earning our living under this Bill fixed for us by civil servants, without consultation with the Bar Council.  There is not a word about consultation with the Bar Council.  The views of the judges may not in any way reflect the views of the Bar.  I am not interested in the solicitor profession, but this section does not indicate that there will be consultation with the solicitor profession in fixing the circuits.  I am interested in my own profession, and there is nothing in the section providing that the Minister before starting to do <Col N="1336" /> something which may materially affect the livelihood of members of the Bar will consult the Bar Council. He is going to fix on a certain plan for the circuits without consulting the governing authority of the Bar, the Bar Council.  When the Minister is replying I would like him to deal with that matter, and to say whether before he fixes the circuit he will consult the Bar Council and hear their views.  I would also like to know whether he intends to make a completely new division of the circuits in the area now known as Saorstát Eireann, or does he intend to follow the old stereotyped lines that existed here before the passing of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924? As the matter is of considerable importance to practitioners, I think this is the appropriate time to gain some enlightenment from the Minister as to what are his intentions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to fortify myself on this matter with a recommendation of the Committee and with the evidence of numerous witnesses.  When the question was precisely put to witnesses they answered unanimously that they thought of appeals to two judges going on circuit.  A number of witnesses said, after having objected to a return to the old system of rehearing, that they were of opinion that there should be an appeal to two judges.  If there was any distinction made it was made by a certain witness who gave evidence asking that Circuit <Col N="1338" /> Court jurisdiction should be cut down, and then making a limit, some new division, as to the point of excess, an upper limit below which the case should go to the Circuit Court judge. Then the witnesses followed that up by saying that if there was to be rehearing on the higher level of cases the appeal should be to two judges, but that if you were thinking of this type of discrimination they did not mind if the lower cases went to a single judge.  I think without doubt the Committee could have expressed itself in these terms, that all the witnesses were in favour of a rehearing by two judges, if it were not for these reservations I speak of.  The only occasion on which any distinction was made by witnesses was when some of them objected to the rehearing at all. Sometimes those who were inclined to put forward that argument later said: &ldquo;Very good, if there is to be a rehearing, let it be before two judges.&rdquo; Then they were asked: &ldquo;Would you have two judges for the rehearing in a matter in which there is, say, only £50 involved?&rdquo;  and they said: &ldquo;Let that go before a single judge.&rdquo;  There was, however, a virtual unanimity of opinion on the point that there should be two judges.  We are now going away from that.</P>
    <P>The Committee expressed agreement with the view that there should be two. Again I say that on this point there was in the Committee's deliberations and in the Report a certain confusion. They were apparently at first taken with the view expressed to them by witnesses that there were considerable excess costs in the new system.  They set out to get a system which would not involve the same expense, but they were in the end forced by the volume of opinion put to them, to express the view that the rehearing should be before two judges, no matter what that should involve in the way of expense.  They were further constrained to express the opinion that the stenographer's notes should be kept, even though there should be the rehearing with two judges.  The retention of the stenographer's notes could not in any way in anybody's judgment have lessened the expense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> Nevertheless, the Committee have put forward that case.  I think it was later, when they considered the suggestion as to the likelihood of perjury, that they decided on keeping the notes, but on this question of the two judges there was virtual unanimity and certainly there was no reason put forward as to why there should be only one judge.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised on the Second Stage along with the discussion on the keeping of notes, and we had the statement of the President on both matters that he had been impressed with the representations made.  I had thought that we would have seen amendments providing for the two judges and also for the retention of the notes, if only to make them available to the judge on appeal, but neither of these matters has been attended to.  As to what was the principle that ruled in the minds of the witnesses who expressed themselves in favour of two judges, it is difficult to speculate.  Some people founded themselves apparently on the old belief that it is better to have two persons deciding a matter than one. Some of them were apparently impressed with the old and I think the wrong mathematical argument that if you have a Circuit Court judge and he decides one way, and the appeal judge decides otherwise, you have a divided opinion.  The question was now and again asked and glanced over, as to what would happen if, on appeal, the two judges hearing it were in disagreement. The obvious answer to that was that then the decision of the circuit judge was not upset.</P>
    <P>There was running through the minds of the witnesses the view that actions in which sums from £100 to £150 were claimed, represented very big cases in the eyes of the people of this country. They carried forward that view when they were talking of the appeal, and they said that cases of considerable magnitude, as they expressed these to be, should not be heard by a single judge going on circuit and hearing such a case with a previous decision one way or the other standing on record.  It is hard to get any common line between the witnesses, but I think that it is not <Col N="1340" /> exaggerating the evidence to say that most of the witnesses, being impressed with the relative magnitude of, say, a £200 claim in this country, felt that it was right that an appeal on a claim of that kind should not be taken before a single judge.  There was inherent in that expression of view this: that it was better to have two judges who could think the matter over and who could have their minds in conflict on the matter as it went along, and who could come to a common decision on cases of that magnitude.  Whatever may be the reasons&mdash;and there were many&mdash;there was such an expression of opinion as made the Committee declare in favour of having an appeal to two judges and we are now going away from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be desirable in the view of many people to have these appeals heard by two judges, but the real objection to that is that it would involve the appointment of additional High Court judges.  If you are going to have every appeal heard by two judges, it will certainly entail the appointment of additional judges. I think if the present scheme were allowed to be put into operation, we could see after a year or two how it would work with the number of judges that are available.  There is another body of opinion which feels that a hearing by one judge might be better than a hearing by two, that is, in cases where the two judges might disagree. Such a case was referred to by the Deputy.  The position then is that the decision of the Circuit Court judge stands.  That has happened in some cases already where we had an appeal on the notes.  The main consideration at any rate is that unless additional High Court judges are to be appointed, we could not carry out that recommendation of the Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to go through the evidence of everybody in detail, but I doubt if there was a member of the Bar called before the Committee who did not express himself in favour of an appeal to two judges.  The witness representing the Incorporated Law Society, Dr. Quirke, an ex-president of the Society, expressed <Col N="1341" /> himself very distinctly in favour of the two judges.  Right down all through the list of witnesses I could quote similar expressions of opinion one by one.  In fact, I have failed to find any reason for the Committee saying that &ldquo;the majority of the witnesses&rdquo; were in favour of an appeal before two judges.  I think that is a considerable underestimate of the number of witnesses, as between members of the profession and others, who gave evidence in favour of two judges. I do not know that there is any one of them who had any firm view in favour of a rehearing by a single judge. There were some of them who started with that view, but upon a question or two being put to them explaining what was going to happen, they unanimously reverted to the suggestion of the two judges.  If there had been a new reference of this matter to the Committee, and their view was taken, as to whether or not it was advisable to adopt the old system of appeals, I doubt very much if there would have been anything like a unanimous report in favour of a rehearing, with the Circuit Court jurisdiction kept at £300, if the rehearing was to a single judge. The evidence was overwhelmingly in favour of two judges.  I cannot find any reference that satisfies me that anybody stuck resolutely to the idea of a rehearing by one judge only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the evidence of Mr. Price on this point. He does not say that he would prefer two to one, but he does say that he would much prefer one to the previous system.  His evidence is given on page 284, beginning with question 4259, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Coming to the question of appeals from the Circuit Court, I understand that your Council favour an appeal by way of rehearing before High Court judges?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;How many judges do you suggest?&mdash;That was discussed very fully, and there were very divided views on that subject.  Two judges, of course, are better than one, but, of course, two judges would cost the State more than one.  On the whole, we have come to the conclusion that a rehearing even by one judge who <Col N="1342" /> would have the witnesses before him would be infinitely superior to the present system and far cheaper to the litigants.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the question of cost to the State, your Council would favour two?&mdash;Yes, as two are better than one.  Occasionally some judges are not as good as others.  I was thinking over this only last night. Of all the judges I have known on the bench, there were five or six who probably were not good judges for trying cases on rehearing.  The majority of the judges were splendid. With two judges you would obviate a hurried or impatient hearing of a case, and then there has to be considered the mutual help and assistance one judge would give another from his knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Senator Brown: The judge of appeal at assizes was trying the small cases?&mdash;He was.  I think they were models in the way they tried them.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be a reason for having only one judge where the jurisdiction was limited to £50.  Do you think it might be limited to £300?&mdash;I do not know if a system could be suggested by which two judges would go to a certain town, such as Galway, and the smaller cases might be tried separately, and on special days they might be required to sit together for larger cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the Deputy says, undoubtedly the balance of opinion, not the great majority of the witnesses, was in favour of a two-judge appeal court.  I personally have already given my opinion here.  I do not think I committed myself on the point before the Committee, because I was not asked the question; but I have already stated here, and I reiterate my opinion, that I think the single judge is a better appeal tribunal than two judges for the rehearing of cases.  I think, on the whole, that two judges will be an unsatisfactory type of tribunal.  We had a two-judge tribunal under the circuit appeal system as it now exists, but I think it would be a wholly different matter to have a number of witnesses before two judges <Col N="1343" /> and have them trying to co-ordinate their views as to the impression the various witnesses made upon them and as to the questions they would like to ask.</P>
    <P>In theory, it might possibly be true to say that two heads are better than one, as I think Mr. Overend said also. He pressed very strongly in his evidence that there should be two judges.  He made that remark that Mr. Price repeats there, that two heads are better than one, and for that reason he favours two judges.  I would myself prefer a single judge as a tribunal on rehearing.  I think it would be more satisfactory and more speedy. It possibly has the fault that it might, in some cases, be too speedy.  But, from the consideration which I have given it, I am quite satisfied that a one-judge appeal court is satisfactory, and, I would be rather inclined to think, more satisfactory than two judges.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Government might have been prepared to yield to the demand of the Committee and accept the view put forward there, though it is a view which is formed on the working of the two-judge appeal court under the present system.  The Government might have been prepared to adopt that but for the obvious requirements as regards the number of judges.  As the system stands, even taking it at four circuits, if we have to send out two judges on each circuit, that will take eight judges.  It may be possible that on some circuits two judges will not be necessary; one judge may possibly be enough.  But, under the scheme as it stands, with the addition of two judges of the Supreme Court and calling on them to go on circuit, eight judges would be required to go round on circuit.  If there were to be two judges sitting together as a court of appeal, it is obvious that the volume of business to be discharged would be halved, if not more than halved.  The only way the situation can properly be met would be by an addition to the High Court judges' panel.  The Government felt that the reasons in favour of a two-judge appeal court were not sufficiently strong to <Col N="1344" /> justify them in coming to the Dáil and, in addition to adding to the Supreme Court, adding to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out, as we have pointed out in reference to other matters, that this is one of the matters which can only be solved in the working.  If it turns out that it is in the public interest that a two-judge court of appeal should be provided, I suppose the Government will have to come and ask for extra judges, or some Government may have to do that.  I am myself clearly of opinion that this will not be the reason for it. I think it will be found that in practice a single judge will be a more satisfactory tribunal than two judges. For that reason I oppose these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly in favour of the amendments moved by Deputy McGilligan.  Whatever justification could be made for the change to the new system proposed to be set up under this Bill, it can only be made if provision were contained in the Bill for the rehearing of cases from the Circuit Court judges by two High Court judges.  There is nothing so unsatisfactory, in my view, at all events, and in this apparently I differ completely and fundamentally from the Attorney-General, as an appeal from one judge to one judge.  We had experience in the old days of appeal from County Court judges to judges of assize.  You presented a case before a County Court judge who knew his work, who was experienced in his work, who knew the county in which he was working, and who gave a decision which everybody knew to be correct and respected.  You had the position that a High Court judge then came down, a couple of months afterwards, and just with a wave of his pen reversed the decision of that County Court judge&mdash;the reversal of the decision by a man who had not perhaps a tenth of the experience or knowledge, and who did not command a tenth of the respect that the judge from whom the appeal was taken commanded.  I think that is the experience of everybody. It will be the experience in future that there will be certain circuit <Col N="1345" /> judges&mdash;I do not say the whole of them, far from it&mdash;but there will be certain circuit judges who will be outstanding in their decisions, whose decisions will command respect, and whose decisions everybody will feel to be correct; and an appeal will be taken from that decision by the person who has lost the case in the hope that somebody will come down from Dublin who will not know the conditions in the country so well as the judge who decided the case, who perhaps will not have the same experience of life or the same experience of law as the judge who decided the case, and a disappointed litigant will gamble his chances on appeal, and in five cases out of ten, I believe, he will succeed in pulling it off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to elaborate on this very much.  I do not want to go very deeply into that aspect of the case. We all know, however, that certain County Court judges were vastly superior to a large number of the old High Court judges, and their decisions carried more respect.  But there was the position&mdash;that an appeal from a competent man to an incompetent man took place with the appropriate result.  I had experience myself of a case where the whole point of the case turned on the question whether or not there was a certain beam of wood between two cottages.  That was the only point in the case&mdash;whether that was there or not.  The County Court judge went out for himself and saw that it was there and decided in favour of my client; but a High Court judge came down six months afterwards from Dublin, and without seeing the cottage decided that the beam was not there.  I fail to see how anyone can say that an appeal of that kind from person (a) to person (b) is such a wonderful instance of judicial reform as to command the plaudits of the entire population of Saorstát Eireann.  I take entirely the contrary view from that, and I think there is no more unsatisfactory appeal than from one person to another person.  The only justification for an appeal is that two minds should be brought to bear on the question whether or not the person who first decided the case was correct.  One of the great advantages <Col N="1346" /> of the existing system of appeal&mdash;one of the things that gave the shorthand note system some chance of success&mdash; was the fact that there were two judges to appeal to.  I think it was the experience of everybody that, so far as that system was a success, it was a success by reason of the fact that two minds were brought to bear on the issue to be decided.  I gathered from the Minister that he would accept the view, were it not for the financial position, that two judges should be the appropriate tribunal.  Certainly the mass of the evidence before the Committee was in favour of it.  Everybody is in favour of having at least two, and if the financial position of the country does not permit at the moment of a proper system, staffed by two judges of appeal, being put into operation, then I think it is better to wait until your financial position improves and enables a proper system to be set in force in this country rather than set up the sort of thing that is going to be set up under this Bill when it is in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really amazing the unanimity that there was before this Committee.  The first two witnesses were members of the Senior Bar&mdash;Senator Lynch and Mr. Overend. There is no doubt about their view in favour of the two judges.  Then there was Dr. Quirke, a solicitor, representing the Incorporated Law Society, and he was clearly and definitely in favour of two.  There was also Mr. Ryan, who was in favour of two. Then a member of the Senior Bar was in favour of two.  After these we have what I might call the reservation cases, such as Mr. O. hUadhaigh, a Dublin solicitor, who said that he thought one would be sufficient, provided the appeal was limited to cases of £50 and under.  He held that the rehearing of cases from £50 up should not be allowed.  Then there was a solicitor whose view I forget for the moment, but it is possible that he was in favour of a single judge.  Then you had Mr. Delaney, who was in favour of two, and Judge Davitt, who was also in favour of two. Judge Davitt felt that the finding of fact should not be interfered with at all and refused to answer the question <Col N="1347" /> of whether the appeal should be taken to one or two.  Two members, representing commerce, made their appearance and they were both in favour of two.  Then another Circuit Court judge, Judge Kenny, was also in favour of two.  Then there was a member of the Bar from Cork&mdash;and on this point Cork was found to be in unison with the rest of the country for once&mdash;and he was in favour of two.  There was another solicitor&mdash;one of what I might call the reservation cases&mdash;and he might be said to be on the side of one judge.  Following him, there was a group of three&mdash;two solicitors and a registrar&mdash;in favour of the rehearing by two judges.  Then there was a district justice, and I do not know whether he expressed an opinion at all or not, but the remainder, I think, were entirely in favour of two judges, excepting that there were two, again of what I might call the reservation cases; the President of the High Court objecting, of course, to the change in the system at all, parried with the question somewhat at the beginning, but in the end said that if he were to have a rehearing he would prefer to have a colleague sitting with him; and the Attorney-General's colleague, representing the Junior Bar, who said that one judge would be right, but again he had the viewpoint that the jurisdiction should be limited to £100. Besides him, there was the solicitor from Dublin whom I have mentioned, who was in favour of one judge but who favoured the limitation of these rehearings to £50 and under.  Excepting these two, and with the possible exception of one other solicitor&mdash;I have a feeling that there was a solicitor from Limerick who expressed himself without any doubt as being in favour of the rehearing by a single judge&mdash; but excepting those I have mentioned, the others were in favour of two judges.  Even in the case of the exceptions I have mentioned, two of them in the end said that they wanted rehearing by two judges and the other two of the four were people who objected, the one to a rehearing on anything more than £50 and the other on anything more than £100.  In these cases they held that a single judge <Col N="1348" /> would do.  I think there was another case of a solicitor from Cork, but I am not sure.  With these exceptions, however, every other witness who spoke on the matter spoke definitely and clearly in favour of the rehearing by the two, and I do not think the quotation that has been given to us from Mr. Price helps very much.  I was reserving him to the end, as he has been quoted.</P>

In the end, he said that on the whole they had come to the conclusion that a rehearing even by one judge who would have the witnesses before him would be infinitely superior to the present system and far cheaper to the litigants.  He then went on to speak of peculiar and special assizes in such a town as Galway where you could have all cases above £50 tried.</P>

    <P>So there was virtual unanimity from a variety of opinion that two judges were better than one, that the two judges could deliberate, that you would have the litigants better pleased. You would have steadier judgment and a better decision in the end.  Everybody combined in the view that a rehearing was not of any great importance except it was before two <Col N="1350" /> judges.  The only people who spoke against that were the people I have mentioned, who spoke with the reservations I have given.</P>

      <P>In page 14, Section 37 (4), to delete all words from the beginning of the sub-section down to and including the word &ldquo;with,&rdquo; line 51, and in line 52 to delete the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;shall determine&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="1351" /> This is a small point, but I wonder what is the meaning of the wording.  In Section 37 (4) it is solemnly stated that the Minister for Justice shall, by order made after consultation with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, appoint the number of judges who shall travel and sit on each High Court circuit and the day and hour at which such sittings shall commence. Surely the courts might be allowed to look after their own business?</P>

      <P>That is a matter that could be conceded.  I would like to point out that it is considered an Executive act to try to arrange those things.  It has appeared in other Bills previously.  I do not see any objection to leave it to the Chief Justice, to let them settle their own procedure where and when they will sit.  I will accept the principle of the Deputy's amendment, but I may have to alter the wording.</P>

      <P>As regards Section 40, the Bill originally had three sections dealing with these matters.  We had an appeal from the Circuit Court on civil cases heard without oral evidence.  That is now in Section 40.  We then had an appeal from the Circuit Court in civil jury cases.  That has disappeared.

      <P>Amendment No. 56 is governed by amendment No. 36, I take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 36 had reference only to damages that might be given in an action where unliquidated damages might be claimed.  I move amendment No. 56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, Section 41 (1), after the word &ldquo;matter&rdquo;, line 6, to add the words &ldquo;in which a sum not exceeding £100 has been claimed or awarded&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point I am driving at here might have some relation to another amendment of Deputy Costello's on the limitation of jurisdiction from £300 to £150, but I suggest that this is somewhat different.  The section reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> An appeal shall lie from every judgment or order (other than judgments and orders in respect of which it is declared... that no appeal shall lie therefrom and judgments and orders in respect of which other provision in relation to appeals is made...</P>
    <P>My amendment sets out that after the words in line 6, &ldquo;in a civil action or matter,&rdquo; the following words shall be added, &ldquo;in which a sum not exceeding £100 has been claimed or awarded.&rdquo; In other words, I want to limit the appeal to matters only in which the claim or the award has been £100.  I am getting at what the evidence put before the Joint Committee aimed at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I read it the other way.  I thought the Deputy wanted to abolish the right of appeal in the larger cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am stating.  If a sum exceeding £100 has been claimed or awarded, then there is no appeal.  The body of evidence given before the Committee was in favour of this, giving what was called the old right of appeal, which was in relation to £50.  It was accepted by a lot of the people appearing before the Committee that £50 then would be represented by £100 now, taking the present value of money into account. A lot of those who professed to be in favour of a rehearing limited themselves to a rehearing as of the old type.  In other words, I accept evidence of people who went before the Committee rather than what the Committee recommended.  A point was made on the last day by Deputy Lavery that going back to the old appeal in this connection was a misuse of words.  There was no old appeal except in relation to £50 which was equated to £100 now.  There never was an appeal on fact in cases above the £50 mark; there was no other case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how it could be when you give a jurisdiction <Col N="1355" /> to the circuit judge of £300.  You would give an appeal where the award reached £100, but no appeal where the award was between £100 and £300.  I cannot see the reason for that.  Why should a person who gets an award of £100 have the right of appeal and no appeal beyond £100 and not exceeding £300?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister say that beyond £100 you will not get an appeal to the Appeal Court? The Minister is getting logical.  He says if you are committed to the fact that there is good reason for giving an appeal in an award of £100 why make a difference between £100 and upwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>You are giving an appeal on circuit jurisdiction.  Why split up what the Circuit Court may award?  Why give people who get £100 award a right of appeal and deprive people of that right who get a bigger sum, £299 for instance? There is an appeal by way of rehearing in all cases that come within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I do not see why we should differentiate between the £100 and the £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the only point on which a case for rehearing was made, was that people got used to it and that they wanted the old system back.  There was a general appeal under the old system up to £50. They were not tried by a judge in the first instance, but by an assistant barrister.  The view was taken that it was only right to give one judicial hearing.  There never was in this country an appeal by way of rehearing except in cases up to £50.  Why give it now?  If you are giving it now why split up the £300?  Why should not the big litigant have the right to have his case on fact reheard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment the Deputy proposes to deprive a man of any sort of appeal if the sum is between £100 and £300.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can amend that. Will you accept the idea that all judges going on circuit only take the <Col N="1356" /> old civil bill equated to £100?  It is the easiest thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that. What the Deputy is talking about is the time when the jurisdiction of the County Court was £50, and he equates that to a figure of the present time. Later, the Government here fixed the jurisdiction at £300.  That was not done by a system of equation; it was not by any method of equation of £50, It was simply the jurisdiction of the court.  Similarly, here in the 1924 Act the jurisdiction was increased to £300. If you change the system, why should not the £300 and over apply?  When the jurisdiction was given to the Circuit Court up to £300 as against £50 in every case, why not an appeal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave that phraseology as it is, and let us apply ourselves to the £100 and £300 cases. You have to think of two things together&mdash;the increased jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the right to appeal.  If there was an increased jurisdiction to £300 there was no appeal on questions of fact; it was only given in questions of law.  You are not going to give an appeal and rehearing in reference to £300.  That is a complete innovation.  We want a limit.  I would like to go back to the £50.  I think we could take in that nominal sum or what it represents. The evidence given before the Committee was that members of the Committee spoke of £50 and used it in a sense that in present-day money it would equate £100.  They had the view put to them and fortified by argument for rehearing, in fact, what used to happen in the old days.  Man after man said that the old civil bill rehearing was only £50 jurisdiction.  All the evidence, except that of persons who wanted the appeal increased in amount was: go back to what used to be.  I admit it is awkward to split the Circuit Court jurisdiction.  The only argument used was by people who wanted to get back; they had not got used to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the present Circuit Court jurisdiction, they did recommend that appeals not exceeding £100 should be heard by one judge, and over that by two judges. They did not interfere with appeals so far as the Circuit Court judge is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to return to the old system and say the old system was such and such?  What the witnesses obviously meant was to substitute for the present system of appeal the old system, retaining the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, because the Committee recommended that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be retained at its present figure.  I think I am correct in saying that the witnesses who spoke of a return to the old system of appeal did not at all carry in their minds or intend to convey that they only wanted the restoration of the old system exactly as it was with the limitation of £50 or £100 in the Circuit Court.  It is hard to treat this amendment seriously, because I do not think the Deputy really means to deprive of an appeal the persons who obtain decrees above £100 and under £300.  He says, of course, that he is prepared to consider some way of providing a form of appeal analogous to the appeal from the High Court as it stands at present.</P>
      <P>He must remember that in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, there was this new right given to parties who had claims over £100 and under £300 of an appeal on fact, even though it was to be on the stenographer's note, and in Section 61 it was provided that the appeal court could send to the Supreme Court for a further review in cases which they considered involved a question of law or fact of such importance as to justify them in doing so.  You there had a new form of appeal given to the persons whose claim was above the old County Court jurisdiction, measured at £50 or its equivalent, and under £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> There is a new appeal given on fact, and a right to go to the Supreme Court on fact.  It is not as easy to apply a logical rule as the Deputy seems to suggest.  His argument is subtle and ingenious, and I think is more intended to try to impale the Minister on the horns of a dilemma than really to achieve any practical result.  I agree with the very last remark he made, and that is that you cannot split the Circuit Court jurisdiction; you cannot deprive litigants who obtain decrees above £100 of a right to appeal without approximating the procedure in the Circuit Court to the present High Court procedure. One of the reasons why it is claimed that there is no case for giving an appeal on fact from a High Court judge to the Supreme Court is the elaborate precautions which have to be taken by litigants to have their cases properly presented&mdash;the elaborate machinery of pleadings, the assistance available to them of skilled and experienced counsel in preparing their cases for court, and the direction of proofs, which is a feature of a High Court action where a considerable amount is involved, and where expenses can be easily borne.  It is reasonable enough I think to say that where there is all that preliminary preparation of the case&mdash;the examination of it from the legal aspect to see what points of law might arise on it, the fact that counsel are there available, that the library is at their disposal, and that they can safeguard themselves against any fatality in the hearing of the case&mdash;it justifies the legislature in saying to a man &ldquo;When you go to the High Court and have your trial before the High Court judge you are not going to be allowed a rehearing on fact.&rdquo;  It is different when it comes to the Circuit Court cases, where all the things I have just mentioned are absent, and where this form of appeal&mdash;the old form of appeal which we are now introducing here&mdash; is justifiable.  The reasoning which justifies it, I think, in respect of £100 and £50 cases is equally applicable to cases above £100 and under £300. Apart from the practical difficulties which arise in discriminating between cases which involve more than £100 <Col N="1359" /> and those which are less than £100, I think every other reason justifies us in leaving the position as it is under the Bill, and leaving to all the litigants in the Circuit Court the same form of appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those last remarks are an able argument in favour of reducing the Circuit Court jurisdiction and nothing more.  All that the Attorney-General has now said is this: There are certain cases above £300. They are important cases.  We are just measuring them in a rough and ready way by the amount.  They are important cases.  You want to have a good detailed system of pleadings, interrogatories and all the rest; you want to have counsel there available, and you want to have law library facilities.  We take the arbitrary decision that the £300 and upward cases are cases that should be dealt with at one hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that £300 and upward case, having all the facilities, there is no appeal except a new trial motion.  Then we turn around and say with regard to the £300 case we think it is good for them to have a first run, without having the law library facilities, or a judge of the particular calibre, and so on.  Then we say again: &ldquo;Having, unfortunately, made that decision, we are going to have a rehearing.  We will send down judges, and we hope that the Bar will follow, carrying as much as possible of the law library with them in their heads.&rdquo;  I do not see why you should make the differentiation point at £300.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General has raised it here, and I think has made a magnificent argument for changing the jurisdiction point, because there apparently is a feeling that the £300 case, the £200 case or the £150 case is too important to have it disposed of by the Circuit Court judge, with the Circuit Court group of counsel, and with the absence of law library facilities.  We think it is <Col N="1360" /> too important a case to have it disposed of in that way, and we are going to have this double procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have decided against it; logic has departed from you at that point.  In regard to the people who gave evidence in favour of this rehearing&mdash;I really think that this can be stood over in regard to every witness who appeared after the Chief Justice; of course he gave evidence late in the hearing, and it is rather a limited number to talk about then, but after even about the fifth or sixth witness I think what I am about to say is quite true&mdash;once the argument began to be made: &ldquo;No other country has this rehearing; England has not got it; England only tried it here; there was this trying it on the dog business.  No other country wants it.  There is nothing that you can get from your reason which makes you decide that there should be a revision of witnesses on the second hearing in regard to one type of case and not in regard to another&rdquo; there was only one way in which it could be met, and the phrase with which it was met runs through this report:  &ldquo;It used to be the system and the people want it.&rdquo;  Then you have got to examine what used to be the system.  Of course historical matters have to be gone into.  It was not an appeal, because there never was a first trial.  What is considered an appeal is really the first judicial hearing.  At any rate it had to do with those minor matters of the £50 and under cases, and I think the appeal now going to be granted by way of rehearing should only have relation to very much the same matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for the point of view that once you have fact ascertained&mdash;and it can <Col N="1361" /> only be ascertained by the man who sees the witnesses&mdash;you should stop with fact, and there should not be any appeal anywhere on a question of fact.  Very few countries have it and the only way in which people can make any case for having it now is to say, &ldquo;We were unfortunately brought up to it, no matter how it arose; give us back what we once had.&rdquo;  I want to give back what we once had and to limit it strictly and narrowly to what we once had.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider the desirability of himself introducing an amendment to secure what was aimed at in this amendment which has been ruled out of order?  After all, I understand that the Committee reported in favour of having the stenographers' notes, and I suggest that the Minister in this case should himself meet the wishes of the Committee and bring about what is in itself a very desirable amendment of the Bill.  However, I rose chiefly to deal with the question of appeals. Speaking purely as a layman, I would be anxious to limit the appeals as much as possible, but I gather from listening to the discussion that, for the sake of what the Attorney-General called logic, and what Deputy McGilligan says is the opposite of logic, they have actually extended the right of appeal.  In fact, an appeal is now being given in cases of fact in which it used not be given before.</P>
      <P>I suggest that as far as possible the Minister should try to limit within what he thinks is the scope and purpose of the Bill, the power of appeal. I make a suggestion for his consideration between now and the next stage. Suppose there is a case being tried by a jury before the Circuit Court and that there is a disagreement of the jury.  In that case I suggest that the case be dropped unless either party applies that it be heard before the High Court&mdash;that, in fact, a disagreement of the jury for the purpose of appeal be regarded as a decision; that the next trial of that case be heard before the High Court; and treated, the step being taken by either party, as an appeal by both parties.  So, instead of having a possible hearing three times&mdash;in the first case a disagreement, in the second a decision in the Circuit Court, and then, an appeal to the High Court&mdash;you limit it, and merely having had a disagreement, the next step to be not a rehearing in the Circuit Court, but an appeal to the High Court straight away.  I do not see that in itself that is at all impossible.  It will at least limit the expense of and objection to one of the hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be anxious to limit the question of appeal, but, looking at it not from the professional point of view but <Col N="1363" /> from the layman's point of view, I think the main thing to get is a definite decision one way or another.  I do not care what court gives that.  If a man has sufficient knowledge to deal with a certain type of case, a District Court judge can give a final decision as well as the Supreme Court.  So can the Circuit Court judge in this particular type of case, so that I am personally opposed to anything in the nature of appeal.  Despite the Attorney-General's scepticism about the spread of perjury, I think it will lead inevitably to perjury. I would ask the Attorney-General how many places there are in which owing to its prevalence, perjury is a reserved sin.  There is perjury and many practitioners have told me that they do not know their case themselves until they go into court and hear the case put up, even by their own client. I think that ought to be limited by every possible method.</P>
    <P>I see only one ground for appeal on fact, and that is the crankiness or worse of the particular person who happens to be trying the case.  It might be useful to try to hold the whip of an appeal over a peculiar character like that, but, taking the whole of the judges&mdash;be they district justices, Circuit Court judges or others&mdash;I think that appeal in itself is objectionable. It may be necessary, in a few individual cases, to hold the whip of an appeal over them, but, beyond that, candidly I do not see the necessity for an appeal.  I think it is much better that there should be a definite decision given.  It may not be scientifically the best decision, and if you went to the High Court with the smallest case, and then to the Supreme Court, you might get a theoretically better decision, but in practice it is better to limit these things, because a definite decision one way or another is much better than to have this continual appealing from one court to the other.  I understand that the Government has in certain cases rejected that argument.  They say it is necessary to have appeals.  I am sorry they take that view, but I make my suggestion as limiting that particular evil in one set of cases, and I suggest that between now and the next stage, <Col N="1364" /> the Minister should consider whether it is a practical suggestion or not.</P>
    <P>At the moment, it may seem peculiar that you should appeal where no decision has been given, but that is a purely verbal objection.  In essence, I see no objection to it, and I should like to get full consideration for it.  Looking at it from a layman's point of view, what is wanted is a decision.  It is much better that the people should get into the habit of accepting a decision.  I will admit quite readily that for a long time they got into the bad habit of not accepting a decision. Very often, they got into the bad habit of not even stating their case to their own solicitor, and very often the solicitor did not know the case until he heard both sides in court where, frequently, he heard his own side for the first time.  It is better that they should get out of that habit.  It is one they probably do not wish to get out of, but, in the long run, it is in the interests of the administration of justice in the country to limit appeals and to have a definite decision and to let it stay there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is to me a novel one, but I do not suppose it would be rejected on that ground.  Under the 1924 Act, in cases tried by a judge and jury, there was an appeal by way of notice of motion for a new trial.  Under the system contained in this Bill the verdict of a jury will carry no more weight than the decision of a judge on an appeal. I suppose it may be admitted that that will have the effect of reducing the number of jury cases in the Circuit Court.  It has been found to be the case, in some areas, that parties hold up the business in the Circuit Courts by asking for a jury.  That applies particularly here in Dublin.  Strong representations have been made to us on that head: that, if possible, something should be done to prevent the hold-up of the civil list in the Circuit Courts by persons who, thinking that they would fare better before a jury, serve notice of motion for a trial by a jury.  However, that is by the way, but it does, I think, to some extent meet the Deputy's point and that it is very unlikely that trials by jury will become popular in the Circuit Courts <Col N="1365" /> and that where there is disagreement before a jury it is likely that the parties concerned will try to take an appeal to a judge without a jury on the next occasion.</P>

      <P>I see the Deputy's point.  It has just occurred to me that there is a provision in the present Act with reference to appeals in civil cases&mdash;Section 61&mdash;that where there is an appeal and two judges differ and that the judge in the court below was affirmed, then either party can go to the Supreme Court.  The Deputy's idea is that where a jury disagree, then either party can take an appeal.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General will admit, I think, that the first portion of his argument had nothing to do with my case.  I was dealing with the case that went before a jury in which there was disagreement. It is bad enough to have two trials on that, and what I want to avoid is having a third trial.  Perhaps the Attorney-General will look into that between now and Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself, I want to say that when discussing the whole matter of appeals there can be no argument as to its being the old system.  It was not the old system.  The full history of what was the old system is set out in the evidence of the Registrar for County Cork.  It is given on page 216 of the Report.  Stating the position in a brief way, there used to be what he called paper petitions tried before a judge of Assize, and that afterwards the judge of Assize was taken off to do merely criminal work.  The civil jurisdiction that he had, which previously was for sums under £20, <Col N="1366" /> was vested in an assistant barrister, who first came into being under an old Act, and the £20 was later increased to £50.  It is there we get the civil bill jurisdiction.  What was called an appeal was, in fact, not an appeal. This assistant barrister had a summary procedure for determining debts under £20 originally and eventually increased to £50.  Then the view was taken that there ought to be at least one judicial hearing.  There was what was called an appeal.  It was really a first judicial taking of that case.  In face of that, we are asked to substitute the whole panoply of the Circuit Court going solemnly through the business of hearing cases up to £300, and when it is all over, in fact before it is all over, you give this notice to every witness who appeared on behalf of every litigant in the court: &ldquo;Remember you need not put your best case forward at this moment; we will have another chance at this.&rdquo;  It can even be put to the man who is not ill-disposed towards perjury: &ldquo;You can do a great deal better the next time; try out your best this time, but remember that there will be another opportunity when you have heard the other man's case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to have that paraded now as a new judicial system to allow these £300 cases to be taken.  Every one of them can be taken on an appeal before a single judge.  My amendment dealing with the stenographer's notes has been ruled out of order.  I want to stress the point that under the suasion of a very able member of the Committee, the Committee itself started with the viewpoint that the present system, which we are departing from, was unsound.  The Committee started with that as their mental attitude towards the whole system, but by degrees, when witness after witness came before them and objected to the £300 rehearing on fact because of the amount of perjury it was going to lead to, the Committee were swayed by all that and made up their minds to rule out the system at present in operation because of the expense, but to keep the stenographer's notes.  Their opinion was that while that would mean a great burden of expense they voted for it because it was the only way to <Col N="1367" /> prevent perjury.  It would give counsei the opportunity of breaking down witnesses ready to commit perjury.  If the Committee did report in favour of going back to the old system, as it was miscalled, and if they reported in favour of giving an appeal on fact, with the consequences that were likely to follow from that, they put in the definite provision, contrary to their ideas of economy, that the only way to prevent perjury was by the retention of the stenographer's notes. Now we are to have this new system, unheard of in our history, with no argument to back it except of the vaguest kind.  There is nothing in the way of logic to recommend it.  The big argument, and the main retreat for those in favour of rehearing, is that people will get used to it, and that we had better give it to them. On that argument we are going to give them something that they never sought and for which there does not appear to be any great desire.  Despite the best efforts of the Committee, we are doing it in a way that will enhance the value of perjury in the courts.</P>
    <P>Economy is looked to in this part of the Bill and disregarded in other parts.  In the case of the appointment of judges, economy goes by the board, but in the matter of charges to litigants, by way of court fees, economy steps in and we are going to have court fees raised.  In the matter of having two judges sitting, economy again steps into the forefront and we are told that we cannot have them, and even in the very important matter of stopping the growth of perjury, not at all to put it down but to stop an increase in perjury in the country, we are still swayed by economy considerations and will not have the notes.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the Attorney-General would have said something beyond merely the appeal that I made to him in the particular case that I put forward when stating the general arguments against appeals.  I was under the impression, watching the Attorney-General closely, that mentally he was in full agreement with me.  He continued to nod, but perhaps that was only the nervous affection which my <Col N="1368" /> eloquence produced on him.  At any rate, I got the impression that he did not like an extension of the system of appeal that we have.  I would ask him to bear in mind that under the new system he is putting a premium on the growth of perjury. Will he say if he was serious in what I understand he stated here on a former occasion, that he did not think perjury was so prevalent.</P>

      <P>But, generally speaking, I think the Attorney-General was rather taken by a suggestion made by the Chief Justice.  I am not pretending now to quote the Chief Justice in this, but I think the idea was promulgated that a witness should not be sworn in court at the beginning; that the only time you should put a witness on oath was when, in the course of a case, you suddenly thought that he had reached the point that he was either laying or going to lie.  Then you proposed to him the solemnity of the oath. I think I have heard the Attorney-General to say that it was better not to have people sworn because you then had a better chance of catching them out.</P>
