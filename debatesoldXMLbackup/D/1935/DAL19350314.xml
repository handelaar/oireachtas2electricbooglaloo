      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he was warned by Mr. James Victory, T.D., that violent action and the use of firearms were likely to result from the activities of the Edgeworthstown Town Tenants' Association and the Irish Republican Army; and, if so, if he will state what action was taken in consequence of such warning.</P>

      <P>Before replying I must protest emphatically against being asked a question which shows a regrettable disregard for the public interest on the part of the Deputy responsible for it.  If such a warning as the Deputy suggests had been received from a member of this House it would obviously be entirely wrong on my part to reveal the fact and the name of the Deputy who gave the warning.  Deputies and all other citizens who in their anxiety for the public peace give information to the Government are entitled to expect that the Government will not allow the right of Parliamentary questions to be so abused as to result in a breach of confidence.</P>
      <P>Having said this, I shall reply to the question and inform the Deputy that no such warning was received from Deputy Victory or from any other member of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I want it to be clearly understood that the fact of my replying to this question is not to be taken as a precedent, and that I shall refuse any reply whatever if a similar question is addressed to me in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that Mr. G. More O'Ferrall has made a written denial of the statement that he informed members of the Gárda Síochána that he did not want police around his house, and whether the Minister will state by whom such protection is alleged to have been offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this same question in the course of last night's debate on the Supplementary Estimates in respect of the Gárda Síochána Vote, I quoted an extract from a police report dated the 2nd March in order that the House might know the source and nature of the information upon which the President based the statements which he made here in this connection in the course of the Adjournment Debate on March 7th. To this I need add nothing except to say that the police had reported to the Department of Justice in exactly the same sense, so far back as the 19th November, at a time when even Deputy MacDermot will acquit them of any desire or, at any rate, of any motive for distorting the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a trade dispute exists between the firm of Messrs. Henderson and Eadie, woollen manufacturers, Collooney, Co. Sligo, and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union of which the employees are members; that the employees are now on strike, and whether steps were taken by his Department to arrange a conference between the parties to the dispute, and, if so, with what result; and further if he will take steps to see that any Government contracts already placed with the firm are suspended pending investigation.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a trade dispute exists between the firm of Messrs. Henderson and Eadie, woollen manufacturers, Collooney, County <Col N="847" /> Sligo, and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and I am aware that the employees have been on strike for a considerable time.  My Department has invited both parties to a joint conference to be presided over by an official of the Department, but one of the parties refuses to come to such a conference.  No Government contracts for material are held by this firm.</P>

      <P>Classification of the number of persons on the registers of the employment exchanges and branch employment offices according to &ldquo;occupations&rdquo; would involve the setting out of figures for each of 576 separate occupations.  A statement has been prepared on the basis of &ldquo;employments,&rdquo; i.e., the industry or service in which the person on the register was last employed, in respect of the 21st January, 1935, and will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention has been directed to the fact that the Government agent for shipments of eggs to Germany is stipulating with exporters that they should offer nothing for the German market except selected and extra selected eggs, and does he realise that in the event of this continuing, an unduly high proportion of medium and trade eggs will be sent to the British market, with serious and undesirable consequences for our egg trade in that centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that egg exporters have been asked to quote only for selected and extra selected eggs for export to Germany at present; but there is nothing to prevent the export of medium grade eggs to Germany during the greater portion of the year.  In fact 22 per cent. of the total shipment of eggs to Germany in February consisted of medium grade eggs.  As the Deputy is aware, the grades have reference to classification by weight, and the eggs in all these grades are of first quality.  It is not anticipated that over the year as a whole there will be any appreciable change in the proportions of the different grades exported to the British market.  In these circumstances, I do not consider that consequences such as the Deputy refers to are likely to result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the House to understand that, consequent upon a trade agreement with the German Reich to exchange goods with this country in certain proportions, that agreement is now being amended by the German Government by way of qualification of the classes of goods that they are prepared to accept?  Is the Minister not aware that a general agreement was entered into with the German Government that they should take eggs?  Is he of opinion that that agreement is being honoured in the letter or in the spirit if it is to be further amended to mean that the German Government will accept only certain classes of eggs, and is that in accordance with the terms of the trade agreement made by the Government with the German Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that it is a legitimate or desirable agreement that to the German market we should send nothing but the two top grades of eggs and to the British market, which takes 95 per cent. of our total egg exports, we should send the leavings, after the German market has been supplied with the best we have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy listen to my reply or had he the supplementary question prepared before he heard it? I think he had.  I pointed out that the British market is able to get as good eggs as ever it got, and if the Deputy had any desire to help the egg trade he would not raise such a question here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that at this period of the year we are beholden to any country which will take our eggs when there is a great surplus, and that at the present moment it is a vital matter to egg exporters in this country that we should treat those persons who take our eggs at all times of the year with the same consideration that we expect from these people in times of difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister imagine that, if we withhold from them the high quality eggs and give them to somebody else at this period, they will treat us with the same leniency and trade consideration that we habitually get from them in difficult times when it is hard to dispose of our surplus eggs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite well aware that the British market is being supplied with as good eggs as ever it was supplied with.  We are sending some to Germany because Great Britain has put on a quota.  There is no question of any lower grade eggs going to Great Britain.  If the Deputy wants to make political capital out of a point such as that, against the interests of the country, he is quite welcome to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that I have suggested that the quality of eggs being sent to Great Britain at present is inferior.  No such suggestion is implicit in my question. I have pointed out that eggs are graded in this country, not only in regard to quality but in regard to uniformity and size, and the choice qualities are those of the larger size. These are now being shipped to Germany to the exclusion of those of the smaller size, which are usually more difficult to dispose of.  My question to the Minister is: is it with his approval that his agents for the German market are collaring all the big eggs for the German market and sending the small ones to Great Britain?  The Minister knows that that is the pith of my question and that there is no reflection on the quality.</P>

      <P>Not in the slightest.  I am aware that I kept well within the bounds of order last evening and it would not strike me that the remarks of the Chair had any personal reference whatever. Personally, I had no intention of discussing that particular point as to whether the instrument on which the Government propose to operate is an Act, or whether a certain section is or is not <i>ultra vires.</i>  That has nothing to do with anything I have to say.  I do suggest, however, that there are other methods open to the Government of collecting the arrears of land annuities.  There is a choice that the Government could make as to the method they should adopt.  I think that I am within my rights in discussing whether or not this is the proper method.</P>
      <P>There are other methods of collecting the land annuities besides that given to the Government in Section 28 of the Act of 1933.  My argument is that in the present conditions the Government ought not to exercise their discretion to use Section 28 of that Land Act; but, if they have recourse to any measures to recover annuities, they should have recourse to the other methods.  These other methods of collecting the land annuities have not been repealed. Not merely have they not been repealed, but the particular section to which reference is made here distinctly states that any power given to the Land Commission under this section is not in abrogation of the powers they already have.  My contention is that in the present conditions they should not use the additional powers given in Section 28. Indeed, I hold they should not use any powers to collect at all, but if they are determined to use any of these measures they should use the other powers.  I submit that I am fully within the rules of order in debating that particular question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From interruptions we heard last evening, I gather that the Government are taking up the line that the farmers are able to pay.  If that is the real belief of the Government, why do they not use the other method that is <Col N="862" /> open to them?  If they believe that the farmers are able to pay, why do they not let the cases come before the Courts in the ordinary way, so that the annuitant may put forward a case that he is not in a position to pay, and that he should not be asked to pay at the particular moment? The Government have deliberately deprived him of the opportunity of doing that.  The Government should exercise their discretion.  There are two types of discretion that the Government could exercise in this particular matter.  On the one hand they could utilise, if they were determined to proceed at all, other methods which they have at their disposal and other means which were not repealed by the Land Act of 1933.  They could give an annuitant an opportunity of putting up the case that at the moment he is not in a position to pay and that he should not be asked to pay.  Secondly, they could exercise their discretion that in the present condition of affairs they should not pursue any powers of so called collection.</P>
    <P>We are voting money to enable the Government to carry out a collection of land annuities.  I hold that on two grounds the House should not vote that money&mdash;firstly, because, in present conditions, the Government ought not to drive the country to despair in their effort to collect these annuities, and secondly, if they think there are cases where these men can pay, they should at least give an opportunity to the ordinary farmer of putting up his case, or should at least afford an opportunity of a stay being put on the proceedings.  The Government as an act of administration is determined to choose one course rather than the other or rather than no course at all.  I think the proper course in present conditions is to forbear collection of these annuities. If the Government is determined to break, not the big farmer, but the independence of the farmers generally in this country I can see no better method they could adopt than the method they are adopting at the present.  I am not referring to big farmers.  First of all, there <Col N="863" /> is hardly any such thing as a big farmer in my own constituency.  When I speak of independent farmers, I am referring quite as much to the ordinary small farmer who has a little holding in the valleys or the mountainsides of Kerry as I am to the farmer with, say, fifty acres of rich land.</P>
    <P>Ministers interrupted several times and they spoke of these people having deposit receipts.  That apparently is the excuse for the proceedings&mdash;because an unfortunate farmer here and there had been thrifty enough to put by a few pounds during the prosperous years before the Government took over what the Minister for Industry and Commerce humorously describes as the reorganisation of the industry.  In the fortunate years before the Government took over that particular reorganisation, undoubtedly there were a number of very small farmers in the country, who had been able to put by a few pounds. Now, under this proceedure, we are apparently to pass money to enable the Government to strip these unfortunate men of every penny they have been able to put by as the result of their hard work in the past.  That method is wrong and that object is wrong and for that reason I strongly hold that the House should not pass this particular Vote, and that it should give voice to its condemnation of the administrative methods of the Government in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The Government have had an opportunity to realise the conditions but they have failed to do so.  Without any chance of defending himself, an unfortunate man whose industry has been reduced to beggary by the policy of the Government is to have Government agents sent in upon him and, in addition, he is to be saddled with costs.  I am not going into the question of the legality of that particular matter but one of the matters which I gathered from the reply of the Minister last night was that part of this Vote is connected with costs upon warrants, or what were called <Col N="864" /> Court Orders.  I understand he means warrants.  That is what we are asked to approve of at the present time, additional costs.  The Minister may say that if they had recourse to the courts, it would involve more costs but, at any rate, in that case the individual would have the choice of paying up, or, if he thought he had a case, of going before the justice. The justice, even if he had to give a decision against the unfortunate annuitant, might give him a very long time during which payment might be made.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to my native county in this Vote.  Last night the Minister for Finance interrupted, as if the only people that were affected by this liability to pay were rich people.  That is not so.  The Minister in introducing this Estimate gave absolutely no indication of the number of warrants that are in the hands either of the sheriffs or of the registrars at the present moment. Surely that was relevant information so far as this Vote is concerned.  How did the Minister arrive at the Appropriation-in-Aid?  He must have had some idea of the number of warrants that are in the hands of registrars and of the sheriffs at the present moment.  I hold that that was pertinent information, extremely relevant to this question, which the Minister should have given us and which he refrained from giving.  Are there 50,000 or 100,000?  How many warrants are expected to be in the hands of the registrars and sheriffs?</P>
    <P>If there is such a large number as 50,000 or 100,000 is the suggestion that these persons are made up of the so-called rich farmers, if there are any left in the country, or even of the moderately rich farmers?  It is quite obvious that they embrace the very poorest farmers living in the poorest land in the country.  How can they be expected to meet the demand which the Minister is pressing upon them and which the House is now asked to give him power to press upon them?  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, last week, made it quite clear that there is a very <Col N="865" /> numerous class of farmers in Kerry, not the rich farmers with 100 or 200 acres each&mdash;they do not exist there&mdash; but the mountainside farmers.  He said their land could produce nothing else except a certain type of cattle, the small Kerry cattle.  He admits that there is no price for these at the present time.  Yet that is the whole industry of these people.  The Minister bought a few Kerry cattle at 22/- per cwt. and sold them at 12/-. He deliberately did that in a few cases as an experiment merely to see whether there was any hope of saving these unfortunate people.  Yet we are asked to give complete power into the hands of the Minister and his officials to issue warrants against these people and other people like them.</P>
    <P>The House ought to be very slow to do anything of the kind, they ought to have no hesitation in refusing to do anything of the kind, because, what is to be the attitude of that particular little farmer in Kerry when he is faced with the necessity of paying these annuities?  Admittedly, his industry has been destroyed.  Admittedly, all that he can hope for is a chance that a certain experiment of the Minister's may succeed and that the Minister in future may be good enough to give him 22/- per cwt. for an odd beast and sell it to a meat factory at 12/-.  In other words, he will have to subsidise them because the industry has been made permanently uneconomic. No hope has this man when he is faced with this warrant.  Not merely is the present bad, but the serious thing is that there is no hope for the future.  And, if a few of these very hard-working and thrifty people have been able to put by a pound or two in the past, they should not be made liable to the sneers of the Minister for Finance because some of them happen to have deposit receipts. Many a farmer has had deposit receipts. There are farmers all over the country who have deposit receipts.  If a farmer has a deposit receipt, he got it by hard work.  If he has a deposit receipt, it is because he was able to get a few pounds together when times <Col N="866" /> were better and at a time before the famous reorganisation of farming by the Government was undertaken.</P>
    <P>What are that farmer's prospects at the present moment?  He sees that money, that he has put aside pound by pound, simply being taken away and swept away from him by the Government. Mind you, it is not merely that this year he will have to pay out and make good losses which his industry can no longer bear&mdash;losses which the Minister admits the industry will no longer bear&mdash;but next year he is faced with the prospect of having to do the same, and that year after year he will have to do the same until the little savings he has put by for his family have all vanished, and then, when they have vanished, still no improvement in sight.  The Minister admits, in these particular cases, that the land is fit for nothing else.  That is what the House is asked to vote for.  That is why the House is asked to pass this Supplementary Estimate.  I submit, Sir, that the House should oppose it very strongly.  The serious thing is not that the farmers may be going to do something illegal&mdash;that is bad&mdash;but a much more likely prospect is that the farmer will lose all hope whatsoever. I do not mean that he will be driven to desperation in the sense of desperate action but that he will be driven to despair in a sense that will undermine any effort on his part and make any effort impossible.  I have noticed that despair growing owing to the action of the Government; and it is the time when that despair is growing, when the farmer is resentful, if you like, and silently grumbling, but mainly overcome by the spirit of despair, that he is caught in this thing and cannot escape from it.  It is at a time like this that the Government chooses to exercise these powers.  This is a gross abuse of the power the State has.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware that if the Government set out to break the independence of the farmers of this country, they can do it.  Other Governments have done it and this Government, apparently, are bent on doing it.  But you need expect no great future for <Col N="867" /> the country if you do it.  If you destroy the whole morale of the farming community in this country, you cannot expect that any of the industries you set up in the towns will compensate for the damage and the wrong you are now doing.  I shall ask the House, therefore, Sir, on two definite grounds to refuse to vote this particular grant to the Ministry; on the ground, chiefly, that at the present moment the Government are, practically speaking, delivering the last mortal blow to the principal industry in this country. It may seem to the Minister for Finance that a couple of pounds, or ten pounds, of a land annuity is very small.  That may be his view.  He may come in here and sneer at the farmers who take a different view, as he did last night, and as he does constantly in this House when questions of that kind arise; but any person who knows the country knows perfectly well the way in which the farmer looks upon parting with money of that kind, especially at a time of crisis.  He will regard it as an absolute proof that the Government is determined to sacrifice him, that it does not care what steps it takes so long as it secures that, and that nothing he can do will save him.  In fact, blank despair is the only emotion he is liable to feel in the present circumstances.  I suggest that, from the point of view of the country, that is about one of the worst things that could happen.  For that reason I think the House ought to impress on the Government that it ought not to use, in the present circumstances, these powers of collecting land annuities, either by the method here referred to &mdash;Section 28, I think, of the Land Act of 1933&mdash;or by any other method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mentioned it, Sir, in the course of concluding, in order to show that there were other methods.  There are other methods which will at least give an opportunity to the annuitant, if he has a case on economic grounds of not being able to pay, of putting that case forward.  Let the case be tried, not by the Minister, not by the officials of the Land Commission, whose business, apparently, it is to get in or to do what they call collecting the land annuities, but by somebody who can hear the case put on both sides, if there is a case to be put up by the Land Commission.  On these two grounds I urge, Sir, that the House should not pass this particular Estimate.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances there would not be very much opposition to this particular Vote. People, generally, are not unwilling to subscribe any costs required for upholding the services necessary for the maintenance of law and order, and of courts in general in this State.  What we object to in this particular Estimate is that there is an unnecessary expansion of expenditure, mainly brought about by including in this Estimate costs for proceedings&mdash; or work, whichever way you like to put it&mdash;taken against members of the agricultural community, and proceedings which, one might say, do not even properly come under the head of Circuit Court expenditure.  Normally the people were willing to pay, if brought before courts which dealt with criminal cases or with financial liabilities, knowing that before these courts they would get a fair hearing, that the pros and cons would be carefully examined, and justice meted out in a perfectly fair manner.  Under this Estimate we are asked to pass £3,000 for temporary assistants and extra court messengers. We object to that.</P>

      <P>I submit that a discussion as to the execution of a warrant under Section 28 of the Land <Col N="869" /> Act is irrelevant and out of order on this Vote, for this reason, that the county registrar has no discretion whatever in the matter.  The moving party in connection with the issue or execution of a warrant is the Land Commission.  When the Land Commission decide, under the section, to adopt this procedure for the recovery of the arrears of annuities, they are entitled to issue these warrants to the county registrars.  When a county registrar receives a warrant he must execute it.  A county registrar or any official connected with the courts has no discretion whatsoever.</P>

I suggest that if this House passes this Estimate it expresses approval of this method while another method is open to the Land Commission.  Unless the House can discuss whether this Estimate should be passed or not, I suggest that the debate should be allowed to continue on the lines I have indicated, namely, that the Government having a choice deliberately made its choice. If that choice had not been made country registrars would not be in the position of having to act as they are acting.  They have to act&mdash;they are compelled to act, because of the action of the Government.  I suggest that the Government cannot get out of it by shifting the responsibility to the county registrars.</P>

      <P>Some confusion has arisen apparently in the minds of certain Deputies regarding this Estimate.  This Estimate is statutory. The money is required for administering Section 28 of the Land <Col N="870" /> Act.  If I may say so, Deputy O'Sullivan argued the matter very adroitly, but the section is not open to criticism in the House.  It was stated, yesterday, that the particular section met with much opposition when it was going through.  Deputies should realise that once a Bill is enacted it is an Act of the Oireachtas.  Deputies are limited to a discussion of the administration of the section or of the Act.</P>

I am not suggesting that we can discuss the section, its validity, or anything of that kind.  Obviously that cannot be done, as you, Sir, very properly ruled.  But surely we can discuss the other method that is still in the hands of the Government, which deliberately it has not adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General intervened practically before I had said anything.  If the Chair had not ruled me out, I thought I would be entitled to refer to the various sub-heads.  I did not intend to go into the whole agricultural position, the position of the farmers, or even of the Minister's administration of another Act.  I intended merely to refer to some of the items of expenditure, and to ask why the House should be compelled to provide £3,000 for extra court messengers and assistants.  I thought I would be perfectly in order in referring to these items.  If the courts were working normally, this £3,000 would not be necessary.  There would be no necessity for extra expenditure.  Those whom we represent were perfectly content with the courts.  They were perfectly certain that their cases would receive due deliberation, and that justice would be meted out to them.  Where there was proven ability to discharge debts, these debts would be discharged, <Col N="871" /> and no one would object to the operation of the courts.  That method has been changed, and the people are asked to supply £3,000 for the alternative methods which have been adopted. I do not intend to go into the legalities of the question, but the change is unpopular, unfair, costly and, I may say, injudicious.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of your remarks, Sir, I will withdraw the word &ldquo;unfair.&rdquo;  The change is certainly increasing this Estimate by providing for a number of officers that are unnecessary. If the alternative method had been adopted, the purpose for which these court messengers and assistants were appointed would not have arisen.  The money that the Government is now trying to collect would have been collected through the operation of the Circuit Court or other courts without any of the needless expenditure that is included in this Estimate.  We object to the extra expenditure of £3,000 for extra assistants and £830 for travelling expenses, on the ground that it is unnecessary. There is also a sum of £400 for incidental expenses in connection with land annuity warrants.  We say that is unnecessary.  There is the expense of a special telephone system at Mullingar on this Estimate.  That is unnecessary; and I do not know for what purpose it is there.  If proceedings are taken for the collection of money it should not be necessary to telephone to Mullingar about the matter.  Apparently in the opinion of Ministers it is.  We had evidence recently of unnecessary expenditure on telephones to bring mechanically propelled vehicles for the purpose of collection of moneys from Dublin and elsewhere. I presume the cost of these is included in this Vote.  The work done by the <Col N="872" /> Circuit Courts has not been increased and, therefore, the expenses should not have increased.  The expenses of the Circuit Court have increased because of work done in relation to another matter which we hold should not be included in this Vote.  We hold that the work involving this extra expenditure could have been done by the ordinary Circuit Courts if they were allowed to come before them instead of having them decided in another manner. To our minds these cases could have been decided in a fair and just manner in the ordinary courts.  If that course had been pursued there would have been no necessity to swell the Vote for the Circuit Courts.  This new method is simply adding more expense on the community.  It is because of that, and of the hardships that it inflicts on the people, that we object to this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Justice a question about the costs levied arising out of this special method of collection and how far they go to meet the expenses of the special officers engaged on this work. I know of one case where the costs amounted to £10.  I am anxious to get information from the Minister about these costs.  Do they go to the county registrars, are they sent up here to headquarters or what becomes of them?  Large sums of money are being recovered by way of costs.  All this involves great hardship on the annuitants.  I intend to pursue this question until I get satisfactory information on it.  I am certain that the Minister does not wish to treat the question with levity, or think that I am not worth while replying to.  I am satisfied that he will give me the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know, too, what method is adopted for &ldquo;culling&rdquo; out annuitants when seizures are to be made.  I know of many cases in which it should have been unnecessary to make a seizure by distraint, thereby piling up costs on the unfortunate people concerned.  Why I say that is this: that many of these people are owed money by Government-controlled <Col N="873" /> bodies such, for instance, as the Irish Sugar Company and the Department dealing with tobacco.  If the farmers concerned were able to get their money from these bodies they could pay their annuities, and there would be no need to pile up costs on them as a result of the seizures made.  I know of one case where the Irish Sugar Company owed a man over £70, while there was £20 due to him in connection with tobacco.  The special officers came to make a seizure in his case, but when the situation was explained to them they realised that the man was honest. The bank manager was called in and explained the position.  They saw that the man could not pay as he was owed all this money by these Government-controlled bodies.  Yet in that case the man had to pay over £10 in costs.  I would be glad to have some information from the Minister as to where these costs go.</P>

      <P>This is a rather extraordinary Vote to meet an extraordinary situation.  In view of the fact that the Government had an alternative method of collecting the annuities, and the further fact that discussion on this is rather circumscribed, I think we are entitled to discuss what might have happened had the method in force before the 1933 Act was passed been adopted.  When the Bill dealing with the present method of collection was going through the House the great argument used in favour of it was that it would cut down expenses.  At that time an attempt was made to show that the amount of the annuities outstanding was so large that it imposed a heavy strain on the ratepayers owing to the fact that the grants payable to local authorities were being withheld in order to meet the deficiency.  I think the Government would be well advised to compare the results obtained under the old method of collection and the new.  The land annuities are halved now, and yet is it not an extraordinary thing that on the last accounting day the sum outstanding should be £1,183,000?  That in itself furnishes a strong criticism of the present method of collection.</P>

If it has not, is it because of any agitation going on in the country?  I say no.  It is because of the circumstances that prevail in the country.  I repeat what I said last night, that the Government would be well advised to consider the circumstances that now exist here before they decide to adhere to this method of collection.  In practically every county in the Free State there is three times as much outstanding this year as there was last year.  That was the reply I got to a question yesterday.  I think it provides a rather sad commentary on the present method of collection which we are asked to implement further by this Vote.  I oppose the Vote because, in my opinion, it will only aggravate the situation.  The Government have an alternative method of getting in the annuities, and it is a much better method than the present one.</P>

      <P>With regard to the <Col N="875" /> question raised by Deputy Minch as to the costs, what happens is: the county registrar, in the first instance, makes out what the costs of the court messengers going out to make a seizure will be.  He adds that amount to the decree and collects the money in that way.  When the decree is levied, the amount collected in respect of these expenses is accounted for to the State.  That is how the item &ldquo;Appropriations-in-Aid&rdquo; comes into the Vote.  As I said at the outset, this is merely a token Vote, because it is anticipated that the Appropriations-in-Aid will meet the expenditure.  Deputy O'Sullivan put a question as to the number of warrants issued.  Very few warrants have been issued in respect of the November-December gale of 1934, but, in respect of the November-December gale of 1933, the position on the 9th February, 1935, was that there were 15,659 holdings in respect of which warrants were issued.  A separate warrant is issued in respect of each holding.  In respect of the May-June gale of 1934, the number of holdings in respect of which warrants then remained with the sheriff&mdash; that was on the 9th February&mdash;was 33,247.  I do not think that it would be in order for me to go into the reasons as to why the position is as Deputies represent it to be.  I assume that the only line of argument I can properly take in this debate is as to whether Section 28 should be utilised or whether the machinery that operated previously should be resorted to.  When the previous Administration were in office, evidence was given by high officials of the Land Commission before a joint committee urging that this method should be resorted to&mdash;in other words, that some such section as Section 28 should be introduced.  I do not think that any responsible Deputy would say that officials would give evidence before a joint committee if they had not, at least, the approval of their Minister to whom they would have submitted their data before they went.  If any people have a complaint to make at this stage about the adoption of a method like this, it should not be those whose officials gave evidence advocating this method when they were in power.</P>

      <P>So far as I remember, in 1931.  I am not quite certain of the date.  That was the report on which it was intended to base the Courts of Justice Bill.  One reason that would influence any person in charge of the Department of Lands in favour of such a section as Section 28 is that it is less costly than the other.  In respect of civil bills for amounts of from 30/- to 35/-, the costs in some cases came to 17/6, against a lodgment fee of 2/- or 2/8 in present circumstances. The amount of costs imposed on unfortunate people in those days was absolutely out of proportion to the amount of the debt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is anticipated that, in some cases, agreements may be entered into between the Saorstát Government and <Col N="883" /> other countries, where facilities may be given for the import of agricultural products to a certain amount or in other ways, without putting on any specific limitation, and in such cases it may be necessary to regulate export so as to have it directed through a particular channel or carried out in the most efficient manner with regard to the products exported.

      <P>Does this amendment mean that, if we make a trade agreement with any country, whereunder we get a preferential tariff as opposed to the tariff imposed on similar goods from other countries, that agreement will automatically bring the commodities in respect of which we have a preferential tariff within the ambit of this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no precedent for such an arrangement and, to my mind, and I submit it to the Minister, this is bureaucracy run mad, because if we give this power, it means that any of the items mentioned in the second section of this amending Bill will be made subject to all the powers of the Principal Act immediately a preferential tariff is made available to us by Great Britain or any other country.  Surely that is going beyond the necessities of the occasion?  Surely it is always easy for the Minister, if he wants to extend these powers, to come in here and propose <i>ad hoc</i> legislation and explain it to the House, without inserting an omnibus amendment of this kind which is calculated to operate very extensively and frequently in a way which neither the public nor the House will be able to keep track of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not appreciate that that power was enshrined in the original Act, but I do submit to the Minister that this system of legislating by Order in Council is highly obnoxious and should not be resorted to except where it is necessary for the efficient administration of the law.  It is simply pushing the Oireachtas to one side, and it ought not to be made a commonplace of every Bill that is brought before this House that we delegate our powers to the Minister to legislate by Order.  It is not urgent; it is not necessary.  It is quite easy to do this by legislation if the necessity arises and the sovereignty of this House should not be whittled away by bureaucracy in a Government Bill.  I make that case to the Minister from the point of view of constitutional law, rather than from the agricultural point of view.  I think he will agree with me that this tendency is manifesting itself more and more in all the legislation we have to handle.  I urge on him most strongly not to subscribe to that principle unless and until it is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>I think it is unfortunate that we have a Bill of this sort. Perhaps the Minister is advised that it is absolutely necessary, but there is this aspect of the case worth considering; as long as we have a Bill of this sort there is almost an invitation to people with whom you have trade negotiations or trade relations, as the case may be, to impose those restrictions, on the grounds that there is machinery for dealing with them.  If there is no machinery for dealing with them there is that sort of unwritten but nevertheless implied understanding between <Col N="885" /> countries or Governments that they will not interrupt the ordinary flow of commerce in that fashion.  To that extent, I think the Minister should consider whether or not he will put a certain time limit to the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I have not got in mind any particular occasion where this amendment will be necessary, but I should like to point out that the powers we have are even more far-reaching than those asked in this particular amendment.  As I said already, if the Deputy looks at Section 2, sub-section (1) (d) of the original Act he will find that we have power &ldquo;for regulating and controlling any alternative export to such country,&rdquo; that is, to such country as an import quota has been imposed upon.  That has been interpreted, because we wanted an opinion on it in recent cases.  We got legal opinion that that entitles us to use that Bill.  It can be applied to any export to a country that has put on even one export quota against our imports to that country. As I say, for the moment I do not myself see any case where this amendment would be necessary, and I am not so very keen on it that I want to divide the House on it.  I do not think it is very important.  I do not think it is going further than we have gone in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister will agree, if his plea is that he has gone further in the original Bill, that there should, therefore, be no alarm about this addition to the amending Bill. He will also agree with me that if we went so far in the original Bill we went unconsciously.  To this moment I never took the meaning from the Act that the Minister's legal advisers have taken and, apparently, he did not take that meaning himself because he sought their counsel before he was prepared to act in that way.  Section 2, sub-section (1) of the original Act says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any country to which any agricultural product is usually imported from Saorstát Eireann establishes any system of restriction or control of the import of that particular <Col N="886" /> product into that country from Saorstát Eireann the Minister may by order, regulate and control the export of that agricultural product to that country from Saorstát Eireann in such manner as appears to him...</P>
    <P>Observe the words &ldquo;may control the export of that agricultural product.&rdquo; The sub-section goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, by such order provide for all or any of the following matters, that is to say: (d) for regulating and controlling any alternative export to such country which may for the time being be protected.</P>
    <P>Obviously, what the House thought that meant was that if you are dealing with quota restrictions on butter the Minister can deal with alternatives to butter.  Is not that so?  Was not that the meaning the Minister had?  By a drafting slip the lawyers have read into this a very much wider meaning. Surely, instead of saying: &ldquo;By mistake, the House has given the Minister wider powers than it intended to give, and, therefore, having made that mistake let us plunge the House a little deeper into the bog than they themselves unwittingly have gone,&rdquo; the Minister should have said: &ldquo;The House has conferred on me powers they never meant to confer.  I take the opportunity in this amending Bill to withdraw from myself powers I never sought, powers which the House never meant to give me, and to restore the situation to the true position which the House believed it to be in.&rdquo; I submit that that is what the Minister ought to do, and not to accept this error on the part of the Oireachtas for the purpose of building up upon a system which the House never intended to sanction.  I, therefore, strongly urge on the Minister that we should at least drop this amendment for the present.  Let us reconsider the situation created by sub-section 1 (d) of the original Act, and in the full knowledge of what that means act consciously in some subsequent Bill along the lines upon which the House really desires to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like it to be understood that we had got through the Oireachtas a provision unknowingly to ourselves or the Oireachtas giving us that power.  We did think we had that power, but this Bill was questioned and we got legal opinion on certain provisions of it, including the definition of agricultural products, as I explained on the Second Reading.  That does not occur on the Committee Stage.  As I say, we got legal opinion on various matters, and our own opinion was confirmed by that legal opinion.  That is what I want to point out.  In any case, if the Deputy holds that this House was misled in any way, we would certainly have asked for that power now that is, the power in paragraph (d), Section 2.  It does, of course, come into the amending Bill again in paragraph (g) in the very same wording.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out to me just now that there is a case where this particular amendment under discussion may be necessary.  In the German agreement it says that the German Government are also prepared to have due regard to Saorstát Eireann's export interest in agricultural produce, and in particular to facilitate the importation into Germany of cattle, wool, hides, skins, etc.  In that particular case the quota has applied in a particular way to cattle, eggs and butter.  There is 15 per cent. of the full quota remaining over from agricultural products.  Although they mention for the 15 per cent. wool, hides and skins, we may for instance, export horses as part of that 15 per cent.  It is one of the items that has been mentioned.  The difficulty there may arise in this way that, for instance, we might be very anxious to export horses later on in the year, or in the quarter, as it goes by quarters.</P>

      <P>This amendment is on much the same lines, although it does not so appear in the wording.  I would have to make the same argument there: that is, that in connection with this 15 per cent. residue for Germany we would be anxious, or it might be necessary, to regulate the export of any agricultural product in order to reserve that 15 per cent. for some particular agricultural product.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister see where the House is now being led? We are reaching the last stage in which the entire control of the agricultural exports of this country is going to be handed over to the permanent officials of the Department of Agriculture; this House is going to be put completely on one side.  The farmers of the country are going to be put completely on one side, and the people who have been associated with the agricultural industry for generations are going to be put on one side.  A small body of men in the Department of Agriculture in effect are going to be given power to control every part of the export trade of agricultural products in this country.  And that is all done by the insertion of almost one single word.  We are going to transfer from this House all its functions with regard to the export trade of the country in agricultural products.  To my mind such a procedure is a complete abrogation of the functions of this House.  We are not discharging our obligations to the people of this country if we hand over to a body of permanent officials the duty which we <Col N="889" /> were sent here to discharge&mdash;that is, to look after the interests of the people we represent.  In a few minutes we are going to deal with a Bill of 153 sections to control the production and export of one particular item of our agricultural industry; by the insertion of one word in a short amending Bill we are going to transfer to the Department of Agriculture the entire control of our whole agricultural export trade.  That is an amendment I certainly can never accept and I do not believe that any Deputy in this House with any sense of responsibility ought to transfer the functions of this House to the permanent officials with reference to the agricultural exports of this country.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister going to make some reference or explanation as to Deputy Dillon's objection?  As Deputy Dillon said, this House ought not lightly to pass an amendment such as that.  We have had in reference to another Act of this Oireachtas unsatisfactory results as far as some of us are concerned.  In the case of another Bill that was going through this House some years ago in reference to the taxation of certain articles some of us <Col N="890" /> thought it might be used in the way Deputy Dillon has indicated.  That Bill, after getting the approval of all sections, was hurriedly rushed through, and it was found afterwards that the Ministry had been given <i>carte blanche</i> without any reference to the Oireachtas.  Here, in a small amendment, we are going to give the Ministry and its officials power to regulate an entire industry.  That is a power that ought not be lightly given by the House to any body of officials.  Could the Minister give us some explanation of his reasons for taking this power in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment does not give us any more power than we had under the original Act.  It does nothing except to clarify the position. I take it that Deputies have not the same objection to having these regulations made where agreements are made with foreign countries.  I could very well understand the objection about regulating the exports of wool or some commodity like that to Great Britain, where there would not appear to be any great necessity for the regulations. But we have already powers to regulate these things.  We have used the power as little as possible; there have been quotas put up by Great Britain and We have not actually used those powers. We have only used them when driven to it.  We have used them in reference to bacon but not in relation to potatoes or eggs.  We tried not to use them in the case of eggs.  We may be compelled to use them by the British if we exceed the quota in the course of the first quarter.  Our present policy is that if we can avoid using these powers we will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put one point to Deputy Dillon: Since the prices of fat cattle were fixed, we have heard week after week a wail and that wail is partly justified because the price is not being paid.  I think the proper way to regulate that price and to see that the proper price will be paid is by giving the Minister power to take over those cattle himself and ship them, if necessary, so as to <Col N="892" /> ensure that the farmer will get the price he ought to get.  We have had the case made that only 17/- or 18/- per cwt. has been paid for cattle when the Minister has fixed the price at 25/- per cwt.  The farmer is being robbed and the man who is robbing him is the cattle dealer.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 2 the general question of the extension of the Minister's power to regulate agricultural commodities arises.  Under the original Act we had a definition in Section 1 which defined an &ldquo;agricultural product&rdquo; as &ldquo;any product of agriculture or horticulture and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product, and fleeces and skins of animals; but does not include intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;  That is now to read: &ldquo;any animal, milk, cream, eggs, and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product or from any animal or from milk, cream or eggs, and includes feathers, wool, hides and skins of animals...&rdquo; In considering the propriety of placing powers of this kind in the hands of the Minister one is bound to examine the Minister's record in administering similar powers on previous occasions.  I drew the attention of the Minister to-day in a Parliamentary question to the situation, in which he was acquiescing, which is being created in the egg trade, and I apprehend that if the <Col N="895" /> Minister gets the kind of power set out in Section 2 he will not only acquiesce in situations of this kind, but he will himself actively promote them.</P>
      <P>We made a trade agreement with the German Reich whereunder in exchange for trade concessions which we were prepared to afford to them they undertook to take from us a certain quantity of agricultural produce, of which eggs were to form a part.  The egg trade is a highly technical business and anyone who is familiar with the business of exporting eggs for a foreign market knows that eggs are divided into grades under two heads.  They are first divided into fresh eggs and trade eggs, and every egg, no matter what its size or weight, which is not a fresh egg is relegated to the trade grade.</P>
      <P>Fresh eggs and duck eggs are divided by weight into extra selected, selected, medium, pullets and duck eggs.  The quality of the eggs in these several grades must be identical and they must be fresh.  The retail and wholesale market for eggs finds it comparatively difficult to dispose of medium eggs as compared with selected or extra-selected eggs, and I need hardly tell the House that the market has an even greater difficulty in absorbing trade eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time of the year, from the 1st March till the 1st May, the supplies of eggs increase very largely. You are liable to have fowl that were hatched last year beginning to lay eggs at this time of the year, and the result is that you have a heavy proportion of pullets and medium eggs.  For other technical reasons into which it is unnecessary to go, you are liable to have at this period of the year an unduly high proportion of trade eggs or, as they are described in the trade, hatched eggs.  Egg exporters have always found a very great difficulty in finding a market for those two grades of eggs at this time of the year.  They have more or less purchased that market by shipping to the same consignee, who took their trade in pullet eggs and medium eggs, all the selected and extra selected eggs <Col N="896" /> they could lay their hands on.  Frequently men in the export trade receive letters of remonstrance from wholesalers in Great Britain or elsewhere complaining that the consignments they are receiving contain an unduly high proportion of trade eggs and small eggs and asking the question: &ldquo;Are you giving somebody else your extra-selected and selected and passing on the `culls' to us&rdquo;?  You are put on your proof two or three times in the season to satisfy the consignee that he is not getting all the &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs and somebody else the choice eggs of your collection.  That problem is constantly present to those who are charged with the responsibility of the egg export trade of the country.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister recently as to what he had to do with the Newmarket Dairy Company and he informed the House that the Newmarket Dairy Company was virtually his nominee for the purpose of carrying through certain transactions in connection with the German quota for Irish eggs.  On the 9th March the following circular was issued from the Newmarket Dairy Company and addressed from the Department of Agriculture, Upper Merrion Street, Dublin.  It says:</P>
    <P>Enclosed circular cancels all previous issues and sets out particulars of the grades, quality and marking of eggs and the marking of eggs for the German market.  We should be glad to receive on Monday evening next or Tuesday morning by telegram or telephone offers of eggs for Germany in two grades&mdash;G.I.A. and G.I.B.  No G.I.C. for the present.</P>
    <P>Now, the G.I.A. grade are eggs, 120 of which shall weigh not less than 16½ lbs., and the minimum size of egg to be included shall not be less than 2 ozs. 2 drams.  That corresponds to the extra selected grade in the statutory terminology of this country.  G.I.B. are eggs 120 of which shall weigh 15¼ lbs., and the minimum weight of an individual egg shall not be less than 1 oz. 15 drams.  That corresponds to the selected grade.  G.I.C. are eggs 120 of which shall weigh 14 lbs. and the minimum size of an individual egg shall not <Col N="897" /> be less than 1 oz. 13 drams.  That would comprise &ldquo;mediums,&rdquo; and possibly pullet eggs.  They go on to define the quality, and by their definition of quality they expressly exclude any trade eggs.</P>
    <P>We may take it that that circular, which to-day comes from the Newmarket Dairy Company in the Department of Agriculture, would have come from the Department of Agriculture itself had the powers which the Minister seeks under this amending Bill been available to him.  At this time, when our whole goodwill in the egg market of Great Britain is at stake, when every wholesaler in Great Britain is on the <i>qui vive</i> to watch exporters in this country lest they should send him the culls of their trade and dispose of the choice grades elsewhere, this circular is issued calling on the exporters of this country to do the very thing which our best customers regard as the most unfair thing any people with whom they are engaged in commerce could do.  I think Deputies will agree with me that if you have a body of distributors in Britain who are prepared to trade with you, take all the eggs you can sell them on the British market for the best price they will fetch and give Irish eggs a preference over Danish eggs, Polish eggs or other foreign eggs which are pressed upon them, we should appreciate that as one merchant would appreciate straight dealing with another in the ordinary course of trade.  I think we should realise that unless we are prepared to play square with the merchants on our largest market for eggs, in fact our only effective market for eggs, we shall do our goodwill in that market a very deadly damage and we shall lose, not ten, but thousands of times what we shall gain by the German quota.  I asked Deputies in this House to remember that it is less than nine months since I read to the House correspondence from merchants in Glasgow informing egg exporters in this country that as a result of activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce which compelled exporters in this country to ship their eggs in cubicle boxes of native timber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 extends the classes of articles to which Section 2 of the original Act is to apply.  I am bound, Sir, to bring to the attention of the House the kind of Orders the Minister has made, and to warn it that to give him more extended powers is to jeopardise the whole agricultural export trade of the country.  I informed the House that we gravely injured our good name in that market, as a result of the blue mould of the wood being communicated from the timber to eggs of excellent quality, contaminating them with this timber mould.  That gave us a great shock in that market.  Now, if we are to go on and proclaim to these merchants who have still continued to deal with us&mdash;and who deal, in my experience, honestly and straightly with Irish exporters&mdash;that we are going to take the cream of the egg production for Germany and ship the skim milk of the trade to them, how, in the name of Providence, can any rational man expect that our goodwill in that market is going to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies must know the value of the egg trade to the people of this country. Deputies must realise how much it means in the everyday life of the people, and Deputies must see the injustice of the Government intervening to secure that nothing will go to Germany&mdash;who never bought an egg from us in her life until about three months ago&mdash;that nothing will go to her but the top grades we have to offer, while the customer who has been dealing with us for eggs, as long as Ireland <Col N="899" /> has exported that product, has to take whatever is left.  If this same principle is carried into the Spanish agreement, the end of it will be that we will be left with nothing but the comparative refuse of the trade, and if that situation arises, those lower grades of eggs will not be disposable at all.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is unreasonable to ask for these powers from the House when we are face to face with the evidence, that he himself has created, of his incapacity to make advantageous agreements for this country.  We were told a couple of months ago that this German agreement, whereunder we were to buy £3 worth from Germany for every £1 worth she was to buy from us, was going to provide us with a large alternative market.  Such alternative market as it is only for the top grades, and those we could always sell in the British market and sell three or four times as much as we have got under this agreement.  The difficulty is to get rid of the lower grades, and under that agreement these grades, are being left on our hands.  With that evidence before us, ought we to extend these powers of regulating trade to all the commodities mentioned in this amending Bill?  I urge on the House most strongly that they ought not.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, sub-section (3) of Section 2 provides that &ldquo;sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section shall have and be deemed to have effect as from the passing of the Principal Act.&rdquo;  Is that an indemnity sub-section?  Has something been done in excess of the powers conferred upon the Minister by the Principal Act, and is this sub-section to be called into commission retrospectively to legalise what has been done illegally, and if it is, surely the Minister ought to inform the House quite frankly and explain any irregularity that may have arisen by inadvertence, and invite the House to indemnify him and his officials by this sub-section?  I think it is necessary that the Minister should explain sub-section (3) to the House fully before he asks it to pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the Deputy's question to-day about eggs going to <Col N="900" /> Germany and I said that in the month of February 22 per cent. of the eggs sent to Germany were of medium grade.  It does not suit the Deputy, however, to accept that information.  It suits him much better to get up and make a political speech here that might have the effect, if anybody had any regard for what he says, which I am sure they have not, of injuring our trade with Great Britain.  However, if the British people know him as well as we do and if they had to listen to him as often as we have, they would not pay very much attention to him. But it is just possible that a speech like this might be quoted in a British newspaper&mdash;in fact, it is just the type of speech that would be quoted in a British newspaper&mdash;and it is more than possible that a British reader might take the Deputy to be a sane man and might have some regard for what he says.  If such British readers did take him seriously, it would certainly injure, and perhaps ruin, our trade with Britain.  That is what the Deputy wants.  For political reasons he wants to injure our trade with Great Britain so that by any effort or any means he may bring some kudos to the dwindling and dying Party to which he belongs.  What other reason could he have?  I told him to-day&mdash;two hours ago&mdash;that what he said was wrong; that in the month of February 22 per cent. of the eggs we sent were medium grade eggs.  He does not accept that. He gets up here and makes the same speech about sending all our extra-selected and selected eggs to Germany, and about how hard it is to maintain the connection with Great Britain, and how hard it is to keep the goodwill of the traders in Great Britain. Does a speech like that do very much to maintain the goodwill?</P>

      <P>What about the circular? The circular does not arise at all.  If a trader sends out a circular asking for a certain kind of eggs, which they want to fulfil a certain contract, the circular does not say that nothing else will be sent to Germany.  In any case, <Col N="901" /> whatever the circular may say, I gave the Deputy the official figures of the grading of the eggs sent out in February, and he ought to have accepted that, and, what is more, if he was really interested in the egg trade of this country, would he not have come to the Department of Agriculture in that connection?  I know that the Deputy has been there before&mdash;not to see me, however, but he is prepared to see officials there.  He went to the Department when it suited himself and when it suited his own business. Is he not prepared to go there on behalf of the country?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I submit that the Minister is allowing himself to be carried away.  The Minister said that I went to the Department when it suited my own business. Would he be good enough, seeing that a question of good taste is involved here, to report to the House the occasions on which I went to the Department on my own business?  I submit that he must do me the justice of stating to the House when I went to the Department in connection with my own business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had the interest of the Department and of the egg trade at heart, why did he not go there and point out to the officials what he pointed out here, that this order is going to injure the trade with Great Britain?  If he had done so, he would have found out that he was wrong.  He did not want to do that, however, because, if he had done so, he could not make this political speech here condemning this agreement with Germany.  He could not make these beautiful points about losing our connection with Great Britain; he could <Col N="902" /> not have made this speech which, I say, is calculated, and deliberately calculated, to injure our trade with Great Britain, if he had been first informed that he was wrong.  It is quite obvious that he has no regard for the trade either with Germany or England or any other place.  It is quite obvious that his only regard is to make some political points here.</P>
      <P>He said that those extra-selected and selected eggs were eggs that we could always sell.  We can always sell them. The Deputy should realise that there is a difference since the quota was imposed by Great Britain.  I explained last week that we calculated that with the quota we got from Great Britain we would need to export about 500,000 great cwts. of eggs, and we tried to get agreement with both Germany and Spain that they would take that quantity.  Provided our trade with these countries is maintained we hope to get that quantity of eggs away.  It is not so easy to sell these eggs.  In fact if we allowed nothing but &ldquo;extra selected&rdquo; and &ldquo;selected&rdquo; to Great Britain this year, and cut out our exports to other counties, the quota would not absorb them.  If we were to cut out &ldquo;mediums&rdquo; and &ldquo;pullets&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  They are first class eggs.  Some people prefer them.  In answer to a question to-day I stated that 22 per cent. of our eggs going to Germany were &ldquo;medium.&rdquo;  We are still sending them there.  It does not suit the Deputy's political argument to accept that.  He refused to accept it.  Who is compelling him to sell &ldquo;selected&rdquo; and &ldquo;extra selected&rdquo; to the Newmarket Dairy?  If he gets a better price in England he can send them there.  We have not yet imposed a quota.  Any trader is free to send &ldquo;extra selected&rdquo; to Great Britain.  Why are they not sold there?  Because they are getting better prices from the Newmarket Dairy and from Germany.  I think it is known that the German market is a little more attractive than the British market; that the Government made an agreement which was a really good one, by getting a good market that is able to <Col N="903" /> pay more than the ordinary trader is able to pay for eggs going to Great Britain.  I am not ignoring the British market.  I am quite prepared to accept what the Deputy said: that the British market is still a big market for eggs. It is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we will not be exporting outside Great Britain more than 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of our eggs, but even these percentages are very useful this year.  I said to-day, and the Deputy may accept it, in the interests of the country and in the interests of the egg trade that this year we will not be sending a greater proportion of &ldquo;pullet&rdquo; eggs or &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs than we sent last year.  I think I would be quite safe in saying that the proportion of &ldquo;pullet&rdquo; eggs and &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs will be lower than last year.  If that is the case I do not think British importers will have any complaint.  I am sure they will not complain unless they are encouraged to do so by Deputy Dillon or by some one else.  The question has been considered in my Department of completely stopping the export of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs to Great Britain.  We may have to do that if we find that we have more eggs than will fill the three quotas to Germany, Spain and Great Britain.  The first thing we will have to do then is to have a complete prohibition of the export of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs.  In that case I do not know whether we will have the goodwill of all the traders.  We will certainly not have the goodwill of producers. They are certainly first grade eggs, but they will have to be excluded if we have too many eggs to fill our quotas.  They are a very small proportion of the eggs sent to Great Britain.  The ordinary Deputy who does not know much about the egg trade might imagine that the number of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs going to Great Britain is considerable.  It is inconsiderable. Deputy Dillon would like to create the impression that the number is considerable.  Of course he <Col N="904" /> does not mind if that impression is created on someone who might read his speech which might be published in a newspaper in England.  The Deputy does not mind if the impression is given that we are dumping all the &ldquo;trade&rdquo; eggs.  The whole of our exports to Great Britain represent 10 per cent.  They have been reduced and I am certain will be a reducing quantity.  The process of reduction will be kept up this year.</P>

      <P>That may be held by some lawyers to mean that food or drink must be manufactured from agricultural products. It may be held to mean a product of the soil, and, therefore, such things as meat, milk and animals would be excluded.  That is the reason indemnity is required.</P>

      <P>I got a circular from him yesterday very much on these terms, desiring to get supplies of eggs for the German market.  There is no need to give the name.  He is not connected with the Government.  Clearly this Newmarket Dairy Company is.  It stipulates that he will not be shipping anything to Germany but &ldquo;selected&rdquo; and &ldquo;extra-selected&rdquo; eggs.  No damage has been done.  There is a danger that damage will be done if this is allowed to pass unnoticed.  There is great danger that damage will be done if these orders are made.  I raise this question, not for the purpose of injuring the trade, out of which I live, as the Minister clearly indicated.  That is silly, childish talk, and the Minister should not let the heat of his indignation run away and make him appear foolish.  The Minister asked why the Deputy did not go to his permanent officials and make representations.  I did not make him Minister for Agriculture. I think he is a very bad Minister for Agriculture, an incompetent Minister for Agriculture.  I think he is ignorant of the fundamentals of the business he is supposed to preside over.

I gladly admit, as the Minister implied, that in my private capacity as a citizen of the State if I have representations to make, or advice to seek, I never hesitate to go to the permanent officials of the Department of Agriculture.  May I say that I have never gone to them that I did not get all the help and all the advice and assistance that they could legitimately afford.  But I have two clear functions: when I choose to criticise the Minister for Agriculture I do it on the floor of Dáil Eireann, and when I wish to avail of the services of the officials of the Department of Agriculture, I go and ask for them as a private citizen.  I make the case against the Minister that in taking power of this kind through the Newmarket Dairy Company he shows himself to be an improper person to have the powers that this section proposes to confer on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Executive Council may, from time to time, by order transfer to and vest in the Minister for Industry and Commerce all the several functions, powers and duties conferred or imposed by the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, on the Minister for Agriculture, so far as such functions, powers, and duties relate to or are concerned with one or more particular agricultural products specified in such order.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the functions, powers, and duties of the Minister for Agriculture under the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, in relation to any particular agricultural product are for the time being vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce by virtue of an order under the next preceding sub-section of this section, the Executive Council may by order retransfer to and revest in the Minister for Agriculture the said several functions, powers and duties, so far as the same relate to or are concerned with the said particular agricultural product.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Executive Council may at any time by order amend any order previously made under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Whenever and so long as the functions, powers, and duties conferred or imposed on the Minister for Agriculture by the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, are, so far <Col N="909" /> as they relate to or are concerned with a particular agricultural product, vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce by virtue of an order made under this section, so much of the Principal Act as defines the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; as meaning the Minister for Agriculture shall not apply or have effect in relation to the said particular agricultural product, and in lieu thereof the said expression shall in the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, mean, in relation to the said particular agricultural produce, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(5)  No transfer or retransfer under this section of functions, powers, and duties shall prejudice or affect the validity, operation or duration of any order made or thing done (including an order made or thing done before the passing of this Act) in exercise or performance of such functions, powers and duties before such transfer or retransfer (as the case may be) by the Minister in whom such functions, powers, and duties were for the time being vested, and reference in any such order to the Minister by whom such order was made shall be construed and have effect as references to the Minister in whom such functions, powers and duties are for the time being vested.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to make orders under this Bill.  Certain semi-industrial products are more appropriately dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce than by the Minister for Agriculture.  In some of these cases, the Minister has the assistance of advisory councils.  That is so in the case of wool.  It would be well that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have power to regulate the export of these semi-industrial products.  The effect of this amendment would be that, where the Executive Council transferred the power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he would make the necessary <Col N="910" /> order and would be bound in the same way as the Minister for Agriculture with regard to laying the order on the Table, and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain what the purpose of this amendment is if the Executive Council have a common policy?  I admit that that is a big &ldquo;if.&rdquo;  If they have a common policy, surely it is possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to explain to the Minister for Agriculture that it is necessary such an order should be made.  The Minister for Agriculture could then make the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the order has to be administered by his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has to do with agricultural exports, and I recognise that it takes within its ambit hides, wool, and some of the raw materials of industry.  All the Minister wants to provide is that, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to regulate an agricultural export, the application for a licence to export, after the making of the order, should be addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and not to him. Otherwise, it would go through the Department of Agriculture to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Is that the difficulty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the same difficulty with regard to this section that I found in respect of the last section. The only order that the Minister for Industry and Commerce ever made with reference to an agricultural export was in respect of the raw materials of fell-mongering.  The House will remember that a Fell-mongering Bill was introduced into this House to give the Minister power to restrict the exports of sheep-skins. I put the question to the Minister: &ldquo;Why do you want power to restrict the export of sheep-skins?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;Because the exporters are getting too big a price for them. There is a desperate conspiracy to buy all the Irish sheep-skins at too high <Col N="911" /> a price&mdash;to pay the farmers too much for them&mdash;and, if that went on, it might seriously jeopardise fellmongering in this country.&rdquo;  I appreciate the important national function that the fellmongers of Ireland are discharging. I do not know what the industry of fellmongering is worth but I do know that the export of sheep-skins is very considerable and that the proceeds of these exports must inevitably find their way into the pockets of the agricultural community.  Yet, the Minister for Agriculture sat silently by while the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in order to protect the section of the community whose interests he is supposed to look after, placed a prohibition on the export of sheep-skins, thus involving in serious loss that section of the community over whose interests the Minister for Agriculture is supposed to preside.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister remember his colleague saying that the object of prohibiting the export of these skins was to ensure that they would be sold at prices less than the inflated prices obtainable in Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is getting a little more cautious than he was.  I reminded him once of what President de Valera said, and he said it was too foolish for anybody to say.  He afterwards discovered that the President did make the statement.  Let me assure the Minister that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did advance the reason I mentioned in justification of his action in seeking power to restrict the export of sheep-skins.  The Minister for Agriculture does not even know that his colleague said that.  The Minister for Agriculture never paid any heed to the fact that his colleague had announced his intention of fleecing the farmers of the country in order to assist the fellmongers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Paul was the protégé of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and poor Peter had confided his difficulties to the Minister for Agriculture, who now protests blandly that he heard nothing at all about the conspiracy.  Now, we are asked to let the Minister for Industry and Commerce make circles around the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants powers to do anything he likes, and then the innocent and uncomplaining Minister for Agriculture, after six months, will get up and say: &ldquo;If he did that, I heard nothing about it.&rdquo;  The explanation of all this is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having made an Order, wants to have the administration of it in his own hands.  The House may think it prudent, from their experience of these two Ministers, to permit that, but the agricultural community are going to suffer in the exchange between the two Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position always appears to have been accepted that where you have an exportable surplus, the price of that commodity is ruled by whatever is exported.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Does the Opposition accept it?  It was a difficult decision for them to make.  If the butcher has to pay a fixed price to the farmer what does it matter to the farmer what becomes of the skin?  I do not know whether the butcher or the fellmonger makes the money, but as far as the farmer is concerned it makes no difference to him.  If the Deputy had grasped these matters he need not have wasted ten minutes showing how the farmer is placed.  As long as the export price rules the home price it makes no difference to the farmer.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce made the statement suggested or not, but whether he did or did not makes no difference to me, as Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that if the butcher pays the price for <Col N="913" /> the skins it does not affect the farmer one way or the other, but when the question of bounty is discussed he says it must necessarily go to the farmer. If there is a loss it goes to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Before the Second Reading of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In moving the financial motions and the Second Reading of the Bill, I want to say that what the Bill is meant to do is to provide machinery for the fixing of prices of bacon pigs to the producer and to regulate the manufacture and sale of bacon.  These are the two big objects that the Bill is to fulfil.  A tribunal was set up to inquire into the production of pigs and bacon in May, 1933, and reported in December, 1933.  This Bill gives effect to the main recommendations of that report.  The production of pigs, and the prices of pigs vary considerably in this country.  The price varies not only from day to day but it varies as between factories on the same day.  I have a cutting here from a newspaper of yesterday and I find that if you take a 12 stone pig dead, roughly 16 stone alive, and if <Col N="918" /> it had been sent to one factory the total yield would be £4 16s., whereas if sent to another factory, it would have been only £3 13s. 6d.  That is a difference of 22/6 in the price of one pig as between two factories.  I quote that to give an idea of the unregulated state of the market at present. Whether we believe that the persons paying the higher price can afford to pay that price and that the person paying the lower price is likely to make a profit of 22/6, or that one man was paying too much and another too little, it would be better in future if we could regulate the price and see that factories gave a fair and fixed price as far as possible over a period.</P>
      <P>Production, of course, is influenced by the price.  We have cycles in pig production and we find that when we have a surplus production, we have low prices and low prices have the effect of reducing production.  We follow, therefore, a cycle of high production by a cycle of low production, which again has the effect of raising prices and starts an increase in production. We have the same cycle over again.  Usually, that cycle will take about three years in passing and it was rather a regular and expected thing in the pig business.  The Bill aims at uniformity in price to the producer and it also aims as far as possible&mdash;it is a very difficult thing to do &mdash;at getting a more regular production the whole year round and it tries to avoid the seasonal changes in both price and production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill consists of three main parts, leaving out the introductory part. There is, firstly, the part dealing with control of the bacon trade; secondly, the part dealing with the allocation as between the factories; and, thirdly, the fixing of prices to the producer. There are two Boards which deal with the second and third parts, which are the principal parts of the Bill, and those Boards will co-operate, so far as it is necessary for them to do so, in attaining the ultimate objectives of securing for the producer the best possible price and so relating the production of pigs to the outlets for bacon as to avoid the occurrence of periods <Col N="919" /> of over and under supply, with corresponding fluctuation in price.  The Bill does not apply to the farmer who kills pigs and makes bacon for the consumption of his own household, and neither does it apply to pigs killed for sale as fresh pork, so that the pork dealer will be free to continue his business as hitherto, with certain reservations which I must mention.  There are two classes which we must regulate, for the present, at any rate&mdash;one of them, temporarily, and the other, permanently.</P>
    <P>These two classes do not come within the category of the ordinary bacon curer.  They are what are referred to here as minor curers and pork butchers.  The pork butcher, as we all realise, sometimes cannot sell his pork fresh and he, therefore, always has the safety valve of salting some of the pork and selling it afterwards as bacon.  There would obviously be a means of evasion there, if that were permitted to proceed unrestrictedly, and it is provided in the Bill, therefore, that a pork butcher may convert not more than 15 per cent. of his output into bacon or make more than four hundred weights of bacon in the year. If he keeps within these two limits, he is permitted to continue in the bacon business to that extent and is not subject to any penalties, except the levy provided in the Bill.  The pork butcher who does not manufacture any bacon is not affected by the Bill at all.  Pork butchers also may be registered at any time.</P>
    <P>The minor curer is defined here as a person who manufactures in 45 weeks not more than 2,200 cwts. of bacon.  That is the equivalent of about 2,000 pigs.  The minor curer must have been in business for at least 45 weeks out of the 52 in 1934 and he must not have exceeded 2,200 cwts. of bacon. The reason for these provisions is that we do not want coming in a man who was engaged spasmodically in the business, who killed pigs on a comparatively large scale when there was good profit to be made out of pigs, for six, eight or <Col N="920" /> 26 weeks and who then cleared out when the ordinary curer had to work at a loss.  We had to provide, however, against depriving the small man, as he is referred to, of his business altogether, and we regard the man who is 45 weeks in business as a genuine bacon curer who still would not be licensed under this Bill.  For reasons of administration, veterinary inspection and so on, we could not afford to look after all those very small factories. The proposal is to allow them to register for two years and if they fulfil certain conditions during these years, they can become licensed curers at the end of that period or go out altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If they exceed, during each year of the qualifying period, the 2,200 cwts. of bacon, they are entitled automatically to become licensed, provided, of course, that the structural conditions of the factory, and so on, comply with the provisions of the Bill.  That is the qualifying amount and it is expected that unless a person intends to go seriously into the bacon curing business, he will not go on, but will be more inclined to go into whatever other business he has, but if he is in that business, I think it will not be very difficult to qualify during the two years and to become a regular curer.</P>

They will, of course, have to comply with the requirements of the Act with regard to the premises and so on and licensing in that case will be permanent.</P>

    <P>An applicant for registration or for a licence under this Bill will pay a fee <Col N="921" /> of £10, which may be refunded if the application is refused.  Persons registered under the Bill, that is, minor curers and pork butchers, will, during the two years&mdash;and, of course pork butchers after the two years &mdash; pay a fee of 2/- for every pig or carcase or cwt. of pork used for bacon, while licensees will pay a fee of not more than 6d. for every pig or carcase used for bacon.  The 6d. in that case is paid to the Minister.  The fee of 2/- is paid to the Minister also, but the reason for the difference is that the licensee has, in addition, to pay fees to the boards.</P>

      <P>No.  The pork butcher, so long as he continues to cure not more than 15 per cent. or more than 400 cwts. of bacon, will be exempt from the provisions of the Bill, except, of course, that he pays the fee.  He is, however, exempt from inspection. Pork butchers are not affected by the prices fixed by the Pigs Board nor will allocations be made to them by the Bacon Board.  They are not limited in the number of pigs they kill for pork, but they are limited in respect of their production of bacon.  Minor curers must observe the prices fixed by the Pigs Board.</P>

      <P>No.  Pork for export is inspected under the Fresh Meat Act. There is no provision, as a matter of fact, for pork for home consumption in either Bill.  Neither the minor curer nor the pork butcher will come under the allocations.  All licensed curers will get an allocation of so many pigs, but the minor curer can buy as much as he likes in the first two years, until he becomes a licensed curer.  He then gets an allocation.  The pork butcher can always buy as much as he likes.  It may strike some Deputy that there is nothing to prevent a minor curer from going from 2,000 to 50,000 pigs a year. There really is nothing in the Bill to prevent that, but I think he would <Col N="922" /> find it difficult, under the working of the Act, to do so, because he would have very severe competition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For two years there is no restriction.  Before leaving this minor curer position I should like to make a few further remarks, because it was one of the most difficult questions we had to deal with in the drafting of this Bill.  I am sure that Deputies would have a genuine desire to see that those men who are small in the trade but who, are, perhaps, living out of the trade, are not victimised or sacrificed in any way.  Some of them, as I mentioned already, do not deserve any great sympathy because they are not men who are in that trade alone.  They were in the habit of taking advantage of the position by sometimes coming in and buying pigs, curing them, and selling bacon, perhaps in their own shops or perhaps otherwise, but when things got a bit unfavourable to the curer they just went out of business and allowed the large curer to bear the loss.  In fact, I do not think we would be bound to make any provision <Col N="923" /> for such as these.  The people whom we really have a desire to help as much as possible are the people who did make the curing of bacon their business, continued in it practically the whole year, but still were in a small way.  Those are the people who were defined as working for at least 45 weeks in the year, but had not turned out more than 2,200 cwts. of bacon. On the other hand, I do not think we can continue those minor curers indefinitely, and I think we should put some time limit.  We do hope under the provisions of this Bill to get a very superior bacon produced in this country both for home consumption and for export.  We are providing here, as Deputies know, for very close inspection and for the marking and grading of bacon after it is cured.  If we were to allow those small men to continue indefinitely, of course there would be unmarked and ungraded bacon on the market for all time.  I think, therefore, that the best compromise we can introduce is to give them a reasonable time to qualify as licensed curers, or, if they think it is not worth their while going on with the business, I think they would have to get out after that time.  We may be asked, of course, why we adopted this limit of 2,200 cwts. of bacon.  We adopted that as the limit above which the curer could afford to remain in the business if he becomes licensed under this Bill, if he carries out all the requirements we have provided for here, and has his premises, equipment, and so on brought up to the standard required under this Bill.  We think that 2,200 cwts. of bacon would enable a man to make a living&mdash;perhaps a modest living&mdash;out of the curing of bacon.  Also I should say that we got returns from a number of those men whom we have in mind here&mdash;minor curers&mdash;and we found that we were including them all under that limit of 2,200 cwts. of bacon and giving them a chance of qualifying.  We are not asking them to come in immediately and become licensed, so we are not putting on them all those burdens of having their premises brought into good condition and so on immediately after the passing of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a levy on the licensed curers of 6d. per pig, which is expected to cover the cost of veterinary inspection.  I think it probably will cover that cost, provided that the number of minor curers who will eventually qualify as licensed curers is not too high.  If there were a very big number of those qualifying, and if they were scattered all over the country in many centres, especially if you had one town, say, where there is no other bacon factory, the cost would be comparatively higher.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends.  Take a factory of, say, a thousand pigs a week; I think sixpence would be more than ample to cover the cost of administration ordinarily, but when you come to a factory that is killing only 100 pigs a week or less, that sixpence would not pay for the veterinary inspection.  The remainder then of Part 2 of the Bill deals with the requirements which licensees will be required to meet.  These requirements follow almost exactly on the same lines as the Fresh Meat Act.  The Fresh Meat Act was passed here in 1930 and it has been in operation since principally for pork and also for lamb during the summer months.  It has been satisfactory on the whole.  I think I can truthfully say that as a result of that Act our pork in the British market has got a very good name.  If we are able to get the same results from the inspection of bacon under this Bill we will probably reap a considerable advantage for the country in British markets in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two forms of licences.  One is a curing licence and the other is a licence for slaughtering and curing.  In some of the northern counties of the Free State carcases of pigs are brought into the factory to be manufactured into bacon.  In that case a curing licence is required. But in a great part of the Free State the pigs are brought in, slaughtered and they are then cured.  In these places it would be necessary to have a slaughtering and curing licence.  In both cases licences can only be granted if the premises are suitable for the business of curing or slaughtering. The curing licences will be granted only where there are adequate facilities for chilling; there must be an adequate supply of water and the premises must be in a state of cleanliness and good repair and the drainage must be all right.  The premises must <Col N="926" /> be adequately equipped with suitable facilities for the proper disposal of washings and waste.  They must have suitable sterilising facilities; there must be suitable locked-up accommodation for the safe custody of certificates, marks, records and equipments and there must be adequate facilities for the veterinary examination of the carcases and bacon.</P>
      <P>In the case of licences for curing and slaughtering the following additional conditions will apply: That the slaughtering premises are structurally suitable for the slaughtering of pigs; that adequate facilities are provided in such premises for the veterinary examination of pigs <i>ante mortem</i> and <i>post mortem;</i> that the premises are suitably equipped with the prescribed plant and equipment; and that there are employed on the staff persons skilled in the slaughtering of pigs.</P>
      <P>In the Fresh Meat Act there was a provision for provisional licences. There is the same provision here. Where the premises or the equipment are found to be unsuitable we may issue a provisional licence and give the proprietor a certain time to get his premises into order.  In that way, he will get an opportunity of carrying on the business while he is getting the necessary repairs or the improvements done. Of course there are the usual provisions with regard to transfers in the case of death or on sale.  In the case of death the licence must be transferred but in the case of sale it need not necessarily be transferred.  The granting of new licences is a matter that causes some trouble, because when this Bill later does become law and is operative, it is always rather difficult for a new person to come into the business and it would be difficult to work out how that person would fare.  Supposing the Minister were to give him a licence to go into business the question would arise as to how he would fare with the Bacon Board.  The Bacon Board might say: &ldquo;The Minister has given you a licence but we will give you no pigs.&rdquo;  We had to provide therefore when the Minister gives a person a licence to start a factory, that he should also direct the Bacon Board to give the person an allocation of pigs.</P>

      <P>The report set out in general that we had enough factories in the Free State.  That is true, but there are at least two areas in the Free State where a factory would be advisable from the farmer's point of view.  As far as I know nobody is talking about starting a factory in any of these areas.  But if a factory were to be set up the Department of Agriculture would be anxious to issue licences. On the other hand, the Bacon Board might say: &ldquo;We are quite capable of looking after that district and we do not see why a factory should be started there.  If the Minister gives a licence we will give that factory no pigs.&rdquo; That was why the provision was inserted in the Bill to give the Minister power to direct the Bacon Board to allocate pigs in such a case.  I will deal with that point more fully later. The regulations of course prescribe as in all such Bills that records are to be kept and so on.  The Minister has power to appoint inspectors as is provided in all these cases.</P>

Then, of course, the usual regulation can be made with regard to <i>post mortem</i> or <i>ante mortem</i> examinations and so on.  Now we come to the marking. The bacon must be marked.  There are various marks which must be prescribed under this Bill.  The side of bacon will be very well marked when all these marks are put on.  First of all, there will be a mark to show that it has been examined and passed as sound and wholesome bacon by the veterinary surgeon; secondly, there will be a mark put on the bacon to show that it is of Saorstát origin; thirdly, there will be a mark identifying the manufacturer, and the Bill says &ldquo;any other mark that might be afterwards included.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be, of course, a mark to show the grading as soon as the grading provisions come into operation. The idea also in this Bill is that bacon should be exported altogether from the manufacturers' premises direct to the country to which it is consigned. That is the practice at the present time.  All our export quota is given entirely to manufacturers of bacon, and the bacon is exported direct from the premises of the curer to Great Britain, or wherever else it may be going.  That is being given legal sanction in this Bill. No bacon can be brought to a premises except from another premises or from a cold store, or if returned.  We have to make provision for that, because the curer might send out a consignment to a wholesaler or a retailer and for some reason or other it might be returned as not suitable or not up to invoice. In that case he is allowed to take it back.  The Bill contains a provision relating to the rates of wages and the conditions of employment at licensed premises, and that provision sets out that the wages payable shall be at a rate not less than the rate generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the rate normally applicable to workmen employed in a similar kind of work at licensed premises in similar localities.</P>

      <P>We cannot put it into the Bill in that form.  If we did we might find, when the next election comes along, the men who would now be over 77,000 hundredweights might be down considerably in production and then you would have a difficulty.  The only thing is for the Minister each <Col N="931" /> time to get the trade together and say: &ldquo;This is the position: there are so many over 77,000, so many between 77,000 and 33,000 and so many under 33,000 hundredweights,&rdquo; and I think you will always get agreement.</P>

      <P>We who are called upon to make this an Act should know on what principle this Board is going to be constituted.  We do not know that yet.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that and perhaps put in an amendment later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss that later. Provision is also made in the Bill for substitutive members, and that is rather important.  If you have two representatives of the small curers, for instance, perhaps something may turn up to prevent their attendance.  One may be ill and the other cannot attend for some reason and they may feel their interests are not being seen to in their absence.  Consequently, there may be substitutes elected and they are called upon in case the others cannot attend.  Therefore, there will always be a full attendance of the Board.  The first period for which the Board will hold office will be to the 31st December, 1936, and they will hold office for two years after that.  The Board will rule by majority verdict, except in certain cases.  There are three very important points with which the Board has to deal&mdash;the allocation of pigs to each factory, the home sales that each factory is allowed and the amount of bacon it may put into or take out of cold storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was in draft we came up against the difficulty that it might happen that the big curers and the middle group might say: &ldquo;We will combine and wipe out the small men; we can allocate all the pigs to the big and the medium men and let the small men go.&rdquo;  You would have a majority of the Board for that decision.  On the other hand, the small curers and the medium men might say: &ldquo;Let us bring the big men down to our level,&rdquo; and they would have a majority for that, too.  I pointed out this danger of a majority verdict.  I said I <Col N="932" /> thought in such a case the chairman should have what amounts to a veto. How it is indicated in this Bill is that the chairman may give his own verdict on such an issue, unless there is unanimity. He really has not a full veto. If there is unanimity amongst the seven members, then the chairman must agree; but if there is any minority, then he can say there is not agreement, and, therefore, he has the power to allocate.  I do not say that he would in all cases take that power. He might consider the majority verdict appeared to be reasonable and he would agree with it.  If he thought the majority were trying to be unfair to the minority, he could make an allocation, first of all, of pigs to each factory and the same would apply to home sales and cold storage.  In these three cases he has that reserve power, unless there is unanimity, to give his his own verdict.  That amounts almost to a veto.</P>
    <P>The Board are required to meet within one month after they are established and make the necessary orders defining a certain period as a production period, allocating amongst licensees the quantity of bacon to be produced and also defining a certain period to be a sales period.  In making allocations the Board are asked to have regard to certain things &mdash;to the quantity of bacon produced by each curer in twelve months, and if a new licence is granted by the Minister, they are required to allocate to the new licensee such portion of the production quota as the Minister may request.  The Board are required to meet at least a week before the end of each period.  They may say that for two months to come the amount of bacon which can be produced by each factory is so-and-so, and at least a week before the end of that period they must meet again and make an allocation for a further period.  The Bacon Board are to look after the cold storage in addition to what I have already mentioned.  They may also purchase from a curer at a certain price. A curer may hold that he could not get rid of his bacon for some reason or other.  The Board may say to that curer: &ldquo;You are looking for too much <Col N="933" /> for your bacon; we will take it from you at the price that other men are selling for, and we will sell it for you.&rdquo; They are entitled to do that.  They can also, in times of slump, or when there is a surplus of pigs, buy pigs and either sell the pigs or cure them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on the Bacon Board. The Bacon Board is composed entirely of curers.  They are not likely to treat a curer badly by taking over his bacon unless there is a good case for it.  This Board can also advertise bacon, either at home or abroad, and carry out research work in the production of bacon and the provision of better methods.  They will have funds at their disposal and they are empowered to make a levy.  They are also empowered to impose a fine of 10/- per cwt. for under-production and 10/- per cwt. for exceeding home sales, and also with regard to cold storage.  Out of that fund from the levy and the fines, if there are any fines, they will pay the expenses of administration, advertising, research, etc.  That is all they have to pay.  They are also entitled to borrow money if they want to get into business immediately before getting in their levy and the Minister is empowered to <Col N="934" /> lend money to the Board.  The fourth part of the Bill deals with the Pigs Marketing Board, which will consist of a Chairman nominated by the Minister, three members elected by the Bacon Board who will be curers, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister develop that and show how that will ease the pressure of the surplus of pigs.  They will manufacture them into bacon just as an ordinary curer would, and sell in the same market.  How will that relieve the surplus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at least one or two ways which might be suggested. In Denmark, for instance, the system at one time was&mdash;I am not sure if it is so now&mdash;that the body controlling the business, which would be the same as the Bacon Board here, had power to buy pigs and dump them as best they could on some foreign market.  In that way they hoped to keep up their price on the British market, where they had a quota, and in their own market, and at the same time get rid of the surplus. This Board might, perhaps, buy some pigs and they might keep them over, for instance.  That is the second way&mdash; the cold storage.  At the end of 1933 here we appeared to have a very big surplus of bacon, and the Department of Agriculture came to the conclusion that there would probably be a scarcity in February or March.  At that time we asked the curers to cold store some bacon.  That was very useful to us afterwards because there was actually a shortage in the Spring months.  That being the first time the curers were asked to do a thing like that on a large scale, they were very sceptical about it <Col N="935" /> and asked for certain guarantees.  We did give them certain guarantees against loss, but they were scarcely drawn on at all.  I think that out of Government funds we lost only about £3,000 on the transaction, although we stood to lose very much more if the guarantees had been fully drawn upon. There are two ways in which they might deal with the bacon: (1) they might export some quantity to some market that is unrestricted as far as quotas are concerned, even though they would not get as good a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would we not be looking for them in any case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  At the present time we are not looking for them so much because, after filling the British quota and our home requirements, I do not think we have any bacon to spare.  If there was a slump the Board might do that.  It would be unfair to ask any individual exporter to do it because he might lose on the building up of that market.  The second alternative is that the Board might cold store.  For one reason or another they might not think it advisable to issue a cold storage order against everybody.  They might take over a small quantity and do it on their own account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did up to a certain point and I will put the papers at the disposal of the Minister if he thinks there is anything in it.  I am certainly against the principle of nomination. I quite agree that the Minister could not accept nomination from any farmers' organisation at the present time, because there is no organisation sufficiently wide in its influence to speak for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as with the Bacon Board, the chairman will also have certain veto powers in one case&mdash;in fact only in one case, and that is in making a prices order.  The principle function of this Board will be to fix the price of pigs.  The position will be that you will have three curers on one side and three farmers on the other.  They are not likely to agree about the price of pigs.  Therefore, if the six are there it is quite likely that the Chairman will have to give a casting vote every time.  In case there were three there on one side, and two on the other side, I think the chairman <Col N="937" /> should be, more or less, in a position as if there was only one vote on each side so that the three who were able to turn up as against the other two, should not have the decision against the chairman.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Unless there is unanimity on the price fixing, the chairman has the fixing.  This price-fixing order is binding on all licensees, that is all bacon curers and all minor curers also. The Board fixes the duration of the prices order.  They are bound, a week before the end of a price-fixing period, to fix a price for the coming period.  The idea is that they should make the price as uniform as possible and to make it for as long a period as possible.  It may not be possible to fix a price for the whole year round.  We shall have to do something to discourage a very big production in the autumn as opposed to other parts of the year.  They will probably have to vary the prices somewhat, so as to try to encourage pig production, say, from this time of the year until July and discourage it in autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that comes in.  They can also make freight orders, fixing certain areas over which there will be certain freight paid.  A curer is permitted to deduct certain things from the price he pays for a pig. He can deduct the freight allowance, the levy of the Pig Marketing Board, and the levy of the Minister which pays for the inspection.  He can also deduct insurance allowances in respect of the condemnation of pig carcases, etc., tolls, if such have been paid, and weighing charges.  In the case of the minor curer, he does not pay a levy to Bacon Marketing Board, but he pays 2/- to the Minister.  He can deduct 1/- of that and as well he can deduct tolls and weighing charges.  The price of pigs, or carcases, fixed by the Board <Col N="938" /> is fixed in relation to weight and it is an offence for a person to buy either pigs or carcases otherwise than by weight save in circumstances in which weighing facilities are not available, and an order permitting the weight to be determined by agreement between buyer and seller has been made by the Board.</P>

      <P>Then there are the price orders.  Deputies may have had some difficulty in following that rather intricate arrangement about the appointed price and the hypothetical price, but we in the Department thought it rather a simple thing.  Putting it into legal phraseology, however, makes it rather difficult.  A person who is buying pigs may be able to pay, say, 56/- per cwt. for the pigs, according to the price he is getting for bacon on the home market.  We may say to him: &ldquo;We should like you to pay 58/- in order to keep prices level.&rdquo;  In that case the appointed price is 58/- and the hypothetical price is 56/-.  He may get from us the difference between the two.  On the other hand, a person may be able to pay 60/- for pigs, according to the price he is getting for bacon, and the Board may suggest that he should pay only 58/-.  We then collect 2/- from them, in order to build up a fund to meet the leaner times.  In that case the appointed price is 58/- and the hypothetical price is 60/-.  He pays in the 2/- difference to the Board.</P>

Suppose we start it during a lean time, there is provision by which the Board can borrow on the security of the fund and the Minister has power to lend.  It is really a stabilisation of prices.  They collect levies and they can pay out bounties.  There is also an amendment, which I propose to bring in on the Committee Stage, which will give them power to vary these bounties according as the bacon is consumed at home or exported.  It is quite possible, as Deputy Belton said, that we might have the consumer paying a certain price for bacon.  There would be no great advantage to the consumer, at any rate, in lowering the price of bacon by 2/-.  It is better to keep the price of bacon to the home consumer as it is and the home price of pigs as it is.  Let us help the man who is exporting because he is having a lean time while the person consuming at home is all right.  We would want power to vary payments out of the fund according as the bacon is consumed at home or exported.  This Board has powers also in regard to research, improvement of pig rearing, and so on.  The Board has a levy, in addition to this stabilisation fund I have referred to, for administrative expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer also to the Chairman of the Board in both cases.  The Bill confers exceptional powers on the Chairman of both the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board. I think I have explained very fully why these powers have been given. The only other point raised is why the Minister has the nomination of the Chairman.  It was laid down in the <Col N="941" /> report of the Pig Industries Tribunal that the Chairman should be neutral. The question was discussed with the bacon trade and they could make no better suggestion than that the Minister should appoint him.  I do not say that they were completely satisfied with that arrangement, but, at any rate, they could not make a better suggestion.  Perhaps the House can make a better suggestion when we come to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know if they put forward any other suggestion.  As I said, however, I do not say that they were satisfied with that arrangement, but they did not make any suggestion against it.  They are, of course, definitely dissatisfied on one point. Their view is that if the Minister appoints the Chairman, why should they pay him out of their fund?  However, I think that we could hardly justify asking for State funds to pay this man's salary if his whole time were to be given up to the regulation of the bacon trade.</P>

      <P>I think that I have dealt with most of the matters concerned, in a general way at any rate.  The Bill, as I have said, follows broadly the recommendations of the Pig Industries Tribunal, and I think I can say correctly that, in general, their recommendations met with the approval of the industry.  As regards the Bill, I have had an opportunity of ascertaining the views of the trade, at all events of that portion of the trade which is likely to constitute the licensees under the Bill.  A Committee of the trade have placed their views before the Department.  I cannot say that we saw all the minor curers, but we saw quite a number of them.  This Committee, as I say, has been set up, and they have suggested a number of amendments on most of which I think we can agree when they are introduced on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the curers&mdash;both the future licensees and the minor curers, have been consulted and have accepted the proposals generally.  I should like to know whether or not there has been any similar approach to the producers.  I mention this because any remarks I would make on the Bill would be in that connection.  The best way to approach the producers would be through the county committees of agriculture, and I suggest that the county committees of agriculture should be asked to study the Bill and put up to the Minister suggestions for amendments safe-guarding the interests of producers if they did not think they were sufficiently safeguarded by the Bill as it stands. It seems to me that when you have done something like that for the curers, something similar should be done for the producers, and the only obvious way to approach the producers is through the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember that we are not regulating the producers, whereas we are doing a lot of regulation in regard to the curers, and the latter were therefore entitled to be consulted.  The only way in which the producer would come in would be in regard to price.  I did receive three or four different groups with regard to price and they put their views before me.  I should like to follow that out, but that is a matter to be ascertained during the discussion on the Bill.  Apart from the curers and the producers, the other big section affected are the consumers.  We will be asked, undoubtedly, why we did not follow this thing out also, so far as they were concerned, and fix the price for the consumer.  I have always held, however, that that is not a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, but for the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and for the Prices Commission.  However, I think I can say safely that there is no commodity in which there is less profiteering than <Col N="944" /> butter, for instance, and I think that the reason for that is that there is a fixed price through the year from the creamery to the retailer.  Therefore, the retailer has no excuse for saying that butter is going up in price and that he must add on a penny.  He cannot do that because the consumer is aware that the price is fixed.  That is not the case where bacon is concerned. We know that people go into a shop and find that bacon is 2d. a lb. up in price and they cannot understand why it should be.  The retailer says to the consumer that the price of pigs went up three weeks ago and that is why he is compelled to put up the price.  It is hard to dispute the matter with the retailer in that case. If, however, the consumer knows that the price of pigs is fixed for, say, six months of the year, he knows that there should be no change in the price of bacon.  I think, however, that as a result of the operation of this Bill, the consumer will get much fairer treatment than he has got up to the present and I think that as time goes on the margin left to the wholesaler and retailer will be less and less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps I had better get back to what I was saying. Deputy Belton asked me a question that I should like to deal with now. He asked whether there is any power under this Bill to limit production. That is the big problem we want to avoid, really.  The obvious way to deal with pigs was to say that we would produce a certain number of pigs in the year so as to be able to sell <Col N="945" /> that number on our export quota and at home, and that we would limit our production to that. That is the way some countries have dealt with it.  In this Bill we tried to approach it in a different way, if you like, by more or less carrying on the present system within limits, by limiting production, by lowering prices at a certain period of increased production, and raising prices at another period; by doing it in a more regular way and giving the full benefits to the producers as far as they can be given.  We hope to be able to avoid the very complicated and very drastic system of actually going to the farmers and saying: &ldquo;You must only produce a certain number of pigs in the year.&rdquo;  I am afraid it would be very difficult to ask for that in this country.  They have probably a more docile type of farmer in other countries.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There is this advantage, that we have got an agreed measure, at any rate with the curers. That is a very big advantage, as they are a very big interest.  They are agreeable to work this measure and, as Deputy Cosgrave said, &ldquo;It should be given a trial.&rdquo;  Having their good will, the Bill will be given a decent trial and given every opportunity to succeed.  I should like to refer to two amendments.  One is an amendment to Section 99, which I shall move on the Committee Stage.  As the Bill stands, the 12-months period ends a month before the Board is established, and on these figures the Bacon Board gives its allocations.  It has been brought to our notice that certain curers are making a very big push to put on production now, in order to have a big qualifying year.  We think that is wrong and we will amend it.  I propose <Col N="946" /> to bring in an amendment to make that period instead the 12 months ending 31st December, 1934.  I referred to the other amendment.  On Committee Stage, Section 145 will be amended slightly to give the Board power to distinguish in their allocation of bounties between export bacon and bacon consumed at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the consoling factors in this Bill is that it is additional evidence that Fianna Fáil is learning.  For the last 18 months Fine Gael advocated the organisation of industry and agriculture on corporative lines, because we took the view that world conditions and domestic circumstances made it desirable that industry should organise itself intelligently and consciously, and that agriculture should do the same thing, so that it could meet the varying winds of trade and trim the sails of the whole industry to whatever was the prevailing and profitable wind.  It seems from the principle underlying this Bill that Fianna Fáil has come to the conclusion that, far from being Fascism and dictatorism, it is a necessary reform, which they propose to put under way. Unfortunately the proposal is half-baked. Nevertheless, since the underlying principle is good, our chief concern in dealing with this Bill will be to improve it, and to add to it those elements that it lacks, in order that this first experiment in the organisation of agriculture and industry may prove successful, and may confer benefit upon people who depend upon pig production and curing for a livelihood. Before getting down to what is in the Bill, I should like to ask the Minister a few questions about things which seem to me to be absent from it.  I am sorry he has not made any endeavour to provide some machinery with which he might experiment later on, if he did not care to undertake the <Col N="948" /> experiment immediately, in the regulation of pig supplies.  Something is being done along these lines in Great Britain.  They experienced very considerable difficulty in administering a scheme to regulate the production of pigs.  But it does seem to me that to launch out on the experiment which is included in this Bill without keeping before one's mind the possibility that the regulation of pig supplies themselves will have to be faced, sooner or later, is a mistake.  We ought to be ready for that if the success of this scheme depends upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will immediately say that the great difficulty we have to face is that while in Great Britain and in other countries you have large farmers who are accustomed to keeping accounts and doing their business in a methodical way, our problem here is the large number of small farmers who are of a very individualistic temperament and who resent any undue interference with their daily life. I fully sympathise with the Minister in that difficulty and I recognise and sympathise with the individuality of the small farmer; but, when we admit the existence of a situation which requires as much regulation as this Bill provides for, we ought to keep our minds open to the possibility that we shall have to go a step further, and in that event I want to suggest to the Minister that he should consider not to attempt to regulate the pig production of each individual farmer but to divide the country into zones or districts and seek to promote the joint production of pigs.  We have co-operative creameries.  I do not see why we might not have co-operative pig societies, so that in regulating the production of pigs you would go to a co-operative pig society in Kanturk and allot it a quota of pigs for any given quota period.  Then it would be for the society to distribute that quota equitably amongst its members.  I believe that, if we are driven to the regulation of pig production, it is along those lines that the regulation will have to go, and I do not think, if it becomes absolutely necessary, that regulation along those lines would be impossible.  It would be difficult, I <Col N="949" /> readily admit, but with goodwill and once you had satisfied the farmers that the thing was going to be a success, that it was going to contribute to the prosperity of the industry at large, I believe you would get a scheme, along those lines, to work.</P>
    <P>This Bill at present does not touch the producer except as to price, but it deals with the curer, the minor curer and the pork butcher.  It has left out of its consideration altogether a very important body of men who have done very useful work in the bacon business in this country for many years.  Those are the urban wholesalers.  People who are not familiar with the bacon trade will find some difficulty in realising how important a part the urban wholesaler plays in the distribution of bacon. As the Minister knows, every retailer in the city is faced with the problem that some of his customers in one part of the city will like one cure, and that more of his customers in another part of the city will prefer a different cure. The retailer's job is to provide just for each of his customer's requirements. It may be quite impossible for him to deal directly with a factory for all his requirements because he may not be able to give an order for some individual cure or grade of bacon sufficiently large to justify him ordering direct from the factory.  And so it has been his practice&mdash;in Dublin, on Tuesday and Friday mornings, I think&mdash;to go and make his choice from the stocks of bacon accumulated by the wholesalers from all the factories in the country.  In addition to that, these urban wholesalers have conducted for generations the business of curing themselves, not curing in the full sense of the term, but doing what might be more properly called &ldquo;the first process.&rdquo; They have taken bacon from the factory with part of the curing salt adhering to it.  They have washed it, dried it and smoked it or they have sold it &ldquo;big&rdquo; according to the retail customer's requirements.  Many of them have built up a very valuable trade for the particular classes of bacon that they, by their skill and experience, are in a position to offer to the consuming public through the retail trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> The Minister has said, and probably will say again, that this Bill does not touch the wholesaler at all, but sub-section (4) of Section 40 specifically says:</P>
    <P>Bacon which has been subjected by any person or at any premises to the process of smoking and no other process of manufacture shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, not to have been cured by such person or at such premises.</P>
    <P>That is quite true, but the Minister, I hope, has not forgotten that he has regulated the curing business.  He has virtually created a monopoly in the curing business, so that if curers choose to go extensively into the wholesale trade themselves they could, by manipulating prices, make the position of the urban wholesaler absolutely impossible and eventually squeeze him out.  It is an illusion to imagine that those men who have been engaged in the wholesale trade have been an added cost to the consumer.  They have not, because if the factories want to discharge the same functions as these wholesalers they must, and will set up depôts of their own.  Therefore, the overheads of the wholesalers will remain a charge upon the industry and that is largely because smoked bacon will not travel.  You cannot ship smoked bacon from a rural factory to a distant city because its general appearance on arrival there will displease potential purchasers.  For that reason, and some other technical reasons, these final processes must be carried out in the urban centre where the wholesaler operates.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the urban wholesaler constituting a burden on the consumer, but there is grave danger that, unless he is afforded some protection in the Bill similar to that which is afforded the curers the curers will combine to squeeze him out of the trade altogether.  Then you will have the men who depend entirely for their livelihood on the bacon wholesaling business in urban centres left destitute after this Bill has been three or four years in operation.  Their destitution would be brought about by a combination of curers resolved to <Col N="951" /> capture the wholesale trade themselves and protected from competition by the wholesalers whom they were trying to squeeze out by the sections of this Bill. These sections make it impossible for anyone to enter the curing trade after the preliminary period without satisfying the conditions laid down by the Bill, to wit, that there is another curer necessary in the trade, and that when he enters he will set up his factory in a district which is not adequately supplied with factories at the present time. The problem is a complex one and, at first glance, it would seem as if the farmers had nothing to complain about. If the matter is looked into closely, it will be found that the provisions of the Bill amount to a death sentence on the urban wholesalers.  In my opinion, the House should take the view that that is a substantial injustice and should be remedied either by prohibiting curers from setting up wholesale depots and going into the wholesale business, or by giving urban wholesalers, subject to a limited definition of that business, the same protection in their trade as the House proposes to give to the established curer in his trade.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is no reference in this Bill to a very important section of the community who have done yeoman service in building up the great prosperity that attended the pig industry for generations in this country.  I refer to the pig jobbers.  The pig dealers went about their business and made available to our people in the most remote country fairs the best prices obtaining in the markets of the world.  Those of us who have some experience of what happened in the western States of America, when the local fairs were destroyed at the instance of the packers and the farmers were compelled to bring their stock long distances into the pig packers' yards, will appreciate the valuable work done by the pig jobber in Ireland.  In America, when the farmers were induced to accept the hospitality of the packers' sale yards the local fairs died and dealers ceased to go out into the country parts.  Then the farmers realised that, whether they liked it or <Col N="952" /> not, they had to go into the yards. Having gone there they quickly realised that they had to take whatever price the packers would give them.  The packers knew that, once they had agreed to pay no more than a certain price for cattle or pigs, the farmer could not afford to bring his stock home again.  He had brought them too far.  To this day, the rural cattle raiser in America who takes his cattle into Denver, Kansas City or Oklahoma is obliged to take whatever price he can get.  I remember seeing a man who took three wagons of cattle to Denver.  So wretched was the price offered for one wagon, that he refused it and took that wagon home. When he got home he discovered that the two wagons of cattle which he had sold just paid his expenses and left him one dollar seventy cents for himself. In this country, happily, we have never had that system.  In most parts of the country we have had a pig or cattle fair.  The farmer brought in his pig to the fair and, if he made up his mind that he was not being offered its value, he was free to take it back again.  The pig jobbers attended the local fairs in considerable numbers and competed amongst themselves for the pigs, to the great advantage of the pig producers all over the country.  Deputy Haslett will remind me that, in a great part of the north of Ireland, the practice is to slaughter the pigs and bring them in to the market as pork.  I know that that is the practice but I never could understand what the reason for it was or how the northern farmer does not realise that he is at a great disadvantage in fighting for a good price in these circumstances.  A dead pig cannot be brought home again. If the live pig does not sell well in Monaghan he may sell well at Clones. Deputy Haslett will probably explain that practice at a later stage but my experience is that the local live-pig market is a very valuable asset.  For that, we are largely indebted to the pig jobber whose co-operation and assistance have contributed in no small measure to the prosperity of the pig industry.  Surely the pig jobber is entitled, in these circumstances, to <Col N="953" /> some representation on the Pig Marketing Board.  His business is going to be profoundly affected and his experience and skill would be of considerable value to the Board.  The assistance given to the industry by the pig jobber is entitled to some recognition. The Government should make some provision for adequate representation on the Board of that body of men in view of their past record and in view of the contribution they will be able to make to the effective organisation of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider the consumer and the producer.  I fully recognise that one can become impractical in suggesting that every kind of interest should be represented, particularly when some of these interests are not directly affected by the Bill at all.  Nevertheless, it is true to say that sometimes an attempt to avoid trouble lets one in for more trouble than would be the case if the facts were faced.  I think that the Minister would be well advised to look into the question of providing representation for consumers and producers on one of the bodies which will be concerned with the control of the sale of bacon and the control of the purchase of pigs.  The Minister, in opening his observations this evening, said that he justified this whole departure largely by the astonishing irregularity that obtained in the pig market of the country.  He pointed to an advertisement appearing in yesterday's paper showing that a pig consigned to one factory was worth £4 10s., while the same pig consigned to another factory was worth only £3 15s. He said that that showed the chaotic condition of the pig market. That chaotic condition is a condition of his own making, as he subsequently confessed, when he referred to the amendment he proposed to introduce to Section 99.  There he laid his finger on the reason why you can get £4 10s. for a pig in one factory as against £3 15s. in another factory.  All the factories are out on the rampage for pigs to qualify for the quota.  The Minister now realises that and proposes to introduce an amendment to the section.  While he was discovering that interesting fact he upset the <Col N="954" /> whole pig market and people are paying fancy prices at present.  To my sorrow, I realise that these fancy prices will come to an end to-morrow because I had a wagon of pigs sent out to capture that price, which has now been blown up by the proposed amendment.  The Minister might have left us the good price for a little longer or given his friends an indication of what was coming, so that we could have got our pigs away to market before he &ldquo;split the gaff.&rdquo; With regard to the general question of pig production, the Minister says that the only instrument to his hand under this Bill is price-fixing.  I do not believe that he can adequately effect control of pig production by varying the price.  I am not altogether sure that it will work out in a desirable way, because, as Deputies who are familiar with this business know, one of the main reasons why pig supplies are prone to grow in the autumn is that small potatoes are available in great abundance at that time of the year.  The country people must have something to consume the small potatoes. That which consumes the small potatoes most profitably is the pig.</P>
    <P>Hence, country people try to have pigs at that time of the year.  Under the agricultural cereals products legislation you are going to raise the price of pig-feeding meals sky-high, and, when you have alternative feeding stuffs grown upon your own land you are going to depress the price down as low as you can, in order to deprive people of the profit they otherwise would have made.  It looks to me very like &ldquo;heads we win, tails you lose.&rdquo; The fact is that the effect of the agricultural cereals Acts has been to accentuate every surplus of pigs in autumn because the spring feeding meals have been made so expensive that people find the margin of profit narrower than ever before, and have turned, more and more, to the period when they can supply their own feeding stuffs for pigs, as the period in which they can make profit.  If this is to be changed and we are, artificially, going to beat down the price in order to restrict their keeping of pigs to consume potatoes it will read otherwise. <Col N="955" /> I do not think that that alone is going to be adequate to control pig production, or equitable in the control of pig production.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the question of lowering the price of pig-feeding meals in spring, if he wants to increase the demand and allow the effect of the cereal legislation to operate in autumn.</P>
    <P>Under Section 2 of this Bill we have definitions which are going to cover the whole statutes.  The third of these definitions is as follows: &ldquo;the word `bacon' includes ham.&rdquo;  Where has bacon been defined for statutory purposes?  This is merely a matter that the Minister might note for reference, because in dealing with the whole industry, as he does here, great difficulty might arise if the meaning of the word &ldquo;bacon&rdquo; was not made very clear, and the fact that there is a differentiation between bacon and ham suggested that the word &ldquo;bacon&rdquo; in the statute might not include foreends and gams and so forth.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the very difficult question of the minor curer.  I recognise, and I think everybody else will recognise, that if the industry is to be organised in conformity with the spirit of this Act, the maintenance of minor curers in existence would produce insurmountable administrative difficulties. But this House has never yet accepted the principle that by legislation we should put somebody out of the business without compensation.  No one in this House would accept the principle that you are entitled to take from a man a piece of land without compensation.  Now, the only value land has, for anybody, is to provide him with a livelihood in one form or another.  To the minor curer his land is his business; it is what provides him with a livelihood.  It may not be an adequate livelihood from the point of view of the Minister, but such as it is, it is his, and if this Bill remains in its present form the man who is killing about 40 or 45 pigs a week, and making a modest livelihood out of it, is required, during the preliminary period, to raise his weekly output to a much higher figure, to equip his premises <Col N="956" /> in a much more elaborate way and, in fact, to embark on a scale of industry that he never contemplated before.  It will certainly mean, in the case of some individuals, that at the end of the preliminary period they will be faced with the inevitable consequences of elimination.  That is something for which I certainly never would stand.  If these men go, in order that the industry should survive, then they must be reasonably and fairly compensated.</P>
    <P>Let there be no question of vicious claims or fraudulent representations; no such claims are entitled to any consideration. But where a man can come before a court and satisfy an impartial judge that he was honestly working his little industry and making a livelihood and that it was yielding so much to him per annum then he is entitled to such sum as will recoup him for his loss.  The method of arriving at that sum is one for which there are many adequate precedents and presents no formidable difficulty.  A judge of the High Court with adequate evidence before him would be compelled to take an independent and adequate view.  If that was considered unsuitable then a special tribunal could be devised for the purpose.  Comparatively few cases will have to be dealt with.  The great danger is that their fewness and their superficial insignificance would induce this House to ignore them.  But what for us might be a trivial and insignificant incident, the elimination of a man who only cured 30 or 40 pigs in the week, could be, for him and his family, an irreparable disaster and might mean the breaking up of a home and the loss of an honest and hardworking and industrious citizen.  I am satisfied that, on reflection, the Minister will come to agree with me that while the necessity of the situation may require the elimination of those men at the end of two years that elimination cannot be contemplated except on the basis of fair and not excessive compensation.</P>
    <P>Now, sub-section (3) of Section 11 deals with pork butchers to whom would be reserved the right of curing not more than 15 per cent. of his total output.  But oddly enough the sub-section <Col N="957" /> says &ldquo;any person&mdash;(a) who carries on at any such premises the business of pork butcher and (b) who is not a qualified pork butcher, and (c) who desires to carry on the business of curing bacon at such premises, may, after the appointed day, apply to the Minister to be registered in the register of pork butchers in respect of such premises,&rdquo; and sub-section (4) says: &ldquo;every application for registration in the register of minor curers or the register of pork butchers shall&mdash; (a) be made in the prescribed form and manner and containing the prescribed particulars and (b) relate to one set of premises only.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can a pork butcher conduct his business as a pork butcher and as a bacon curer on the same premises?  It seems to me that there is another section which provides that the operation of curing bacon and retailing pork cannot be carried on on the same premises, and I think that is a detail which would want to be looked into and corrected, if that inconsistency exists.  Sub-section (3) of Section 12 deals with the question of registration and it sets out that:</P>
    <P>On receipt of an application for registration in the register of pork butchers by a person who is not a qualified pork butcher made under and in accordance with the immediately preceding section, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, enter in such register the name and address of the applicant....</P>
    <P>Why is that very full discretion left in the Minister's hands in that case and to exclude whom is it designed?  The Minister must have in mind some class of person who he thinks might apply for inclusion in this register who should not be there and he, therefore, reserves to himself the right to exclude them.  I should like to know from the Minister what that class of person is and whom he has in mind.</P>
    <P>I think that a registration fee of £10 in respect of minor curers is very high.  They are not to be inspected in the way the permanent curers are; they are not liable to veterinary inspection and, in fact, this Bill imposes <Col N="958" /> very little upon them, except the obligation to pay the levy.  Why should their registration fee be £10?  £10 might mean a very great deal to a man who cured only 2,000 pigs in the year, and unless it is a revenue provision, I can see no justification for it. If it is a revenue provision, it will not produce sufficient revenue to make it worth while and it will constitute a very heavy burden on the individual minor curers, at the same time, so I think the Minister ought to consider the desirability of reducing that fee to something closer to a nominal figure.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (6) of Section 15 is enshrined, very modestly and well hidden, a return to the age-honoured principle of Fianna Fáil that we do not want any courts of law.  Section 6 says:</P>
    <P>Every certificate of indebtedness shall be conclusive evidence of all matters purported to be certified therein....</P>
    <P>I can well understand that it should not be required to be proved in the ordinary formal way as having been issued by the Minister or anything of that kind, but why should it be conclusive evidence of its contents?  Has the Minister for Agriculture suddenly become subject to the delusion that he is infallible and, if he has not, why not leave the truth or falseness of any matter referred to in that certificate to the court to decide?  He is going to produce it to the court and he is not asked to prove the validity of the instrument.  All he is asked to do is to leave the judge free to exercise the intellect God gave him and not to tell him: &ldquo;We produce this piece of paper; there is no need to read it and, in fact, it might just as well be a blank sheet of paper, because all it is is a statutory warrant ordering you to accept as gospel whatever our witness pleases to say.&rdquo;  That is turning the process of law into a farce and I suggest to the Minister that that should be rectified and that in regard to the facts alleged in any statement made by a public servant, he should be open to the same cross-examination that any humble citizen of the State is open to under similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> The Minister has power to recover by ordinary civil proceedings the amount of any levy or fee due to him by anybody who is liable to pay such things under this Bill.  Nevertheless, sub-section (8) of Section 15 not only sets out that he is free to proceed by way of civil process, but it goes on to say that if the court decides that the debt is due, the litigant who has ventured to go into court against the Minister has committed a statutory offence, because in paragraph (c) of sub-section (8) if he has failed to pay, within the time appointed by this section, any fee payable by him to the Minister under this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50.  Surely if somebody questions in the regular way his liability for such a fee, he should not be made liable to a penalty for his temerity in invoking the courts as between himself and the Minister in question?  A case very similar to that came to my notice a couple of days ago.  A butcher who is registered under the free beef Act has had a difference with the Minister about the amount of levy due by him in respect of the cattle he has killed for the provision of free beef.  The man believes he has a perfectly good case and he takes the view that the Ministry have misconstrued their powers in collecting the fees from him.  Under this section he would be guilty of an offence in daring to make his case and in questioning his liability for the fee claimed from him within the statutory time.  There should be some exception made in favour of an individual who has a bona fide case and indicates to the Department his intention of testing it in the courts by way of civil process.</P>
    <P>Section 18 enshrines a new principle and one that is extremely interesting. It is that the quality of being a registered curer is now going to become an asset, and something which is freely conveyable from one person to another. Under sub-section (2) of Section 18, any person who is a registered curer can sell his position as a registered curer to somebody else, and can compel the <Col N="960" /> Minister to register the purchaser of his licence.  I am not sure that I object to that principle, but it is something which the House should decide upon in the full knowledge of what they are doing and in the knowledge that they are creating under this Bill a very valuable asset which they are conferring gratuitously on the persons who happen, during the qualification period, to be engaged in the bacon-curing trade.</P>

      <P>I do not quite remember whether there is an absolute right or whether the right is subject to the approval of the Minister in that connection.</P>
      <P>I want to go back for a moment to the minor curers.  There is one point which has escaped the attention of the Minister for Agriculture altogether. He has provided that those men will go in certain circumstances and that others will survive if they accept the 2,200 cwts. a year.  What is going to happen to the employees of the men who must go?  Are they entitled to any consideration? Is their means of livelihood to be wiped out without any compensation or any consideration? They cannot control their employer. They cannot make him kill more pigs than he wants to kill.  They cannot force him to stay in the trade if he does not want to do so.  If he chooses to say: &ldquo;Well, I do not propose to sink any more capital in this business.  To stay in the business would involve me in putting in plant and so forth, which I am not prepared to consider at the present time,&rdquo; they cannot make him do it.  If the provisions of this Bill operate as they stand at present, those people will simply be thrown out of a job, and it will be nobody's business. I think the Minister will have to consider that when he comes to look into that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter of the curing and slaughtering licences which arises in Section 21 seems to me obscure, because the section says that every application for a licence shall relate to one set of <Col N="961" /> premises only.  Surely it does not mean that you must have two separate premises, one for slaughtering and another for curing, or does it mean that you must have one premises at which you cure nothing but dead pigs which have been purchased dead, and another for curing dead pigs which have been slaughtered on your premises? I think that section is obscure, and I think it deserves to be looked into so that the presumed intention of the Minister should be carried into effect, that is, that if you get a slaughtering and curing licence you will be entitled to conduct both operations on the one premises, as is universally done.  Section 24 provides that:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister shall have absolute discretion to grant or refuse to grant an application for a licence. Where an application is made before the appointed day for a licence in respect of any premises and the applicant satisfied the Minister that he was at the date of the passing of this Act carrying on the business of curing bacon, and that he manufactured at such premises, during the qualifying period, not less than 2,200 cwts. of bacon the Minister shall.  ...grant such application.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) goes on to make it mandatory on the Minister to grant the application in certain circumstances, but it seems to reserve to him some absolute discretion to refuse or grant it under certain circumstances.  I think the Minister should take us further into his confidence and tell us does he propose under this Act to create a situation whereunder he might decline to register a <i>bona fide</i> curer for reasons best known to himself? Does he think it desirable that in a matter of that kind he should have absolute discretion, or does he not think that conditions should be laid down by the Statute which would make it incumbent on him to do one thing or the other in any given set of circumstances?  In sub-section (6) of Section 28 the same undesirable proviso is introduced.  It says: &ldquo;Every certificate of indebtedness shall be <Col N="962" /> conclusive evidence of all matters purported to be certified therein.&rdquo;  That amounts to pre-judging the issue which ought to be the province of the court before which it is brought for consideration.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention before to a section in another Bill similar to that which appears in this Bill in sub-section (2) of Section 30, providing that the Minister may revoke the licence of any person who had been adjudged bankrupt.  An earlier section has made that licence a very valuable asset.  It has made that licence something the sale of which might make all the difference between bankruptcy and solvency, and yet the Minister takes power to cancel and destroy that asset, not because a man has done anything wrong, not because a man has been guilty of any breach of the law or breach of the regulations under this statute, but just because he has taken advantage of the bankruptcy laws of this State which were devised for the relief of such persons, and which were adopted by the people in sympathetic understanding of the difficulties into which their neighbours might get.  There is nothing penal in the bankruptcy law.  There are no penalties put upon a man who finds himself unable to meet his obligations. All he is required to do is to wind up his commitments and let his creditors have a definite and final knowledge of where they stand.  But into this Bill and into the Cereals Bill, and into one or two other Acts, this entirely new principle has been introduced of penalising a man for going bankrupt.  In other Bills the Minister for Agriculture has argued: &ldquo;Well, those people have dealings with country folk who are easily put upon, and it is very necessary to protect those people from being deluded or unjustly treated by a bankrupt.&rdquo;  The bacon curers of Ireland are not going to deal directly with the small farmer, except when they are dealing with him for cash, so there is no danger of any delusion being practised on those who are susceptible to being misled.  I think, therefore, that to introduce this sub-section here is quite inadvisable, and that it ought to be removed in the Committee Stage.  I do not know <Col N="963" /> what is the offence referred to in paragraph (h), and I think it is a very great mistake in drafting Bills of this kind to include references to other statutes without elaborating them at length and letting people know what exactly is meant by a reference to Section 9 of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934.</P>
    <P>There is a case provided for in sub-section (3) of Section 30; where the Minister proposes to revoke a licence in certain circumstances, and the licensee challenges the grounds upon which the Minister proposes to revoke the licence, &ldquo;the Minister shall appoint a fit and proper person to hold such inquiry, and the person so appointed shall have power to take evidence on oath which he is hereby authorised to administer.&rdquo;  Surely such person should have some qualifications which would restrict the Minister in his choice of him.  Would it not be well to describe him as a practising lawyer, or a solicitor of 10 years' standing, or somebody who is accustomed to the giving of evidence, the hearing of evidence, and the assessing of it, so that a licensee would have some protection and would feel some confidence that a detached and independent person would hear his side of the case, and give it the weighty consideration to which his representations would entitle him.</P>
    <P>Section 31 says: &ldquo;Whenever the Minister grants a licence he shall communicate to the Bacon Marketing Board and to the Pig Marketing Board the fact that the grant of such licence with such particulars of such licence as he shall think proper.&rdquo;  Why should the Minister withhold from either of these Boards some of the conditions that he has injected into the licence which was issued?  If these particulars are to be communicated to these Boards why should not all the relevant facts be communicated to them and why should there be this Bluebeard rule as to the conditions which the Minister thinks fit to communicate? Why should not an obligation be placed upon the Minister to communicate this relevant information about licences to the two Boards concerned? In Section 38 we have a <Col N="964" /> formula incorporated which was repudiated as unthinkable, ineffective and worthless by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he was bringing in the Milk and Dairy Bill.  There is an amendment standing in my name to amend a section of the Milk and Dairies Bill and it runs on the same terms as Section 38 of this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has denounced my amendment as calculated to make the working of the section quite impossible. How does it happen that what in the case of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is possible and desirable becomes entirely wrong in the eyes of the Minister for Agriculture?  How is it that what is right at the North Wall becomes wrong at the Custom House?</P>

      <P>Well, my amendment is there for the Minister to read and compare with this section.  I suggest that this section should be amended so that we should not have a section in one Act clashing with a section of another Act.  Section 41 deals with curers and wholesalers to which I have already referred.  Section 51 reads: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time make an order (in this Part of the Act referred to as a bacon (production from carcases of pigs slaughtered in licensed slaughtering premises) order) prohibiting the production at licensed premises of bacon unless such bacon is produced from the carcases of pigs slaughtered in licensed slaughtering and curing premises.&rdquo;  What I want to suggest to the Minister there is that he has made that section too watertight.  He ought not to take power to prohibit that but to limit it.  In some cases it might be desirable to limit it but not to prohibit it altogether.  Section 57 deals with consignment certificates and it seems to me to create a great deal of unnecessary difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On debating the general principles of the Bill I am entitled to advert to anything in the Bill that interferes with ordinary trade and to point out where interference may be purely vexatious.  On the question of the cold storage of bacon provided for in this Bill, I want to point out that Section 65 is apparently designed to prevent the export of cold stored bacon.  But that provision should be done explicitly.  In the Bill as it stands there is nothing to prevent any person taking cold-stored bacon to his factory and then shipping it from his factory to an extern market.  Furthermore, the same principle arises here that arises elsewhere.  The section is being made too watertight.  The Minister ought to take permissive power in Section 65.  Permission might be given to export certain parts of the bacon, but at the same time, if necessary, to restrict the manufacturer in the export of bacon as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me strange that when we determine on setting up a Bacon Marketing Board we do not stipulate any qualifications at all for membership of the Board.  As Section 77 <Col N="966" /> stands at present, it seems to me that the bacon curers could elect a policeman on the Board if they desired to do so.  Surely the Minister has in mind that the persons elected shall be curers and representatives drawn from the panel of electors.  That is not stated in the section and it ought to be stated.  The Minister has arranged for the large, the medium and the small curers and the proportion is 3-2-2. That proportion is going to give rise to difficulties.  It has been temporarily agreed that the Minister recognises that a situation may arise later on whereupon the whole arrangement for the election to the Board may have to be revised.  One way out of the difficulty would be that the large and medium curers would be provided with representation on the Board, which should bear some relation to the number of pigs cured and according to the number of pigs cured in each class, each class would be entitled to representation on the Board.  Naturally, in the event of such an arrangement being arrived at, the large curers would require a larger number of pigs than the medium curers and the medium curers a larger number than the small curers.  I sympathise with the difficulty of the Pig Marketing Board in being asked to pay for servants whom they themselves do not appoint.  That, I think, is a matter that should engage the Minister's attention.  The Minister has vouchsafed an explanation of the new principle enshrined in this extension and that is in connection with the chairman of the Board.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>This motion asks for relief of rates on agricultural land during the continuance of the economic <Col N="967" /> war because of the dire circumstances of the agricultural community.  Those who have spoken against the motion on the Government side have been mainly Ministers, the men who, a year or two ago, were themselves advocating this particular principle.  Speaking last night, the Minister for Industry and Commerce described the motion as curious, and when he came to explain what was curious about it he said that, if passed, it would mean that derating would become permanent.  I could imagine somebody on other benches objecting to a permanent derating proposal, but coming from a member of the Government, it does not seem at all considerate.  Remember, it was your baby.  In better times than there are now, you took this particular policy to your bosom, nursed it, preached about it on public platforms and put it into your election addresses.  If there was a need for it two or three years ago, there is ten times the need for it now.  If the circumstances of the farmers were so bad three years ago as to prompt a proposal for total derating, then that necessity is ten times greater now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can sympathise with the point of view of the Minister for Local Government. He is mainly concerned with the collection of the rates.  He does not profess to have any great knowledge of agriculture. He has honestly admitted that, and I wish that admission were as honestly made by other members of the Government&mdash;that they are equally ignorant of the conditions prevailing in the agricultural sphere.  The Minister for Local Government honestly admitted that his knowledge of agriculture was second-hand. He is mainly concerned with the collection of rates, and whether or not the people are able to pay them does not concern him very much, although perhaps he might have sympathy with them.  I do not accuse him of a lack of sympathy.  In the chief city in my constituency the Minister expressed the view that the rates were not high enough, and that he was only actuated by the provision of greater services, irrespective of the expense to the ratepayer.  We can all agree with <Col N="968" /> the desire for better services for the people&mdash;I do not suppose there would be opposition from any part of the House in that connection, if the people could afford it&mdash;but the cost of better services should be equitably borne, and should be distributed amongst all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>If one is to accept the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this motion, if passed, would mean permanent derating, the last people who should cavil are the occupants of the Government Benches. A very good case could be made for permanent derating.  There is one obvious advantage in derating and that is that whatever measure of relief it offers at the taxpayers' expense, the benefit will go directly to the people for whom it is intended&mdash;it will go directly to the farmers.  That could not be said of any attempts at relief made by the Government during the last three years.  Nobody denies&mdash; it has not been denied by the Government Party&mdash;that the position of the farmers is a difficult one.  It has not been denied that the farmers are in sore financial straits and are unable to pay their commitments.  If the farmers are to exist, something more than has been done for them will have to be done.  One big step towards aiding the farmers in their difficulties would be the adoption of the principle underlying this motion.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out what this Government has done for the farmers generally.  The Minister for Local Government referred to the hundreds of thousands&mdash;in fact the £9,000,000 or £10,000,000&mdash;which went directly to the farmers.  I felt my teeth watering when I heard the Minister speak of the millions they were bestowing on the unfortunate agriculturists. I wonder where that money has gone? I am not aware that any of it got into my pockets, or into the pockets of my neighbours.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce dealt with the agricultural policy in England and attempted to prove that our market for cattle, in England, was gone.  His principal reason for that argument was that the British Government have seen fit, in the last <Col N="969" /> twelve months or so, to make provision so that better prices will be got by British farmers for their agricultural produce.  The British Government were perfectly right in that effort, and I hope they will have good results from it.  The Minister pointed out that if the British were going to increase the price for beef cattle, that would be to our detriment.  I will take up the issue with the Minister there.  I submit that the more the British farmer will get for his beef, the better pleased we ought to be.  The British farmer will never produce enough beef, no matter how intensely he goes in for the production, to feed the English people.  He cannot produce more than a tithe of their requirements and the remainder will have to be found elsewhere. The more the British farmer goes in for beef production, instead of other forms of agriculture, the greater will be his necessity to obtain the raw material, and the best raw material available for the Englishman engaged in the production of beef is the Irish store.  The British Government had that in mind when they made arrangements that an Irish store three months in England was to be considered a British-born animal.</P>
    <P>If the British decide to treble their production of beef there will be a greater necessity for the exportation of the primest store cattle from this country to Britain.  Some Ministers have said that the English market is dead and gone, and they have expressed the hope that it is dead and gone.  The fact is that it is not, and we had certain proof of that within the last few months, particularly at the Christmas markets.  Despite all the Ministerial statements, they could easily arrange for the British to take another 150,000 cattle under a recent agreement.  The extra number being exported to Britain this year forms a very small portion of the British requirements of raw material for the production of beef.  Further arrangements of that sort could be, and should be, made so that the British will take not alone an extra 150,000 cattle, but an extra 500,000 cattle.  We will soon, I hope, arrive at the day when they will take an extra 500,000 stores every year <Col N="970" /> from this country.  The greater price the British farmer gets for beef the more will he be inclined to extend his beef production; the greater will be his requirements for store cattle, and it is to this country he will look for the best stores.  The best stores are undoubtedly produced here, and they can be sold in England at beef prices, and even above beef prices, because the price per cwt. for store cattle in this country has often exceeded that of beef cattle.  It has often paid a farmer to sell a beast before it was finished rather than to finish the animal.  It paid him better to let the British farmer finish it.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that we have no market for beef.  There is a grave danger that we might lose our market for store cattle in Great Britain.  It is not that Great Britain will not require our cattle or will not have need for the extra stores that we can offer them of high quality, but it will be due to the policy of the Government.  Perhaps some people are rather impressed by what one might call the contradictory policy of the Government when they read in the papers of buyers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture giving £500, £600 and sometimes £1,000 for a bull, and in the same paper read an announcement that a bounty of 10/- or 12/6 is to be given on calf skins, so that they are spending the taxpayers' money on the production of cattle on the one hand, and, on the other, for the extermination of them.</P>
    <P>What is going to be the result of this policy?  The result is inevitably going to be that the farmers will be tempted to get rid of their calves and there will be a diminished supply of cattle.  There is a serious danger that, the price of calves being so low&mdash;calves being only worth the value of the skin&mdash;those who do feed their calves will not feed them in the future.  It will not pay them to feed them.  No farmer is going to raise a beast and sell it at eight months old for 25/- or 30/-.  He is going to allow the calf to take its chance of living or dying.  We are inevitably going to arrive at the period, in two years time, when the next generation of cattle are going to be inferior because of being <Col N="971" /> underfed at the time they ought to be fed&mdash;inferior in quality and perhaps delicate in constitution.  There is a danger that other countries may step into the market for store cattle in Great Britain that we have held so firmly&mdash;a market that Canada or any other part of the Commonwealth could not drive us out of.  Our store cattle are worth pounds more than any other stores in the British market and the Government are setting out to destroy the advantage which we have there.</P>
    <P>Minister and Deputies on the other side have pointed out the advantages of the home market.  Nobody denies that we ought to collar the home market, and we are collaring it.  At present we have practically all the home market in beef, butter, potatoes and everything else, bar one or two articles.  We have had an increasing amount of it every day for the last two years and are we one whit better off? We have collared practically the whole of the market and we are not one whit better off because of the attempts of the Government to give us a greater proportion of that market.  Rather are we worse off.  Even if we can collar the little percentage of the home market to which the foreigner still holds on there will not be any appreciable improvement in our position if we lose the benefit of the export market we had.</P>
    <P>Even if the farmer was not altogether as badly off financially as he is at present he still could make a very good case for the remission of rates, because the policy of the Government during the last three years has been to increase central taxation to a great extent and the farmer has borne an increasing burden of taxation, outside his rates, for the last three years.  Take the one item of tariffs.  Possibly the farmer has borne a bigger share of the millions derived from tariffs than any other member of the community.  The President himself, speaking a couple of years ago on this very question of the relief of rates, referred to tariffs and said it should be remembered that the tariffs bore more heavily on the smaller farmer than anybody else. That in itself was a good argument <Col N="972" /> made by the President in favour of derating.</P>
    <P>Nobody could make a better case for this motion than Ministers, and a good case could be made for this motion outside the economic condition of the farmers.  If the poor and the needy and the unemployed and everybody else are to have the benefits that they ought to have; if the local social services are to be improved as perhaps they ought to be improved; if the sanitation and improvement of towns are to be undertaken on the lines that they ought to be undertaken then there should be an equitable distribution of the burden.  Even if these circumstances had not arisen a very good case could be made for derating.  A more equitable distribution of the burden should and ought to be made.</P>
    <P>I, for one, am willing to take the Minister for Industry and Commerce at his word, that if this motion is passed it is going to be a permanent matter. If it is to be a permanent matter, I shall vote for it, just as I shall vote for the temporary remission of rates which has been made necessary by the present conditions.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in endeavouring to make a case last night, adopted his usual tactics by throwing the onus on the Opposition.  The Minister is an adept at that kind of performance. When he is at a loss for a good case he throws the taunt at us: &ldquo;What would you do; what is your policy?&rdquo;  The Minister should not seek for our policy. He ought to have a policy of his own to help in these matters and stand by it, rather than look for it from Deputies on this side.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the policy of the Opposition was to give relief in hard times and hope that something would turn up in the future.  Even if they only did that it would be something, if the relief reached the people that it was intended to reach.  The policy of Fianna Fáil, as far as the farmer is concerned, seems to be to perpetuate the bad times, because we have had bad times in farming since they came into office, and there does not seem to be any prospect of the times becoming better.  Unless they <Col N="973" /> are put out, or unless they mend their ways, we shall certainly have a perpetuation of the miserable circumstances in which we are at present. We have had bounties and subsidies and other aids for the great home market that was going to make us glorious, happy and prosperous, and with all of them we have gone down and down in the financial scale until we are practically beggared.  The few who are not will soon be.</P>
    <P>The case that could be made for this motion was made in this House by the members of the Front Bench two or three years ago.  It was followed by an appeal in their election addresses to the farmers of this country, in which they asked them to put Fianna Fáil into office and they would have complete derating, having previously proved what a blessing it would be.  There might have been differences of opinion amongst some members, other than those of the Fianna Fáil Party, at that time as to the propriety of total derating, but if there were, God knows enough had happened to change the mind of any doubter that derating is certainly necessary now, and other reliefs also if we could get them.  I have no qualms of conscience in supporting this motion.  If there is any danger of derating becoming a permanent necessity, I am prepared to stand by it and to back it in this House and outside it.</P>

      <P>The other evening the benevolent Minister who looks after the Department of Local Government and Public Health, in one of his rare adventures into the regions of humour, reminded the House of the old school problem: &ldquo;Think of a number and double it.&rdquo;  He might have referred more fittingly to another trick that used to be common, in my boyhood days at all events, and one that, in my opinion, embodies the policy of the Government: &ldquo;Shut your eyes, open your mouth, and see what God has sent you.&rdquo; The Minister for Industry and Commerce who, as we all know, is a very astute, dialectician and a very able debater, worked himself into a state of red hot fury and <Col N="974" /> blind hysterics about this motion the other night.  He forgot, with his usual cleverness, to grapple with the main issue before the House.  The Minister for Agriculture, at all events, knows something about agriculture.  At least I saw some time ago that at Mallow he held a plough there.</P>

      <P>Somebody who saw it on the paper said: <i>Libera nos a malo.</i> The other day in a lucid interval he said that the economic war would have to be settled by some kind of arbitration. I am sure that in saying so he was giving expression to the views of his own side of the House as well as to the views of this side.  Everybody knows that, at the present time, the farmers are very heavily hit.  I do not think any man in this House will deny that.  Listening here to the speeches from the Government Benches, I am reminded of the days of Titus Oates. On all sides there are suggestions of dark conspiracies, midnight meetings. Guy Fawkes, Whiteboys, Ribbonmen and all kinds of people meeting together.</P>

      <P>I haven't heard what Deputy Donnelly said.  If I did I should answer him, but I am sure he will get many other opportunities of giving expression to his views.  One would think that all the farmers of the country had conspired out of malice aforethought to pay neither their rates nor their annuities, while it is wellknown to this House that the reason that any one of them does not meet his obligations and his liabilities is through sheer necessity.  They are unable to do so.  The very first obligations they do meet when they have any money are their public obligations.  The result is that many shopkeepers and others who have given them credit have to wait for payment until some future time.  I shall not trouble you with any figures. Figures have been put before you exhaustively and, in any event, as Deputies on the Government side know very well, figures are more illusive than facts.  The one fact that does remain is that the farmers are not living on honeydew or swilling the milk of <Col N="975" /> paradise, that they are, at the present time, in a very parlous and unfortunate condition.  The reason I support derating is that in the present circumstances, I think it is the only equitable way of adjusting the benefits and the burdens between all members of the community.  I think it should be only brought into operation simply as a temporary expedient to meet conditions as they exist at the present time.  I am very much surprised if that point of view does not appeal to the Government Benches as well as it does to this side of the House.  Somebody whom I met in the street said to me yesterday that the tramway men had put Dublin on its feet, and I hope, in conclucion, that the members of the Government will put the agricultural industry on its legs in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was dealing with this motion last night, tried in every possible way to point out that rates were the least burden upon farmers.  Had he prepared his speech or looked up some of the references to derating made by his own Party, he would have discovered that the President himself stressed very strongly that the greatest burden the farmer had to bear was rates.  At one time an attempt was made to establish that there was a conspiracy amongst the farmers not to pay rates.  I have personally always denied the existence of any sort of conspiracy in that way. Looking at the various counties that were slow in paying their rates during the last year, if there had been any foundation whatsoever for the insinuations made by the Party opposite that there was a conspiracy and that the supporters of that conspiracy not to pay rates belonged to the Party on this side of the House, surely one would have expected that in County Clare the rates collected would have shown a very high percentage of the amount of the warrant. What happened in County Clare, for instance?  The official report of the collection of rates in Clare was returned as nil.  Very shortly afterwards the new organisation for putting forth the correct view of things, the Information <Col N="976" /> Bureau, tried to show that these first returns were inaccurate, in the sense that many delays had taken place with regard to the issue of the rates warrants and gave instances of several counties where this had happened.  But Clare was not mentioned at all. No excuse was made for Clare.  It struck me as the most extraordinary thing, and anyhow I think it shows, to any fairminded persons, that all this idea of a conspiracy about the nonpayment of rates does not exist at all, and if it did exist, it is just as much on that side as on this.  There is not a pin of difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very struck last night with one particular aspect that the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealt with, with regard to this motion, and that was his great indignation that a White Paper should be issued on the other side with regard to the cattle industry in England, and that we on this side should not have read it.  That is what he had in the back of his mind, and he could not believe that any member speaking from these benches could have read that paper.  Otherwise, they could not have said what they did. The thought that ran through my mind at the time was this: that you could read a thing and not understand it: that reading a thing and understanding it are two different things.  It struck me, with all due respect to the Minister, that he was doing himself a very great injustice because, from what he said himself, he was either making himself out a fool, which I do not believe for one moment he is, and yet, if he was not that, he was not being honest about it&mdash;so that, either way, he was not doing himself justice.  In that connection I must say that I dislike very much indeed to see any Minister of this State put himself in a position of that kind.  I am not the type of person who wants to derive any success for our side by anything of that kind.  After all is said and done, a Minister is a Minister and holds a very important position in this State, and when he comes to the House and says something, I like him to say it in a way that is going to bring conviction&mdash; anyhow, sincerity and honesty&mdash;but I <Col N="977" /> must candidly confess that the whole speech of the Minister gave the impression that he did not know anything of the subject he was talking about. He was talking on the subject of farmers in this country and he knew nothing about it and was trying to make a case that he could not make.</P>
    <P>Let us go back for one moment to the White Paper.  The Minister laid great stress on the point that unless members of the British Commonwealth took severe steps to restrict their exports of meat into Britain, Great Britain would have to take steps, and very drastic steps, to reduce those imports, and that we on this side of the House were doing a great wrong to the farmer by trying to hold before him the possibilities of recapturing the British market.  I challenge any Minister or any member on the opposite side to say straight out to the people more or less what I am going to say now.  If they do, they will be putting before the people the right and true, unvarnished position with regard to the British market and this country. According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the British say that their market must stop the imports of meat into the country.  What would happen supposing they stop all imports of meat into the country?  Let us face that fact.  Any man who thinks can see at a glance what is bound to happen, and that is that, in a very short time, meat in England would be at a price that only the rich could afford.  England cannot supply her own meat.  She cannot do it and she never will be able to do it, and I defy anybody to contradict that.  It is an impossibility.  Very well.  Where the Minister went wrong last night was in this: He treated meat as meat.  He made no distinction between chilled and frozen meat and fresh meat, and it is the frozen and the chilled meat, imported from foreign countries and from Commonwealth nations, that is killing the market for meat in England.  If there were restrictions on that chilled and frozen meat&mdash;and that is what the British Minister for Agriculture is trying to bring about&mdash; it would naturally put up the price of the home produce.  England, however, <Col N="978" /> cannot produce sufficient of her own fresh meat to feed her own people, and that is where we come in if we only had the sense to see it.  Her farmers will not be able to produce sufficient fresh meat to feed her population, and that is where we should come in.  To my mind, it is as clear as daylight if you only have the wish to see it.  I hold it is a most dishonest thing to try to bamboozle the people of this country into thinking that the British market is going.  It is being taken away bit by bit, but it is there still and can be just as valuable to this country as in the past.  The more restrictions are put on foreign countries, and even on the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, with regard to frozen and chilled meat, the better will be the market in England for fresh meat, and for fresh meat from this country if the people have the sense to grasp their opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer.  A great deal has been said and a great deal has been done for other industries in this country.  I am not cavilling at any help that has been given to any industry that is going to give employment and in which there is a hope that it will be successful.  While every help is being given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to other industries, and while they can borrow money on long terms at 2½ per cent., what has the unfortunate farmer who wants money to pay?  Not less than 6 per cent.  Is that fair treatment? After all, no one can deny this fact that farming is the greatest industry in this country&mdash;even now&mdash;in spite of the bad times it has been going through.  In spite of the bad times, it is giving more employment than any other industry.  Still, the poor farmer who wants a loan has to pay 6 per cent., while people in any other industry can get it at 2½ per cent.  Is that fair?  Certainly not.  No difference should be made in that respect between one industry and another. The largest industry should certainly not be put in a worse position than smaller ones that were never heard of until a short time ago.</P>

      <P>I defy anybody, after listening to the speeches they heard to-night, to pick out of the motions that have been discussed in Private Deputies' time one more than another to which these speeches are relevant. That is a fair test.  I propose that someone should go and get one of the old Order Papers and take the last five motions that have been introduced by our friends opposite, and the speeches that have been delivered on this one and the speeches delivered on any of the other motions, and to give the actual speeches to an independent person and to ask him to identify on which set of motions any set of speeches were made.  All I can say is that even the gas-producing capacity of the Opposition is exhausted.  They <Col N="980" /> have got to use the same gasometers time after time.  Instead of having one motion on which they could all speak and keep going they find that the only way they can keep going is by introducing a motion, withdrawing it in effect, and then introducing it again so that the same speakers make precisely the same speeches.  For instance, Deputy O'Higgins started the proceedings.  His conventional speech is that the last speech that was made was the most disreputable and discreditable speech ever delivered in the House.  That is his conventional speech.</P>

I put it to the recollection of the House that almost invariably the speech of Deputy O'Higgins is: &ldquo;The last speech I have heard is the most disreputable, the most discreditable, and the most dishonest speech I ever heard in my life.&rdquo;  This time the Deputy started but he had no speech in front of him.  What did he do?  He invented a speech and then said it was the most disreputable and the most dishonest speech he had ever heard.  He invented the reasons why we were going to oppose the motion. He told us why it had been put down to the bottom of the Order Paper, and having invented that for someone who had not said it, then he produced his usual diatribe.  If a man will go as far as that in order to make the same speech that he made before, he will actually invent a speech that was never made.</P>

How did they do it?  They put a veterinary inspector on board ship.  They declared those cattle were suffering from tuberculosis and they kept them out of the country. Now, that is the history of Canadian cattle, and that is a very significant incident, an understanding of which I <Col N="984" /> hope this House will get before I finish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a cardinal principle with the Opposition that Irish cattle were necessary for Britain, and for a period that is true.  To a certain degree at the present moment that is true.  To what extent that may be true in the future I do not know, but many good judges do believe that whether in the same degree, or in a different degree, Irish store cattle will always be necessary for Great Britain. At the particular time at which it was necessary to invent tuberculosis for the purpose of restraining the import of Canadian cattle, the existence of a large pool of cattle in Ireland was absolutely essential to the military and political system of England.  Many things have happened since.  Motor cars run at nearly 300 miles, and aeroplanes run up to 400 miles an hour. Arms of precision had not been developed, nor had the present technique of military and naval warfare been developed to the extent to which it has since been.  England at that time was an island in reality, an island containing some 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of human beings who, due to the industrial economy on which they had entered, could not for any reasonable time be fed out of the products of their own country.  There was not at that time in England more than about four weeks' bread-producing stuff at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was essential to the military system of England, of a meat-eating people, the most meat-eating people in Europe, that there should be maintained across the narrow seas, in a position in which access to it was incapable of interruption, a large pool of beef food, and in order that a pool of any size of meat or otherwise should be maintained in this country, it was necessary, and it is still necessary to <Col N="985" /> the extent to which that pool is required, that the cost of production of that food shall be available in the market.  England envisaged the possibility that the importation to any large degree of Canadian stores would bring down the prices of cattle in England to such a level that it would no longer be economic for the Irish people to maintain in this country that pool of cattle which was absolutely essential to the military and political economy of England.</P>
    <P>For that reason, at that time, England deliberately protected the home beef market for Ireland against Canada and against every other part of the world.  To the extent to which in the future it shall be necessary that England shall have in this country a pool of cattle of a certain size, no matter what may be her other intentions, no matter what may be her other wishes in the matter of tariffs, quotas or anything else she puts on, she will have to maintain in her own interests a price in the beef market in England which will enable that pool of cattle to be produced and maintained here.  The cost of production of those cattle, the cost of the production of the export stuff in Ireland is largely an expression of the cost of maintaining the population in Ireland.  The only way in which she could reduce the cost of the production of cattle in Ireland was to reduce the population in Ireland or to reduce the standard of living in Ireland.  That was part of the story by which Ireland became both depopulated and poor.  But there came a time, somewhere about 1900 and leading up to the incident of Agadir in 1908, when it was evident to those who were studying the larger politics of Europe that a war of some kind, in some aggregation of alliances, was bound to come.  It was necessary to build up again a pool of cattle in Ireland.  It was built up consciously and deliberately.  Some of you may remember that extraordinary book written or issued by Bernhardi, of Germany, before the European War, in which he explained how the Government's activities&mdash;cultural, educational, political, economical and social&mdash;had all, in turn, been bent and disciplined <Col N="986" /> over a period of years in order to prepare the nation for the purpose of war.  Bernhardi told the story in relation to Germany, but precisely the same thing was going on in every country of Europe to the extent to which it was under intelligent and far-seeing government.  Just in the same way as it suited England to penalise Canada and to keep out the Canadian stores rather than suffer a reduction of the pool of cattle in Ireland, so, too, it paid them over a period of years&mdash;the period of preparation for 1914&mdash;to see that those conditions did exist in Ireland which would enable that pool of cattle to be built up.  That is the sermon which is delivered upon the text of Deputy Bennett's irruption into Canadian cattle.  But that story goes further.  Remember that I am stating a good many of the things in which my opponents believe.  They believe that a pool of Irish cattle is necessary to England.  They believe that fresh beef food is necessary to the English people. They also believe that that is necessary to the existing farming economy of England.  I believe that, to a certain extent, it is.  To the extent to which it is necessary, that pool must be maintained here and it can only be maintained by giving to those who produce the cattle for that pool the cost of production. There is no escaping that point.  To that extent, we are in agreement.</P>

      <P>Why should I do what nobody else has done.  When I am speaking, the reporters have a good time.  They can lay down their pencils. There is not one of them who would not be lynched if he reported one word of what I say.  It is the only time that they have an opportunity of enjoying <Col N="988" /> themselves.  We go back to the period of the opening of the economic war, when we had that normal condition to which reference is made.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government had just disappeared.  The country had been flowing with milk and honey.  It was a country in which all the farmers were perfectly content, in which no farmer complained, in which everything was prosperous.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government had just come to an end but the consequences of the amazing ingenuity of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had not had time to disappear.  It was a period when, if the House remembers, the leader of the Farmers' Party, rising to speak in this House, was followed by the Deputy who then sat here.  That Deputy had been listening to the jeremiad of that farmers' leader in that perfectly prosperous Ireland&mdash; for the farmer&mdash;that was created by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. And what did the then President say, following the speech of that farmer Deputy?  He said: &ldquo;Ireland is not bankrupt yet, Ireland would be bankrupt if it was like the Deputy, bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative, bankrupt of everything of any use or value to Ireland.&rdquo;  Then the Deputy who sat here, and was then President, as an indication no doubt of appreciation, made the man whom he had declared so bankrupt in everything of use and value to Ireland head of a great Executive Department in this city in return for the support of this docile, disciplined and happy farmer who, previously, had been so bankrupt.  I simply want to put, in its proper perspective, what exactly I mean when I say that at the beginning of the war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic war, so called.  At the beginning of the economic war Ireland was normal: she was prosperous.  What did that mean?  It meant that she had a pool of cattle here in this country.  She had somewhere about 800,000 cattle ready to export, she had something near 800,000 cattle ready to export the next year, <Col N="989" /> and she had 800,000 ready to export in the following year.  That was her position. She had three years' cattle ready to export and only one possible market to which to export them.  What happened? Let us for the moment assume that the Government on this side of the House was responsible for everything. Let us assume anything you like and I want you to see where you are going to get to in the end&mdash;that certain dreadful, bold, bad and possibly criminal, communistic action was taken by the representatives of the Government, in repudiation of all the laws of God and man.  As a result of all that certain tariffs were put on Irish cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the normal effect of putting a tariff on anything has always been, as contended by the previous Government, to raise the price in the market; to protect the home market and to enable, behind the walls of that protection and other restrictions on imports, the restricted industry to be built up to higher prices until the expanded industry was able to produce the goods at lower prices.  The normal effect of putting a 20, 30 or 40 per cent. tariff on Irish cattle would have been to raise the price in the English markets.  Now that was all done, as the House knows, for penal purposes.  At the same time, under the leadership of their local bible &mdash; the <i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash;England decided to go over to the development of her own agriculture.  For the first time in 80 years she became &ldquo;land conscious.&rdquo; But still the price of agricultural produce fell in England, and kept on falling.  Various things were done by the way of restricting imports of bacon and other things, in order to raise the price of agricultural produce for the benefit of the English producers of agricultural produce.  And to some extent, in relation to most agricultural produce, either the fall in agricultural prices was stayed or it was actually reversed.  In some cases the prices of various agricultural produce in England even to the English consumers were raised.  But there was one thing that did not happen.  In regard to that 20, 30 or 40 per cent. tariff one thing did not happen and that was the <Col N="990" /> fall in the price of beef in the English market was not stayed.  These are facts which are common property.</P>
    <P>Eventually we came to somewhere about the end of the first year of the economic war when Mr. Thomas had exhausted every expedient that was in his possession of penal tariffs for the purpose of disciplining the Irish people. At that time Mr. Baldwin said in relation to beef: &ldquo;We have had no success; the price of beef is still falling.&rdquo; After every effort which had been made, or could be made, from the penal political point of view, to punish us by putting tariffs on which normally should have allowed the price of English produced meat to rise behind that wall, the price of English beef was still falling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact of a tariff on our beef would not raise the price of theirs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of that time another man took charge.  This man had no interest in Ireland, positive or negative, friendly or unfriendly&mdash;Major Walter Elliott became Minister of Agriculture.  He found the price of beef in England falling.  Mr. Thomas had exhausted the whole of his expedients, and then Major Elliott took up the job.  He put on a quota.  Certain Labour and other interests in the British House of Commons protested that the game was going too far, and that this further penalisation of Ireland was wrong.  Major Elliott said &ldquo;No; it is not a penalisation of Ireland; it has nothing whatever to do with it.  This is imposed for purely economic purposes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is imposed for the purpose of raising the price of beef in the English market, and he tried his best.  You, first of all, have the tariff war, behind which the price of beef should have risen.</P>

      <P>Will you permit me, Sir, to make a personal explanation?  I owe you and Deputy Bennett an apology.  I did ask a question which Deputy Bennett might have reasonably misunderstood as being one to which he might have made a reply.  The fault is mine in this particular case.  I have put the question, as a matter of fact, as an oratorical question to the whole House.  But Deputy Bennett did answer it, and if he was out of order <Col N="993" /> I am responsible in the matter and I am sorry.  Deputy Bennett suggests that what they should have done was to restrict the import of foreign meat. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have asked them to do it and they have not done it.  Why have they not done it?  Because they cannot do it.  That is their answer.  I ask the House what can they do but what they have done and Deputy Bennett very honestly tells me what is in their mind, what is in the mind of New Zealand, what is in the mind of Australia, what is in the mind of Canada, and what is in the mind of South Africa, as to what they ought to do, but they have not done it.  They have refused to do it, and why? Again let them go into the witness-box and say for themselves.  There are £10,000,000 of English capital invested in the transport alone of Argentine beef.  There is a great deal more than that invested in the part ownership of Argentine ranches.  Deputies have heard of the Nelson line.  The Nelson line does not confine itself merely to owning ships.  It owns the refrigerators on the other side and it owns the ranches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take Australia and Canada later.  I am going to take these one by one.  All these people have asked that the Argentine should be restrained and they will not do it. Now we go a bit further.  England, while she has become at last land conscious, has not decided to scrap her whole export trade; she has not decided to live on her own agricultural fat.  She says: &ldquo;I must still have an export market,&rdquo; and she says &ldquo;I cannot have an export market unless I have an import market.&rdquo;  There was an industrial exhibition held in the Argentine&mdash;I am only taking this as one of the cases&mdash;and what happened? They sent over the Prince of Wales to open it.  Why?  Because they wanted to sell industrial products in the Argentine. They were not fools enough, and they did not pretend to be fools enough&mdash;they did not even pretend to Australia and New Zealand that they are fools enough&mdash;to think that the Prince of Wales will be able to sell English industrial products in the Argentine if England does not buy Argentine beef. Therefore, the thing they cannot do apparently, at the present moment, unless they are prepared <i>pari passu</i> to destroy their own export trade, is what Deputy Bennett honestly thinks they can do, and that is to cut out or to grievously restrict&mdash;I do not want to exaggerate it&mdash;the import of non-Commonwealth meat.  If they cannot restrict the import of non-Commonwealth beef for the purpose of raising the price of beef in the English market, what else can they do?  I am asking.  I want to know.  What else can they do?  If any Deputy will tell me anything they could do, I will take the responsibility of his answer.</P>

      <P>Let us assume now, for a moment, that England does intend that her agricultural producers shall, in spite of us, have a fair run in their own market whether we are friendly with them or not.  I think they will agree that that is the proposition.  We start now with three years cattle.  We have nowhere else to send them but to England.  We have, according to the Deputies opposite, shown that rather than destroy them, rather than have 400,000 of them lying dead in the fields in September, we are prepared to export them at a price which Deputy Bennett and others say, and honestly believe, is an utterly uneconomic one. Now, what would happen if we had done that?  Assume for a moment that, without any unfriendly feeling whatsoever on the part of England, with no quotas and no restrictions, we had sent over our cattle to the amount to which we previously had sent them.  The dominant fact is the lack of demand for beef.  It had not disappeared but it had fallen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would happen with a constant supply into a market, with falling demand and falling price?  What is the reaction of a falling price on anyone <Col N="996" /> who can keep his stuff?  His tendency is to restrict his exports to that market, and, therefore, the price comes to some balance.  What is the reaction of a falling price on a man who cannot keep his cattle?  None.  He has still got to export them.  There is a falling demand, a further increase of the offered goods over the demand, and the market goes down.  The market would have gone down day by day and every day until the price in the English market would be the price at which we have shown that we were prepared to export our first year's cattle rather than keep them.  Is there any answer to that?  We had to get rid of that year's cattle, and remember you had the menace of two more years' cattle coming.  If you were not prepared to destroy the cattle you had to export them.  You had to export them in face of a falling demand.  You further had to export them in face of a continually falling price.  The price in the English market, if there were no tariffs, and if there were no quotas, would have gone down to the price at which we now export, and which, we are told, is uneconomic.  I see no escape from that point of view.  But the British were not prepared to allow that to happen.  They were not even prepared to allow the price to fall to the level to which it fell under the protection and behind the wall of a 40 per cent. tariff.  Were they going to allow it to fall to the level to which it would have fallen without any tariff?  They would have had to do something.  They would either have had to say &ldquo;the result of the National Government's agricultural policy is beef at the price at which it is sold in Ireland to-day&rdquo; or they would have had to do precisely the things that Thomas did out of malice and that Elliott did out of economy.</P>

Deputy Burke, like Deputy MacDermot, hates scurrility. He does not like that sort of thing. Yet his description of a Minister is, &ldquo;red-hot fury of blind hysterics.&rdquo;  Of course, Deputy MacDermot was not there to restrain his language, but I have no doubt that later on a curtain lecture will be delivered to Deputy Burke.  In fact, I have no doubt that gradually the Party opposite will learn to appreciate the necessity of living up to the standard of hating scurrility which is represented by Deputy MacDermot, in a recent speech, describing his opponents' brains as maggoty.</P>

      <P>I am only dealing with the fact that there is under the legal system, under the authority of this Dáil, a Tribunal under which can be tried as a matter of fact whether there is or is not a conspiracy to pay or not to pay rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to try whether or not a number of men are members of that organisation; or whether or not they have conspired together for the purpose of carrying out the objects of that organisation in a conspiracy not to pay rates.  That Tribunal has met, that Tribunal has heard the evidence, that Tribunal has had before it men who say they did not belong to the organisation which conspired to organise the non-payment of rates. They have been there to say that they did not conspire to organise the non-payment of rates.  But that Tribunal, set up by our opponents, every man on which our opponents nominated, has given a verdict that every one of them did conspire and do belong to an organisation set up for the purpose of conspiring and organising not to pay rates in this country.  Yet we are told that the non-payment of rates is not due to a conspiracy.</P>

      <P>That is not what the Deputy is at.  There are certain individuals who have been found guilty of a certain illegality, and they have been punished for it.  They are not whining about it, but they do not want another false charge levelled against them in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A crime.  Certain people have been found guilty of an illegality! Not merely do we hate scurrility, but we love using delicate words.  That Tribunal was not set up to find people guilty of an illegality.  The whole legal organisation of this country, the whole authority of the existing courts, was not deliberately voided for a purpose of that kind; the whole Constitution was not suspended merely for that purpose.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  To the best of my belief, nobody has been found guilty by the Military Tribunal of conspiring not to pay rates, and I doubt if anybody has been so charged.  I submit that the whole of the references to the Military Tribunal have been utterly irrelevant to the debate.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to keep the Parliamentary Secretary to the subject-matter of the motion.  The points raised with reference to the decision of the Military Tribunal are not points of order, and I am not in a position to give a decision upon them; I do not propose to make reference to them.  I will ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep as clear of that matter as possible.  He surely can deal with this motion without incursions into paths of doubtful relevancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the people of Cork County will <Col N="1002" /> have to pay £180,000 in rates for the action of those people, and the sooner that sinks home the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that in human affairs people do not live in watertight compartments.  A tax, for instance, which is collected into a central fund goes, as to millions of it, to the relief of rates.  Annuities, when they are not paid, are a direct withdrawal of that amount of money from the local fund, which can otherwise only be implemented by rates, and, therefore, a conspiracy not to pay annuities is a conspiracy to deplete the local revenue of an equivalent amount of rates.  That money has to be found by rates afterwards, or the local authority has to be without the money. There is no difference whatever in actual effect between conspiring to prevent the payment of rates directly into the treasury of the local authority and conspiring to prevent annuities being paid to a central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What these people have been found guilty of is conspiring to produce the condition which Deputy Corry has described in which the County Council of Cork is depleted of £180,000 of rates.  If anyone thinks there is any satisfaction in that distinction, they have got it now in black and white. These are the people who are asking to have a certain thing relieved.  The agricultural grant automatically is reduced by the amount of which those 14 splendid and famous men succeeded in depleting the land purchase annuity fund.  Deputies know it perfectly well and it is a foolish attempt to evade the issue to pretend that they do not.  Deputy Burke proceeded with his argument, and here again Deputy MacDermot's delightful appreciation of the refinements and the beauty of cultivated parliamentary speech will enable him to appreciate the reference.  He spoke of swilling the milk of paradise; the pig sticking his nose into the trough of heaven.  Now, what does Deputy MacDermot think of that from the point of view of scurrility, or is it merely banality, or is it that standard of high, almost semi-divine, parliamentary <Col N="1003" /> eloquence on which he is trying to train up the young neophytes behind him?</P>

      <P>No, Deputy Burke is not a bag; at the present moment he is a farmer; he must be treated as a farmer and he speaks with an authority on the distress of farmers which no one else except a barrister is allowed to assume.  The Deputy proceeded to castigate the occupants of the front bench here.  Having described the Minister for Agriculture as having made a vain and rather vacuous attempt to enter for once upon the path of humour, he turned to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Do you know what he actually said about the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  I want those who believe in refined speech <Col N="1004" /> just to imagine the extent of it.  He actually said the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not honest. Just let that sink in.  To what level has Parliamentary decency sunk, to what disreputable level or disregard for the decencies of debate have we sunk, when a member of the Opposition will actually describe a Minister here as not honest?  All I can say is that if we are to take as an authority, in relation to that, Deputy Coburn, who used to sit upon the top benches, we should have great heart, because Deputy Coburn on one occasion in this House told us that the economic distress in the country would drive us into honesty.  We have the authority of the whole of the Opposition, the undivided, the unanimous authority of the whole of the Opposition, that whatever else exists in this country, there does not exist a condition which has driven this Government into honesty.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned accordingly.</P>
