      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce (1) if a decision has yet been arrived at by his Department in connection with the increases in fares recently made by the Dublin United Tramways Company; and, if so, if he will make a statement in the matter; and (2) if by virtue of the powers conferred on him he will take steps with a view to (a) having the distances increased for the different fares and a greater number of penny fares introduced on each route; and (b) the general adoption of return fares and of special rates for school children on all services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my Department's investigation has gone, the recent increases in tram and bus fares do not appear to be justified, and the matter is still under consideration with the tramway company.  Part (2) (a) of the question appears to be covered by the consideration relating to part (1).</P>
      <P>With regard to part (2) (b) I understand that special rates for school children are generally available, and that the general adoption of return fares by the tramway company is not practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware of the grave dissatisfaction that exists among the general public regarding the system under which the increased fares are operating at present?  In the case of wage earners, they are deprived of the opportunity which they had previously of being able to make the journey in and out of the city to their meals, as the result of the increased fares has been to impose too heavy a burden on them.  In addition to that, school children in the new housing areas, owing to the lack of accommodation in the local schools, have to go to schools in the city, and a great many complaints are being received by reason of the fact that many of these children are constantly being drenched with rain at the present time since they are not able to pay these increased fares. Does the Minister not think that, in some special circumstances such as these, the rate should be reduced from <Col N="1061" /> what it is?  At the present time the rate is half-fare, and that means 2d. per journey to children where the ordinary fare is 4d.</P>

      <P>The main cause of delay in promulgating a scheme of pensions under the terms of the Defence Forces Pensions Act, 1932, was due to the fact that certain provisions in the proposed scheme regarding non-commissioned officers and soldiers were affected by the enactment of the Widows and Orphans Pensions Act, 1935, and until these matters had been settled it was not found possible to deal with other points in the scheme regarding officers. These points are now the subject of inter-departmental consideration, and it is hoped that a definite decision will soon be reached so as to permit of the promulgation of the scheme at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 22, Section 3 (1), to insert after the word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; the words &ldquo;nor undertakings engaged in the production and distribution of newspapers daily.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> I realise that the Minister is sympathetic with the position of the newspapers, because he has an amendment down, amendment No. 10, which deals with the newspapers.  Unfortunately, amendment No. 10 applies only to overtime.  I do not suppose anybody wants to hamper the newspapers and everybody realises that the newspapers are in a somewhat different position from an ordinary industrial undertaking.  Newspaper proprietors must get the newspaper out on time, and whether it is a speech or a disaster, or whatever it may be, the paper has to be got ready for circulation and if it is not in the hands of readers on time it is absolutely no use so far as the newspapers and the readers are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to understand the position of the newspapers.  For instance, under the Bill there is no definition of a shift.  While, for instance, it might be considered that on a newspaper perhaps a considerable section of employees are engaged on ordinary day work, there is another section of workers who are employed at different hours of the night.  In agreements that exist between newspaper companies and their employees both day work and night work are referred to as shift work.  If that is so, the Minister's amendment is useless, because a person or an undertaking is not allowed to work more than nine hours on any particular shift.  No overtime of any sort is allowed in that connection. That is why I suggest the Minister ought to define what a shift is.  For instance, the day work is carried out during the ordinary time of the day and in times of extra pressure some overtime is worked.  If that is to be described as a shift the newspapers would be unable to get the extra amount of work done which they may require from time to time.  I would like the Minister to go very fully into that question and explain what would be the difficulty in giving the newspapers an exemption from the provisions of this measure.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that it is not a case of a body of employers imposing hardships on a small and unorganised section of workers.  I am sure the newspapers have not any <Col N="1077" /> desire to treat their employees unfairly or to be put in any extraordinary position with regard to working their employees.  On the other hand, the employees are well organised and very stringent regulations have been drawn up governing the production of newspapers. Perhaps it would be possible, as some of us thought some time ago, for a number of these agreements to be brought in and registered by the Minister where the conditions were not repugnant to the Conditions of Employment Bill, but the Minister is well aware that very special difficulties would arise under that head.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I wish to touch upon, namely, an extension of the shift question.  No doubt the newspapers have men working off and on during the 24 hours, but they have a large number who work during the day and other workers come on for very short periods.  It is expressly forbidden in this Bill for a worker to work in two shifts when they follow each other.  Most of us would agree with that provision; but there are cases where men are taken on only for a certain period.  Is a very skilled man forbidden to work only half an hour in each of two consecutive shifts? With regard to other cases, some of them seem to merit very special investigation on the part of the Minister. For instance, I understand that it is a fairly common occurrence for certain newspaper employees to work from 2 in the morning until 7 o'clock.  It is the practice for some of them, at any rate, to come in from 4 until 6 o'clock in the afternoon, making a total of seven hours.  Would the Minister consider that excessive?  Is that expressly forbidden, and what are the newspapers to do in the circumstances?</P>
    <P>Another matter that has not been remedied is the compulsory half-day. It is laid down that a worker has to get a half-day in the week, but according to the laws that operate in the case of evening papers, if that is to be rigidly enforced there will have to be a day on which no evening newspaper will be produced.  I do not suggest that the fact that these difficulties have not been foreseen means anything more than that newspapers are a very <Col N="1078" /> special business working very special hours, and they are more or less a class apart from an ordinary industrial undertaking.  Under these circumstances I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment exempting newspaper companies from the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell.  I gathered from the Minister last week, when discussing some other amendments, and arising out of some suggestions thrown out by me, that he did not intend to victimise, or perhaps I should say, to handicap, in any way, any industrial production in this country.  The Minister must be aware that there are sufficient handicaps on the newspaper industry already, and that they suffer a good deal from competition with cross-Channel newspapers. If the law is to be as proposed in this Bill it certainly would handicap newspaper production.  I want to say that both proprietors and operatives in the industry would be very anxious, if possible, to abolish overtime altogether.  But overtime is incidental to the production of morning and evening newspapers, so that I hope this amendment will be accepted by the Minister.  I felt early on in these debates that the Minister did not want to add any handicap to those already existing in connection with newspaper production.  The Minister must be aware that the newspaper industry, and the newspaper business generally, is in quite a different category from that of ordinary industrial concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already pointed out that overtime is incidental to the production of newspapers.  I gave an illustration last week of how an evening newspaper, or a morning newspaper, that wants to give the latest and most up-to-date news to the public must have some men working overtime.  The Minister might insert a provision or a licence to work overtime from time to time, but he must be aware that in regard to such matters as sweepstakes, a general election and other events that occur, it is absolutely essential that men should be brought back to do overtime work if Irish newspapers are to hold their own in Dublin and <Col N="1079" /> in Cork against outside competition. Take the case of operatives engaged on a Dublin or Cork evening newspaper. They will ordinarily finish their duty about five in the evening.  There is no night duty done on Saturday except in the case of a paper like the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  In addition to the ordinary news, a Saturday evening paper has to keep some operatives for extra hours on duty to supply the late football news and so on.  In the case of a paper like the <i>Sunday Independent</i> the men must, of course, come in and work up to midnight in order to deal with the news.  There are many other considerations which I am sure will have the consideration of the Minister.  He must know that the production of a newspaper is not like the building of a house.  You can stop at any portion of the work of building a house, and the same is true of any other industrial undertaking which this Bill is intended to serve.  But in newspaper production the delay or stopping of work for ten or 20 minutes might mean that a train or bus connection might be lost.  Because of these circumstances I suggest to the Minister that newspaper production is not on a par with other industries and should not be included in Section 3 of this Bill.  I am quite certain if the Minister was fully conversant with all the facts relating to newspaper production, he would accept the amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell.  I said that newspaper proprietors, as well as those engaged as operatives in the industry, would be very glad indeed if they could get rid of overtime which is incidental to their work; but the exigencies of newspaper work are altogether different from any other kind of work.</P>
    <P>A point not mentioned by Deputy Dockrell, and which I would like to mention is this: Those engaged in the profession of newspaper production have slightly better conditions than exist in other undertakings in the country.  They have higher rates of pay, and they get two or three weeks' holidays.  In some cases they get two weeks' holidays and three weeks' pay. The pay is relatively good, and they <Col N="1080" /> have amenities that do not apply to other industries in the country.  All this goes to show that long before this Bill came into existence, a fortnight's holidays, and other amenities not mentioned in this Bill, applied in the newspaper industry.  All these things show that this industry should be eliminated from the operations of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  There are things in the Act which are the minimum requirements of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the newspaper profession you have three or four different kinds of labour involved.  Even a reporter, who may be engaged for seven or eight hours on duty for his newspaper, might be compelled, as the Bill is now drafted, to involve his employer in trouble if he found he had to work three or four hours extra.  Many of these journalists, returning from a horse show, or a race meeting, have to write up their copy when they get back to the office.  It is not quite clear in the Bill whether that section of the profession is exempt or not. There are others such as editors and sub-editors who have different hours. Then there are lino operators engaged at day and night work.  There are stereotypers and compositors on night and day work.  There are continual shifts working through the day and night in different operations in the newspaper offices of this country and in every other country where morning and evening papers are produced.  I feel when the Minister examines these things and is fully acquainted with the facts he will agree to the amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>I ask the Minister not to accept this amendment.  The object of the amendment is to exclude the production of newspapers entirely from the scope of the Conditions of Employment Bill and, of course, the primary object of the Bill is to provide for certain minimum conditions in respect of hours of work, in respect of holidays, in respect of rates of wages, in respect of the working week and the working day, and in respect of the employment of young children.

      <P>I would say, if the Deputy is speaking for one of them, it is only for one, and I very much doubt even then that any case can be made by the Deputy or anybody else for the exclusion of newspaper production from the scope of this Bill.  The Deputy says that at present the trade unions have certain minimum conditions which are better than the conditions in this Bill.  That was not always so.  There was a time when another condition of affairs existed, and it would be well for the trade unions to have, at all events, those minimum rates enshrined in legislation lest they might again experience some of the difficulties which they experienced in the past.  Deputy Anthony talked of the difficulties that are experienced in newspaper production. He seems to have completely ignored the fact that there is provision made in this Bill for meeting difficulties of the kind he referred to. He might make a case about difficulty which would be imposed on newspaper production if there were restriction on the working of overtime, but if the Deputy looks at Sections 40 and 41 of <Col N="1082" /> the Bill he will find that uncontrolled overtime is permitted within a reasonable maximum, and that even apart from uncontrolled overtime the Minister has power to grant a permit for overtime even in excess of the fairly generous limits laid down in Section 40 of the Bill.  Deputy Dockrell talked about the difficulties of shift work production in regard to newspapers. Of course the newspapers are entitled under the Bill to make application for the grant of a shift work licence, which brings them into the scope of the facilities granted in this Bill in the case of forms of industrial work where shift work is in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  Does the Deputy think that is unreasonable? If it is going to be shift work, it is going to be shift work.  Then it means three shifts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But it can surely.  The case made by Deputy Dockrell is a case made from the point of view, I think, in the main, of the people who are responsible in a managerial sense for newspaper production, but it surprises me when Deputy Anthony comes in to support him in a claim for the exclusion from this Bill of the minimum conditions which are enshrined in this Bill and made applicable to all workers engaged in the form of industrial work set out in Section 3 of the Bill. I believe there is a strong case for regulation in every industry.  I believe a strong case could be made for the establishment of minimum conditions in every industry.  Deputy Anthony attempts to pick out newspaper production as one of the forms of industrial work on which there is going to be no regulation through this Bill, but leave the matter to the free play&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Anthony that if there are practical difficulties to be met in the application <Col N="1085" /> of this Bill to the newspaper production industry there are facilities provided for in the Bill to enable the industry to get over such real difficulties as must be met when this Bill comes into operation, but that is not a case for excluding newspaper production from the scope of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will insist that, in respect of newspaper production, there will be the same kind of regulation as in every other industry, so far as it is practicable to impose that regulation on newspaper production. I think if Deputy Anthony had studied the various exclusionary provisions of the Bill he would have seen that it is not necessary for him to support Deputy Dockrell's amendment in order to get over the difficulties which he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to accept this amendment, nor do I think any case has been made for it.  In fact, Deputy Dockrell in proposing it did not attempt to make such a case.  He did make a case bearing upon the sections of the Bill dealing with hours of work, but that is obviously a matter which we can discuss in relation to amendment No. 10, which covers that case, and not a matter which relates to the Bill as a whole.  The Deputy's proposal, I take it, is to exclude the printing of daily newspapers from the whole of the Bill&mdash;not merely from the sections dealing with hours of work or overtime or the short day, but from all the sections of the Bill.  No case has been made for that, either by Deputy Dockrell or Deputy Anthony or by the representatives of the Newspaper Managers' Association.  We recognise, and have always recognised, that the peculiar conditions under which a newspaper industry works would necessitate the exclusion of that form of work from the provisions of Section 37 of the Bill.  That section had another number on the last stage. We contemplated that exclusion being effected under Section 28, but having regard to the apprehensions which have been expressed I am bringing forward an amendment now to exclude the printing of newspapers from the scope of Section 37.  That exclusion also operates, of course, to exclude <Col N="1086" /> that form of work from the provisions in respect of the short day, and also the provisions in respect of overtime, other than the obligation of paying the overtime rate.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of the daily newspaper printing industry from the overtime regulations is required because of the circumstances existing rather than because of any arguments that might be advanced upon general grounds.  Under present conditions, the agreements between the trade unions and the newspaper managers require that a printer when employed for any portion of a week must be employed for a full week, and that, coupled with the fact that there is no unemployment in the industry, means that at present a fairly substantial amount of overtime is worked, particularly in the production of certain classes of newspapers.  In any event, the arrangements which exist in respect of these daily newspapers between the managers and the unions are quite satisfactory in all respects at present and, consequently, there is no reason why we should feel that undesirable results will follow from the adoption of amendment No. 10.  But whatever case has been made deals with that particular matter only.  No case whatever has been made by anybody for the exclusion of newspapers from the other provisions of the Bill to which Deputy Norton has made reference. The effect of amendment No. 10, as I said, is to exclude the printing of newspapers from the limits in respect of hours of work fixed by Section 37. It also excludes them from the provisions in respect of the short day and the provisions in respect of overtime other than the payment of the overtime rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The printing of newspapers, of course, is not a continuous process, nor does it really come under the section dealing with licensed shift work.  If no amendment were made in the Bill, or no exclusion regulations made under Section 28, newspaper printing would, I think, come under Section 37.  Obviously Section 37 does not apply to the conditions of that industry and, therefore, the amendment <Col N="1087" /> is being introduced.  But if the amendment were not introduced at this stage, the conditions could still have been met by exclusion regulations under Section 28.  As it is obvious that these exclusion regulations would have to be made in any case, it is as well to deal with the position by an amendment of the Bill rather than let the Bill pass in its present form and deal with the matter by exclusion regulations.  I have heard no argument from anybody as to why the printing of daily newspapers should be excluded from any other provisions of the Bill much less from the whole measure, therefore, I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 4 (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every licence granted under this section shall be expressed to provide that the person carrying on the undertaking to which it relates shall be required to conform to regulations not less favourable to the workers employed in such undertaking than the provisions of the enactments mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 4 it is provided that where the amount of any form of industrial work to be done in the carrying on of any undertaking is so small that, in the opinion of the Minister, the provisions of this Act cannot be conveniently applied to the employment of such workers in such form of industrial work, the Minister is empowered to grant a licence entitling such an employer to employ workers outside the provisions of the Act.  When we were discussing that matter on the Committee Stage and on the Recommittal Stage, the Minister indicated that he only intended that section to deal with the case of an industry outside the scope of the categories of work defined in Section 3, yet where industrial work might be performed in the establishment. Even in respect of that form of industrial work carried on in an <Col N="1088" /> establishment of that kind which the Minister desired to exclude from Section 4, there is at present certain protection provided under the Factory and Workshops Acts and under some of the other Acts referred to in the Schedule to the Bill.  If, therefore, these Acts are repealed, either in whole or in part, by this Bill, such protection as they afford the workers will be of little use to them, since the sections of the Factory Acts have been repealed in the first instance, and there will not be protection for such workers under this Bill, because they will be excluded from the scope of the Bill.  I think in granting a licence to an employer within the scope of Section 4, the Minister ought to take power to provide for the workers engaged in that form of industrial work conditions as favourable as under the enactments that will be repealed by the Schedule to the Bill.  I hope the Minister will see his way to meet the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is putting forward this amendment under a misunderstanding.  The only case in which the Minister would give the exclusion licence mentioned in Section 4 (2) is where the amount of industrial work done in the carrying on of an undertaking is so small that factory legislation cannot be applied at all, and in fact the workers are not really industrial workers.  Again, I will give the one case which prompted the introduction of this section&mdash;the shop assistant in Woolworth's who operates an automatic machine for the printing of visiting cards.  The mere fact that one assistant is operating that machine printing visiting cards made the whole place a factory under the existing Acts and necessitated the application of the provisions of the Factory Acts to it. That was obviously an impossible situation. In fact, the worker concerned could not be described as an industrial worker in any strict sense.  In such a case it is not practicable to apply factory legislation.  In so far as legislation is required for the protection of the conditions of employment of such workers, it is legislation which would bring within its scope commercial employees rather than industrial <Col N="1089" /> employees, and that is why, in excluding these very occasional classes of workers from the scope of this Bill under a licence under Section 4, we are doing so because they are not properly capable of being regarded as industrial workers at all.  Any question that might arise about the protection of their interests is one which must be dealt with in a measure which will bring all commercial employees within its scope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that it is not the proportion which the amount of industrial work bears to the total amount of work done, but whether the amount of work is so small that the provisions of the Act cannot be conveniently applied.  If the amount of work done is so small that the Act cannot be applied they can be excluded.  But the fact that half a dozen workers in a concern which employs 1,000 were only engaged in industrial work would not justify the exclusion of these workers from the scope of the Act if the provisions of the Act can be applied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Where the employment of a worker with a particular employer is interrupted by reason of the illness of such worker, the temporary cessation of the work on which he is so employed, the temporary reduction of the weekly quantity of such work, or any other temporary cause not due to the act or default of such worker, such worker shall, for the purpose of reckoning any period of continuous employment with such employer within the meaning of any section of this Act, be deemed to have been in the employment of such employer during such interruption if, but only if, the following conditions are complied with, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at the end of such interruption such worker returns to employment with the employer with whom he had been employed immediately before such interruption, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such worker is not employed in any form of industrial work during such interruption, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the duration of such interruption does not exceed one month.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that we had a discussion upon the significance to be attached to the terms &ldquo;continuously employed&rdquo; or &ldquo;continuously in the employment of an employer&rdquo; and it was urged strongly here that an attempt at a definition of these terms should be made.  I was opposed to making the attempt because I had some idea of the difficulties involved; but having regard to the representations made, and, in fact, to the desirability of having such a definition, if it could be conveniently drawn up, I produced this amendment.  This amendment proposes that, where the employment of a worker with a particular employer is interrupted by reason of the illness of the worker, by temporary stoppage of the work on which he is so employed, or by the temporary reduction in the quantity of the work upon which he is employed, or any other temporary cause not due to the act of the worker, then, for the purpose of reckoning continuity of employment, such worker, nevertheless, will be deemed to be continuously employed if, at the end of the interruption, <Col N="1091" /> the worker returns to the employment of the employer with whom he had been employed previously; if during the period of interruption he had not entered into a contract of employment with another employer, and if the duration of any one period of interruption did not exceed one month.</P>
    <P>That definition of continuous employment, of course, must be related to the sections of the Bill in which the phrase is used, namely, the sections dealing with the annual holiday, where the qualification is set out for receiving the right to an annual holiday.  As the Bill will stand, if this amendment is inserted in it, the worker, in order to qualify for the annual period, will have to comply with two conditions: first, that he has been continuously employed in accordance with this amendment, and, secondly, that he has worked for 1,800 hours or for whatever number of hours may be fixed in respect of his class of work.  I think that this is as satisfactory a definition as it is possible to get, and, on the whole, I think it is better to have it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is merely trying to justify an interpretation which, on reconsideration, I think he will realise is not a fair interpretation. Deputy Dockrell asks whether a person, who has met with an accident in the course of or arising out of his employment, would be excluded from the benefits of this section if he were absent for a month.  I think that the Minister should meet specially the case of people who meet with accidents in the course of their employment; and the duration provided for in paragraph (c) need not apply in the case of a person <Col N="1093" /> who meets with an accident on duty and is in receipt of benefit under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the provision of holidays, and the proportion of worked time&mdash;the six days in the year and public holidays&mdash;that is a calculable factor.  Perhaps it is not a matter of deadly accuracy, but it is at least a calculable factor.  We all sympathise with the man who has had an accident, but if you adopt the principle that people who have accidents are to be provided for, in connection with holidays, independent of whether they work or not, you are going to take the calculation of what it is going to cost the employer and, eventually, the public, from a calculable thing to an incalculable thing. I think the Minister has met this case very fairly.  It is conceivable that you could have all sorts of difficulties arising and all sorts of loopholes which would need to be provided for.  This is provided for very late in the day and it is conceivable that you would have all sorts of loopholes.  You might have a man laid up for a month or six weeks, and then he might be called up to the Colours for another six weeks, and eventually you might have quite a large number of people in employment who had actually not worked at all but who were still in benefit, to use a trade term, for holidays. I do not think the Minister ought to go further than he has provided for in this amendment at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to give this matter further consideration.  Security against abuse is provided in the provision as to the number of hours the man must have worked previously.  If a man got work on the 1st January and on the 31st December, as in the case the Minister mentions, he would have to have 1,800 hours, or whatever the number of hours fixed, before he would be entitled to benefit.  If you leave loopholes for employers, you will have men, who have been ten or 20 years in one employment and who meet with <Col N="1094" /> an accident, being deprived of their holidays because they could not resume work inside of the month.  If they came back in, say, six weeks, that being the earliest time their doctor allowed them to come back to work, you will have these men being picked out to be deprived of their holidays under this section, while their fellow-workers are enjoying their holidays. You might have more than one man injured in an accident, through the collapse of a scaffold or through some other similar cause, and these men would be deprived of holidays under this section when, obviously, they have suffered enough already through the accident, which might have been the result of the negligence of the employer in not providing sufficient safeguards for their health and safety.  Surely, in such circumstances, these men ought not to be penalised.  If there is a possibility of abuses, I think the Minister can easily avoid them, but as the Bill stands now, it is going to inflict very grave hardship and cause such anomalies as I have referred to, where you have some employees getting their holidays and their comrades being deprived of their holidays at a time when they would most need a holiday in order to recuperate after the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for leaving the term &ldquo;continuously employed&rdquo; undefined and letting a commonsense interpretation be applied to it, having regard to the other sections in the Bill.  Immediately you introduce a definition you have to impose restrictions.  The question is whether or not the amended interpretation is sufficiently long to define &ldquo;continuous employment.&rdquo;  I think you must regard continuity of employment as broken if the interruption exceeds one month.  That probably will apply in some cases in a manner which we might regard as unfair to the workers but the number of such cases will be comparatively small whereas the effectiveness of the definition is a more important consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> In page 6, line 8, Section 6 (3), after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a matter which we debated at some length in the second Committee Stage.  It is provided in Section 6 (3) that &ldquo;Any employer may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons in his employment, substitute in any year any of the following days for any of the days mentioned or deemed to be mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section&rdquo;; and then certain holidays are specified.  I want to ensure that the right of the employer as provided for in this Bill is not implemented in a vindictive or capricious way.  Under the powers conferred upon the employer in this section it may conceivably happen that if a particular city or town generally observes a bank holiday one employer may say, without regard to the local convenience of the people and without regard to the desire of his own workers, that he is not going to accept the local bank holiday and that if his workers are not working on that day he is not going to pay them though every other employer in the district may exempt his workers from work on that day and pay them for it.  It may also happen that if an employer wanted to be particularly &ldquo;cussed&rdquo; he could select all kinds of Church holidays instead of a reasonable bank holiday in respect of which he proposes to pay his workers.  I am trying to ensure that there is some kind of consideration given to the convenience of the workers in this matter and that an employer should not be allowed to say, without any regard to the convenience of his workers, that he was going to require them to work, say, on the first Monday in August and give them as an alternative bank holiday, Ascension Thursday in the following year.  He is empowered to do that under the Bill as it stands and if an employer were to so act, he would be acting in a vexatious manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will find the word &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; in the Bill at all.  At all events, what I want to ensure is that when a vague provision substitutes for a bank holiday a Church holiday there will be some advertence to the convenience of the workers.  With that view I want to insert certain words in this section which will provide&mdash;that substitution will only take place with the consent of the Minister.  If the Minister's consent is necessary then we may be sure that the representations made by the workers against giving consent to the substitution will reach the Minister and that he may be able to consider their convenience and to say why the substitution should not be permitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at considerable length at an earlier stage and I indicated the reasons why I thought the selection of six public holidays should be left to the employer in each case.  The employer has the responsibility for carrying on the business, and considerations bearing upon the effective carrying on of the business cannot be ignored.  It would be administratively impossible for the Minister himself to undertake the responsibility of examining the circumstances of every case and giving or withholding his consent to the employer's proposal.  I think it is not unreasonable that the person responsible for the business and for determining whether the volume of business at a particular period of the year or the need of the work likely to be forthcoming makes it desirable or undesirable that public holidays or Church holidays should be observed, provided that the statutory obligation of giving six holidays is complied with. I think the Bill is better as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 28, Section 6 (4), before paragraph (b), to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the day substituted for any day mentioned or deemed to be mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section shall be the day mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section which is immediately following the day for which it is so substituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that there shall be some equity towards the workers in the matter of substituting Church holidays for public holidays.  In the section certain holidays are set out as public holidays, and the employer is empowered to substitute for any one of the six named holidays in sub-section (1) any of the Church holidays set out in sub-section (3).  Because of the very unsatisfactory way in which the section is drafted, and the considerable looseness which is imported into it, it is possible for an employer to say to a worker one month before Easter Monday: &ldquo;Take notice that I am not going to pay you for Easter Monday.  If you want to get paid for that day you must work that <Col N="1099" /> day, and in lieu of that I will pay you for the 8th December.&rdquo;  The worker would have a paid holiday which he would ordinarily get on Easter Monday abolished; he would be required to work that day if he wanted to get wages for that day, and in lieu he would get paid in respect of the 8th December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he has power, on a month's notice, to substitute a Church holiday.  He may say to the worker that instead of having a holiday on the first Monday in August he would give him a holiday with pay on the 8th of December.  If the worker chooses to object, as he is entitled to do, the Minister does not want to impose any restriction upon the employer and does not want to claim for himself any right to be consulted. Not merely is the employer entitled to make the substitute, but he can make it without consulting the convenience of his worker, so that the employer can deprive the worker of his paid holiday in March or April or August and give him a paid holiday instead in December. If dismissed in the meantime after the substitution of the 8th of December for March or the first Monday in August, no provision is made in the Bill whereby the worker would be paid.  I think if there is any case for the substitution of Church holidays for bank holidays&mdash;and from our knowledge of several places where Church holidays are preferred, we know a strong case can be made for the substitution of Church holidays for bank <Col N="1100" /> holidays&mdash;it should be substitution that would replace the nearest Church holiday for the nearest bank holiday. I think the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says this section as it stands will enable the employer to substitute a holiday in December for one in August.  But that also makes it possible for him to substitute a holiday in August for one in December, and the Deputy is trying to prevent that.  I see no reason to prevent that.  If the Deputy's amendment were carried, three or four holidays in sub-section (2) would have to be deleted altogether, because they could never be observed under the Deputy's amendment.  It is quite possible that there might be a general desire on the part both of the employers and the workers for one of those holidays to be observed in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that desire is expressed, will the Minister meet it and only allow the substitution then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I already expressed the opinion that any enlightened employer would consult local practice and the convenience of his workers so far as his business will allow him, and select those holidays that conform to them. I doubt very much that there will be a case of an employer who would attempt to use the power of substitution in the vindictive manner now suggested and who would get away with it.  I think the Deputy knows that is so, and that the certain element of discretion given is desirable and in regard to the particular practice observed in different parts of the country&mdash;in most parts of the country&mdash;the Church holidays most anxious to be observed would not be observed under the Deputy's amendment.</P>

The section provides for an over-riding maximum period of 1800 hours, which must be worked in one year by any worker in order to qualify for the annual holiday. <Col N="1103" /> It was pointed out that that number of hours was related to a 48-hours' week, and would be less applicable to the circumstances of an industry in which work was ordinarily shorter or became shorter in consequence of the regulations made under this Bill, so this amendment is brought forward in order to permit of a variation in that number of hours in relation to particular classes of industries in respect of which it would not be applicable.</P>

      <P>Before amendment No. 7 is taken, might I call the Minister's attention to a correction that seems to be necessary in Section 19, sub-section (3), line 7, page 11? The word &ldquo;he&rdquo; appears to have been omitted before the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; that seems to be required.  The words &ldquo;such person&rdquo; should be inserted.  I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, before Section 23 (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any worker, during any period of annual leave to which he is entitled under this section, to do for reward any industrial work of the same form as the industrial work in which he was employed immediately before such period of annual leave, and if any worker does any industrial work in contravention of this sub-section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
      <P>On the previous stage, Deputy Norton proposed that it should not be lawful for a worker to do any other form of work during his period of annual leave. I indicated certain objections to that provision.  I accepted the desirability of prohibiting such a worker from doing work similar to that on which he was ordinarily employed, but I felt that it was desirable to leave him free to take certain classes of work which might be a form of recreation.  I indicated that I would endeavour to produce an amendment expressing that point of view.</P>
      <P>This is the amendment, and it proposes to prohibit a worker during the period of his annual leave from doing the same form of industrial work as that in which he was employed immediately before the period of such leave. I think that is as far as we can go in the matter.  It deals with the particular case raised, where there is a shortage of skilled workers at the present time, and there might be considerable inducement held out to these skilled workers, enjoying a period of annual leave from one employer, to take employment with another in the same class of work.  It goes no further than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>On this amendment, I desire to say a word in defence of something that is perishing from this country, as it is perishing from every other country where the bureaucrat <Col N="1105" /> reigns supreme, and that is in defence of individual liberty.  I regard it as a monstrous infringement of the individual liberty of working-men in this country that this House should undertake to regulate, not only the conditions that shall obtain when they are at work&mdash;there could be no defence made for that&mdash;but that we should pursue them into their leisure hours and proceed to regulate where they will spend the time which is their own.  No Party in this House would advance a demand that the time of an employer should be regulated as to his occupation during his leisure.  No one in this House could defend on its merits a suggestion that we should pry into the personal affairs of any citizen simply because he earns his living by the sweat of his brow.  I have heard it stated by a very distinguished defender of democracy that democracy amounts to saying, whether a tyrant be a king, a demagogue or a dictator, &ldquo;let him look out.&rdquo;  In that category of kings, demagogues and dictators, I think it is very necessary in this country to add bureaucrats.</P>
      <P>It is a source of astonishment to me that members of the Labour Party should allow this House to be invoked for the purpose of branding the working-men of this country as a suitable group for restraint of the kind envisaged in this amendment.  Surely the fact that a man works does not rob him of his personal dignity, or all right to be looked upon as an independent man capable of regulating his own life, capable of recognising his own obligations to his neighbours.  Why should we assume that because a man is a working-man he is going to betray the interests of his neighbours and unjustly take from his neighbour a day's work or a week's work which he believes his neighbour is entitled to?  That is the assumption enshrined in this amendment. Are we going to send it out from this House that our considered judgment of the working-men of this country is that unless we regulate them and prohibit them from doing what would ordinarily be a perfectly legitimate thing to do in their leisure time, they will so far encroach upon their neighbour's means of livelihood that it is necessary to check them by legislative action of this character?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> I know of no precedent in the legislation of this country, for an attempt to interfere with a man's enjoyment of his leisure and to do an act which in itself is perfectly legal during his leisure time. There is no precedent for it.  I urge on the Labour Party even now to point out to the Minister that they are not prepared to accept the principle enshrined in this amendment, although in the past they have been led to believe that this amendment would remedy what appeared at first glance to be a potential evil.  I urge on them that there is no serious danger of evil arising, and that, whatever evil might accrue from leaving complete liberty to the working-men in their leisure time, the evil of depriving them of that liberty, of interfering with their personal affairs, as the amendment proposes to do, is infinitely greater, because it strikes at a great principle.  As I have repeatedly pointed out before, if you allow principles to be encroached upon in order to deal with special cases, those encroachments will be used as a precedent in future legislation.  It has happened on every single occasion in which we sought to make a breach of a big principle in order to meet a special circumstance. Whenever we did that, it was quoted to us later as a precedent for going further with new encroachments upon the principle.</P>
    <P>We are now going to establish a principle that this House feels itself competent to regulate the leisure of a certain group of the community, and that group is restricted to those men who earn their living by the sweat of their brow.  I object most emphatically to that type of discrimination and to any citizen of this State being prohibited by law from doing, in his own time, what in itself is an absolutely legal thing to do.  I urge on the Labour Party to oppose this on principle.  I do not pretend in this regard to speak for my Party.  I am speaking purely as an individual and in defence of what I regard as a grave principle of liberty. I do not propose to challenge a division on the matter, but I do propose to ask to be recorded as dissenting from the amendment, if the Minister persists in it.  I only hope that the Leader of the Labour Party will challenge a division on this and give the body of the <Col N="1107" /> House an opportunity of voting upon it. If he will give me the slightest indication that he will join me in the Lobby, even if we go in alone, I shall so far trespass on the indulgence of the Chair as to occupy the time necessary for a division, in order to permit the Leader of the Labour Party and myself to record our view.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused as to the attitude of the Party opposite in relation to this Bill.  The first demand for this amendment came from the members of Deputy Dillon's Party.  If Deputy Dillon thinks it is worth while wasting ten minutes of the time of the House for a speech of the kind he has just delivered, he should first use his eloquence and oratory on the members of his own Party and persuade them he is right before he comes to persuade us.  Apparently, he has some influence with them, but he has no influence with us.  In any case, his speech is very illuminating and indicates the extent to which he, at any rate, has moved from the theory of the Corporate State which he was defending 12 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether his outburst is going to result in his joining Deputy MacDermot on the Independent Benches.  If there is any consistency in his Party, or any general agreement as to what they stand for on anything, then Deputy Dillon is surely in opposition to the rest and it is about time that he severed whatever connecting link remains.  In any event, his ideas are antediluvian.  The idea that it is a restriction upon personal liberty to control the conditions of employment is preposterous.  Are we, in the interests of personal liberty, to allow children to work all night? It is a restriction upon them, a denial of their dignity, to allow some employer, for a few shillings a week, to employ them for long hours until eight, nine, ten or twelve o'clock at night?  The Deputy will agree that we should regulate there.  It is only a question of where the regulation is to stop or to begin.  The Deputy's <Col N="1108" /> principle falls to the ground as soon as it is examined.  It is not a principle at all, but an opportunity of making an oratorical outburst, which Deputy Dillon had no intention of making five minutes before the amendment was moved, and which he will have forgotten five minutes after the discussion is concluded.</P>

      <P>Not since I saw Bernard Shaw's &ldquo;Apple Cart&rdquo; staged have I listened to a more interesting exhibition of vocal nonsense than Deputy Dillon has indulged in here this evening&mdash;and he has the audacity to appeal to the Labour Party to vote against this amendment.  If he had directed his histrionic talents to the Deputies on his own benches and tried to get them to vote against it, I could perhaps understand it, but Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Beckett, and, I think&mdash;though not quite in the same category&mdash;Deputy Good, are in favour of this amendment.  Most sensible people are in favour of it.  On the last day we discussed this matter, Deputy Dillon was handing out Socialist labels to all who asked for these restrictions to be placed upon people so as to prevent them working during the period of the holidays that the State was providing for them, and he was quite taken aback when Deputy Dockrell almost put out his tongue, so to speak, for one of these Socialist labels when he followed on Deputy Dillon and trounced him very severely for describing him as a Socialist when, according to Deputy Dockrell himself, he was doing a very sensible thing.  As a man engaged extensively in industrial work in the city, Deputy Dockrell saw that the amendment we were pressing for and that he was pressing for&mdash;in fact, I think he spoke in favour of it first&mdash;was a very useful amendment from the point of view of regulating industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon now comes here and, in an attempt to understand this Bill, he has got himself into a state of mental indigestion.  He says: Why should we regulate anything?  Why not let us have that old <i>laissez faire</i> concept of life which the Deputy at one time used to be so fond of?  He asks why should we pursue the working-man into his leisure and pry into <Col N="1109" /> his affairs there.  Apparently, he does not understand that this amendment is to make sure that the working-man gets leisure.  If the Deputy had his way, the working-man would get no leisure, because, when he would have finished working for one employer, and was then getting his six days' holidays with pay, he would be entitled to take up work in some other industry during the week when he was supposed to be having leisure.  So that, what Deputy Dillon really wants to do is to make sure that the worker is given facilities whereby he may work during the week of his holidays when every sensible person in this House wants to make sure that the worker will have the leisure to enjoy the wage he has got for that week's absence from work.  If Deputy Dillon would reflect on these things for a moment, he would realise that his argument is based, not on the facts of the Bill, not on the facts of everyday life, but simply on an invention, and even a very muddy kind of invention at that.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to make sure that, if the employer is going to be required to grant the worker a week's holidays, and to pay him for that week, the worker shall be entitled to enjoy that week and shall be prevented from denying himself the recreation which will be provided for him on that occasion. Deputy Dillon comes in here to make the claim, then, as if he were the only apostle of individual liberty in the House&mdash;I suggest that if the Deputy rattled his brains instead of the money in his pocket he might be able to make a better contribution to this discussion&mdash;he comes in here now and poses as the only champion of individual liberty here.  Is not that an impudent pose, especially when the Leader of his Party is in the House and could be relied upon to express the Party view on a matter of that kind? Deputy Dillon really should not take himself so seriously in matters of this kind.  He ought to leave the championship of individual liberty to the Leader of his Party, especially when that Leader is present in the House; and I am sure that, notwithstanding Deputy Cosgrave's imperfections in <Col N="1110" /> many respects, he would express those views with less arrogance and probably more common sense than the Deputy displayed in his contribution to the discussion of this Bill here this evening.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this matter, but Deputy Norton drew me.  Apparently, Deputy Norton has lost faith in the principles of the people whom he professes to represent.  Evidently, Deputy Norton's faith, that ordinary members of trades unions or of labour generally are loyal and faithful to one another, has lapsed.  He does not trust them.  It is necessary to enshrine in an Act of Parliament a section to compel workers to be loyal to one another. That is the sum and substance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon.  I should not like to see liberty fettered, any more than Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy in this House would like to see it fettered, and we are accepting the principle of fettered liberty in this amendment. I stand behind Deputy Dillon in his opposition to this particular clause, but I am rather perplexed at the view of Deputy Norton and the Labour Party.  I am surprised that they should stand by the amendment because, if there is anything in trade unionism worth while and if there is anything in the loyalty of the individual workers one to another, then, undoubtedly, this clause is unnecessary. Is it supposed that, if workers have been pressing for a holiday, as they evidently have been, and if the Labour Party in this House comes to their assistance to see that they get it&mdash;is it supposed that they are going to abuse that?  Have you so lost faith in them that you are going to enshrine in an Act of Parliament a provision which will prevent them from having full freedom during that holiday? There is no doubt that this does limit their freedom to do at least certain things, and I think it is a principle <Col N="1111" /> that the leaders of the Labour Party at least ought not to accept.</P>

      <P>We do not claim to have reached the very high standards of the Fine Gael Party, perhaps, and we consider that common sense and reasonable measures are necessary to regulate our lives.  Deputy Dillon states that we are restricting a man from doing what he has a perfectly legal and legitimate right to do, and, in the next breath, that we are afraid to allow a man to do the mean thing of stealing a few hours' work in the week from a fellow-worker. Would the Deputy feel that the worker was entitled to take a week's work during the time he was being paid for a holiday?  He cannot have it both ways.  The Deputy says that it is legitimate for a man to do anything he likes during his leisure. Evidently, the Deputy thinks it is perfectly legitimate for a worker to steal a week's work from a fellow-worker, who perhaps badly wanted work, and to take the money prescribed by the State.  Because the House here, and the Labour Party with the majority of the House, who are in favour of providing leisure for the workers, do not want to see that leisure abused, and because we want to take ordinary common-sense means to see to it that workers, whether they are mean-souled or high-souled people, will adopt the principle laid down here, we are accused of lack of appreciation of the workers' needs and of robbing them of their individual <Col N="1112" /> liberty.  I think it is an abuse of the privileges of the House to have such inflictions made upon the Minister as have been made by these Deputies, and to have to listen to the things that have been said of him by Deputies Dillon and Bennett.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 22, Section 26 (1), to delete the words &ldquo;one week&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;two weeks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the notice of the annual leave which must be given by the employer, and the Bill makes provision for the giving of not less than a week's notice, by the employer to the workman, of the time of the commencement of his annual leave.  I think a week's notice of the commencement of the annual leave is utterly inadequate. If the employer chooses to say to the worker that he was only going to give him a week's notice of the annual leave, then the worker who might have thought of the possibility of getting away to the countryside or the seaside with his wife and family would not be able to make the necessary arrangements in the meantime.  While still complying with the terms of this section the employers could adopt a very reprehensible attitude, cause considerable inconvenience to the worker and a considerable dislocation of the holiday arrangements of his family. My amendment seeks to ensure that the worker will be given at least a fortnight's notice of the time of the commencement of his annual leave.  I was in considerable doubt when submitting this amendment that a fortnight's notice&mdash;that is the period suggested&mdash;was adequate, but at all events, one week's notice of the commencement of the annual holiday is totally inadequate.  A fortnight's notice, in my opinion, is also <Col N="1113" /> inadequate but it is a substantial improvement on one week.  I think the Minister should accept the amendment so as to ensure as far as possible that the workers will get at least a fortnight's notice.  The employer, I hope, will be able to arrange his industrial undertakings in such a way as to give a much longer notice.  As the Bill stands it is necessary to give only one week's notice which is entirely inadequate, if there is to be any regard for the convenience of the workers.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment:</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will check up on it afterwards.  As far as the average employers are concerned there will always be a certain amount of give and take.  I think the Minister has fairly met the average case by saying: &ldquo;Well, the worker must get one week's notice.&rdquo;  Most of the workers who are going away for holidays will make their plans a good way ahead, and they will then try to find out how far the employer can accommodate them.  I think that in most cases that will be the spirit in which the problem will be approached.  But absolutely to say that <Col N="1114" /> everybody must get a fortnight's notice is, I think, going too far.  After all, the average worker does not hire a pantechnicon for going away.</P>

      <P>This point was also discussed already on another amendment. I agree that as a general rule it is desirable that the employees should get a longer notice than a week as to the date of the commencement of their holidays.  But the question we are considering now is not what is a reasonable arrangement between employer and employees in that respect but what is the statutory minimum obligation we are going to impose having regard to the circumstances of some industries and the advisability of conveniencing the employer to the extent that he will be able to fulfil his obligation to give his employees a week's annual holidays during the slack season of his trade and other considerations.  It is desirable I think that the minimum statutory obligation in respect of the holidays should not be for longer than a week's notice.  I think I am quite certain that the majority of employers will find it not merely advisable but also desirable to give a longer notice.  I do not think the giving of more than a week's notice should be made a punishable offence under this Bill.  There is an obligation to give at least a week's notice.  I think the Bill is better in its present form.  In certain cases it might prove detrimental not merely to <Col N="1115" /> the interests of the employer but also to the interests of the workers if a longer period were prescribed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 57, at end of Section 28, to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Exclusion regulations made under this section shall be expressed to provide that conditions of employment not less favourable to the workers concerned than the provisions of the enactments mentioned in the Schedule to this Act shall be observed in every undertaking engaged in the form of industrial work to which such exclusion regulations relate.</P>
      <P>This amendment is somewhat similar to amendment No. 2, except that amendment No. 2 applies to a certain type of industrial worker.  This amendment, however, deals with a somewhat wider issue, because it provides for the issue by the Minister of exclusion regulations, and these exclusion regulations can, of course, be made applicable to industrial undertakings in such a way as to exclude industrial undertakings from the obligation which is provided for the workers in that undertaking by this Bill.  As the Minister knows, large sections of the Factory and Workshop Acts are repealed, and the whole of the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, 1920, is repealed in respect of any form of industrial work. The amendment which I have proposed is designed to ensure, in respect of forms of undertaking in which exclusion regulations are made, that the protection afforded by the Acts repealed by this measure will continue to apply to the workers who are working under the exclusion regulations. I think the Minister ought to grant to the workers that protection in the case of excluded undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy can have given this matter very careful consideration.  Obviously, <Col N="1116" /> the only case in which an exclusion order will be made is where it is not possible to observe, in respect of some form of industrial work, the provisions of this Bill.  I do not contemplate that the exclusion regulations will be made except where it is not possible&mdash;I use the term with its ordinary meaning&mdash;to observe the provisions of the Bill.  It is the intention to make suitable provision in cases where, having regard to the circumstances of the industry, it is impracticable to observe the strict conditions of this Bill.  The only circumstances, therefore, in which exclusion orders will be made will be where it is necessary to enable a particular industry to carry on, but it is not proposed to permit particular workers to work under conditions less favourable than those prescribed in the Bill. One provision is that a man must not be employed after 8 p.m.  In some industry which one can conceive the regular practice might be such as to require that workers will be employed after that hour, not on overtime, but on ordinary work.  If a case were made to show that the circumstances of the industry were such that that was necessary, then an exclusion order would be made.  Obviously, if the amendment were inserted, no such exclusion order could be made, and therefore, in my opinion, the Deputy's amendment cuts right across the intentions of the section as to permit of exclusion orders being made in certain exceptional cases in respect of which the provisions of the Bill cannot be carried out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, before Section 37 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply to any industrial work done in or about&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the printing of newspapers, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the construction, maintenance, alteration, or repair of any telegraphic or telephonic installation, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the maintenance or working of a broadcasting station maintained and worked under Part II of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> This amendment, in so far as it affects the printing of newspapers, was discussed already on amendment No. 1. The purpose of this amendment is to exclude from the scope of Section 37, which regulates working hours, persons employed in the printing of newspapers, in the construction, maintenance, alteration or repair of any telegraphic or telephonic installation and in the maintenance or working of a broadcasting station.  These classes of persons would necessarily have to be excluded from the scope of the section or else these services could not be carried on.  We originally intended that they should be excluded by regulation under Section 28, but on reconsideration it was considered more desirable that the exclusion should be effected in the Bill, because there can be no question as to the need for it.</P>
    <P>The effect of the exclusion is to impose no regulation in respect of hours upon these classes of workers, but I do not think that need cause any apprehension, because the conditions under which such persons will be employed will be such that no abuse need be feared.  Exclusion from the section involves and implies exclusion from Section 30 and the sections dealing with overtime.  The three classes of work which I have mentioned are necessarily done at night.  I do not say that all work upon telegraphic or telephonic installation must be done at night, but obviously the work could not be allowed to be left undone, otherwise we would not have any telegraph or telephone services after 8 p.m. and we would have no broadcasting service after 8 p.m. and no newspapers in the morning unless this amendment were inserted.  The only question that arises is whether it is more desirable to have the exclusion effected in this way.  In so far as the exclusion when made must be permanent, it is more desirable to have it by way of provision in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and I am also pleased to know this amendment brings in an exclusion from Section 30.  There is one point the Minister has not dealt with, namely, how far <Col N="1119" /> it could be argued that the newspapers were employing shifts.  I will ask the Minister if it would be possible to exclude them from Section 31.  I need not go over what I said on a previous amendment.  The Minister stated that newspapers were not a continual process and I think it is doubtful whether, under the provisions of this Bill, they are actually employing continuous shifts, or shifts at all. At the same time they do employ separate gangs of men and from that point of view it might be argued that they were employing shifts.  I would like him in that connection to exclude them from Section 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is necessary.  The industry is clearly not one of those contemplated under Sections 32 or 33.  Under Section 32 the industry must be a continuous process industry; that is, an industry the process of which must be carried on continuously and newspaper production is obviously not of that kind.  In Section 33 the industries concerned are those which need not necessarily be carried on by a continuous process but are permitted to be carried on in that way.  Newspapers are not carried on as a continuous process.  As the Bill stands, the regulation of newspaper employment would obviously come in under Section 37.  They are to be excluded by this amendment. The result would leave them uncontrolled in respect of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister may find it necessary to meet some practical difficulty by this amendment, I think, by the manner in which he has attempted to do so, he has gone to quite unnecessary extremes.  For instance, in sub-section (b) of the amendment he deals with &ldquo;the construction, maintenance, alteration, or repair of any telegraphic or telephonic installation&rdquo; and places that completely outside the section of this Bill dealing with working hours.  Let me remind the Minister, as one who knows something about the matter, that it is not necessary to exclude the whole of the staff engaged in that kind of work in order to ensure that a limited number of people working <Col N="1120" /> outside the hours 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. may continue to work, in order that telephonic and telegraphic services should not be interrupted.  Everyone wants these services to be maintained as one of the necessary things of modern life.  Lots of people could make a case for the continuance of broadcasting after 8 p.m. but it would not be necessary to exclude the whole of the broadcasting staff from the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It may be that the Minister is excluding them from the beneficial portions of this Act.  I think he could go back to the exclusion Section 28 and get over the difficulty in that way.

      <P>It does not seem too much to say that the Government does not want to do it.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been pressed for the last two years, and I think that is a fairly long period, to reduce the working hours of the group affected by this amendment.  The Department of the Minister's colleague takes all that time, and even then we cannot get a decision.  I suggest this amendment is unfair.  In order to provide a skeleton service between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. the Minister is by this section taking out 98 per cent. of the workers already in. <Col N="1122" /> I think their inclusion is valuable.  The Minister ought to be glad to get as many industrial workers as possible within the scope of this section of the Bill.  Similarly in the case of the Post Office factory at St. John's Road where telephone parts and instruments are manufactured.  These people would also appear to be excluded from the scope of this section.  They are clearly industrial workers, yet they are to be excluded by this amendment because the work they do can be described as that particular type of work.  Here again if the Minister had relied upon the powers he has under Section 28 he would do the minimum amount of harm instead of tearing through this section in such a brusque way.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 23, Section 40 (1) (a) after the word &ldquo;year&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or thirty-six hours in any period of four consecutive weeks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of a discussion which we had here on the Committee Stage.  The Bill permits of certain uncontrolled overtime being worked&mdash;not more than two hours in any day, 12 hours in any week, or 240 hours in any year.  It was pointed out that the yearly maximum might be concentrated in a short period, and that that would be undesirable.  This amendment provides that the overtime worked shall not be more than 36 hours in any period of four weeks; in other words, if the maximum overtime is being worked it cannot be worked continuously for more than three weeks. The next amendment works a similar change in the sub-section which regulates juvenile employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister's attention has been drawn to one item, not in the amendment, which I would support, but in the section itself.  I think the case of the person who has to work overtime has been very fairly met, but I should like to point out to the Minister that two hours on any day is too short, because the employer is allowed to employ the worker on overtime for twelve hours in a week.  He would have to be employed on six days, therefore.  I suggest to the Minister that he might allow four hours overtime on any day, because that would mean that in three days the overtime for the week could be worked. I am sure the Minister can very easily imagine cases, especially where the job is some distance, or divorced in some way from the work they were doing during the ordinary day, in which it might be desirable for a worker to work four hours overtime on any one day.  I think the practice at present, where there is a case such as I have cited, is to work in longer periods than two hours and not to work them on consecutive evenings.  I suggest to the Minister that if he would double the overtime for the day and leave the rest stand he would make this section more flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to that is that the purpose of the whole scheme is to discourage the working of overtime as a regular policy.  But, if special circumstances should arise necessitating the working of a considerable amount of overtime, if a special job arises which has to be completed within a period involving long hours of work, then it should properly come under Section 41, the following section, under which, on application, a permit to employ workers in excess of the uncontrolled overtime can be given.  In other words, work of that kind, involving a considerable amount of overtime, should be foreseeable, whereas the uncontrolled overtime under Section 40 is designed to facilitate the employer who may have work in excess of the normal, the aggregate of which he has been unable to foresee, and which must be done as it arises.  But where foreseeable overtime is involved, then Section 41 should be applied and a permit should be sought, and such permit <Col N="1125" /> when obtained, would permit of the working of employees in excess of the uncontrolled overtime.</P>

I will not say that it is in any way a universal practice, but, at the same time, it is the practice.  I think the workers would themselves prefer to work longer periods on fewer evenings.  I should like to point out that Section 41 involves an application to the Minister and a certain amount of foresight, etc.  I am not seeking to increase the amount of uncontrolled overtime work.  I am merely trying to make the provision more flexible and bring it more into line with the present practice.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to permit of work in connection with telegraphic and telephonic installation and broadcasting to be done on Sundays or public holidays.  The same effect could be secured by regulations made under the section, but as such regulations will have to be made and, when made, will have to be permanent, it is better to have provision made in the section itself.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is, for the same reason that I have already expressed.  If the Minister is to make regulations under the section he can limit the effect of the exclusion.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, before Section 48 (4), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks proper, by order make regulations permitting, in respect of any particular form of industrial work, the period of twenty-four consecutive hours' rest mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section to be given to any worker within seven days after the Sunday on which such worker was so employed as to be entitled under the said next preceding sub-section to such period of rest, and whenever any such regulations are so made the said next preceding sub-section shall have effect subject to the provisions of such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is inserted to deal with a special case that may arise. The only illustration I can give is in connection with newspapers again.  As the Bill stands, if a worker is employed on Sundays for a period in excess of three hours, he must get a period of twenty-four hours before the following Sunday.  Now, workers employed on the printing of morning newspapers start work on Sunday evening, generally, I understand, before 9 o'clock, and consequently are regarded as being employed upon Sunday for the purposes of the section and would be entitled to a period of 24 hours' rest before the following Sunday unless an order were made under this proposed amendment.  In fact, they do not work on Saturday and get a period of rest extending from early on Saturday morning until the ordinary starting hour upon Sunday evening&mdash;in other words, the full normal period of rest&mdash;but it happens to be spread over Saturday and Sunday. It is proposed here to take power in such a case to allow the period of rest to be given within seven days after the Sunday on which the worker was employed.  If the section <Col N="1129" /> were not changed it would involve considerable dislocation in the matter of morning newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the nature of a certain type of industrial work to which I have referred previously&mdash;that is, railway work&mdash;I find now that it would be possible for men to be called out on relaying work or bridge work on Sundays.  If they could get their rest between that Sunday and the following Sunday, it would be all right, but it is a common occurrence in that type of work that it may entail two, three, and sometimes four Sundays for the completion of the particular bridge or the relaying of the section of line concerned.  The men are drawn from the various lengths of line adjacent to that district and it would cause considerable dislocation to have them laid off on the following week because they are specialists in that class of work and it would be impossible to get outside men to do it.  Of course, it might only happen once in twelve months, but has the Minister provided for such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To meet that case there would have to be a regulation excluding such workers from this section, but this amendment deals with a different type of case.  As I say, the amendment is designed to give us power to vary the provision in regard to the period of rest in certain forms of industrial work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 21, lines 51-53, Section 48 (4) to delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;one day's pay&rdquo;, line 51, to and including the word and bracket &ldquo;leave)&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;such sum as would be paid <Col N="1130" /> normally for the full number of hours ordinarily worked by a worker on a week-day.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is that, where a holiday is granted, the payment for that holiday should be that of the normal number of hours that would have been worked on that day. There is a rather complicated arrangement made for the payment of holidays, which would come to a fractional amount.  That, I think, will not appeal to the working-men or to the employers.  If a man gets a holiday on, say, Monday, he should be paid, in my opinion, for the number of hours he would work if he had been working on a Monday.  Similarly, for the other days of the week: if he gets a holiday on a Saturday&mdash;and that is normally a short day&mdash;he should get paid the short day's salary.  I think that anything else is unworkable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Beckett is thinking entirely of the case of the man paid by the hour, and obviously his amendment would be entirely inapplicable to the person employed at piece rates.  In his case the other system of calculation would have to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that they will be dealt with on their own.  My amendment refers to the normal working day, and the effect of it is that the worker should be paid for that day at the same rate that he would have been paid if he had been working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is proposing to take out what is in the Bill and insert another set of words which would deal only with one type of worker.  The provisions in Section 23, which are transferred up to this section, provide for the calculation of the pay that is to be given, and while I agree that they are perhaps a little elaborate in relation to one public holiday as distinct from the annual holidays, nevertheless I think they are necessary in order to cover all the various types of case that will have to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister see the point of Deputy Beckett's amendment: that, if the holiday is on a Saturday, <Col N="1131" /> the worker should not get an ordinary day's pay for the Saturday, which is a short day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the point Deputy Beckett is raising. That is the point we discussed on the last day, and my answer was that it cancelled out in seven years, whatever the position might be in regard to one year.  The section says: &ldquo;One day's pay, calculated at the rate which would be applicable if such day were a day of annual leave.&rdquo;  Section 24 says that, in the case of a worker whose ordinary remuneration is wholly calculated by reference to time&mdash;and these are the workers in whom Deputy Beckett is interested&mdash;he shall be paid at the rate at which such remuneration was payable immediately before the commencement of such annual leave.  I think that meets Deputy Beckett's case quite well and will occasion no difficulty in the case of the class of workers he has referred to.  The only case in respect of which an elaborate calculation is required is the case of workers employed at piece rates.</P>

      <P>In page 22, line 7, Section 48 (4) (d), to delete the words &ldquo;and fifty&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;and twentyfive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is to provide that, where workers are working on short time, there should be an average of hours which will bring them in to qualify.  I think Deputy Keyes mentioned last week or the week before last, in discussing this matter, that a large number of employees were working on short hours &mdash;I think 35 hours a week&mdash;and that they would be disqualified under this clause unless they got a reasonable amount of hours.  I suggest that 125 hours would bring them in reasonably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is one which the Labour Party would accept enthusiastically, because it is in the interest of the workers.  The 150 hours relates to a 48-hour week.  I have an amendment down&mdash;the next amendment&mdash;which <Col N="1132" /> is designed to give the Minister power to vary that figure of 150 downwards in the event of the normal working week in any industry being less than 48 hours.  If the normal working week is less than 48 hours, then I agree that that figure should be reduced, but where there is a 48-hour week ordinarily worked, then the requirement that the worker shall have worked 150 hours out of the 192 is not unreasonable.  The only circumstances under which that figure would have to be reduced would be where the normal week was less than 48 hours, and I am taking power to deal with that position in the next amendment, which, I think, is the most satisfactory way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister already has experience of industries working less than the 48-hour week and having regard to the fact that a considerable number have been shown to be working on short time, I think the Minister ought to accept Deputy Beckett's amendment.  The 125 hours seems to be a very fair proportion.  The other works out at 118, I grant you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same pro portion.  This section must be related to the working hours provision which provides for a 48-hour week.  So long as the 48-hour week is involved, that figure is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, apart from that, that in this particular section, without prejudice to the general alteration made, that you could accept 125 hours during the period of four weeks as being very reasonable.  You are only dealing in this section with a four-weeks period, but you have 1,800 hours in the entire year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>That would bring in these people who have a perfectly good claim.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind to meet existing circumstances, but I suggest it would be a good thing to take cognisance of that point now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To make application is not legally necessary.  I do not say that application should not be made because it is always in the interests of the party concerned to bring particular cases to the notice of the officers of the Department who would be dealing with them.  The intention is where the normal working week is less than 48 hours that then a reduction in this period will be effected under the proposed amendment.  But the maximum must relate to the maximum working week.  The number does not mathematically exclude it, but this figure and a similar figure have been fixed, and there must have been 75 per cent. of the full time worked in order to qualify the worker to be considered as &ldquo;continuously employed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Beckett's amendment is incomparably better than anything the Minister has any notion of.  The worker who was employed normally for 48 hours in the week may have been working at only three-quarters time for the last seven years.  In that particular case the worker would have to work the full three-quarters time every day, every week, every month in the year in order to get <Col N="1134" /> any benefit under this section.  The only way in which he could possibly get any benefit is by reducing the number of hours from 150 to 125.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is sufficiently clear about his amendment.  He prefaced his remarks by saying that he was struck by the case made the last day, and he expressed agreement with it. The Minister, in fixing these hours at 150 in a period of four weeks, arrived at that by saying: &ldquo;Take a normal working week at 48 hours; we require a person under this section to work 75 per cent. of that before he can qualify under this section.&rdquo;  He is offering in his amendment No. 20 that if the working week is reduced to 44 hours, you are going to get 75 per cent. of 44, but he has no notion of going down to the limits that Deputy Beckett suggests.  If it were a 36-hour week, the Minister may draw on his imagination to say that a person may work 75 per cent. of that in order to get the benefit of the section.  The amendment is much better than what the Minister proposes in his amendment No. 20.  It is incomparably better than anything that the Minister has any notion of doing under that amendment and he should accept it.</P>

      <P>Where a day mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 6 has been substituted as a public holiday for a day mentioned in sub-section (1) of that section every worker who by virtue of the provisions of this section would be prohibited from doing any form of industrial work on one of the days mentioned in the said sub-section (1) is entitled to recover from the employer one day's pay (calculated at the rate which would be applicable to overtime work) if he ceases to be employed by such employer at the date of the public holiday substituted as aforesaid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill it is provided that an employer, on his own initiative, without consulting the workers or the Minister, may substitute a Church holiday for a bank holiday.  The Bill is drawn in such an unsatisfactory way from the point of view of the workers that an employer may offer to a worker a Church holiday in December in lieu of, let us say, St. Patrick's Day.  In the meantime, he may dismiss the worker. If the worker were employed on St. Patrick's Day and if the employer were required to give him St. Patrick's <Col N="1137" /> Day and pay him wages for that day, and if he were required to consult the worker before he made any change such as substituting a Church holiday in December for St. Patrick's Day, then the worker would have got the benefit of receiving wages for St. Patrick's Day.  But if he did not get the benefit of wages on St. Patrick's Day, he might lose his employment between that day and the date of the Church holiday in December.</P>
      <P>This Bill in its present form could conceivably be used by employers to deprive workers of the six bank holidays to which they are entitled.  The Minister must admit that under the Bill the employer can say to a worker that he proposes to substitute the 1st November, a Church holiday, for, let us say, Easter Monday.  In other words, he postpones the day due to the worker for a period of seven months.  In the meantime he may dismiss the worker and then the worker will be in the position that he will not get paid for Easter Monday or 1st November.  That would be obviously unfair.  This amendment seeks to provide that if the employer, on his own initiative, substitutes a Church holiday subsequent to the normal bank holiday for that bank holiday, and if the worker is dismissed in the meantime, the employer should be required to pay him wages in respect of the substituted bank holiday. The Minister, I think, should accept the amendment.</P>

He must fix by notice the day on which all the workers in his employment will get a Church holiday in lieu of the public holiday.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that Church holiday being a day previous to the public holiday.</P>

They cannot be substituted; they must be observed in any event.  I have had regard to that fact and it is not at all improbable that a Church holiday before a bank holiday may be fixed.

      <P>The employer must still observe the six public holidays in the year and must give holidays to workers employed upon these days by him. Deputy Norton is talking about an employer who maliciously defrauds an individual worker.  That cannot be done by an employer who shuts down his factory altogether.  He cannot gain anything by the tactics which Deputy Norton says he might adopt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a day the worker would normally be paid for. If the employer is going to say to the worker, &ldquo;I am not going to pay you for being absent on Easter Monday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And if he says &ldquo;but I will pay you instead on the 8th December,&rdquo; the employer may have a certain number of workers on Easter Monday, but between Easter Monday and the 8th December some may have left his employment and who is to pay those who had left before the 8th December comes round?  These people were clearly entitled to payment for the bank holiday when it arrived.  The substitution portion is a secondary consideration. The prior consideration is the recognition of the six days as bank holidays.  Now, this worker that I have been mentioning is entitled to pay <Col N="1139" /> for Easter Monday, but he is told that he will not be paid for that day, and that he will have to wait until the 8th December.  Meantime, the employer pays off some of his men including this man because there is no work for them. If it gets to that stage the man is not paid for the six days' holidays, so that what is being done has deprived the worker when he was in employment of his Easter Monday holiday with pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most fantastic argument.  Clearly these people <Col N="1140" /> will get the holidays they are entitled to.  It is possible under the Minister's amendment for a man, by dodging in and out of employment to get 12 public holidays.  I suggest the Minister should reflect a bit before he tries to get that argument that he has used into his service.  He really ought to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may happen.  The provisions of this Bill in relation to holidays are only of very special interest to the workers who are, more or less, in continuous employment.  The workers not in continuous employment may complain that they are getting too many holidays.  It is workers who are continually employed who benefit by these holidays.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 26, before Section 53 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No proceedings shall be taken against any person for a breach of any of the provisions of this Part of this Act if immediate notification (together with such particulars as will enable the Minister to identify <Col N="1143" /> the particular piece of work in which such emergency arose) is sent to the Minister of an occurrence of any such emergency as comes within the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section, and if the Minister is satisfied that such an emergency as aforesaid did in fact exist.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to agree with me on the Second Reading that work of an emergency character, say in regard to burst water mains and so on, would be provided for.  At the time, I made a suggestion that the work should be undertaken immediately, and that immediate notice should be given to his Department. Under the Bill as it stands at present, if a contractor undertakes work of national importance&mdash;say it is in regard to some dangerous structure, or the stopping of a serious water wastage&mdash;he may possibly have to defend an action in court for having successfully done that necessary work, and that is an unfair position in which to put any contractor or workman.  I suggest that the clause embodied in the amendment would meet the whole case, and that the Minister should adopt it.  It would mean that the Minister would get immediate notice, and that the contractor would not be put to the annoyance of having an inspector stepping in and summoning him to court.  He would have a good case to defend, but having done probably very unpleasant work he should not be put in the position of having to defend himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that what he sets out in this amendment will undoubtedly be the practice so far as the Minister is concerned, but the Bill does not provide that the proceedings must be taken at the suit of the Minister only.  It provides that proceedings may be instituted by the Minister, but proceedings may be instituted otherwise than by the Minister, in which case the Deputy's amendment would appear to be inoperative.  In any event it is perhaps undesirable to put the Minister in the position of judging the facts.  What we are providing in the Bill is that it shall be a good defence for an employer, if proceedings <Col N="1144" /> are taken against him, to show that the circumstances which gave rise to the working contrary to the provisions of the Act were due to an emergency, but the proceedings might be instituted by a party other than the Minister, and, in those circumstances, the mere fact that a notification had been sent to the Minister would not be sufficient to prevent the proceedings taking place.  So far as the Minister is concerned, it is certain that he would not institute proceedings against an employer unless the circumstances were different from those described in the amendment.  If he had received notification of the fact that such nonobservance of the Act had taken place, due to an emergency, and if he satisfied himself that there was an emergency, he would not institute proceedings, but, as the Bill stands, it is open to any person, in the guise of a common informer, to start proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are providing is that if proceedings are taken against an employer for a breach of the Act, it will be a perfectly good defence for him to show that the circumstances which gave rise to the breach were circumstances of emergency.  That is as far, I think, as we can go in the legislation; otherwise, we are taking the function of deciding the facts from the court and giving it to the Minister, or to an official of the Minister, which would be undesirable in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The Expiring Laws Bill, as the House is aware, is an annual measure and requires to be enacted before the end of the present calendar year.  The measure continues for another year all the statutes that appear in Parts I and II of the Schedule of the Expiring Laws Act of last year, with the single exception of the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919, which has been repealed by the Aliens Act of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Schedule of the Bill, I might inform the House that two Orders have been added to those shown in the columns of Part II as restricting the scope of the Statutory <Col N="1146" /> Undertakings (Continuance of Charges) (No. 2) Act, 1923.  One of these relates to the Foynes Harbour (Temporary Increase of Charges) Order, 1921 and the Kilrush Pier, County Clare, Order, 1921.  I may say that full consideration has been given to the desirability of enacting legislation to give permanence to Acts hitherto continued by means of an annual Expiring Laws Act.  It has not been found practicable this year to introduce legislation to make permanent any of the Acts in the Schedule of the Bill, with the exception of four to which I shall briefly refer.</P>
    <P>The first of these will be a Bill dealing with the Poor Law position generally which it is hoped shortly to introduce and which will make unnecessary the further annual renewal of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  The second is a permanent measure to amend the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925.  The third is a Bill which is in an advanced stage and which will provide for the repeal of the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, with certain saving provisions and for the repeal of Section 2 of the Statutory Undertakings (Continuance of Charges) (No. 2) Act, 1923.  This Bill is a consequence of the Harbours (Regulations of Rates) Act, 1934 and as soon as the Courts of Justice Bill now before the Oireachtas becomes law, the further annual renewal of the Courts of Justice Act, 1929, will be unnecessary.  With regard to all these measures, with the exception of the Courts of Justice Act, the necessary legislation will not be ready for some time, and it is accordingly necessary to provide for their continuance for a further period by means of an Expiring Laws Act.</P>
    <P>Memoranda explanatory of the enactments which are being continued have already been circulated to Deputies for their information, and if Deputies will be good enough on this stage to raise any matters in relation to these expiring enactments which they think it advisable to raise, their points could possibly be dealt with at <Col N="1147" /> greater length on the Committee Stage by the Ministers who are more intimately concerned than I am with the operation of these measures.  I do not think there is anything more to say, except to repeat that desirable and all as it might be to dispense with temporary legislation of the kind which is covered by a Bill of this sort, it has not been found practicable and I do not think it will ever be found practicable to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke of a series of measures which will be introduced in the future and which will make several of these annual enactments unnecessary.  It occurs to me to inquire why the Government have not taken the occasion of the Labourers Bill to codify the law relating to labourers' cottages and thus render unnecessary the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, and certain sections in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, and the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  I think the Minister will agree that it is undesirable to have the law relating to one particular business distributed through three or four statutes, and that when a comprehensive measure, such as the Labourers Bill, is coming forward, it presents a very good opportunity of codifying the law relating to the matters primarily contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 8 in this explanatory memorandum is &ldquo;The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.&rdquo;  That is an Act that was passed when there was an acute housing shortage in this country, just when the State was first set up, or shortly thereafter.  While I admit it was necessary then in order to keep rents somewhere near the capacity of the people to pay, there can be no doubt that it had a very adverse effect upon house property as a security and a very deterrent effect on speculative builders, at least on that type of builder who proposes to erect houses for the purpose of renting them.  I think it has contributed very considerably to a continuance of the housing shortage in the country.  I am wondering when will the time come <Col N="1148" /> when the removal of those restrictions on rents will become possible as well as the removal of the restriction on ejectment proceedings which provides that if a tenant can prove that it is more inconvenient for him to move than it is for the landlord that he should remain, he can remain indefinitely in another man's house provided he pays the agreed rent. The result of that proviso is that a great many people who would be building houses, and thereby helping to relieve the housing shortage, are not building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission is that it is only public authorities and persons who intend to reside in the houses themselves who are building. The Deputy, I think, is fairly familiar with rural conditions.  If he is, he will know that in the past it was a common thing for a man who had a comparatively large sum of money to invest to build houses with it with a view to renting them instead of investing the money in stocks and shares. Now, that is practically stopped, and it is stopped on account of the provisions in the Rent Restrictions Act, because the average man in the country, with money, has rightly got it into his head that once a tenant has got into your house you can never get him out of it.</P>

      <P>I am not so familiar with the conditions obtaining in the cities as I am with the conditions obtaining in rural Ireland.  I am speaking of what I know by reason of personal experience.  Doubtless, other Deputies who have more intimate knowledge than I of urban conditions will address the Minister on that aspect of the situation.  Of course, we are all agreed that the restrictions contained in our legislation are necessary so long as a housing shortage obtains, but we are informed now that the housing shortage has been almost overcome.  If not, I want to know when we may expect to <Col N="1149" /> have a suspension of this legislation for the reasons that I have explained.</P>
      <P>No. 9 in the explanatory memorandum deals with &ldquo;The Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925.&rdquo; My experience of that Act in operation is that it has contributed very little indeed of value to local administration in this country.  It may have been conceived and put into effect in order to remedy abuses that obtained in 1925. Of that I am not qualified to speak, because I had no experience of local administration at that time.  But now I find that it is hindering the economical administration of local affairs and, further, that it is giving rise to situations that I find it very difficult to explain.  Recently, a local body, of which I am a member, had before it a memorial from its county surgeon to say that he had been obliged to buy instruments from a certain person designated by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, that the instruments were no good and asking leave to order new instruments from another firm saying that he would not be responsible for the health of his patients or for the administration of his hospital if he was compelled to continue buying surgical instruments and supplies from this firm which the Department of Local Government and Public Health had appointed contractor under this Act.  Well, now, either a local authority is competent to purchase its own requirements or it is not.  If it is not competent to carry out the everyday contracts of purchase on behalf of the ratepayers, it ought not to be there at all, and if the Minister makes up his mind that a local authority is abusing its power in making contracts and is extravagantly expending the funds of the county, he ought to dissolve it and send down somebody who will do the job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act does seem to me, in practice, to have been a complete failure. I raised this question last year and the Minister said that the difficulties I submitted to him had no real existence in fact.  But, since, I have every reason to believe that, in practice, they do obtain, and that they do obstruct people very much indeed.  There is some provision in this Combined Purchasing <Col N="1150" /> Act which requires that you will either buy from the firm mentioned in a list provided by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, or, that, if you purchase a trivial thing locally-made it shall not be at a price in excess of the price quoted by the contractor approved by the Department.  That may sound a perfectly simple provision but, in fact, it is most unworkable because all local authorities have a series of sub-committees. Some of them are local committees concerned to look after some very small purely local undertaking, such as a waterworks or a local electrical supply installation for which the board of health is responsible.  They may want in an emergency a washer for a tap or a few screws or some trifle of that nature costing, perhaps, 6d. or a 1/-.  They buy it locally, and there may then arise a protracted correspondence as to whether they have not paid more to the local hardware merchant for the screws than they could have been bought at in Limerick or Cork.  Time, temper and money are wasted ascertaining whether the screws should have been bought for 6d. or 4d.  If the responsible official to the board of health can get going quickly enough you are prevented getting the screws until you have satisfied him that the price you propose to pay for them is in accordance with the rules laid down by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>To my mind that is useless obstruction. It may be that we do not know what facilities the Department are prepared to place at the disposal of local authorities in matters of that kind, but, if that is the case, I invite the Minister to take this occasion, or to make the Committee Stage of this Bill the occasion, to state clearly what is the position of a local authority wishing to purchase a trivial commodity, what inquiries should first be made and what discretion vests in it as to price, conditions and so on.  I also suggest to him that the time has come to dispense with the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act altogether.  I do not think that it has been a success.  I do not think that it has saved any money and it has involved a lot of busy people in a great deal of inconvenience.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in advocating the total removal of the existing rent restrictions, says he is doing so to encourage speculative house builders to build more houses and, incidentally, to improve the price of privately-owned house property.  I am amazed that Deputy Dillon, who is generally given credit for being of a studious disposition, should display such ignorance regarding the present position of speculative house builders.  If he had made any study of the operations of these individuals, particularly around our principal cities, he would have found that they were getting more out of the Housing Act of 1932 than any other section of the community.  I am sure that Deputy Dillon has not studied the existing restrictions on houselords or he would not advocate the total removal of these restrictions.  I had hoped, in view of the many declarations by the present Government regarding the rights of town tenants, that they would not be coming forward, after four years in office, asking us to continue in operation a measure introduced in 1923&mdash;a measure which, to the knowledge of members of the Ministry, imposes considerable hardships on the poorest section of our town tenants.  I have been reliably informed&mdash;I understand that the local papers will bear me out&mdash;that President de Valera promised, at a public meeting in Castlerea, before the General Election of 1932, that one of the first Bills he would introduce would be a Bill to meet the reasonable demands of the town tenants.  I was amazed to find that Deputy Cormac Breathnach, at a meeting of the Dublin Corporation less than a month ago, said that the Fianna Fáil Party had given careful consideration to the grievances of town tenants, and he regretted that the Party had decided not to have legislation introduced dealing with this matter.  The Minister for Justice, in a statement issued to the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; on Monday or Tuesday of this week, says that the Party have taken no such decision. Are we to understand from that statement that the Party have done nothing and intend to do nothing in connection with the rights of town tenants?  I should like the Minister for Justice to say, when dealing with this matter <Col N="1152" /> later, whether it is a fact that a Committee of the Fianna Fáil Party was set up over a year ago to deal with this subject and has not, so far, made any progress.  I understand that an InterDepartmental Committee has also been sitting for some time in connection with this matter.  I suppose it will continue to sit until the Government goes before the electors again, when we shall probably have a repetition by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues of the promises made so far back as 1932.</P>
      <P>Deputy Breathnach, in his speech at the Dublin Corporation, was obviously dealing with the question of the excessive rents being charged by slum landlords in the City of Dublin.  He indicated that it was useless for that responsible body to appoint a deputation to interview the Minister for Justice in connection with this urgent and pressing problem.  I understand that Deputy Cooney, who, I am glad, is in the House, made reference to these matters at a meeting of a Fianna Fáil branch in Dublin within the past week.  I should be interested to hear from him in the House, which is the proper place for such statements, what are the Government Party intentions regarding the complaints made by his own constituents in connection with the excessive and exorbitant rents being charged by slum landlords and what he knows&mdash;if he knows anything&mdash;as to the intentions of the Government in connection with this important matter.  I hope I shall not cause any annoyance to the Minister for Finance and his colleagues when I remind them that, in connection with the Landlord and Tenant Bill of 1931, he and his colleagues, who were then in opposition, moved and supported no fewer than 87 amendments. If they have forgotten all about the genuine grievances and claims of the town tenants, might I ask them to appoint some Deputy or Minister who has not much work to do to read up the discussions on that Bill and see how far they can fit in their present views with the views expressed by them on that measure.</P>

      <P>One very important section in the Rent Restrictions Act of 1923 is very unfair to town tenants. Section 2 deals with the determination of the standard rent.  Any tenant who thinks that he 2is being charged an unfair rent is entitled under that section to come before the court and make the best case he can.  In order to prove that he is being charged an exorbitant rent under that section, he is compelled, I understand, to produce a rent book or rent receipt or other documentary evidence showing the rent he was paying in August, 1914.  A very important test case dealing with the application of that section was tried before Judge Shannon in the Circuit Court.  This is known as the Donnelly case.  Judge Shannon, in giving his decision against the tenant in that case, said: &ldquo;Where the rent payable in August, 1914, cannot be proved, the court cannot, in my opinion, assist the tenant.&rdquo;  He also said that he arrived at that decision with regret, and hoped that a higher court might be able to decide otherwise.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance and his colleagues that cases of that type should be carefully and sympathetically considered, and that in any amending measure dealing with the Rent Restrictions Act of 1923, it should be made clear that the onus of disproving the statement regarding the rent paid in 1914 should be placed upon the landlord.  The landlord must, in such cases, be in possession of documentary evidence as to the agreement arrived at with the tenant, and he should be in a position in other ways to show what rent was paid him by the tenant in occupation in August, 1914.  The onus in such cases should be placed upon the landlord, because, if there are many cases similar to that decided by Judge Shannon, a great hardship is being imposed upon tenants who are being charged exorbitant rents by slum landlords and other houselords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section of this Rent Restrictions Act enables, with subsequent amending Acts, landlords coming into <Col N="1154" /> possession of houses over a certain valuation to charge double the rent of these houses or of separate rooms in these houses.  I give all the credit that is due&mdash;everybody of impartial mind will do the same&mdash;to the Minister for Local Government for the way in which the Housing Act of 1932 is being administered and for the way in which many of the slums in our cities and towns are gradually disappearing.</P>
    <P>I would, however, warn the Minister for Local Government that new slums are being brought into existence in other parts of our cities and towns. We have houses in Baggot Street, Mount Street and other fairly respectable streets in this city, and in cities and towns throughout the country, which the owners have turned into self-contained flats, and there is no restriction whatever under existing legislation on the rents that can be charged by these new slum-owners to the tenants who must occupy these flats because they have no other suitable accommodation.  I appeal to the Minister for Local Government to look into that matter because it is going to create a problem in the course of the next few years.  I think that people who turn houses of £20, £30, or £40 valuation into a number of self-contained flats should be restricted in some way as regards the exorbitant rents charged by them to-day.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice was good enough on a recent occasion to grant an interview to a deputation representing the town tenants' organisations.  Having heard their grievances, he took up the very peculiar attitude of suggesting that these organisations should unite and submit for his consideration typical cases of hardship.  Indeed he went so far as to suggest that they should submit six typewritten copies of every case of hardship they could lay their hands upon.  This is a new method of discharging the responsibilities of government by pushing the responsibility on to some other body that has not the same machinery or perhaps finance at its disposal to do work which can only be done in a proper way by a Government.  They are to go round this city and every other city and provincial town and pick up the <Col N="1155" /> story of every town tenant who thinks he has a grievance.  They are to do that without having at their disposal information which only the landlord can give or be compelled to give.  That is not, I suggest, a serious way of dealing with the grievances of town tenants.  If there is any desire on the part of the Government to deal with the grievances of the town tenants they should make up their minds that the only people who can deal with these grievances in a proper way are the Government, who have the power to do it if they have the will to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that these two bodies set up a committee of five, and he said that he should be presented with a statement in writing, drawn up in suitable form and vouched for as correct by some committee representative of town tenants generally, setting out in detail, with names and addresses, exact figures and dates, a large number of cases, distributed as widely as possible over the country, which could be relied upon as typical examples of the hardships complained of.  He also said that it would be well that the statement should be typewritten and that six copies should be presented.  Surely no responsible Minister can suggest that bodies such as the town tenants' associations can do the work which the Minister requires to be done in this way.  They have not the machinery at their disposal, even if they had the will to do it.</P>
    <P>I cannot do better than remind the Minister and his colleagues of the promise made by President de Valera at a public meeting in Castlerea in 1932. I have reason to know, from a limited knowledge of the President's attitude in these matters, that the President is very particular about carrying out his promises, and I hope it will not be necessary for those of us who may take a passing interest in the grievances of town tenants to remind the President personally of the promise made in Castlerea in 1932.  At any rate, that promise is certainly not being carried out by the attitude recently adopted by the Minister for Justice in making these suggestions to the deputation from the town tenants' associations.</P>
    <P>I could, of course, deal with many <Col N="1156" /> other matters affecting town tenants contained in the measure which we are now asked to re-enact.  I hope the Minister for Finance and his colleagues will not come to this House again and ask us to re-enact the powers contained in the existing Rent and Mortgage Restriction Act of 1923 and the subsequent Acts which amend in some respects that measure.  I hope they will have the courage and the pluck to face up to the promise made by the President at Castlerea and realise that there are genuine grievances from which town tenants, particularly in the slums, are suffering, and that, before it becomes necessary to pass another Expiring Laws Act, a genuine Town Tenants Bill will be passed, and that, therefore, there will be no necessity in 12 months' time to re-enact a measure of this kind, which to my knowledge imposes considerable hardships on the poorer section of town tenants.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin has made one or two very remarkable statements. One thing he said seems to me very remarkable indeed.  He called attention to the owner of a house in Mount Street, say, who has turned the house into flats and is charging any rent he likes for these flats.  Deputy Davin finds very serious fault with that.  Yet, some six months ago or so, when the Minister for Finance proposed that the value of such a house should be increased by 25 per cent. for income tax purposes, Deputy Davin and his leader almost went wild with annoyance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They went into the division lobby on every occasion against this &ldquo;mad proposal.&rdquo;  It is a pity that Deputy Davin was not a bit more explicit in regard to his main grievance.  Is it his proposal that every urban rent in the country should be fixed and controlled by the State? That is a pretty tall order.  It would require, I should say, a tremendous extension of the Civil Service and of State activity.  One would like to know if it is put forward as an item of policy by the Labour Party that that should be done.  Presumably, if it is <Col N="1157" /> done in Mount Street, it should be done in Wicklow Street, in Rathgar, in Dun Laoghaire, in Bray, in Mallow, and all over the country.  It is a pity that the Deputy did not tell us the full extent of his proposal and the lines on which he expects advance to be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's speech also was somewhat remarkable in the sense that he found fault with this Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act of 1923 on the ground that it had restricted speculative building.  In order to make that assertion, Deputy Dillon had to pretend to be very innocent&mdash;he only knew the country; he would not attempt to speak for the cities.  Of course, Deputy Dillon knows very well that for several years past speculative building has been extraordinarily active and that there can have been no restriction whatever&mdash;that this Act has had no restrictive effect so far as the principal towns in the country are concerned. Otherwise, there would not have been the great boom in speculative building that has taken place in the cities.  I think, however, the Deputy is right in regard to the mere fact of there not being much building activity in country towns, whatever the reason has been.  There is a great shortage of houses in a lot of our towns, and it is a curious thing that you have such a contrast between the cities and the great bulk of the country towns, that, while speculative building in the cities has been tremendously active, you have had practically nothing done in a great number of the small towns.  In the town of Baltinglass, for instance, it is said that there has not been a new house built, except it was built by a public authority, for almost 100 years.  Obviously, it cannot have been the Act of 1923 that prevented building there, but it would be worth while inquiring why it is that there have not been people to avail of the Government aid for building in the country towns what we might call middle-class houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many people, such as civic guards and so on&mdash;married civic guards&mdash;are often in great difficulties as to how to get a house when they are moved from one town to another.  In <Col N="1158" /> many cases they find that no house of the kind that would suit them is ever vacant.  I would not say for a moment, however, that the Act of 1923 has much to do with it, and I rather think it would be an advantage to have rents so stabilised as they are in country towns.  I think nobody has much of a grievance in that connection and, so far as depriving householders of any legitimate income is concerned, it seems to be rather the other way, because wherever an agitation has sprung up in recent years in regard to rents in country towns, it has nearly always resulted in considerable concessions to the tenant.  If what Deputy Dillon alleges were the case&mdash;that property owners are very severely hit by this Act&mdash;they could not afford to give the concessions they have given in very many country towns.  With regard to Deputy Davin's case in connection with town tenants, I gathered from the Ceann Comhairle that it is not in order.</P>

I could agree with a good deal of what Deputy Dillon said on the subject, but I think it would not be just, at the moment, to take up time discussing the existing Act, seeing that we have the promise of the Minister that it is going to be amended by a new Bill in a short time.</P>

There has been complaint as to the position the Government is in with regard to its work and that, at this particular time of the year, we are only meeting two days a week.  The Minister indicated, in introducing this Bill, that there is certain additional legislation that it is proposed to introduce that will have the effect of removing some of the Acts from the schedule.  Will the Minister assure us that these proposed measures will not be dumped down on the House in the spring, when the House is dealing with its financial business?  The whole dignity and <Col N="1160" /> decorum of the House was destroyed and undermined and prejudiced during last spring, principally by reason of the fact that Deputies from all sides of the House felt that they were not getting a proper opportunity of dealing with the very important financial measures that were then before the House.  It would be disastrous to the prestige of this House if the same thing were to be repeated in the coming spring.  As the Minister has mentioned that new and important legislation is to be introduced in order to get these Bills off the schedule, I should like him to assure us that the House will not be asked to deal with these measures at a time that ought to be devoted to very important financial business.</P>

I do not know, Sir, that there is very much for me to say on this.  I think that the criticisms that have been offered of some of the measures that are included in the Bill have cancelled each other out.  It is quite clear from the long speeches we heard from Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davin, in regard to the Rents and Mortgage Restriction Act of 1923, that there is a great deal to be said on either side, and I do not propose to confuse the issue by adding any remarks of mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. S.T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is scarcely necessary for me to enter into any detailed review of the legislation dealing with the provision of cottages and plots for agricultural labourers, but a brief <Col N="1161" /> review is necessary in amplification of the terms of the Bill now before us. Before these cottages and plots were provided the dwelling accommodation available for rural workers was worse than bad.  Many of them were boarded by their employers and their earnings were insufficient to enable them to maintain a separate dwelling. Unlike the urban worker who needed a proper house at a rent below the economic standard owing to his inability to meet the full charge, the rural worker not alone needed a proper house, but he needed it at a nominal rent and with a garden plot large enough to enable him to supply his domestic needs and thus conserve his earnings to acquire such necessities of life as he was unable to produce himself.</P>
      <P>The parent Acts (the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1931) are closely allied to the Land Acts.  Earlier legislative efforts were made to place on the farmers the onus of providing proper housing accommodation and allotments for their workers, but without success. Among other things it was difficult to place the onus on any particular farmer in the many cases where labourers worked for more than one employer.  The Labourers Act of 1883 brought the local authority into action and initiated the machinery under which cottages and plots could be provided by these bodies for rural workers under loans raised on the security of the rates.  The expenses incurred by local authorities were charged as a rate on the sections of their areas in which the cottages and plots were provided.  In other words the expenses were shared by all the farmers for whom the labourers might be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the Labourers Acts may best be gauged by the alterations made from time to time in the definition of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer.&rdquo;  At first this definition referred only to persons doing agricultural work for hire.  In 1903 the expression was extended to include other persons working in a rural district whose wages did not exceed 2/6 per day and who were not in occupation of more than one-quarter of an <Col N="1162" /> acre of land.  In 1919 the limit of 2/6 per day was removed and the definition was further extended to include any person who worked for hire in a rural district or any person not working for hire but working in a rural district at some trade or handicraft without employing any persons except members of his own family.  The one-quarter acre limit for land holding was preserved.</P>
    <P>The area on which expenses of the Acts were charged has also been altered from time to time.  These expenses, originally charged on the section of the area in which the cottages and plots were provided, were from 1998 chargeable on the entire rural district and since 1933 have been chargeable on the entire county health district.  A more even distribution of the charges resulted from each change.  Up to 1906 the provision of cottages and plots was financed mainly by loans issued by the Commissioners of Public Works.  With the aid of these loans, the repayment period of which varied from 20 to 50 years, some 20,351 cottages were provided. The burden on the rates, increasing each year as new schemes were carried through, was attaining telling proportions, when in 1906 provision was made for the payment of subsidies from State Funds in relief of the charges on the rates.  The periods of most of the pre-1906 loans were extended and an Exchequer contribution was made towards the loan charges.  This State contribution amounts at present to an annual sum of £29,205 6s. 2d., which meets about 26 per cent. of the loan charges.</P>
    <P>From 1906 loans for the purposes of the Acts were issued by the Irish Land Commission on Land Purchase Terms (68½ years repayment period with an annuity of £3 5s. 0d. for every £100 borrowed).  Of the loan charges on these loans 36 per cent. is met by a State contribution which amounts at present to £44,388 per annum in respect of some 21,571 cottages.</P>
    <P>From 1925 to 1932 small cash grants were available for the provision of cottages and a limited number of schemes were carried out under these grants with short-term loans raised by local authorities from their Treasurers. <Col N="1163" /> About 544 cottages were provided in this way.</P>
    <P>Since 1932 the present Housing Programme has been in operation and under it 4,754 cottages have been completed and 3,954 are in progress. The schemes under which the present cottages are provided are financed by loans from the Commissioners of Public Works repayable in 35 years with interest at 4¾ per cent. per annum.  The State pays 60 per cent. of these annual loan charges.</P>
    <P>In all, about 47,000 cottages and plots have been provided to date at an expenditure of £9,000,000.  The cottages are let at rents averaging 1/2 a week for pre-war cottages and 2/- a week for those provided since.</P>
    <P>The existing code makes no provision for the sale of cottages and plots to tenants.  Two great difficulties in the way of any scheme of sale were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the inability of the tenant to pay or repay any sum approaching a market price for his cottage and plot, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the danger that alienation would follow sale at the very uneconomic price the tenant could afford.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these serious difficulties the Government felt that the natural desire of the tenants for vested ownership should be met if at all possible.  To this end a Commission was appointed by me in 1932 to report on the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  whether there is a demand from the general body of tenants for vested ownership;</P>
    <P>(2)  whether the formulation of a scheme of sale acceptable to the general body of tenants is practicable without placing an unreasonable burden of cost on the ratepayers or increasing the liability of the State;</P>
    <P>(3)  whether the sale of the cottages and plots to the occupying tenants would be advantageous to the agricultural labourers as a class or whether the alienation of the property by sale to the sections of that class at present occupying cottages and plots would tend to <Col N="1164" /> bring about ultimately a serious housing shortage for the class as a whole;</P>
    <P>(4)  whether the average present tenant is in a position adequately to maintain the property in addition to paying a purchase charge and rates should a purchase scheme be carried out?</P>
    <P>The Commission were also requested to suggest a scheme of sale if such were considered by the Commission to be practicable and advisable.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report has been duly published.  It shows the Commission's findings:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that a demand from the general body of tenants for vested ownership exists;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the formulation of an acceptable sale scheme was practicable without placing an undue burden on the ratepayers or increasing the liability of the State;</P>
    <P>(c)  that the sale of the cottages and plots to the occupying tenants would be advantageous to the agricultural labourers as a class and, with adequate provision against alienation outside the class, need not lead to a housing shortage; and</P>
    <P>(d)  that the average present tenant is in a position to maintain his small property in addition to paying a purchase charge and rates.</P>
    <P>The Commission suggested the following scheme of sale:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  tenant to pay an annuity, the equivalent of 75 per cent. of his present rent, exclusive of rates, during the unexpired period of the loan under which the cottage was provided;</P>
    <P>(2)  tenant to bear in future the cost of all repairs and to keep and maintain the property generally to the satisfaction of the local authority;</P>
    <P>(3)  annuities to be collected in quarterly or half-yearly instalments;</P>
    <P>(4)  cottage to be put into repair by the local authority before sale;</P>
    <P>(5)  Vesting Order to provide against alienation to any person except a member of the purchaser's <Col N="1165" /> own family or to another agricultural labourer.</P>
    <P>The Commission also recommended that the legal successor of a tenant or a person who was an agricultural labourer when he became tenant but had ceased to be an agricultural labourer owing to economic changes, might be permitted to purchase in the normal way, and that a person who was never during tenancy an agricultural labourer, but had been in occupation of the cottage for a considerable period, might be permitted to purchase on an assessed value of the holding.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report and recommendations have been very carefully examined and it is with the object of giving effect to them, in the main, that the Bill now before us has been introduced.</P>
    <P>It is intended to fix the purchase annuities on the basis recommended by the Commission, viz. 75 per cent. of the present rent, save in cases where it is found that the amount of the present rent is unreasonably in excess of the rents generally prevailing for similar cottages and plots in the district. There are cases of cottages provided under short term loans in which the rents were fixed with some regard to the high loan charges payable on the cottages and these cases will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>As to repayment periods, it is felt that full acceptance of the Commission's recommendation, that the period in each case should be the unexpired period of the loan under which the cottage was provided, would lead to serious inequities from the points of view of both the tenants and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>There are actually cases in which loans have already been paid in full or have only a few years to run, although the cottages provided under them are not as old as other cottages on which there is a substantial part of the loan period yet to run.  This is due to the varying loan periods in respect of pre-1906 cottages and to the short-term borrowings between 1925 and 1932.  In such cases the tenant would get his cottage free or on a very short purchase period, while in other cases, <Col N="1166" /> where a long term loan was raised, the tenant would perhaps have a 30 years purchase period for a cottage of the same age or perhaps considerably older.  From the local authority's point of view there would be the inequity of giving away a cottage free or on very short purchase period just because the ratepayers, by meeting heavier annual loan charges, funded the loan in a shorter period.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, enables all such inequities to be removed.  If the Bill is accepted each local authority will be required to formulate its sale scheme. The basis I intend to put to the local authorities to determine the purchase period in each case is as follows:&mdash;(a) for cottages and plots provided under pre-war schemes: the equated period of all loans raised in respect of such cottages and plots in the area of the local authority from which is to be deducted in each case the age of the cottage; (b) for cottages and plots provided under post-war schemes: 35 years from which is to be deducted in each case the age of the cottage.</P>
    <P>As to pre-war cottages, if we assume that the equated loan period in a local authority's area is 65 years, then the purchase period for a cottage 30 years old would be 35 years, and for a cottage 40 years old, 25 years.  In this way inequities will be brought to a minimum.  In the case of post-war cottages the purchase period is based on the present repayment period for loans under the Labourers Acts. The basic period for repayment period calculations is much shorter than the basic period for pre-war cottages, but the rents in which the annuities are to be calculated are correspondingly higher.</P>
    <P>Purchase schemes under the Bill will require the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who may modify a scheme or direct the preparation of a new purchase scheme.  Each approved purchase scheme is to be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It has not been found possible to accept the recommendation of the Commission that persons who were never agricultural labourers during tenancy be permitted to purchase, but the Bill proposes an amendment of the definition <Col N="1167" /> of agricultural labourer which it is believed will bring in all deserving persons. The Bill does not, in itself, affect the tenancy of persons who were never agricultural labourers during tenancy, but it is, and always has been, the duty of local authorities under the parent Acts to conserve the cottages and plots for agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the following tenants may purchase their cottages and plots:&mdash;(1) an agricultural labourer, or (2) the widow of a deceased agricultural labourer who before his death was the tenant of such cottage, or (3) a person who, when he first became such tenant, was an agricultural labourer, and provided no rent is due by the tenant in respect of his tenancy. Where application to purchase is made, the local authority shall make an order vesting the cottage in the tenant in fee-simple, subject to the payment of the purchase annuity.</P>
    <P>To enable the vesting of fee-simple interest in each case provisions are included in the Bill to facilitate the speedy acquisition by local authorities of fee-simple interest in cases where this is not already vested in them.  A limited number of cottages on State lands cannot be included in the Bill, as the alienation by the State of such property is prohibited by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is provided that a purchased cottage shall not, during the payment period, be used for any purpose except the accommodation of:&mdash;(1) the purchaser; (2) on the death of the purchaser, his widow; (3) an agricultural labourer.  Provision is also included to prevent the alienation of the cottage other than by operation of law or by sale with the consent of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Before sale the local authority must put the cottage in good repair and sanitary condition and thereafter it must be maintained in good repair and sanitary condition by the purchaser. The local authority is empowered to enter and repair at the expense of the purchaser in his default.  A cottage which has been purchased may not during the payment period be mortgaged or charged.</P>
    <P>Provision is included to enable resumption by the local authority on <Col N="1168" /> breach of the statutory conditions, but, to avoid hardship, the local authority is empowered, with the consent of the Minister, to suspend for a period any statutory condition which restricts the purpose for which a cottage may be used.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommended that where the purchaser of a cottage and plot becomes the vested owner of land under the Land Commission the entire holding should be consolidated, and provision to this end is included.</P>
    <P>On the question of alienation I should like to point out that the Commission's suggestion was that provisions prohibiting alienation should operate for all time.  This, however, is entirely foreign to the fee-simple title it is proposed to vest in the tenant and its continued enforcement would be practically impossible.  The matter has been met in the Bill by applying the statutory conditions, including that prohibiting alienation, during the repayment period, and it is not intended, save in the case of consolidation under the Land Commission, to empower purchasers to redeem their annuities so as to free themselves of the statutory conditions.  In the case of a consolidation the position is, of course, entirely different.  The owner of the consolidated holding has ceased to be an agricultural labourer, and the statutory conditions are no longer required. In any other case, however, it is felt that provision enabling redemption of the purchase annuity and, in consequence, release from the statutory conditions, would provide too great a temptation to redeem and dispose of the cottage and plot for profit.</P>
    <P>Certain representations were made by the Commission on matters which do not fall within the strict scope of this Bill, but which are allied to the general question of the welfare of agricultural labourers.  They relate to the allocation of land to agricultural labourers, to the provision of cow-parks and turbary rights for them.  I have drawn the attention of the Minister concerned to these representations, and I am informed that they do not require further legislation.</P>
    <P>The Commission suggested that where cottages are being provided in an area where land is of poor quality, <Col N="1169" /> such cottages should be provided with plots of not less than three acres.  This suggestion has been fully considered, and it is difficult to see how it could be given effect to.  The price of land varies to a considerable extent throughout the country, and it is regulated more by the use to which farmers in different areas put their land rather than by the quality of the land.  In parts of Counties Louth and Galway land is very nearly as dear as in Dublin County.  In Meath it is only half the Dublin price in many cases. In North Tipperary it is only about half the Meath price.  The price, therefore, does not give much indication of the quality of the land.  If the quality of the land has to be taken into consideration as the factor determining the quantity to be acquired for each cottage, endless disputes are bound to arise as to the quality of land proposed for acquisition.</P>
    <P>It is also likely that applicants may tend to seek quantity rather than quality in the selection of sites, and land-owners may succeed in ridding themselves of useless plots where with a more careful effort on the part of local authorities suitable sites on land of good quality could be found.  The position would probably resolve itself into an effort throughout the country to secure as much land as possible at the cost of an acre in Dublin, where the price is highest, and local authorities would find themselves in the position of having to spend £70 or £80 on land in areas where rents approaching the Dublin rents could not be obtained.  This would increase the loss on local authorities in the provision of cottages.  The present policy of my Department is to insist on the selection of sites on good land, and this is more beneficial to the applicants.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;separate recommendation&rdquo; was made by four members of the Commission regarding the reduction of 50 per cent. in land annuities payable by Land Commission tenants and suggesting &ldquo;favourable consideration&rdquo; of the position of existing tenants of labourers' cottages.  The suggestion is made without a full appreciation of the position.  It is often overlooked that the tenant farmer and the cottage tenant are not in comparable positions. <Col N="1170" /> The former had heretofore paid the full annual charges on the purchase price of his farm.  The rent at present paid by the latter, after allowing for cost of repairs, insurance and collection, meets only about 20 per cent. of the annual charges on capital expenditure in the provision of the cottages, while the gross rent meets only about 35 per cent. of the total annual charges in respect of the cottages (made up of annual charges on capital expenditure, cost of repairs, insurance, collection and other charges).  It will be seen that the cottage tenant is and has always been much more handsomely treated than the Land Commission tenant is now.</P>
    <P>We feel convinced that the cottage tenant himself will be the first to admit that this Bill affords him immeasurable social advantage.  We have approached this problem solely from the point of view of meeting, if at all possible, the natural demand of the cottage tenant for vested ownership.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the invaluable work done by the Commission of Inquiry.  They have shown us the way in which this natural demand could be met.  If the Bill is accepted by the Oireachtas it is completely in the hands of the cottage tenants to make a success or a failure of the measure.  I personally feel that it will be a great success and that we shall never have cause to regret the extent to which we have gone in this proposed legislation to make the rural worker a better citizen.</P>

      <P>The Minister has now raised the curtain on the third miserable act of the great Fianna Fáil swindle.  The first was set in the faraway days of the Fianna Fáil promises. The second act was set on the interim report about which so very few of us heard anything recently, and now we are at the third act.  In the third act we are asked to consider a Bill here which the Government Press tells us is introduced following the consideration of the report; that is, the consideration of the final report of the Commission of Inquiry into the sale of cottages and plots.  The Commission was inaugurated on the 1st October, <Col N="1171" /> 1932, and they were asked not to delay longer than six months making their reports.  About 11 days prior to the polling for the general election, which took place on the 24th January, 1933, very little over three months after the Commission had been set up, we got in the columns of the &ldquo;Irish Press&rdquo; an interim report, or rather a description of the interim report, by the political correspondent of the Government organ.  Not a single Deputy has ever seen the interim report; it has never been produced nor printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time in March the majority report was signed, and in April the minority report was signed.  But it was not until about July, 1933, that Deputies had a chance of handling the final report.  Now just a few words about the second act.  As part of the second act, 42,000 people, we were told, were going to purchase their cottages at a saving of £32,000.  The local authorities who bear the burden for some of the loan charges for these cottages, were told they were to be relieved of £50,000&mdash;quite an excellent second act, something which was rather different from the outlook to the third act, and something which will be very different from what will be the outlook to the fourth act when the local board of health and the tenants of those cottages come to discuss the terms upon which savings will be made and full possession by the tenants is going to take place.  Forty-two thousand people were promised that they would have their cottages in full possession and that they were going to save between them £32,000 a year.  And the farmer ratepayers of the country were promised that they were going to save £50,000 a year.  All this we were told at the time in words that were quoted by the political correspondent of the Government organ as being the words of the Commission, but expressing no doubt the Government's mind. We were told all this would be done for them because &ldquo;the Commission is of opinion that giving the cottager ownership and security will impart to him a new sense of citizenship and pride and that it is due to him to recognise his work as a citizen and <Col N="1172" /> member of a class that is a mainstay of every democratic State.</P>
    <P>Again we do not find these splendid words in the final report.  We only find them in the columns of the Press with special priority to the Government Press! We are not able to know whether this was the spirit in which the Commission approached the occupiers of these cottages.  That is what was promised; and Deputies now have in front of them the final report.  They see from the majority of the members of the Commission what was going to be done, and they have some reflexion upon the general position as put forth in the minority report.  Taking the report of the majority at its best, it is interesting to see what they thought could be done.  At the time, considering the number of cottages that the Commission were in a position to deal with, on the 31st March, 1931, we find from the majority report that the cost of that position is as follows:&mdash;The tenants pay £129,356 a year in respect of rent only and the local authorities the sum of £141,432.  That includes repairs, £50,138; insurance, £2,451; cost of rent collection, £16,367; other outgoings, £9,806; and deficit to meet loan charges, £62,670.  The total that fell upon the local authorities was £141,432 and the annual cost that fell upon the Government was £73,593.</P>
    <P>Now the majority suggest a certain redistribution&mdash;that the loan should be reduced by 75 per cent. and that repairs should be borne by the tenants, and that the tenants should bear the cost of the rates.  The resultant position with regard to the tenant would be that the rent would be reduced approximately to £97,000; that if he was to bear the cost of repairs the amount yearly would be £50,138.  If that was done the resultant position would be that the tenant would have to bear the cost of these two sums, that is £147,138 in addition to £17,782; so that so far from being relieved, as the interim report, which none of us have seen, stated, and the details of which we have to take from the political correspondent of the Government organ&mdash;so far from the tenant benefiting by a reduction of £32,000, on the presentation of the facts by <Col N="1173" /> the majority of the commission the tenants would have to bear £17,782 additional.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 64 of the report, at page 60, says: &ldquo;It may be considered that the cottagers would be unable to bear this burden, but we would point out that they will not be called on to meet this charge in full, as will be explained later.&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister must have looked, until he was black in the face, through all the subsequent pages of the report to see the part of this report which later explained how the tenant would not have to bear the total cost of the full burden of repairs, because it seems to be clear from the details which have been given in the minority report that it is most unlikely that the cost of repairs to labourers' cottages throughout the country as a whole can be reduced every year.  In a previous paragraph the majority directed their attention to that, and the only thing they say is, in paragraph 53, that &ldquo;the cottager can, with ordinary care, prevent the necessity for many of the repairs which at present cost the ratepayer very considerable sums.  With his own labour and such local assistance as he can procure he can do the necessary repairs with very little cost in money.&rdquo;  The Minister, having considered this report, and introduced this Bill and outlined some of the ideas that he had in his mind with regard to the way in which the boards of health ought to work out their scheme, has very carefully refrained from dealing in any way with the position in which the tenant is likely to find himself, when&mdash;although his rent may be reduced by one quarter&mdash; he is going to have the total cost of the repairs borne by himself, as well as whatever he may have to bear for rates.  The local authorities are told in this famous interim report that the rates can be relieved to the extent of £50,000.  The only suggestion which the majority make in their report as to the way in which the rates can be relieved is that the cost of the repairs can be taken from them; that possibly £6,000 of a reduction in the cost of collecting rents may be brought about; that their outgoings may be reduced by £5,000, although they gave <Col N="1174" /> no indication as to what those outgoings are or how they may be reduced; and they intimate that in order properly to cover the insurance of the cottages, which they recommend, there should be an increased cost of £749 for insurance.</P>
    <P>However, if all the suggestions of the majority were able to be carried into effect the cost falling annually on the local authorities would be reduced from £141,432 to £113,399, or a reduction of £28,033, so that whereas in the interim report it was possible for the majority of the Commission to write such stuff&mdash;in a report signed I suppose on the 12th or 13th January&mdash;as persuaded the political correspondent of the Government organ that the rates could be reduced by £50,000, when it came to March had they modified their position?  At any rate, in their report signed in March they are not able to show, by the greatest stretch of their imaginations, that the rates under this general scheme could be reduced by more than £28,033, and the Government bears the same cost as in the past, that is, £73,593.  We are dealing with some 43,216 cottages, and the Minister has indicated that the figure of 42,000 people who are going to be affected by this is a myth.  The Minister has made no attempt to tell us how, in fact, on his examination of this report, the tenants are going to be affected in the matter of a saving of their outgoings, or how he considers that the local authorities are going to be saved money in respect of these 42,000 odd houses.  I submit to the Minister that it is not stretching the description of the matter to say that this is just one of Fianna Fáil's political swindles; that they have drafted a measure here which throws back on the local authorities the whole question as to what may be done or what can be done in regard to how the tenants may become owners of their holdings. Who are the people that this measure is supposed to help?  The Minister pretends that through this measure he proposes to confer on the agricultural labourers and other tenants occupying those cottages immeasurable social advantages.  So immeasurable are they that the Minister has made no attempt <Col N="1175" /> to measure the additional cost.  At any rate, they were told on the 13th January, 1933, that they were the class which were the mainstay of every democratic State.  What we have to consider first is the extent to which, if the tenants purchase, this is going to increase the amounts they have to pay.  We are speaking in round figures here.  We do know, from the information in the minority report, that the incidence of the cost of repairs is going to fall in an unequal way on various tenants; some tenants may escape any serious increase as a result of repairs, but that only means that the bulk of the repairs are going to be thrown on the backs of others.  From the figures published on page 21 of the minority report we can calculate that, when the repairs are added to the reduced rent, the average total outgoings of the tenant in respect of rent and repairs, but not including rates, are going to be increased from 1/2 to 1/4, that is, they are going to be increased by one-seventh. They are going to have to pay, on an average, an additional 2d. per week.  As I say, some people will have to pay less, but other people may have to pay considerably more.  What is the particular class of people which, at this hour of the day, the Minister attempts to fool into thinking that he is going to better their position by something which the board of health will work out for them under this scheme?  There is not a single agricultural labourer from one end of the country to the other who has not had his wages reduced, as a result of the general policy pursued in this country since 1931, by much more than the whole cost of rent and rates and repairs.  If the Minister will consult the particulars issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce he will see that over the whole province of Leinster the wages of permanent male agricultural labourers over 21 years of age have been reduced by 3/3 per week, when we compare July, 1935, with July, 1931.  That is the condition to which in Leinster that part of the community has come&mdash;that part which the Government, and the Commission, according to their interim report, <Col N="1176" /> regards as the mainstay of every democratic state.  Their wages are down by 3/3 per week in Leinster, more than twice and very nearly three times the new increased outgoings of the tenant. Three times would be only very little more.  In Munster, the mainstay of every democratic State has had his wages reduced, between July, 1931 and July, 1935, by 3/5; in Connaught by 2/9, and in the three counties of Ulster by 2/6.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that if we take the country as a whole, the reduction is 3/-.  Members of the Labour Party and others in the community will tell us that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is putting it mildly, because when he tells us that the wages of agricultural labourers throughout the whole country have been reduced by 3/- per week in these areas, he also tells us that what happened was that they were reduced from 24/3 in July, 1931, to 21/3 in July, 1935.  I have here, however, extracts from the &ldquo;Clare Champion&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mayo News&rdquo; in which, having gone into the situation of the agricultural labourer throughout the country, the Irish Labour Party, through some section of their organisation, point out that when they went into it, they found that in County Wexford the wages of agricultural workers generally were as low as 14/- per week; in Kerry, from 12/- to 18/-; in County Westmeath from 10/- to 12/-; in County Cork from 15/- to 18/-; in County Galway from 15/- to 18/-; in Roscommon from 15/- to 18/- in Tipperary from 15/- to 20/-; in Waterford from 12/- to 18/-; in Meath from 12/6 to 16/-, and in County Sligo from 10/- to 15/-.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from the &ldquo;Clare Champion&rdquo; of 30th March, which embodies a statement on the position of agricultural wages which is issued by the Administrative Council of the Irish Labour Party.  So we have evidence from the Irish Labour Party that the Minister's figures as to the amount of the agricultural labourers' wages in the country <Col N="1177" /> are fantastic.  We have also other evidence.  On 19th November, 1934, there was a letter published in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; which read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been a farm labourer for 47 years.  Up to 1932 I have always managed to live in comfort and contentment. Since then my lot has been daily harder and harder.  In 1932 I was earning 30/- a week; I am now getting 17/-.  I don't blame my employer.  No one knows better than myself that he can't afford even that, as things are now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an individual case showing a fall somewhat more than 3/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford, I have repeatedly said here, reviewed the situation in February and in March, and, I believe, in April, at the beginning of this year, and at a meeting of that Committee the whole question of agricultural labourers' wages was discussed.  One of the members of the Committee said that the average wage of the married agricultural labourer in his area was 8/- a week, with his support.  That was stated at a meeting which was reported in the &ldquo;Wexford People&rdquo; of February 2nd.  They were at that time pointing out the condition of agricultural labourers' wages in the country and showing that it was such that they thought the free beef scheme should be extended to agricultural labourers in Wexford.  A month afterwards they were reiterating the position, and another and different member of the same Committee, at a meeting which was reported on 2nd March, 1935, when they were discussing the paying of a bonus by the Government towards agricultural labourers' wages, stated that he would like to include in his motion a request that the wage be brought to 14/- a week&mdash;a subsidy of 6/-.  It was there reiterated that the average wage was 8/- a week, and that a Government subsidy of 6/- a week was required to raise the agricultural labourers' wages there to 14/-.  We have further confirmation. The Minister can refer to things that must have come under his own notice, such as the cottage rent collector in South Tipperary, who had to report to the Commissioner administering the county that he could not <Col N="1178" /> collect the rents because some of the agricultural labourers there had only 8/- per week, some were out of work and some were dependent on outdoor relief.  On 18th June of this year, the Bishop of Cork, speaking at Water-grasshill, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be well for the Government to realise that there are many labourers with families who are not getting more than 10/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One final bit of evidence is taken from the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of 18th November, 1935.  It is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yardman; good milker, early riser; excellent references; 7/- (indoor), anywhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position to which the class of person, so beautifully described by the Commission in its interim report and for whose benefit the Minister introduces this measure, has been reduced.  The Minister must know that the position is as bad as that, and he must know that through the administration of his Department he is going to make it worse.  Publicity has been given within the last few days to certain proposals with regard to relief work.  I admit that they have been hatched in the Office of Public Works, and a couple of years ago an attempt was made to try them on contractors for the Board of Works in the City of Dublin.  An attempt was made to casualise the regular employees of contractors who work for the Board of Works, but it did not come off.  Now it is going to be worked on the county councils, and the Minister knows that we are going to have a position very shortly in which road workers&mdash;and many of them occupy these cottages&mdash; who have in the past had as part of their regular domestic economy four or five months' wages on the road coming in to them, are going to be deprived of that; are going to be thrown in with the other men in the area who are out of employment at present, for reasons which the Minister can estimate, and are going to be casualised in such a way that they will lose the greater part of what was their normal income through work on the roads.</P>

      <P>When we look at the type of person who occupies these cottages, we find that in South Cork&mdash; I am quoting from page 25 of the Minority Report&mdash;where there are 610 tenants, 171 are road workers.  That is just a sample.  The same will be found in various parts of the country.  As I say, it is merely one of the additional things which are coming down on the unfortunate people who are tenants of these cottages and which will make it impossible for them to bear the additional burdens which this scheme would bring into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is so solicitous for the position of the ratepayers that when there was an election atmosphere it was possible to read this into the majority report that the rates could be relieved to the extent of £50,000, but if everything that could possibly be done, according to the committee, were put into operation the rates could only be relieved to the extent of £28,033.  It has been pointed out that the ratepayers in the country are staggering this year under astounding burdens that they never contemplated they would have to bear: that, in spite of the promises that were made to them, they are paying £310,000 more this year on normal assessable expenditure <Col N="1180" /> for the year than they were paying in the year 1931-32, that they have £240,688 as well to make up in excess of arrears over the 1931-32 period, and that they have to make up £159,884 in respect of unpaid land annuities, not to talk of what is taken out of their pockets in respect of land annuities that have not been included in the assessment.  From the ratepayers' point of view the position is even worse.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point, and that is with regard to the tenant. Would the Minister say if he has any explanation to offer as to the astounding rise in the amount of arrears on labourers' cottage rents.  The arrears on the 31st March, 1932, were £34,519, and on the 31st March, 1935, they amounted to £53,949.  The arrears had, therefore, risen by 53 per cent.  In Clare they had risen by 44 per cent., in South Cork by 57 per cent., and in Kerry by 32.5 per cent., the increase in the amount being £4,148.  In the County Limerick arrears had risen by 95 per cent. or by the sum of £3,072.  They had risen by a comparatively small amount in South Tipperary.  Nevertheless, they had risen by 100 per cent. or by a sum of £598, in spite, I am sure, of the vigilant care and hard work of the Commissioner.  As far as Limerick is concerned, the Minister will have seen the extent to which the Limerick Board of Health is endeavouring to go in squeezing the rents out of the tenants which, in many cases, the courts have decided they have not got.  At the present time it is stated that, where they have 4,500 cottages, court proceedings are being taken against a large number of defaulters, and that the board have no alternative, in some of these cases, but to collect the arrears.  There is one particular case of a man who was summoned for the possession of his labourer's cottage.  He said that the amount due in this case was £5 5s. 3d., but that the council owed him £24. There were other cases in which the council owed the occupiers of these cottages additional sums.  Therefore, you have the position that the Limerick County Council is at the present moment struggling under its <Col N="1181" /> own financial difficulties in such a way that, I suppose, as was so often the case before, the payment of the road workers' wages is outstanding for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the new cottages. I take it from his remarks that the new cottages are going to be dealt with under the purchase scheme, although it was not suggested in the report that they would be.  From the point of view of the State, and of the ratepayers generally, we ought to look a little at the position of our general housing finance.  We are only dealing in those figures here with 42,000 houses.  The Minister has already told us, I think, that by the 30th of June last 4,292 additional cottages had been built.  He told Deputy Norton that by the 30th October, 1935, there were 4,754 new cottages erected, 2,848 in course of erection and 4,711 approved, in all 12,313 additional cottages built and subsidised by the State under the terms of the 1932-33 Housing Acts.  Let us examine for a moment, in just a few brief figures, the whole position of our housing finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of housing finance is only relevant so far as it relates to the purchase of these cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase of these cottages involves the purchase of the 4,754 cottages erected up to the 30th October.  The terms of the Bill suggest that it involves the purchase of the 2,848 in course of erection and the 4,711 approved and whatever other additional cottages will be built to meet the needs of approximately another 100,000 agricultural labourers in the country.  I am not going to weary the House with what these figures would be, but I am going to present to the House the commitments that have been undertaken by the State as well as the expenditure under the Acts passed in the last few years. I will only deal with the amount of these commitments which relates to labourers' cottages.  I only want to put to the House the general housing figures&mdash;the background of the labourers' cottage figures&mdash;because I think they ought to be there.  They <Col N="1182" /> are not very many.  Under the Minister's recent Housing Acts, the figures that I have are only up to the 30th of June, 1935.  These are the last figures that we have been able to get by means of Parliamentary question. According to these figures, there have been 4,292 labourers' cottages built. The State has assumed responsibility for a capital sum of £170 in respect of each of these cottages.  The result in State debt is £729,640.  There have been built in urban areas 3,108 non-replacement houses.  The State accepts responsibility for £151 on the average for each of these houses.  The result in State debt at the moment in respect of them is £467,282.  There have been 5,739 replacement houses built in respect of each of which the State shoulders responsibility for £227 on the average.  The result in State debt in respect of these is £1,300,613, or, in respect of these 13,149 houses, a total debt of £2,497,535.  In addition, the State has paid out in grants £601,770 towards the construction, by private persons, of £9,856 houses. That gives a gross total of 22,955 houses with a total cost, so far as the State is concerned, of £3,099,305.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The background is there in that figure of £3,099,305 in State money.  The sum of £601,770 has been spent, and the remainder has been left as a burden of debt on the people of the State.  I have pointed out already that in the case of the 24,000 odd houses built before the Minister's administration, when the taxation and revenue of this country were much smaller than they are now, that every halfpenny of money that was given to help housing was given out of revenue.  So much for the background. Let me now confine myself to the labourers' cottages erected, to those in course of erection and those approved up to the 30th of October, <Col N="1183" /> 1935.  The total is 12,313 at a figure of £170 per cottage.  The State is raising money, and leaving it as a debt on the taxpayers of this country in respect of these 12,313 cottages to the extent of £2,093,210.</P>
      <P>The local authorities in whose areas these cottages are being built are saddling the farmer ratepayers of these counties with a debt of £738,840. The Minister seems to question the reasonableness of referring to the appalling burden of debt that is being put on the taxpayers in dealing with this question of housing.  If he is so sensitive with regard to the taxpayer, I shall be satisfied if he deals only with the ratepayer.  I should like him to tell us if he is going to continue the procedure he has adopted in respect of the labourers' cottages that are now being built&mdash;the procedure of burdening the taxpayer with £170 and of burdening the ratepayer with £60 and handing over the cottage to a new tenant for a capital sum of £58.  The report tells us that the cost of cottage and plot in pre-war days was £155. Now, the average all-in cost of the cottage&mdash;I am not clear if the plot is included but for the moment I shall presume that it is&mdash;is £288.  How many more of the £288 cottages is the Minister going to arrange for at the cost I mentioned to the ratepayers and to the State?  If the labourers' cottage scheme was introduced, as the Minister says, to help unfortunate agricultural labourers who had not decent houses, he must be aware that there are&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;50,000 agricultural labourers as badly off now as the others were before the labourers' cottage scheme was introduced. Where does he think the money is to come from to put these agricultural labourers into occupation of their cottages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That takes us up against the general situation in the country.  The general situation is that the people who are to be asked to pay these rates and the people who are to be asked to pay these taxes are being impoverished right, left and centre by the choking down of the real source of production&mdash;that is, the agricultural <Col N="1184" /> industry, for the service of which these additional cottages are required.  I take it that the Minister would tell us that the only reason why additional agricultural labourers' cottages are required is that we want them to serve as equipment for the better assistance of the agricultural industry.  The labourers' wages have fallen, since 1931, from the point at which this committee examined the position with regard to agricultural labourers and their wages.  The burden of rates has gone up on the people upon whom we are depending both for rates and taxes to pay off these loans and to provide the capital that will enable an agricultural labourer to get a £288 house and plot for £58.  They are being prevented from earning what would ordinarily keep them in decent circumstances by the general policy pursued from 1931 to 1934.  The farmers' income from the market he used to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely Deputy Davin, of all persons, does not think that, as regards providing houses for agricultural labourers and rural workers, we are going to stop at the 42,000 mentioned in the report or at the 12,000 mentioned in the reply given by the Minister to Deputy Norton the other day.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was discussing the motion that a special committee should be set up to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government on Saorstát agriculture.  In the course of the debate Deputy Corry speaking in column 861, volume 59 of the Official Debates said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I see very little use in setting up this committee, because Deputy Belton knows as well as I do, or any sane man in the country&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It will be observed that Deputy Corry differentiates between sane men.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;that I can get a committee to report in favour of or against anything I like.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in itself should be sufficient answer to Deputy Belton's proposal, that the committee should consist of 11 members and should be named by the Committee of Selection.  He knows that the precedent in this House is that the majority on the commission would be got to report anything he wanted.  Of course he went on to explain what he meant.  He wants the country to believe that the farmers in East Cork are embarrassed at their prosperity; that they are making more money to-day than they ever made before.  The Deputy went on to elaborate the way in which that is done.  I pointed out before, and I do so again, despite the oration of the Minister for Agriculture in County Wexford a few days ago, in which he exhorted us to eat veal, that economic facts remain, and that the most outstanding economic fact is that there are 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country, and that less than 5,000,000 acres will produce all the wheat, all the beet, and all the foodstuffs <Col N="1187" /> of every description that the population could consume.  You are then left with more than 7,000,000 acres of arable land, the agricultural produce of which is to this country what the natural resources of Great Britain are to Great Britain, gold to South Africa, or oil to the United States of America. It is on this land the tariffs which are imposed by Great Britain are falling, and it is upon the prices and the productivity of the land that the losses resulting from the economic war are falling.  The Minister for Agriculture recommends a diet of veal.  He also suggested that we should drink milk. The President recommended a diet of light beer.  As to the suggestion of these distinguished statesmen to drink light beer and milk and to eat veal&mdash; and who thanked God that the British market is gone for ever&mdash;how can even the dullest member of the Fianna Fáil Party, unless he be of Deputy Corry's mentality, doubt what the incidence of the special duties imposed by Great Britain in the course of the economic war are?  What necessity is there for cloaking up these patent facts, by making them the material for a committee, when the verdict is already given in the immortal words of Deputy Corry, the honest, outspoken member of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I see very little use in setting up this committee, because Deputy Belton knows as well as I do, or any sane man in the country, that I can get a committee to report in favour of or against anything I like.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are sometimes told that it is not the economic war that is affecting us at all, that it was our adherence to archaic and old-fashioned ideas of agriculture before the blessed advent of Fianna Fáil, and that if we would adopt the methods recommended to us by the Minister for Agriculture and the President all would be well with the agricultural edifice that they propose to erect on wheat, tobacco and turf. Turf used to play a very great part in that agricultural renaissance.  Tobacco went up the spout about six months ago.  I wonder if turf has gone up the spout after it, and the bags with the turf.  Now we have machine-made turf. <Col N="1188" /> What I want to submit to the House is that the rest of the scheme is going up the spout, and that if we abandon what they are pleased to describe as our archaic methods of agriculture we will soon be left with no methods of agriculture at all, but universal infertility over the whole land.  Now the wheat scheme is going up the spout, and it is going up the spout because rational men will be forced to the conclusion, before very long, that it is not only waste of good land but is leading us to the fantastic position in which the people will be forced to eat cake because they will not be able to afford bread.  All the wheat wanted in this country can be supplied from 600,000 acres of land.  I venture to say that if that ideal is reached, bread will become a luxury that no one can afford except the wealthy; the entire live stock will have to be concentrated in the south-east of Ireland, and it will be illegal to keep a cow in the provinces of Connaught or Leinster. Unless that is done, the crazy ideal of producing all the wheat we can consume in this country can never be realised.  Some 600,000 acres of wheat represent approximately 4,800,000 barrels, and that is going to cost us £1,000,000 per annum in subsidy, over and above the economic price for the wheat.  That money is going to be charged upon the price of bread.</P>

On another occasion I hope to have an opportunity of working out in detail how that £1,000,000 will increase the cost of bread.  It has also this ridiculous aspect that if the requisite manure to fertilise the soil for the production of wheat is to be made available, we must have approximately 1,800,000 cattle in or about where the wheat is to be grown or else we shall have a Fianna Fáil plan for bringing dung from, say, Gweedore to Taghmon.  It will take the manure of 1,800,000 cattle to fertilise the soil of this country for the production of the requisite quantity of wheat.  Without elaborating that aspect of the matter&mdash;and I look forward to an occasion upon which we can investigate the full advantages that will accrue to the new air line of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Great Southern Railways by the transport of dung at goods rates&mdash; I shall merely ask Deputies to realise the asinine imbecility into which they are being led by the arch-priest of this folly, the Minister for Agriculture. Surely they must realise that unless we have a profitable market for the agricultural surplus that is going to be produced by the 7,000,000 acres of arable land, and unless we can dispose of that agricultural surplus at a profit, the standard of living of those people is going to fall down steadily until we get to the stage when nobody in this country will produce any more than he <Col N="1190" /> himself consumes on his own land, and when in fact everybody will be living at the level at which our grandfathers were living in 1849&mdash;the bare subsistence level&mdash;so that any natural cataclysm will precipitate half the population into starvation unless the English people come across and feed us.  Surely that is neither a desirable nor a dignified position for what is potentially one of the greatest food-producing countries in the world.</P>
      <P>Tariffs such as are being imposed at the present time are going inevitably to destroy agriculture as a profit-making enterprise in this country.  The land will always remain, and though it may be extremely difficult to get the agricultural community back upon its feet, so long as the land is there and there are men and women there, that industry can be made to recover.  It may involve more suffering for the people but still there is a way out.  But the consequences of that collapse may be far greater because a great many Deputies and a great many people in this country forget one factor of vital importance.  The industrial revival in this country depends not upon tariffs, not upon quotas, not upon trade loans or subsidies; it depends upon the capacity of the Irish people to buy the products of Irish factories.  It does not matter how many tariffs you have, how many subsidies there are, if the farmers of this country cannot consume the products of Irish factories there is nobody else to consume them.  And bear in mind that unlike land, factories do not remain.  Close them down by lack of demand, scatter your skilled staff, break up the capital that keeps them going and it will be a big job to restore them.  We have seen ten years of industrial progress in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every Deputy got considerable liberty in dealing with the motion and every Deputy travelled outside the terms of the motion, but I think Deputy Dillon is traversing a much wider field than anybody so far endeavoured to travel on this motion.  He is traversing the whole industrial policy of the Government, not alone its agricultural policy. He is endeavouring to deal with the <Col N="1191" /> Government's industrial policy now.

      <P>I will make the case, departing from the matter to which I was just referring now, that when the committee proceeds to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government, it is going to do it in the light of the public undertaking given by Deputy Corry that he will make that committee report whatever he wants them to report without reference to the evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the statement I made was that any Deputy in this House with any grain of sense&mdash;I do not include Deputy Dillon in that category&mdash; knows very well that he could get the committee to report just as he wishes. Deputy Dillon, of course, is still in the moon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I therefore say that urgent and vital considerations, far from being clarified by the setting up of such a committee, are going to be obscured.  I submit to the House that one vital and urgent matter is going <Col N="1192" /> to be obscured and it is this, that with the destruction of the productivity of the soil by the imposition of penal tariffs on the agricultural produce of these 7,000,000 acres of land to which I have referred, you are going not only to have a disastrous effect on industry, but you are going to have something that is very much more dangerous.  You are going to have the collapse of social services in this country. I ask Deputy Belton does he seriously imagine that, if that case is made and proven to a committee, of which Deputy Corry forms one of the majority, a finding will emerge from that committee which will be of any value to this House or anybody else?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it?  Will that committee not combine, by their influence and position, to produce a finding calculated to reassure the people, and say that, having heard all the evidence and seen the witnesses, they are satisfied that there is no immediate danger?  Deputy Corry says that is the verdict he is going to find, no matter what evidence you bring before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is no hope for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is.  The hope I have is that, while Deputy Corry can perform any kind of miracle within the committee where he has a majority, we still have this House. We still have an opportunity in this country of speaking the truth with perfect liberty so far as the rules of order will permit in this House.  That is why I want to direct Deputy Belton's attention to the danger of removing from the forum of this House to the committee room questions of such vital interest as those upon which I am touching now.  I say that if the productivity of that 7,000,000 acres of land is made uneconomic by the imposition of these tariffs you are going to have a situation arising in this country when the Exchequer will be no longer able to find money to pay old age pensions on the scale on <Col N="1193" /> which they are at present paid, or unemployment assistance, or the grants which they are making for a variety of other social purposes.  So we are brought face to face with the fact that one of the first sections of the community which will suffer, and suffer hardest, are the poor; and they are going to suffer not only as a direct result of the tariffs themselves, but very largely from the crazy efforts of the Government to offset the effects. They are going to get it fore and at.</P>
      <P>What I apprehend is this: that if the State fails in its duty to the poor, in its duty to alleviate the suffering of those economically embarrassed, for one reason or another, they are handing those people over into the hands of any agitator who inveighs not against the mistakes of a democratic Government, not against the mistakes of a particular Party, but against the institutions of the State.  If you make a people sufficiently desperate by poverty and hopelessness you make their minds very fertile soil for subversionary doctrines which put the case to them: &ldquo;You have tried everything else; you cannot be any worse than you are; try what we have to offer now.&rdquo;  Any Deputy who lives in rural Ireland knows that the people living in the country are falling steadily in their standard of living. Deputy Corry says that if I bring those people before the committee he will find others who will come and swear them down.  What is the use of my summoning friends or neighbours to come and tell&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch the Deputy.  What is he saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the same advice that the Minister for Local Government gave to my colleague, let him read the Official Reports and he will find out.  If I bring people before that committee there will be others brought.  What is the use?  I can bring dozens of men and women who will swear before that committee that they find money becoming so scarce they are no longer able to keep the same standard of living in their houses as they used to have.  I see myself, and I know <Col N="1194" /> people who have told me, and who will be quite ready to come and give that testimony before such a committee as Deputy Belton has in mind, that two or three years ago they considered it to be the hallmark of comfort that they had a bag of flour, a bag of oatmeal, a side of bacon, a stone of sugar, a pound of tea home with them from the market.  Those same people bring to-day, instead of a bag of flour, a stone of flour; instead of a bag of oatmeal, a stone of oatmeal.  Those same people, who used to buy the best tea that money could buy, now buy the cheapest. They skimp their children in sugar and they wear clogs instead of boots. They can get on; they are not starving. They can live; but life is a very different thing for them from what it was.  Their standard of living is falling, they are getting poorer.</P>
      <P>I know it is hard for Deputies who sit here, or who prosper in East Cork, to sympathise with people in that condition.  I know it is hard for Ministers, who are in receipt of large salaries and generous perquisites, living in Dublin, seldom if ever going down the country, never coming in contact with the daily lives of the people, to realise that the affluence they enjoy is confined to the Government Benches.  It is not reflected even in their own supporters; it is reflected nowhere in the country in the homes of the people.  It is notorious to everybody that it takes a long time to tear down an agricultural community founded on the small holder.  They will slowly sink down to the level of subsistence.  It is only then that the town dweller will really begin to suffer.  But, in the process of sinking down, our people are suffering terribly at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Deputy Belton think that there is any use in my bringing evidence before a committee, on which Deputy Corry has a majority, to prove that?  Of course there is not.  So I put it to you, lest I strain your patience by straying into paths on which I should like to travel&mdash;because I think it is good that Deputies should learn something of what is passing in the country&mdash;that there is <Col N="1195" /> no use in my bringing evidence of any kind before such a committee. Far from its being any use, I should be co-operating with Deputy Corry in perpetrating a fraud on the people. Here is the place to tell the Government what they do not know, and that is, the condition into which people are being driven by their folly.  Here is the place to tell the Government that the people are getting poorer.  Here is the place to tell the Government and their supporters that the taxes they are piling up are falling on the backs of those least able to bear them.</P>
    <P>Will it avail anything for me to bring evidence before that committee to show that the wife of a small farmer, whose every article of production is suffering under these penal taxes, when she goes into a shop to buy her weekly supplies of groceries and household goods, drapery, hardware, and boots, is to-day paying into the Exchequer in indirect taxes at least 4/- out of every pound she spends?  That is a very conservative estimate.  Every small farmer's wife who goes in to do her marketing in any town pays into the Exchequer 4/- in indirect taxes for every pound she spends.  Is it any use bringing evidence of that before Deputy Corry's commission?  The facts are simple. The economic war and the taxes which flow therefrom are ruining agriculture in this country.  It will take some time to consummate that ruin, but when it comes, industry and the social services will be ruined with it.  Not only the farmer will fall but every other section of the community will fall with him, and, in the collapse of the Irish people, this nation, as an independent nation, will be disgraced for all time.</P>
    <P>There is only one remedy for that state of affairs.  There is only one finding that that committee could honestly come to, and that is that the incidence of this taxation is upon the agricultural surplus which is the source, and the only source, of the national wealth of this country, and that any responsible Government of the Irish people have as their first and paramount duty to settle by negotiation the economic war <Col N="1196" /> which President de Valera has boasted he had the honour to commence.  The only honest finding they could arrive at is to give to the President and the Executive Council of this country the same advice that the President so eloquently gave at Geneva to Signor Mussolini two or three weeks ago: Let there be a peace conference before the war instead of after the war.  Let there be a peace conference now.  Let there be a settlement now.  Let there be an end to sanctions here.  Let there be an example shown to Italy and every other country by the Government of this country; and let there be prosperity returned to the agricultural community of Ireland, and the other sections of the community will look after themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper of this House for nearly 12 months, and during that 12 months every Party in this House, on public platforms and in the public Press all over this country, has told the farmers of this country what they have been suffering and that a remedy must be found for those sufferings.  I would like the Press to expose that hypocrisy in their issues to-morrow and show that politicians do not care one tuppenny hoot about what the agricultural community is suffering at the present time.  If proof is wanted of that, I wish they could show a photographic picture to-morrow of this House and the interest that is taken in this motion.  It is time the mask of hypocrisy was taken off this House and off all political Parties.  I have here an illuminating leading article apropos of that.  It is the leading article, in its issue of last week, in a journal published in the constituency represented by the one Minister who now adorns the Government Benches.  I refer to the <i>Kilkenny People</i> of the 16th November.  The article is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This country is suffering, amongst other ailments, from a severe attack of sanctions-itis.  It is a self-imposed disease.  What are the facts?  The Dáil, now omnipotent&mdash;for the the Senate is on its last legs&mdash;is made up of three political Parties: Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Labour.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, nobody will forget Deputy Corry for his ignorance.  The article continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Those three Parties cannot be got to agree on any mortal thing concerning their own country, which should have the first claim on their allegiance.  They cannot be got to agree on any common line of policy to get rid of the sanctions which the British Government has imposed on the Free State, but they can all agree in aiding the British Government to impose sanctions on another country that has never done us any harm, a country, indeed, that has many ancient ties with our own.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They are right in saying that they did agree in aiding the British Government to impose sanctions on another country. Now, that form is reproduced in this House on this motion.  I followed Deputy Dillon's long speech very closely to find if he would commit himself to any line; but he did not.  On the other hand, with the exception of two back benchers, Deputies Moore and Corry, no Deputy on the Government Benches considered it worth his while to speak.  None of those patriots who wanted to wade in the blood of Britain, and who have now allied themselves to Britain, thought it worth his while to get up and speak on this motion.  Deputy Dillon made an attack, not on this motion, not on the proposal set out here, but upon the agricultural policy of the Government. If my eyes did not deceive me, I read in the public Press within the last two or three weeks, after the exist of Deputy MacDermot, who followed after me, where Deputy Dillon's Party had adopted that agricultural policy.  Now, are we living in an age of pure deception?</P>
      <P>There are a few other interesting points that I should like to hear something about.  Deputy McMenamin, in speaking on this motion, talked about the select committee.  Having quoted the first part of the motion, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the first part.  I candidly say I do not like that at all, nor can I support it.  I am not going to ask anybody in this country to support <Col N="1198" /> the continuance of the economic war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This motion does not ask anybody to do so.  However, he goes on as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My opinion is that they have borne it so long that they are no longer fit to bear anything.  For that reason, I cannot understand why Deputies Belton and Kent put down the motion in this form.  The second part of the motion says: `That the committee consist of 11 members who shall be nominated by the Committee of Selection.' What is this committee to do?  They are to distribute the incidence of the economic war.  Speaking for myself, if I were to help to distribute the incidence of the economic war, more than it is distributed at the present time, I would not be discharging my duty.  I do not think there is one individual in my constituency, or in any constituency, who has not borne this burden up to the breaking point; and I think everybody would be delighted if some method were found to put an end to this thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy goes on to speak further, but I shall not burden the House with the whole quotation.  However, I have quoted enough to indicate that Deputy McMenamin, representing the municipality of the County Donegal, will not support this motion.  Now we come to Deputy McGilligan.  It is strange that the echo of the voices of all these people, who make these sweeping statements on this motion, can still be found in the land where they have addressed meetings of farmers, telling them what they are suffering and their policy to alleviate those sufferings. Deputy McGilligan said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not see that it is possible to distribute more equitably the burden of the economic war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said something similar. Now, we have Deputies Brennan, McMenamin, McGilligan, and Dillon. Well, let us see the authority that those Deputies have from their own people.  I challenge contradiction on this.  Organisations in this country are nearly all similarly constituted.  There is an annual convention, or an Ard <Col N="1199" /> Fheis, held, and that is the supreme authority of that organisation.  Those Deputies, whom I have just quoted, held that Ard Fheis last March, and I am going to quote a motion proposed at that Ard Fheis last March and carried unanimously.  The motion was sent forward by the Cappawhite branch of Fine Gael, County Tipperary, Cashel district executive.  I am quoting from the agenda, and this was given to me on Sunday last by a man who was at that meeting and who came up from the country to help the passage of this motion.  He informed me that it was carried unanimously. This is the motion and I will ask anybody here to think it over and say how much it differs&mdash;if it differs even in a comma from the motion that I have put up here, seconded by Deputy Kent&mdash;the motion that Deputies on those benches said they will not support.  Here is the motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That as a result of the financial dispute between the Saorstát and Great Britain, the burden of the annual payments previously paid by the Saorstát as a whole is now borne by the agricultural industry and, in consequence, prices for agricultural produce have been depressed on the export market, and the home market prices with the exception of butter have been lowered to the export price level; that we call on the Government to remedy this injustice by shifting the burden from agriculture to the whole nation and that we suggest the most feasible way to do this is to increase the bounties to the level of the tariffs imposed by England.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was carried by the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis last March and it was carried unanimously.  I state emphatically that any member of the Fine Gael Party who votes against the motion that we have down here is betraying the trust given him by that Ard-Fheis.  There is a mandate there to support a certain policy.  That is the policy in the resolution I have just read.  I will give way to any Deputy on those benches who can claim that he has authority to go against the direction of his own Ard-Fheis.</P>
    <P>In, moving this motion I have kept <Col N="1200" /> as close to the exact wording as I possibly could.  In my short address I did not mention the economic war.  I did not mention any policy.  I stated there the facts as they appeared to me and I asked for this select committee to be set up to investigate the incidence of these tariffs and to ascertain if there was anything in the allegation that agriculture is bearing the whole burden of the economic war. I submit that the Government Party did not face facts.  They cannot face them, because the members on the Front Bench and the President himself have admitted so much that they cannot make a case against this motion. The President cannot make a case against this motion unless he wants all of us clearly and emphatically to see that he does not want the truth to come out.  Of course the position has not been improved by the silence on the Government Benches.  Labour, who are concerned about agricultural wages do not think it worth their while to speak on this motion.  Surely Labour sees the relation between agricultural output, agricultural profits and the capacity of that industry to pay wages, large or small.  But Labour, too, will not face the issue fairly and clearly.  Deputy Moore paid me the more or less left-handed compliment of saying that I am an agriculturist and an economist and that, in his opinion, it would take ten years to carry through this investigation. Of course it would take ten years to carry through any investigation when you do not want to carry the investigation through.  For example, if I wanted to walk over to the opposite door and started in the contrary direction I would never reach that door.  That is the sort of investigation that Deputy Moore visualised and that is the sort of investigation that Deputy Corry had in mind when he said he could get a committee to do anything or to find anything he wanted.</P>
    <P>No wonder that this House is getting into contempt in the country.  Speak of the Dáil anywhere to a man to-day and the man to whom you speak laughs.  Is there any wonder that responsible members of this House will go down the country, preach one thing <Col N="1201" /> there and come in here and do another thing?  I have given quotations now that are irrefutable.  Then red herrings are pulled across.  Deputy Corry is an adept at that thing.  He never gets up to speak on agriculture&mdash; and to speak intelligently on it&mdash;but he draws across the red herrings.  He talks about John Bull's bullocks. Why is the Government subsidising the sending of bullocks to John Bull? The thing is a farce and it is about time we got down to business.  Better send the bullocks to John Bull than old cows to Roscrea.  Better send the animals to John Bull than to continue the slaughter of the innocent calves for 10/- of a subsidy on a calf skin that is not worth a tanner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broderick was quoted as saying that anybody who went in for the Government's agricultural policy made money.  Of course you cannot argue on national affairs with men whose vision is not beyond the tips of their noses.  Nobody can deny that when, in the first or second year of office of the present Government, they remitted the excise duty on tobacco grown in this country, it was giving the grower of tobacco a market worth 9/- to 10/- a lb. for tobacco of which the commercial value was only 5d. or 6d.  The manufacturer would have to pay 9/- or 10/- a lb. for that.  What happened?  The grower and the manufacturer split the 9/- or the 10/- between them.  The grower made a handsome profit, got money for nothing, and the manufacturer got money for nothing.  The Minister for Finance wiped the cobwebs off his eyes the following year because he saw what the Exchequer and the country lost, and he realised he could not sustain that.  Anybody who thinks nationally in economic or political affairs must look beyond his nose and it is no use thinking individually or selfishly of &ldquo;What can I make if I do so and so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even before the people now on the Government Benches thought that a plough was any use in the country, I advocated the policy of the plough, and I still advocate it.  Deputy Corry put up a case about growing wheat and beet, doing more tillage.  Suppose <Col N="1202" /> we all go in for a big drive in that direction, what will the produce be worth to you?  It will be worth the international price, because the day we export it we must sell on the international market and we cannot get more than the international price.</P>
    <P>I do not want to develop a discussion on that.  I have mentioned it sufficiently to get to a point of relevancy in connection with the motion. Deputy Corry pointed out that the market we have got in the shape of a wheat market is compensation for what we lost on the export market in connection with our cattle and other farm produce.  Let us visualise what the situation would be like if there were no economic war.  I would like to know if the Fianna Fáil Party had in mind the agricultural policy they have put into operation before there was any danger of an economic war or, to give it its up-to-date name, before there was any danger of sanctions.  Before the imposition of these sanctions by the Government's friend, John Bull, the Government had in mind the development of a scheme of tillage economy here.  That tillage economy could not be put over unless an inducement was offered to the farmers, unless there was some indication that putting more land under the plough would be a profitable operation for them.  All the inducements that have been given to increase the area under tillage would have to be given, and possibly more would have to be given, if there had not been an economic war, so that anything that has been paid to the farmers by way of subsidy for more wheat or beet or any of those things&mdash;more corn&mdash;would have been a necessary consequence of a Fianna Fáil tillage economy scheme.</P>
    <P>With such a thing I would be 100 per cent. in agreement, but my point is that it is in no way a compensation for the losses entailed by the economic war.  It is entirely irrelevant to drag that in.  It would have to be done in any case if there were never an economic war.  There would have to be some inducement to get farmers to till the land.  If there had been no economic war the inducement <Col N="1203" /> would have to be even greater, because the old system of economy would be more profitable and a higher bid would have to be made by the Government to get the farmers to change their system of economy.  That is quite obvious to anybody.  But anybody whose mind is saturated with the philosophy: &ldquo;I will get a committee to find anything&rdquo; will not see that.  We have had all this twaddle, this red-herring across the path, of &ldquo;Look at what we have got for wheat.&rdquo;  What was got for wheat was necessary in order to encourage the growing of wheat here and it was entirely apart from the economic war and the Government should have visualised that before there was any danger of an economic war or sanctions.</P>
    <P>The same applies to beet and the little odds and ends that the Government dishonestly claim as a set-off to the economic war.  If they feel there is any substance in their claim, why do they not accept this committee? If there is any truth in what Deputy Corry says, that they can get this committee, no matter how it is constituted, to report any way they want, why do they not get it?  They are afraid of it; they know the position and they are afraid of the issue.  They know that the report of any committee of 11 that takes evidence must be related to that evidence and they know that evidence can be put up that cannot be refuted by any hostile witness. There are Deputies who wonder if there are people ready to put up a case to this committee.  I can assure them there are people ready to submit a case they can stand over and that cannot be refuted.  I know a case has been put up to the Government by farmer supporters of their own, by, for instance, farmers from the County Meath, from Deputy Kelly's constituency.  They met in Ballivor and they invited him to the meeting.</P>

For Heaven's sake, let Deputies opposite not be &ldquo;Yes men&rdquo; all their lives.  Let them not forever remain as overgrown babies and dummies.  The case which I have now to go into in some detail would I consider be better dealt with before the committee for which this motion asks.  It will scarcely now get an opportunity of being heard by such committee.  It will have to be considered by those in this House who listen to it, and by the committee of public opinion at the next election to be held in this country.  I regret that I have to go in some detail into the case, especially as it has been gone into, in certain aspects, in great detail by those who have spoken upon this motion.  Certain Deputies have said they do not want this motion; that they were against the economic war, lock, stock and barrel; but there, they were only seeking an easy line of retreat.  I have been against the economic war and against sanctions, lock, stock and barrel.  But a certain thing happened which, while it did not make me change my opinion upon the economic war, did make me change my attitude upon the matter. The reason for that was the straight fight, upon that issue that took place at the local elections last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who stood on platforms in opposition to the economic war, taking it all round, were fairly and squarely beaten at that election.  After that we could not keep on shouting, and I have never since, in public, spoken the way I did before the economic war, though I am still opposed to the economic war.  But I hold it is not relevant to be always voicing the case of hostility to the economic war when the voters of this country have spoken on that issue.  I accept that verdict, but when the time comes again I shall fight against the economic war as before.  But until that time I must try to alleviate the hardships created by the economic war.  Consequently I put down this motion in consultation with Deputy Kent, and whilst leaving the issue, that is the question of the <Col N="1205" /> economic war, severely alone, we consider that there is a very good sound case to be made for an equitable distribution of the burden of this economic war, and, I think, upon that principle no Deputy in this House would say that the burden should not be equitably distributed.  Some hold that it is not equitably distributed, and that one particular section of the community is bearing the whole burden.  Other people say it is equitably distributed. Deputy Moore gave us the Government's point of view and I accepted it in full.  He gave us the Government's point of view and no one else has spoken on the Government side except Deputy Corry who indulged in his usual eccentricities about wheat and beet and John Bull.  I accept Deputy Moore's announcement of the Government point of view that the burden of the economic war is equally distributed.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt Deputy Belton to say I was wondering how far he thinks the vote at the local elections would justify him in the action he has taken.  If the local elections settled the economic war, how is it that they have not settled the question as to the distribution of the burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is this as I see it: The contention of one group in this country is that the bigger issue&mdash; the economic war&mdash;is settled, and the question then is how should we adapt ourselves internally in fighting that issue?  I know farmers who have said to me, collectively, that on the issue of the economic war or sanctions, between this country and Great Britain, rather than strike our colours they would be prepared to starve, but that they were going to let the President know that they were not going to carry the whole burden.  That is precisely my attitude in this matter I am not prepared to starve to fight this ridiculous economic war, but I make no point on that, because I accept the verdict of the country on it.  The issue before us between the late elections, and the time in which we will have to consult the electorate again, is how to distribute the burden of the economic war equitably amongst all classes of the community.  And it is to endeavour to <Col N="1206" /> get that equitable distribution that we have put down this motion.  I think it is only fair to ask the Government to give us the opportunity we seek of having an investigation.  If they do not give it their refusal can only be interpreted in one light, namely, they are afraid of the issue.  They know the position really is as Deputy Kent and myself and other speakers have put it before the House.  Why should they be afraid of it?  If that committee were set up, made thorough investigations, and reported that there is at present an equitable distribution of the burden, then in regard to the farmer who would get up and squeal I would be the first man here to say he is a traitor to his country.  If he is called upon to bear no greater part of the load than any other member of the community&mdash;no greater part of the burden which has been decided on by the men and women voters of this country in a free election&mdash;then the farmer has no right to squeal any more than anyone else.  If he is carrying only an equal share of the load he has no right to squeal.  I hold that he is carrying the whole of the load, despite all the little intricacies of economies into which Deputy McGilligan tried to lead us.  He is carrying the whole load; that is a case which we want investigated, and which the Government is afraid to investigate.  When they refuse to make that investigation they cannot refute the charge made by agriculture that agriculture has to bear the whole burden.  They did not get any verdict from the people to make one section of the community bear the whole load.  They got a verdict from the people to fight Britain on this issue.  That is the only verdict that they got; they would not get 20 per cent. of the votes on the other issue&mdash; the issue we are putting up here.  I would challenge Deputy Corry&mdash;or anybody else on those benches&mdash;to stand up here and say that the farmer should bear more than his share of the burden. Of course he will not.  He may have an honest opinion that the farmer has only to bear his equitable share, but he cannot deny the fact that there are thousands of people in this country who hold that the farmer is bearing the whole lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the grounds we have for our claim that agriculture is bearing the whole burden?  Just in passing I might say that if I have no right to speak for agriculture, if I have no constituents but city constituents, surely I cannot be accused of any selfish motives if I make a case for the farming community.  The Deputy has said that I am not elected by a farming constituency.  I do not think I got the vote of one farmer coming in here.  Mine is purely a city constituency; I cannot then be accused of being prompted by any selfish motives or of looking for votes if I speak here on behalf of agriculture. I am sure if the Deputy represented a city constituency he would not say much about wheat, beet and peat. What is the case that can be made? What is the case that is sticking out? There was a payment of £5,000,000 to Britain.  That £5,000,000 was withheld by our Government&mdash;it does not matter for what reason.  The British Government said: &ldquo;If you do not pay <Col N="1208" /> us that £5,000,000, we will collect it.&rdquo; They set about collecting it, and they have collected it.  All these steps are agreed to; it is all common ground. On the figures published, out of the £5,000,000 collected there was only about £100,000 collected off the goods exported from this country other than agricultural produce, so that, dealing with the figures here in a general way, the substantial case is that agriculture has paid that £5,000,000.  How is it paid?  Is it paid in the ordinary way by a tariff imposed on goods going into Britain?  No; it was paid in the following way: our goods are sent over to the British market, and sold at the British market price.  Then those tariffs are taken off that price and withheld by the British.  They collected in this way until they had £5,000,000&mdash;the amount they wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That £5,000,000 was taken directly out of the pockets of agriculture.  That £5,000,000, spread over our total exports, was £5,000,000 off the total world price of the stuff we exported. If that £5,000,000 had not been taken off, the price of agricultural produce at home here would have been, in the aggregate, £5,000,000 more than it was.  Roughly speaking, about 50 per cent. of our agricultural produce was consumed at home, and 50 per cent. exported.  £5,000,000 was lopped off the agricultural produce which was exported.  That, as I have explained, came directly out of the pockets of agriculture, but it had the effect of depressing the wholesale price of agricultural produce by £5,000,000, so that, in the aggregate, agriculture lost £10,000,000 instead of £5,000,000.  Then there were some export bounties given.  Those, of necessity, must come out of that £10,000,000.  I have already referred to the bounties given for a change in agricultural economy in the case of wheat-growing.  It is not right to make any deduction for those, because that is a change in economy which would have to be paid for if there were never any economic war. I think the bounties at the highest were about £2,000,000 a year.  Taking that £2,000,000 off the £10,000,000 which I have given as a rough estimate, it leaves £8,000,000 of a loss to agriculture.  There are about <Col N="1209" /> £2,000,000 land annuities remitted. That leaves £6,000,000 of a dead loss.</P>
    <P>Roughly, that is the case which we have to put before this select committee, if it is set up, and I challenge any Deputy on any bench here to refute that case.  I look around, and, of the 11 Deputies elected on a farmers' ticket at the last general election, only Deputy Kent and Deputy MacDermot are here in this House now.  I challenge any Deputy here to refute that substantial case. I am not going to say that those figures are audited figures, but it is a substantial case which I challenge anybody to refute.  I appeal to the Government to divest themselves of their Party manner and have this matter investigated.  Let the House agree unanimously to an investigation of this matter.  Surely if our case is fiction, and thousands of people in the country believe in this fiction, the best thing the Government can do is to set up this committee and expose it as fiction.  If they do not set up that committee, it is quite obvious that they are afraid to face the issue.  I am afraid Deputy Moore let the cat out of the bag when he said that if the Government accepted the setting up of this committee, they would, in effect, be accepting the position that they have been dishonest towards the agricultural community for the last three years.  In effect, that is what Deputy Moore said.</P>

The other £5,000,000 was brought about by the difference between the prices that would have been obtained had these tariffs not existed in England and the prices obtained.  Against that figure, the Deputy put £2,000,000 for bounties and £2,000,000 for land annuities, making a total of £4,000,000, which left a balance of £1,000,000 from the £5,000,000 which the country lost.</P>

The agricultural community lost £10,000,000 and the country £5,000,000, against which there was this sum of £4,000,000, so that the total cost, according to the Deputy, of the economic war is £1,000,000 a year.</P>

      <P>The gross loss to agriculture was £10,000,000.  The Deputy tries to make the point that because half of that £10,000,000 was lost to agriculture and was gained by other sections of the community who purchased agricultural produce in the home market&mdash;they paid £5,000,000 less for what they had to buy&mdash;the total loss to the country was only £1,000,000 a year.  Now, deliberately, I wanted to keep away from finessing like that. Deputy McGilligan in his speech implied a little finessing of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me follow that point for a moment and only for a moment.  Even if a certain section of the community which was purchasing agricultural produce got their total supplies for the year £5,000,000 less than they would get them in normal circumstances, agriculture was £5,000,000 poorer and <Col N="1212" /> the purchasing power of agriculture was £5,000,000 less.  The Deputy, if he puts his financial brain to work, can work out the amount of business which the circulation of another £5,000,000 would bring about in the year, and I suggest that there is not a Deputy in this House more capable of solving that problem than Deputy Briscoe.</P>

We can get 20 per cent. more than is obtainable in the British market if the Government &mdash;aye, and the Opposition, too&mdash;were true to the people of this country and did not impose sanctions against Italy. We have the Italian market ready to buy at 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. higher prices that those at which the British market is prepared to absorb our stuff now.  Italy will send ships to Dublin Bay and to Cork Harbour to transport any surplus stuff we have in this country.  The Minister for Education smiles.  I will give him figures, and I will produce to him confidentially my authority for those figures.  We have a market in Italy if these sanctions are only taken away and if we are only given freedom to get out of the hole as preached by Arthur Griffith during his life.
