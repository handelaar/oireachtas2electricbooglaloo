      <P>asked the President whether in view of recent events the Executive Council will now consider making an order under the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931, declaring the organisation known as the Irish Republican Army to be an unlawful association.</P>

      <P>Any action that may be necessary for the maintenance of public order will be taken in regard to the Irish Republican Army and other military or semi-military organisations, but it is not the opinion of the Executive Council that the necessity has arisen for the course suggested in the question.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the President's answer, is he aware that a large part&mdash;perhaps the greater part&mdash; of the strength of such organisations is derived from the belief that in their hearts the majority of the Fianna Fáil Party approve of their existence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will cause inquiries to be made regarding the alleged delay in paying national health benefit to members of the Unified Society, especially when more than one doctor's certificate has been lodged with the society; and whether he is aware that numerous complaints have been made in connection with the matter.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the payment of national health insurance benefit does not rest on my department, but on the committee of management of Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.  I am, however, prepared to have inquiries made in regard to any case in which delay is alleged in the payment of benefit if full particulars of the case are supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of complaints which has been received in the department is very small when compared with the number of claims dealt with.  In the great majority of these cases any delay which has occurred has been due to the fact that the insured person has failed to <Col N="3" /> give sufficient information to enable his claim to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte that the number of persons in receipt of benefit payments is 28,700, and in almost 98 per cent. of the cases cheques are issued by the society within 24 hours of the receipt of the requisite medical certificate.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the arrears of annuities in the year ended 31st March, 1933, were funded.  An advance of £1,616,000 was voted in March, 1933, as an advance to the Guarantee Fund to enable the local taxation grants for that year to be issued.</P>
      <P>As regards the year ended 31st March, 1934, the arrears of annuities in respect of the May-June gale, 1933, were funded, and there were no deductions from local taxation grants in respect of that gale.  For the November-December, 1933, gale, the net amounts of grants absorbed in the Guarantee Fund to meet arrears at the 31st January, 1934, will be published in the Official Report.  None of these amounts that will hereafter be published has been subsequently reduced by any payments made to the councils.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he would state whether he is aware that on the 30th September last a body of armed men opened fire on the hall at Kilfinnane during the progress of a dance; on the 1st November last Patrick Creed's house was fired into; on the 20th January a body of men drilled publicly at Ballinlina, Kilfinnane, carrying arms and firing several rifle shots; and that recently the houses of Mrs. Condon, Ballinanama; Miss Hayes, Ardpatrick; the Ardpatrick Co-operative Creamery and the Darragh Creamery have been broken into and robbed; and if he is aware that in none of these cases have the persons guilty of the offences been charged by the police; and if he will state whether he has caused inquiries to be made into the circumstances existing in the Kilfinnane area with a view to the making of more effective provision to protect the community there from outrages such as these and to punish those who have been guilty of them.</P>

      <P>I have received reports from the police in respect of all of the alleged outrages referred to in the Deputy's question, and I am satisfied that in any of these cases in which an offence has been committed the police have done, and will continue to do, everything possible to make the culprits amenable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the police in that <Col N="7" /> particular area would appear to have had a very difficult time.  For instance, there were 50 malicious and criminal injuries in that particular area in six months.  These outrages consisted of blocking roads, cutting telephone and telegraph wires and such things, which, if not encouraged by the Party opposite, are condoned.  For these offences 39 people were brought to justice in this particular area, so that the Deputy can take it the police are not at all idle in that district.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say, if 50 crimes of the type he speaks about have been committed and only 39 persons have been brought to justice, whether the action of the police in allowing, without apparently any interference or any arrest of the persons responsible, firing into dance halls and people's houses, the robbery of co-operative creameries and breaking into other houses, was an offset in respect of the other people that they think ought to have been arrested arising out of the 50 outrages the Minister speaks about?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the price of beef and mutton has been considerably increased as a result of the coming into operation of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, 1934; whether he is aware that the minimum prices fixed under the Act referred to are not being paid by the butchers to the producers of live stock; and whether in view of the prices at which beef is being supplied by the butchers under the Government's free meat scheme he will order an immediate investigation by the Food Prices Commission into the prices presently charged by butchers to their cash customers.</P>

      <P>My Department has been in communication with the Department of Agriculture in this matter.  I am informed that, as might naturally be expected following the imposition of a levy in respect of animals slaughtered and the fixing of a minimum price for fat cattle, the price of beef and mutton has increased as a result of the coming into operation of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, 1934; but it is not correct to state that the price has increased considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been received by the <Col N="12" /> Minister for Agriculture that in certain cases the minimum prices fixed under the Act are not being paid by butchers to the producers of live stock, but complainants are reluctant to come forward to substantiate such complaints. Producers should be aware that if they receive less than the minimum price prescribed under the Act it is open to them to recover the difference as a debt due by the registered proprietor.</P>

    <P>I should point out that for some time past detailed investigations into this very difficult matter have been proceeding in my Department, but have not yet been completed.  Accordingly, the foregoing statement should be regarded as provisional and subject to amendment.  Furthermore, there are some other heads of invisible trade for which it has not been possible to make estimates, so that even a preliminary figure for the net balance of payments in the aggregate cannot be given.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will have included in the Insurance Bill, 1934, before the text of the Bill is circulated to Deputies, provisions providing that in the case of policies taken out for small sums with Irish and other insurance companies where the policy-holders were induced through false, fraudulent or misleading information to take out policies on distant relatives or connections and such policies have been determined by the companies concerned without payment of compensation or surrender-value, the companies shall be liable for refund of the premiums paid.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the value of the assets of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland as ascertained by the auditors for each of the years from the formation of the company up to the decision to wind up the company; at what period it became apparent to the Minister for Finance that the company was likely to be involved in financial difficulties; whether any proposals were made by the representatives of the Minister for Finance on the Board of Directors as to the steps which, in their opinion, should be taken to avoid financial losses, and if so, whether he will state the nature of the proposals so made, and indicate in detail to what extent, if any, they were acted upon, and what other steps were taken to safeguard the State's interest in the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that what the Deputy wishes to know is not the value of the aggregate balance sheet assets of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, Ltd., but the market value of the investments of the company other than investments in loans guaranteed under the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Acts.  I am unable to state what the market values of these investments were for the years to the <Col N="16" /> 31st December, 1926, and the 31st December, 1927, but the values at which they were returned in the balance sheets were £173,440 and £250,345 respectively for these periods; and as the auditors passed the accounts, I presume the market values exceeded these figures.  For the four succeeding accounting periods ending on 31st March, 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932, respectively, the market values were £233,189, £199,000, £195,039 and £148,679.  At the end of the next succeeding accounting period to the 30th June, 1933, the bulk of the investments had been realised, and the position is not comparable.</P>
      <P>It first became apparent that the company was likely to be involved in financial difficulties when the accounts for the 15 months to the 31st March, 1929, were published in May, 1929. From that date the affairs of the company were the subject of frequent discussions between the Board and the Minister for Finance.  The Minister's representatives on the Board do not appear to have put forward any proposals for dealing with the situation, but on behalf of the State it was suggested that the company should (1) defer payment of dividends and Directors' fees; (2) apply its reserves and carry forward and all profits on income account to writing down the book value of the investments; (2) realise as rapidly as possible all investments that did not show good prospects of early recovery; (4) invest all future income and all sums realised from the sale of investments in fixed interest bearing stocks of a gilt-edged trustee or high class investment character; (5) close down the offices of the company and conduct the administration through a bank or a firm of auditors and accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the last suggestion the Directors of the company agreed generally with the proposals made by the Minister for Finance, but in interpreting and applying the agreed policy, the Directors naturally used their own discretion, and their views did not always coincide with those held by the Minister for Finance.  In particular they took a more optimistic view <Col N="17" /> as to the number of their investments which could be regarded as having prospects of recovery, and as to the period within which such recovery might be anticipated.</P>
    <P>For further information as to the history of the company, I would refer the Deputy to the liquidator's report, a copy of which I have caused to be put in the Library.</P>

As the export trade in spring lambs will start on the 1st April I am sure the Minister will see his way to give a bounty for spring lambs, anyway.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan (for Minister for Lands) Dr. Ryan (for Minister for Lands)">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan (for Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>In allotting land and in considering applications, the Land Commission are governed by the provisions of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, which empower them to make advances for the purchase of land to (a) uneconomic holders, (b) persons willing to exchange holdings, (c) evicted tenants or their representatives, (d) ex-employees on lands acquired, (e) trustees of turbary or pasturage, (f) any other person or body approved by the Land Commission. This is not an order of preference; and in practice any large scheme of resale will be found to include persons coming under each of those categories.  It may be said, however, that parties such as herds and labourers who have lost their employment as a result of the taking over of lands by the Land Commission are considered to have first claim for allotments, and that genuine evicted tenants and uneconomic holders in the locality must next be provided for if the scheme is to be a success.  Then would come suitable landless men in the district, and if necessary and land is available, migrants whose lands elsewhere can be used to relieve congestion.  In every case an overriding consideration prescribed by Statute (Section 31 (2) of the 1923 Act) is that the Land Commission must be satisfied as to the allottees' <Col N="21" /> competence to work land and their intention to do so, and not to sell, let or assign it.</P>

      <P>I submit the following motion:</P>
      <P>Beartuítear leis seo, fé Airtiogail 38a den Bhunreacht, an Bille Rialtais Aitiúla (Reacht-Shaoirse do Leathnú) 1933, do chur go dtí Seanad Eireann arís.</P>
      <P>It is hereby resolved, under Article 38a of the Constitution, that the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Bill, 1933, be again sent to Seanad Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 38A of the Constitution declares that whenever a Bill, initiated and passed in Dáil Eireann is, within a period of 18 months after it is sent to Seanad Eireann, either rejected or not passed by Seanad Eireann or passed with amendments with which the Dáil does not agree, Dáil Eireann may within one year after the expiration of such period send the Bill again to Seanad Eireann by resolution <Col N="24" /> expressly passed under Article 38A.  If it is then not passed within a period of 60 days, it may by resolution of the Dáil, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This Bill was sent to Seanad Eireann on the 28th June, 1933, and rejected. The Bill may therefore be sent again to Seanad Eireann within one year after 28th December, 1934&mdash;the day on which the constitutional period of delay expired, and I move accordingly.</P>

      <P>When the Minister introduced this measure in June, 1933, he said that the Bill afforded a long delayed opportunity of considering what should be the qualifications of a Local Government elector.  The Minister, it is true, had been already warned by discussions in this House as to the position of the general fabric of local government as a result of the economic situation created.  The Minister has had more than warnings since then.  He has seen the steady increase in the grave distress of the farming community.  He has seen the position in which so many local bodies are being placed as a result of their inability to collect from the farming community the normal rates to support the administration of local government. He has seen substantially large sums that normally would be transferred by the Minister for Finance to local authorities to carry on local government administration, withdrawn from their local bodies.  No doubt he must be at the present time faced with a very grave problem arising out of the land annuity position, which disclosed itself on the 31st January last.  The Minister has seen quite recently a number of county councils&mdash;Leitrim County Council and Clare County Council to mention two&mdash;discussing quite openly the gravity of their situation. He has commissioners operating for himself in County Waterford, South Tipperary and Kilkenny and in these three places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has, therefore, had an opportunity to consider the whole position of local government.  He has seen the operations of the Land <Col N="25" /> Commission, and he has seen the value assigned by the Land Commission to lands which they are buying at the present moment.  He realises that to a large extent support of the fabric of local government rests on the land which the Land Commission at the present moment has, in many cases, declared as practically worthless.  So in putting this motion to the House, the Minister has gone very far beyond the position in which he could simply recommend it to the House as a long-delayed opportunity of considering what should be the qualifications of a local government elector.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister he is now in a position in which he ought to give to this House the rather long-delayed opportunity of considering what the future of local government should be. This is the time, when a very grave position has arisen in the state of local government generally, that he comes to the House and says: &ldquo;Paragraph so-and-so of the Constitution says that if the Seanad does not do a particular thing, it can be made to do it.&rdquo;  He enters in no way into any of the merits of the discussion that took place here or in the Seanad when he introduced the Bill.  Particularly, he enters in no way into what is going to be the future of local government itself, which is a much more vital matter for the people of this country than the question of what the local government electors should be or who they are going to be.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what the Minister expects to achieve by passing this Bill to extend the franchise. To my mind, it is an abrogation of the rights of the people who pay and who, ordinarily, have the right to call the tune.  I do not think that anything has happened recently which should encourage the Minister to extend the franchise to people who previously had not the franchise in local government elections.  We have increased numbers in receipt of home help and receiving doles or State assistance in one form or another.  The Minister may think that with conditions like these existing, it is the right, the fair and the just thing to give these people rights which belong to the people who pay for <Col N="26" /> the services, but personally I do not think there is any justice in it.  I do not think that the Minister will help either himself or local government by extending the franchise.  In fact, I think it will be quite the other way round.  I do not think there is any merit in the proposal, and consequently I am opposed to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was passed through this House to enable all adult citizens to record their votes at local elections in the same way as they are entitled to record them at national elections.  Deputy Mulcahy wants to permit people of 21 years of age to vote for him, to elect an Executive Council, and to elect Deputies, but he does not want the same people to be permitted to elect town commissioners that would be responsible for spending a couple of hundred pounds a year. That is a most illogical viewpoint, particularly in view of the recent evolution in the Deputy's Party.  We were told some time ago by the Director-General of the Deputy's Party that he was interested in encouraging youth, and in giving them a full opportunity of taking a part in the councils of the nation.  That Party, while still pretending to be interested in youth is not anxious to show that it is the real orthodox party that is looking after the youth of the country.  Of course, the ex-leader of the party is trying to organise a separate league of youth. So far as his speeches indicate, he is interested in giving youth its opportunity, but apparently that is not the <Col N="27" /> view of the Fine Gael Party, although they proclaim that they are keenly interested in getting youth to take an interest in the affairs of the nation. One would imagine that they would be glad to see a Bill of this kind.  Is all the talk about youth so much humbug?  Is it just for the purpose of trying to restore the attenuated ranks of the party opposite?  After all the protestations we have had from that party about the desire to establish a Corporative State, and to give everyone an opportunity to take part in the development of industry, agriculture and government generally, I would have thought that Deputy Mulcahy would have had a keen interest in having this Bill passed.  Instead of that he comes here to oppose it. and wants to have the youth of the country &mdash;in which his Party pretends to have a keen interest&mdash;denied the opportunity of taking part in the councils of the nation.  Can we have from Deputy Mulcahy a definite statement as to whether his party really stands for the policy of giving youth an opportunity of voting at local elections and taking an enthusiastic interest in municipal affairs?  If his party still pretends to believe in that, what is the explanation of the opposition to a Bill which will give these people an opportunity of displaying their zeal in the management of local affairs?  Is it the explanation that the proposal for a Corporative State has been expelled from the programme of the party in the same way as its one-time creator?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That declaration is more illogical than the Deputy's general attitude to the Bill.  He knows that only one person in each household can pay rates.  If a man lives in a house with his wife and has three or four sons, aged from 30 to 40 years the Deputy knows perfectly well that the wife and the sons cannot pay rates, although the homestead is maintained by the general productivity of the family.  In that way they contribute to the rates.  Yet, the Deputy wants to have it so that only the head of the household will be allowed to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not Deputy Dillon know that if there are two brothers in a household, one is made the rated occupier while the other one, who may, in fact, contribute more to the household than the ratepayer, is prevented from voting under existing legislation? Deputy Mulcahy wants to continue to deprive such a person of an opportunity to take part in local government, even though he is permitted to elect Deputies.  That is an entirely illogical attitude.  After the Deputy's declaration that he is opposed to youth being given an opportunity of expressing an opinion in an effective way at local elections, while at the same time his Party pretends to be interested in youth, one cannot expect very much logic from that Party.  This is a good Bill, one calculated to develop a keen interest in local government, and calculated to capture the enthusiasm of youth for municipal services generally.  I cannot see that the passage of a Bill, containing a provision to enable youth to exercise the franchise, is likely to have any serious ill-effects on the local government machine.  I think Deputy Mulcahy's Party should have welcomed this Bill.  It is a progressive Bill, and in conformity with the best social thought in Europe to-day.  Instead of hanging on to a worn out system of local government, and a worn out franchise, which has no merits whatever, except that it was the system of municipal franchise which was handed over, and which we slavishly followed, I hope this motion will be passed, and that the Party opposite will drop their objection to it.  I also hope that the Bill will be passed when it is again submitted <Col N="30" /> to the Seanad.  If it does, I think that by giving to youth the opportunity of having an effective say in local government it can do much to improve the position of local government in the country and do much to help in the selection of a better type of candidate for election to local authorities, and Deputy Mulcahy might well be glad that the opportunity of doing so was presented both to this House and to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party commends this motion to the House on three grounds: (1) because, he says, it will provide an opportunity for youth to partake in local administration; (2) because, as he seems to think, this country is full of houses occupied by bachelor brothers one of whom may be deprived of his vote under existing circumstances, or houses occupied by invalids with large families of adult children who are deprived of the franchise by the existing system; and (3) on the analogy of the franchise provided for Dáil Eireann elections. Each of his three recommendations is equally fallacious and futile.  To suggest, that by leaving the franchise on its present basis you preclude youth from partaking in the elections, is absurd because the question of youth does not enter into that at all.  The difference in principle between us and the Government is as to whether the franchise shall be universal, or as to whether it shall be restricted to the ratepayers of a county.  There is no reason whatever why the ratepayers of a county should not be young men.  In fact, in thickly populated counties, in the congested areas, where the old age pension legislation has made it obligatory on the father of a family to convey his property to a son if he himself is to qualify for pension rights, many of the ratepayers are comparatively young men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tendency, I hope, in this country will be for the age at which the old age pension will be awarded to men and women steadily to fall, and to have property transferred at an even earlier stage than it is at present into the hands of the rising generation.  So that it is in no way inconsistent with youth <Col N="31" /> having a full voice in local administration to abstain from providing for universal franchise in local elections. The second reason advanced&mdash;that you have these houses swarming with invalid fathers and mothers unable to struggle down to the polling booth&mdash;is so ludicrous that it does not require to be demolished.  The third reason which the leader of the Labour Party gave for recommending this motion to the House was the analogy which he sought to establish between the local elections and elections to Dáil Eireann. That is just the place where the Government part from us.  Holding, as we do, democratic views, we believe that where you are dealing with the Parliament of the country in which is vested the ultimate authority for the freedom and social services of the people, the proper way is that everybody of 21 years and upwards should have a voice in the election of members to the Dáil, so that everybody may feel that they can influence the supreme government of the community. Personally, I believe in that.  Shall I say that my belief is compelled to that system principally because I feel it is the only practical system, and that it is the only system which will guarantee the community against recurrent revolution.</P>

Let us now confine ourselves to the reasons advanced by the Leader of the Labour Party for the passing of this motion.  I have already pointed out that we believe in universal franchise for election to Dáil Eireann, because we believe in democracy.  I had gone on to say that my belief in democracy was compelled largely by the belief that it is the only practical way of avoiding recurrent revolutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party can at a later stage put up some of his satellites to say all the things that he forgot to say himself. To suggest that the same considerations apply when we are considering the franchise that should elect the body of persons who will be charged with the responsibility of administering the local services is, to my mind, entirely false, because no question arises of the liberties or the ultimate interest of the people as a whole being finally determined by any local authority in this country.  There is always an appeal from a local authority to Parliament if any local authority fails in its duty or attempts to convert public moneys to purposes for which they were not intended.  It is manifestly undesirable where you are raising considerable sums of money from one section of the community to be spent largely upon another section of the community to give universal franchise: to put into the hands of people, whose sole interest is to get the largest possible sum of money distributed by a local authority, the power to elect representatives on a county, because, human nature being what it is, the inevitable tendency amongst the ordinary member of a local body who is looking for popular support must be to feel gigantic pressure brought upon him to indulge in extravagance and in the improvident distribution of the resources of the county if he believes that by doing that he can indirectly purchase large numbers of votes from the voting public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have already pointed out that the question of youth versus age does not arise, but the question of ratepayers versus non-ratepayers does arise and it is on that distinction that our case rests exclusively. We have had considerable experience, not only in this country but elsewhere, of persons who believe that it is a popular thing to scatter public money broadcast amongst the electorate.  Considering all the relevant matters, we believe that we have got to endure that so far as parliamentary elections are concerned, but let us not carry that temptation to scatter public money through the populace for the purpose of purchasing votes into the field of local administration, bearing always in mind that if the local administration fails to keep up with the national standards of social services and social amenities, the Parliament is always here to insist on their going further than they themselves wish to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an ample check on local administration by the control of Parliament over them.  But so sure as we create universal suffrage for election to local authorities we are going to give the vote to those whose sole desire will be to see the local authorities spend money exercising a predominating influence on the minds of those charged with the responsibility of local government.  I regard that as something highly desirable. I believe that the correct consequences of this alteration in the franchise is going to be this: that the Minister for Local Government who is responsible for this Bill will yet come back to this House to sponsor or support a measure for doing away with the county councils or substituting for them some other system of local government, when he finds that the bodies which will be evolved from a franchise of this character are paying no regard at all to the resources of the country or its revenues, and are considering only the pull they can secure, by the expenditure of public <Col N="34" /> money, on the voters in a particular constituency.</P>

      <P>The arguments used by Deputy Dillon in opposition to this motion would be unanswerable if we were still living in the year when the Local Government Act came into operation.  Under the circumstances of that time, all the charges for Local Government and Public Health services had to be borne by the ratepayers residing in the respective areas.  Deputy Dillon does not appear to have grown up.  If he realised he was a man instead of a boy, instead of talking in the boyish way he did, he would have realised that the contribution to the upkeep of local government services by the central authority is in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent. and that only the other 50 per cent. is contributed by the people who live in the benefited areas.</P>

For that reason I believe in that system.  Assuming that, some day or other, this House will be intelligent enough to pass a measure along those lines, what does Deputy Mulcahy and the older members of the League of Youth fear from the giving of powers to an advisory body elected under such a scheme?  They talk of giving an opportunity to youthful members of their Party, to giving them a say in the government of the country, local and national, but by opposing a motion of this kind they are doing quite the opposite to what they say they intend to do.  If they remove some of the old people who are on the Executive of the League of Youth or the Fine Gael Party, perhaps those who would take their place would regard this proposal from a different point of view.  However, they are taking good care to see that the Director-General chooses the Executive, and they give very little power to the rank and file of the League of Youth.</P>

He did not know what was in the minds of his principal advisers at a certain period.  I do not make any bones about confessing openly that I believe in a type of local government scheme which gives power to one man&mdash;an efficient servant appointed in a democratic way&mdash;to supervise the whole of the staff in a particular area.  I have been watching the operations of county surveyors.  I sympathise with the most efficient and industrious county surveyors in the country, who, under the existing system, are having the tails of their coats pulled every week by 32 or 40, or, perhaps, 78&mdash;as in Cork&mdash;county councillors, who are looking for a job for this fellow and wanting to get the other fellow kicked out of a job.  I make no apology to Deputy Mulcahy for condemning that system and favouring any other system which will give a man with the necessary qualifications power to supervise the work for which he is held responsible.  Deputy Mulcahy denies that he was aware of what was going on in his Department before he left there.  I accept that denial without further question.</P>

I came to the conclusion that <Col N="37" /> he was living in the beginning of the year 1898 and that he does not realise the progress made in the meantime&mdash; that he does not realise the powers of the local authorities and is not aware of the sources of the money which they are charged with spending.  On looking into the matter, I am sure he will realise the important change which has been effected when the cost of the upkeep of local services is now on a fifty-fifty basis.  Seeing that there will be less responsibility on the members of these local authorities in the future, there is a glaring case for the passage of this measure.</P>

When he says that I am living in the year 1898, does he forget that, notwithstanding the substantial contribution made by the central Government to the cost of local administration, the burden on the ratepayers is more than twice as great as it was in 1898?</P>

They would have found, if they had studied that document, that our Party expressed itself as being in favour of the very same principles as Deputy Davin has just been advocating&mdash;advocating, I notice, with the applause of those sitting opposite to me, including Ministers&mdash;namely, that there should be more of a concentration <Col N="38" /> of executive authority in the counties in the hands of one wellselected individual and that he should be assisted by an advisory elected council.

      <P>The principle at issue is not one as between youth and age, but as between ratepayer and non ratepayer.  The Labour Party often say that those who are not ratepayers are contributing nevertheless.  Well, I admit that there is some truth in that, especially if you take into consideration the fact that some of the moneys are supplied from this House; but the worst of it is that, even if they are contributing, they are not conscious of the fact.  They are not conscious of the fact that expenditure can be any sort of ill from their point of view, and the attitude of a non-ratepayer, on the whole, is that the more expenditure there is the better.  I am sure there is no member of the Labour Party who, as a practical man, really could deny that.</P>
      <P>Without spending too much time in discussions of abstract principles, my view about this Bill is that it is likely, on the whole, to make county councils somewhat worse than they are at the present time, and that, inasmuch as we are all in favour of quite a different system it seems a pity to be causing a disturbance by such a revolutionary change in the present system pending such time as we will be able to introduce a Bill instituting a new system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a lot of confusion in regard to this Bill.  The last speaker seemed to suggest that everybody was agreed on having some other system than the present one, but I do not see very much sign of that agreement at present. There is agreement, I think, that the present system is not satisfactory, and that the present system of local government requires revision.  There is no logical reason why those particular public services which are administered by the local authorities should be linked irrevocably with one type of taxation and one type of taxpayers, as is the case to-day, because rates, in fact, are only a tax on land and buildings.  Deputy Mulcahy, I think, was right in suggesting that we should not pass this Bill until the Government have disclosed their intentions with regard to the whole future of local government.  It is true, as Deputy Davin says, that 50 per cent. of the <Col N="40" /> moneys expended by local authorities is supplied from the Central Fund.  That is no reason, however, why the present franchise should be changed.  If 50 per cent. of the moneys supplied by local authorities is supplied by one type of taxpayer, and 50 per cent. by taxpayers in general, then I see no reason why the particular taxpayers known as ratepayers should not have a special say in the elections of the local authorities. The 50 per cent. supplied by this House is supplied by a House elected on universal suffrage.  That money is supplied by a House which taxes every person in this country, and since this Government have come in, with the help of the Labour Party, they have taxed more and more the poor people as distinct from the rich.  Every day and every week, added taxation is put on the poor as against the rich, and that has been done with the approval of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot.  I think that particular class of taxpayer, which has to bear the main brunt of providing money for local services, certainly should have a special say in the election of those bodies.  The Minister, in asking the House to pass this Bill, also forgot to state his intentions with regard to all those counties which have been deprived of local government during his régime.  He has submitted those counties to a Crown Colony government.  He has treated them as white niggers, unfit for self-government, and he has done so with the approval of Deputy Davin.  Certainly, we should know from him whether it is his intention to continue this Crown Colony government indefinitely or whether those counties eventually are <Col N="41" /> to be allowed the privilege, which other counties are allowed, of controlling and directing their own affairs to some extent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde says that the present Government have increased the taxation of the poorer class very considerably.  It would take a person of great ability, I think, to fit that argument into the general argument from Deputy Esmonde's Party in connection with this debate.  It is very obvious from the remarks passed, I think, that the real issue in this debate is not ratepayer versus non-ratepayer. The real issue is that the Opposition Party do not consider that people of no property should have any say in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They consider that the proletariat should be alienated from the business of local government and not allowed to have any say.  When they put forward the argument that non-ratepayers will demand inevitably too great an expenditure&mdash;will demand a too prodigal expenditure of rates, surely, as a Farmers' Party, or as a Party that claims to represent farmers, they are in a strikingly illogical position. The farmer is supposed to be the principal ratepayer locally, and of course he is so.  According to the argument of the Opposition, then, farmers' sons, if they get the vote, will demand that their fathers should pay more and more rates.  Is that a serious argument from the Opposition?  Certainly, it would be a curious type of policy for same people and for intelligent young men to advocate.  I could not imagine it being done.  I never knew farmers' sons&mdash;to any number anyhow&mdash;I never knew a district where there was even 3 per cent. of farmers' sons, who were lunatic to such an extent that they would openly advocate that their fathers should pay more rates because of some fantastic notion that they themselves might have a better time.  A still stranger anomaly appears in the Opposition argument when we remember that there is being discussed at present, in Private Members' time, a proposal that farmers should be relieved of rates on agricultural <Col N="42" /> land during the continuance of the economic war.</P>
      <P>So now we have the position that the Opposition want to have a vote on this question and I suppose they are going to take it.  The Opposition will have it that the farmers should only pay rates similar to what labouring men pay; yet the farmers are to have a monopoly of local government. Deputy Norton dwelt upon the illogical argument of Deputy Mulcahy.  The more it is examined the more illogical that argument appears.</P>

      <P>Of course I will.  Even if I do not vote with the Opposition, if they convince me, they will, at least, make me feel uncomfortable. They will at least make me feel that I am voting for something that I should not vote for.  But I may tell Deputy Dillon that I never feel uncomfortable as a result of his arguments. If Deputy Mulcahy makes me feel uncomfortable, or if he makes the Minister feel uncomfortable&mdash;that he is forcing upon the country something that he should not, he will have done something.  My vote does not count for very much; it is the uncomfortable feeling that arises if the Deputy opposite is able to put forward convincing arguments that counts. But his arguments, so far from making us feel uncomfortable, make us feel very smug.  I feel sorry for the Opposition. I look in these matters more to the credit and efficiency of the Dáil which I think is much more important than the success of any party.  Party is ephemeral; the Dáil will have to go on and be efficient. From that point of view I feel that the arguments put up against this Bill are not at all sufficient and anybody looking to the future of the Dáil would say that that institution <Col N="43" /> would not have much of a future if they represented the intellectual power of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I think it is time that the Opposition tried to give up the business of opposing merely for the sake of opposition.  I think they ought to try and make a case when they are going to force a division, or when they are dealing with big questions. They have made no case in this instance. Of course that makes us feel that we are in an unassailable position. I would rather not see such a position arising.  I would rather see a position where there would be keen competition and where both sides of every question would be examined on their merits.  That is not the position which is going to arise from the action of the Opposition here.</P>

I share the view of the last Deputy, which was, if I interpreted him rightly, that this measure will not make a very substantial difference in the type of representatives on the local bodies.  Every householder is a ratepayer and all that this will add to the list, substantially, will be the sons and daughters of the householder and, to a very large extent, these sons and daughters will vote the way their parents vote.  I do not see a very substantial difference, but I see a big change in principle.  I was surprised by the unreality of the debate.  And what surprised me most was to see how Deputy Davin has advanced towards Fascism and dictatorship.  Instead of democratic county councils controlling the county surveyor, Deputy Davin would like to see one official doing it. It is only one step further for the Deputy to say that instead of having 153 Deputies here it would be better to have a dictator.</P>

      <P>The principle of &ldquo;Representation where there is taxation&rdquo; is an old democratic principle, but I do not know what principle those who support this Bill are subscribing to when they demand representation without taxation. I am surprised to see Deputy after Deputy getting up and saying: &ldquo;All this local government is wrong; we must have bosses in every county who will not be under the control of the local electorate but who will boss the local electorate and we must have advisory bodies to these county managers.&rdquo;  I cannot understand that mentality when they are creating a situation that will demand that.  I would be all for those supporting this measure if they did not put the cart before the horse but put the horse first and said, as they have promised on many platforms, before they got into office, that there would be derating of agricultural land, but there's going to be no derating so far as indicated as yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the origin of it?  The Deputy does not know.  The Deputy's idea of the Agricultural Grant is that a certain sum of money is given, out of the goodness of heart of this Government, for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  If the Deputy knew anything, he would know <Col N="47" /> that the Agricultural Grant was never a farmer's relief grant but a landlord's relief grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a responsibility taken on by this Government and its predecessors to meet a liability hitherto met, not by the farmers, but by the landlords.  That is the origin of the Agricultural Grant and before I comment any further, I will give the Deputy time to study that.  I, as a member of a county council for ten years, resent the comments made from both sides of the House that county councils generally are discredited bodies&mdash;comments made by people on both sides who never sat on a county council or gave an hour of their time in the local public service where there is no remuneration. People should not come in here and make wild statements of that kind without supporting them.  I am sorry that Deputy MacDermot has left, but because he has left, I am not going to take up his general criticism of a subject he knows nothing about. County councillors, both now and in the past, have given a lot of their time, free, gratis and for nothing, to the local public service, and it is very unfair for anybody to use this House as a platform to condemn county councils generally.  I hope that, if this Bill becomes an Act, it will be the forerunner of derating and I hope that, in any future debate, I will not see so many indications of parties running away from the policies publicly advocated on every platform in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one principle that has been enunciated here in support of this motion which, I think, is fallacious, or rather, which, if we examine it, would prove to be the direct opposite.  That is the principle which says that, seeing that at the present time a considerable amount of money is being provided out of the Central Fund or from funds under the control of the Oireachtas, we should come to a stage now when contribution to the rates <Col N="48" /> would not be a necessity for franchise. I have served on some of the local authorities for a good many years, and I note that where there is any possibility of getting a penny from the Central Fund, or from Government sources, there is a very great anxiety to spend it and to spend it without even examining whether it will be well spent money or whether a better channel could be found for it, whereas, in respect to the money that comes from direct taxation, and of which those who are voting it will have to put up their share, there is a conservatism and consideration as to whether the expenditure is worth while.  I think if we use that argument it will only prove the opposite to what the Deputies have said.  I think it will only be repeating the principle of what a good number of Deputies have mentioned, that for local purposes we ought to have some responsibility.  I do not even go the length of saying being ratepayers.  But where a person takes up the responsibilities of a home and has a house, that person and his partner ought to have representation for local purposes as they have at present.  But, asserting the broad principle that every person of 21 years of age, whether he has any responsibility in the country or not, should have a vote and be a voter, the same as the people who carry the burden and heat of the day, is entirely wrong.</P>
      <P>Another thing that has struck me is that the real reason for this measure has not been brought out at all in the House.  I think if we were to look to charging people for having done something under false pretences, we could not have a better example than what has been done here to-day.  I say that because we should have been told at the start that these were a series of Bills to change the voting strength of particular Parties.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Belton when he says that this will not change the franchise or the representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment, but unless that object would be achieved there would be no necessity for this <Col N="49" /> Bill.  It seems to me that the real reason underlying this motion is not to broaden the representation for local purposes but to increase the voting strength of particular Parties.  This measure will in time change the personnel of the local authorities, and I think that is not a step in the right direction.  I say that because if people have some responsibility for the money they are voting they give that matter consideration before voting for the spending of it.  I am aware that there are a good number of representatives in public life to-day who are not substantial ratepayers.  It may be argued that that has a bearing on this matter. I do not want to belittle in any way the county councillors.  The county councillor to-day has an important job.  He has far too much to do if he has private work of his own to look after.  I think it is hardly fair to condemn the county councils wholesale or the men who are trying to administer the public business of the country.  But where we have representatives in our county councils who will not be paying for what they are voting, the result will be that these representatives will not give the consideration to the matter that they ought to give.  For that reason I am inclined to vote against the motion.</P>

To-day I have listened to a great deal about ratepayers.  Who are the ratepayers?  Would these people I am going to mention be ratepayers? I am not an Imperial politician.  I am only a village politician.  I only think of Dublin.  I think of a tenement house in Great Longford Street.  There are in that house eight families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Take me at my face value and let me go on.  At all events, I need not canvass them now.  In this one house I know there are eight families. They hand over to the landlord £2 a week; that is £104 a year.  The landlord's outgoings might be £8 for head rent; £17 for rates; his repairs and insurance might come to another £15. That is £40 in all, leaving a profit of £64.  Probably one might have to make allowances for bad debts.  But who pays the £17 rates?  Is it not the people living in that overcrowded house?  Some time ago a correspondent of one of the newspapers wrote an article in Irish in connection with the tenement houses in Dublin.  This is the way he described them:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In every room there is a full household and in every house a full town.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is practically true.  If we take one or two or three of these families in those tenement rooms we will find in them grown-up young men and women. They have to live in surroundings that I cannot mention here.  Are these young people ever to have a chance by vote or speech to make an effort to better their condition in life?</P>

I ask the sensible men here who are ratepayers in those houses and who ought have the franchise and have representation?  Is it not the people living in them, the young men and women growing up there?  Their having the franchise will make for better conditions in life, and they <Col N="51" /> themselves will take an interest in the welfare of the State by becoming useful citizens.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice people here whose minds seem to be greatly occupied about the extension of the franchise. I think it is a little late in the day now to talk about extending the franchise.  Some people here seem not to realise that we have already many public representatives in the public boards of the country who are only 21 years of age.  But if they are only 21 years of age they have some sense of responsibility, for the reason that they have to be ratepayers in order to become qualified of being public representatives under existing legislation.  But having that sense of responsibility, I dare say their first consideration is what any scheme is going to cost themselves and their electors as ratepayers.  That is what they have to consider when they are asked to give their assent to the expenditure of money.  They do not allow any whim or wild idea to run away with their better judgment when they are voting for the spending of money. That is because they know the consequence of this to themselves, to their neighbours and to the people they represent, the people who reposed their confidence in them and look to them to safeguard their interests.  These are matters that weigh with these people, I have no doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as one who has been a public representative for some 29 or 30 years. I do not speak with that want of responsibility <Col N="52" /> recently displayed by the Minister for Local Government.  I think I am correct in saying that he stated, in some place in the South, not-withstanding that the rate there was 29/- or 30/- in the £, that it was not an excessive rate because the people got good service.  This extension of the franchise will, I think, apply to urban areas as well as in rural districts.  In some areas a painful situation has been created for the ratepayers by reason of the fact that irresponsible people have been allowed into public authorities as representatives of the people, whether with the knowledge of the Minister for Local Government or otherwise, I do not know.  It should be within his knowledge if he is properly informed and, as the responsible head of local government, he should be informed of the fact.  Since certain alterations have taken place there has not been that careful administration, and that careful investigation, that should always take place as to who public representatives are, whether they are really qualified or whether they are not qualified. In the town in which I live we have a very substantial rate.  I am now referring to an urban area.  I think the rateable valuation of the town, some short time ago, was between £10,000 and £11,000.  The total rateable responsibility, within the past two years, of certain representatives of that urban area, was something like £34. Doubtless, I may be reminded of this, and rightly so, that the people repose their confidence in those representatives; they gave them a mandate and authority to carry on in their behalf. I wish the people who gave them that authority every luck.  I know they have had to pay for it; they have been faced with certain consequences as a result of their own lack of consideration.</P>
    <P>As regards derating, I have heard it said on many occasions when derating was in the offing that the farmers might look forward with confidence, and that they would be relieved of all responsibility. In such circumstances, if the farmers were relieved of all responsibilities, I feel that there should be a complete change in the methods of local government.  I say that for this <Col N="53" /> reason, that if a man has no responsibility, if it does not touch his pocket directly or indirectly, he loses all sense of proportion; he feels that he is a free lance, that he has that freedom which enables him to put his hand into his neighbour's pocket, that he can spend lavishly at the expense of his neighbours. If we had derating there should be a different method of administration. It should be from the central authority, because otherwise the consequences would be extraordinary.  That is why I urge that for representation you should have some rateable qualification; you should always aim at keeping before the minds of those who represent the people a sense of their responsibility to the people and a sense of their responsibility to themselves.  I think it is fairly democratic when you have a franchise that entitles a man of 21 years of age to become a public representative on an urban council or a county council, but the day you take leave of the rateable qualification so as to enable a man to become a public representative you will have to view the situation from a different standpoint. Otherwise, you will have one man vieing with another to see who can be most successful in spending money lavishly at the expense of the general public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very grave responsibility, and I hope he realises it.  I hope he realises it is not good local government, good administration, to say to public representatives that it is a matter of indifference what the rate is provided there are good services. I believe in good services; I have never stood between the public and good service, but I believe in the public having that good service at a proper price.  We have heard it stated here with regard to the agricultural grant that it represents 50 per cent. of the amount of money expended by local public bodies.  The Minister will recollect&mdash;I am sure he has some responsibility for inflicting it on the public&mdash; that in 1933 the agricultural grant was reduced by £448,000.  In the county that I represent, both locally and here, the rates had to be increased by 1/4 in the £ in consequence of the reduction <Col N="54" /> of the grant.  I do not know that any effort has been made by the Minister, or anybody on his benches, to explain to the public the justification for withdrawing the £448,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for mentioning the matter of rates is that the question of extending the franchise is before us for consideration.  I am claiming that I am entitled to do that in order to show that when you relieve certain people of any responsibility with regard to rates the consequences will be immediately to the disadvantage of everybody concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates instead of being on the downward trend are increasing, notwithstanding the agricultural grant. In the county I represent £40,000 of the agricultural grant has been withheld, notwithstanding that it is the first county in the Free State with regard to the payment of rates.  The people there have paid their annuities and they have paid their rates better than the people in any other county in the <Col N="55" /> Free State so far.  I think that is publicly acknowledged.  Notwithstanding that, £40,000 of the agricultural grant is still withheld. That is a very poor return for the manner in which the ratepayers and the land annuitants in the County Mayo have met their obligations.  The rates this year are considerably higher than in any year that I can recall with the exception of one.  The rates are 11/8 in the £.  What reduction the agricultural grant will make I cannot at the moment say; but even with the agricultural grant I think the rates will be something like 5/8 in the £.  That position has been created by a lack of responsibility on the part of certain people.</P>
      <P>The agricultural grant is a matter of very great importance.  It has brought many benefits and many disadvantages. If the rates continue to increase, it is not hard to visualise what the position of the ratepayers will be in the very near future.  The great difficulties that people are face to face with in meeting the ordinary rates in present circumstances should be known to everybody. In the extraordinary circumstances which obtain at present what can be their ability, no matter what their disposition is to meet their obligations, to pay these rates when the position has changed and is changing to their disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government considers that the extension of the franchise is going to bring relief.  I have no want of confidence in the youth of the country&mdash;I have the utmost confidence in them.  I believe that they can be trusted to be upright and honest.  But giving them representation without any responsibility as ratepayers tends to create in the minds of these people a complete lack of understanding as to what the consequences of lavish expenditure might be.  We know that the consequences in many cases have been greatly to the detriment of the rate-paying public.  The franchise is there already and many people have become voters as a result of the Old Age Pensions Acts, particularly the Act passed by the present Government which enables them to become the <Col N="56" /> owners and occupiers of holdings and therefore ratepayers.  That has made a very considerable change in the number of voters in the country. Many people who hitherto were not entitled to become voters have become voters.  They have qualified as voters and they can exercise the franchise when they reach the age of twenty-one years.  The interest in the land, by deed of assignment, is conveyed by the father to the son and as a consequence the son becomes a voter right off.  I think that extension of the franchise is quite sufficient for the present and any further extension of it is not in the interests of the general public, but quite the reverse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few remarks on this motion.  I have been a considerable time on local boards and I am just visualising as to my chances of election on local boards in the future.  Very probably the situation which I am dealing with would not be apparent to a great extent in other directions.  I have always held the view that both this Government and the last Government have always introduced legislation detrimental to the interests of the agricultural community.  In my constituency there are two large towns with a population of about 12,000 people.  I have no say as regards the management of these urban districts. Still they are the dominating factor when it comes to elect a county council. They will have all the representation without the responsibility.  I wonder if the Minister realises that situation.  I see the Ceann Comhairle is looking at me as if I was saying something which does not come within the scope of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is, if I may say so, following the Deputy's argument with keen interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my point clear.  I think that a very serious situation is being created under this Bill.  The Minister knows the representatives who have been on local bodies in the past.  He knows those who were good administrators and those who were the opposite.  He must know that <Col N="57" /> those responsible for corruption and other things do not represent, so to speak, the ratepaying community.  I want to see local administration carried on as it ought to be.  I realise the necessity of keeping up the county services and everything else.  As to this Bill helping in that matter, I say, and I said it when this Bill was before the Dáil, that the Minister for Local Government will have the most desperate position of anybody under the Bill, because I can say, and I know what I am talking about, that the type of representatives as a body under this Bill will not be such as the Minister would like to see.  I was very sorry to hear him, once upon a time, give expression to the statements to which Deputy Davis referred, that the people were getting very good value and that the rates were not too high. The ratepayers think more about the amount they have to pay than the extent to which local services have to be increased.  It is not much use to a farmer to know that a motor car can attain 60 miles an hour on a grand steam-rolled or tarred road if he is not able to meet his obligations.  The agricultural community are about the largest rate-paying section of the people, but it is not of much benefit or consolation to them if the roads are in tip-top order while they cannot meet their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly think that the time is coming when this whole situation has got to be reviewed.  The manner in which local affairs are being carried on has been, I am sure, a cause of great concern to the Minister, even where there is a manager or a commissioner, and he must realise the situation.  It is no good trying to expect a council, a commissioner, or anybody else to extract money that is not there.  It is certainly not tending towards good administration, which should be the first concern of the Minister, to bring forward a Bill like this.  I have mentioned the case of my own county, where there are 12,000 of an urban population.  I cannot say what the rural population would be, but I do not think it would be anything like that.  I know that the rural population, although they pay the piper, have a very poor chance of <Col N="58" /> having anything like a decent say in the affairs of the county.  That is not good business.  We all know that if a person has not to contribute to the local rates he will naturally vote for those who give the most extravagant promises, regardless of what may happen to the county services.  I think there is no justification whatever for a Bill such as this.  Everybody who had any responsibility in connection with the payment of rates had their say in the election of representatives in the past, and I think it is only creating more trouble for the Minister himself to introduce a Bill of this kind.  When this Bill is in operation, the Minister will scarcely have as pleasant a time as he has at present, although even at present he has not a very nice time considering the position of local affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>Quite a variety of matters have been discussed on this motion to-day.  Some Deputies&mdash;I do not believe Deputy Curran was one of them&mdash;knew so little about the Bill or perhaps cared so little about it, that they hardly referred to the Bill or its contents at all.  They tried to drag in a variety of subjects, some of which had only a remote connection with the Bill.  I do not take the same point of view as Deputy Curran with regard to the future of local government after the passage of this Bill and when it is in operation in the country.  I, like him, and other Deputies who spoke here, am anxious for the well-being of local government in the country.  In a particular way it is my concern as Minister. It is my concern as a Deputy and it is my concern and the concern of all of us as citizens to see that the government of the country, in so far as local affairs are concerned, is conducted in the best possible way and with the best results to the people for the money they contribute.  It is our concern to see that it is carried on with economy, as well as with all expedition possible and with efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the passage of this Bill will have one effect, at any rate, and that is that we shall have more efficiency and greater economy in the administration of local affairs.  While it is true, as Deputy Curran and other <Col N="59" /> Deputies have stated, that men or women 21 years of age and over, can become elected as members of local authorities at present, only a small percentage of them nowadays are eligible as ratepayers.  Everybody who is 21 years of age or over will be entitled under this Bill to be elected to a local authority and to vote in the elections for local authorities just the same as at present they are entitled to vote for candidates for membership of this House.  My own personal experience&mdash; and I was a member of an important local authority before I was 22 years of age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think I was.  There are some Deputies on the opposite benches who were on that body somewhere about the same time or perhaps a little later.  My experience then definitely proved to me that the young men who were in the local authorities with which I was associated were the members who were really anxious for efficient administration, for honest administration, for uprightness in the council and for getting the work done without too much talk.  The old greybeards, many of whom had been on the council for a long time, were the ones who were stumbling blocks in the way of efficient, economic and rapid administration.  That is my experience. I know that that does not apply altogether in every part of the country.  It cannot be called a general rule, I am sure, because you will get many young men who are not as intelligent or as educated in these matters as they might be and who perhaps would have notions of spending money as lightly as Deputy Curran and others fear they will when they become members of local authorities after this Bill becomes law.  I give my own personal experience, that I went into certain public bodies in this city a good many years ago, somewhere about 35 years ago.  It will be for the good of local government and I have no hesitation, as I have said when introducing this Bill and when it was being discussed in its various stages, in recommending it to the House.  I do not think that <Col N="60" /> I need say any more.  I take the definition of ratepayer given by my colleague and namesake Deputy Alderman Kelly.  I believe these are all ratepayers.</P>

I cannot, for the life of me, see how the Deputy could justify that statement, because the Bill is not taking away from any persons rights they had.  There is no suggestion of abrogating the right of anyone.  The Bill is the logical outcome of developments on democratic lines, developments that should have taken place here long ago.  Some rather interesting developments of policy were enunciated on the opposite benches to-day.</P>

    <P>The position with regard to this Bill is somewhat similar to the one that we have been discussing.  This Bill was sent to the Seanad on the 7th June, <Col N="63" /> 1933, and rejected.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Minister has not attempted to underline his conviction, that this motion should be passed, by any statement to the House. The valuation of the City of Dublin is probably about £1,900,000 at the present time.  When the Greater Dublin Act was passed its valuation was about £1,200,000.  It was estimated that in or about £600,000 of that represented the valuation on commercial or business premises, and that the greater part of that valuation was not directly represented by a local government electoral vote.  Rates were raised as fully on that valuation of £600,000 as on the remaining part of the city valuation. We have not been informed by the Minister what is the present valuation on business and commercial premises in the city.  If the entire valuation of the city is £1,900,000, we may take it that the valuation of commercial and business premises is at least £800,000.  The Minister's proposal is that the people who pay rates on that valuation will have no representation directly on the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Greater Dublin Act made a certain amount of provision in that respect.  It gave five representatives, on a council of 35, to those elected on a commercial franchise based on the commercial and business valuation of the city.  Since the Minister put this measure before us the Oireachtas has passed an Act which is extending the Dáil franchise to local government electors.  Therefore, while the franchise, which is, more or less, directly related to rate paying, and the valuation of the city is now extended, I suppose, by 40 per cent., the Minister is depriving property, the valuation of which is about £800,000, of representation on the Dublin Corporation. I think the Minister should tell the House how he thinks it right to do that.  That property, bearing the full city rate, will now have no representation <Col N="64" /> on the City Council.  It seems to me to be a very extraordinary thing to happen.  It is a matter that the Minister ought to deal with when asking the House to pass this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well if the Government were to reconsider its decision on this matter.  Apart from what Deputy Mulcahy has said, it should also be borne in mind that during the last couple of years Government policy has been directed to pretty large borrowings.  Amongst a number of big institutions seeking money in the market now is the Dublin Corporation.  One might naturally expect that people having extensive property in the city would be interested in the successful flotation of loans by the Dublin Corporation for housing and other schemes.  Consequently, it is advisable that they should have representation on the body whose property&mdash;their property and the property of others whom they represent&mdash;is pledged as credit for these loans, and that an endeavour would be made to have co-operation between them and other interests on the municipal body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Cork City Act, when it came before the House some few years ago, representations were made, but at too late a date, to provide a franchise for the business community. The result of what is now proposed is that property in the city of high valuation will have no representation on the City Council.  The question arises: has there been any objection from other sections of the community to the representation on the City Council which it is now proposed to sweep away?  So far as one can judge, harmonious relations have existed between those elected on the commercial register and the other members of the City Council.  Apart from all that, if it be intended to deal with a big question like that of housing, it is inevitable that sums of money be borrowed.  The better the response of the public to the offering of these loans and the better the rates at which money can be procured by bodies which have to borrow, the better for all classes of citizens.  It might, perhaps, help the present loan <Col N="65" /> if it were known that this matter was receiving reconsideration by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has touched upon a very important point, which the Minister should consider. I am not as undemocratic as the Minister, measuring the Minister's democracy by the last motion and his view thereon.  I remember, a few years ago, when the Minister asked in the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;Why stop at 500 houses for the people; why stop at 1,000, why not 10,000?  I agree with him.  The Minister is probably aware&mdash;if not, the Minister for Finance will tell him&mdash;of how easy or how difficult it is to get money to finance housing schemes.  He is probably aware that the loan now being floated for £1,350,000&mdash;the loan referred to by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;could have been floated a year ago at a cost of £40,000 less.  Money is cheaper in the world market to-day than it was then.  We could float a loan of 3½ per cent. stock then with every hope of its being subscribed&mdash;in any event, we were able to get responsible people to guarantee that stock at an issue price of £96&mdash;but to-day we can only obtain a guarantee if the stock is issued at £93.  I wonder if the fact that this Bill is on the stocks has anything to do with that.  The British municipalities can get money at 3 per cent., issuing their stock at par.  Why should we have to pay £3 10s. for every £93?  The Minister is probably aware that, even then, no provision is made and no money will be available for the building of a solitary house under the 1935 programme.  The sum realisable by this loan will be £1,336,000, contracts for the whole of which have been placed, with the exception of one item of £75,000 for the widening of South Great George's Street.  All the housing contracts have been placed and will be completed by next September.  Take the case of the Crumlin area, where a £500,000 contract is in course of execution. Land has been developed for a housing scheme to cost £1,000,000 but we are making no provision for that in this loan.  I do not want to say <Col N="66" /> anything here that I should not say and I do not really know where the danger point is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, we have not any money to build houses on this developed land at Crumlin.  We are making no provision in this loan for the building of houses there.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the Dublin Corporation has discontinued the lending of money under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and that no provision is being made in this loan for the financing of this Act.  The Minister shakes his head.  I know all the operations. Provision is made for £250,000 in respect of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act but that money has already been advanced from other allocations and, when the borrowed money comes to the credit of the Small Dwellings Act Account, it will have to be transferred to the other accounts from which that sum has already been borrowed.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this loan will make no money available for the operation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I do not know whether or not the Minister would advance the money but, in any event, the price would not be a practical proposition because it would be £4 15s. per cent.  The Minister is aware of the position and I am sure appreciates it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the withdrawal of this Bill would help the credit of the Dublin Corporation, it would be a very good piece of work for the Dublin Corporation and for local government generally.  Certain of the added areas require water and sewerage schemes but they are not going to get them.  Provision is not being made for them in this loan.  If the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act be discontinued, 80 per cent. of the building activities in and around the City of Dublin will cease.  The building trade is the trade which is giving most employment in the city to-day. It is giving more employment than all the factories put together&mdash;I do not care how numerous they may be represented to be.  Anything that will help our credit in the Dublin Corporation should be considered by the Minister <Col N="67" /> in present circumstances.  If he is convinced that the withdrawal of the Bill would not help our credit, then my argument collapses but I am of opinion that it would help our credit.  Another thing that is necessary is either a second main from Roundwood, giving an increased water supply, or the alternative water supply scheme which has been suggested and which is now supported by the engineering staff in the Corporation.  But £500,000 will be required for it, anyway.  That has to be procured.  To carry on, in even the comparatively small ambitious way in which we were carrying on, in housing and general development in the city, another loan on top of this one is practical politics.  So, the Minister will perceive from that the absolute necessity of this loan being a huge success, even though the price is pretty high.  It is good to be able to get money even at that price, and if it is not a success it will be serious.</P>
    <P>Again, however, I would ask the Minister to consider if anything he could do with this Bill, either by holding it up or scrapping it, would help the credit of the Dublin Corporation. He should seriously consider that before he takes the final step of having this Bill enacted into an Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see, for the life of me, how the putting of this <Col N="68" /> Bill into operation, or the holding up of the Bill, or the holding up of any matter dealing with this particular Bill, is going to affect the credit of the city.  I have known, as I know that Deputy Cosgrave has known, the Dublin Corporation for a long time, and, as long as I can recollect, I think I can say with truth that the commercial interests of Dublin were always represented there in some way or another.  People connected in a very intimate way with the big commercial interests of the city were always to be found amongst the members of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;not in great numbers, perhaps, but you always had a fairly substantial representation there in the membership of the municipal council.  It does not seem reasonable to me to suggest, therefore, that the addition or the elimination of five members, one way or the other, is going to affect the financial credit of the municipality.  I do not think that it would take half of one per cent. off the loan price if we agreed to allow this Bill to remain suspended.  I do not believe that it would have any effect, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>What will affect the credit of the city is that the money that is to be raised in this loan, which Deputies have mentioned, and moneys to be raised in future loans, will be spent wisely and well.  I am satisfied that the credit of the municipality stands high and deservedly high: that the business of the Dublin Corporation is well run and has been well run.  I have no fault to find with the way it has been run, as a Minister at present, or as a citizen, or as a member of the Council in the days when I was a member.  We all criticise municipalities, and perhaps there is room for criticism of municipalities to-day, just as there is room for criticism of other bodies of greater or less importance; but on the whole I am satisfied that the municipality of Dublin is well run, that its financial business particularly is well run and managed, and I believe that the credit of the municipality stands high, and that its loans are the best possible form of security and should be well invested in by the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> Again, I cannot see what effect, adverse or the contrary, the action of the House here on this Bill is likely to have in so far as the financial credit of the city is concerned.  I believe that when it was introduced and passed here it was a reactionary kind of measure, and one that is not in keeping with the spirit of the times.  I believe that the individuals who have their money invested in the commercial houses and commercial properties of the city are all entitled to their votes and to their representation in their various spheres, and the commerce of Dublin gets its due representation when the former system ceases.  I do not believe that it is going to be adversely affected by the elimination of the special franchise which now operates.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider it wise to have a consultation with the people who are up against this money raising?  After all, we have this <Col N="70" /> before us.

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £3,589 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1934, and the sundry Contributions and Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid in respect of the cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the said Acts.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the presentation of this Supplementary Estimate is to meet the liabilities accruing in connection with the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911-1934, arising out of the fact that the expenditure on accidents, sickness, disablement and maternity benefits for the year has been greater than was anticipated.  It is now estimated that a further sum of £6,000 will be required to meet such grants-in-aid of these benefits in addition to the sum of £59 required to meet actuarial expenses, the casual references under this heading having been more than normal, increasing the additional sum required to £6,059.  It is anticipated that there will be a surplus of £20 under appropriations-in-aid, reducing the additional sum to £6,039 and it is further anticipated that there will be a saving of £2,450 on further sub-heads of the Vote, of which £2,300 is in respect of savings on salaries due to reduction in the cost-of-living bonus, vacancies in staff unfilled or filled by officers on loan from other Departments and changes in personnel.  This saving will reduce the additional sum required under the Supplementary Estimate to £3,589.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Vote on the ground of the delays that are arising in the payment of benefits under national health insurance since <Col N="73" /> the change-over.  Conditions were never too good in respect of the local societies, but these societies were near at hand and it was possible for the people entitled to benefit to get that benefit rapidly, but since the change-over took place, the delay has become very much greater and a large number of people are complaining bitterly. I suppose we have to take it that one of the chief causes of the delay is the fact of money running short.  In cases of sickness and maternity benefit there should not be any undue delay.  The employees and the employers are subscribing to this fund and there should be no delay in paying when cases arise.  I have not very much to say on the Vote except to ask the Minister to see to it that in future there is not as much delay in paying as there has been in the past.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate for money in respect of national health insurance, I want to draw the attention of the Minister to one grave defect in the existing system of national health insurance.  I remember when the unification Bill was passing through, several of us made representations to him about the minimum statutory benefits that were to be provided for.  I remember pointing out to him that many of the then societies were providing dental benefit and that it was proposed under the Bill to omit dental benefit from the statutory benefits.  I think the time has come when the Government should seriously consider introducing amending legislation to provide dental benefit and I think that for the reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is familiar with the fact that social services generally are in a very uncoordinated state to-day and that various Departments look after various aspects of social legislation.  Each new piece of social legislation seems to be a self-contained piece of legislation and apparently no effort is made to regulate these items of legislation and to bring them into a co-ordinated whole. The Minister, I think, when we were discussing the question of the National Health Insurance Act, indicated his own belief in some kind of a co-ordinated scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to advocate legislation.  What I want to know is whether the Minister can tell the House if there is any Departmental Committee examining the question of national health insurance in its relation to other aspects of our social service and if there are any proposals in contemplation for the regulation of these various social services and co-ordination of national health insurance legislation with the various other items of social legislation to which national health insurance is in some way related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I raise the question of dental benefit in the same form by asking the Minister if he is of the same opinion still, taking the long view, that dental benefit is a useful benefit to provide under a national health insurance scheme, and whether he is in a position to inform the House if there is a committee at present considering the desirability of adopting <Col N="75" /> this useful reform?  Might I further ask whether he has addressed his mind as yet to the question of the value, taking a long term view, of a benefit of that character and whether, recognising that, at the moment, it might throw a considerable burden on the funds of the Unified Society, he has considered that the provision of dental benefit in Ireland would result in a very material relief to the funds of the Unified Society in, say, 20 or 30 years' time. Has he considered that if he fails to provide that benefit now, he is perpetuating, not only a recurring sickness benefit but perpetuating what almost invariably turns into disablement benefit, because I think his Parliamentary Secretary will inform him that one of the commonest causes of that type of rheumatism which incapacitates hundreds of subscribers to the national health insurance fund has its origin in dental defects in the earlier years of the insured person's life?  The object of my proposal is to provide now a benefit which would, in the long run, pay for itself not only from the point of view of the finances of the society but also from the general public health point of view of the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment I am not concerned with future benefits, but I am concerned with the benefits which the people are entitled to and are not receiving.  There is no question but that, throughout the country, we have complaints in regard to undue delay in dealing with the claims of the poor people.  We have claims awaiting six or seven weeks, and, in the meantime, those people have to receive home assistance.  We find the most frivolous excuses from Dublin, such as a wrong number being sent up by an agent, instead of the officials dealing with the proper cases that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have three cases in mind.  One is the case of a man who had been in receipt of disablement benefit for two years.  The superintendent under the unification scheme was the superintendent under the original insurance scheme.  The moment it came under <Col N="76" /> the Local Government Department, the same superintendent reported that this man's illness was a result of an accident.  This man himself proved by medical evidence, by the evidence of surgeons in Dublin, that his illness was in no way the result of an accident. The Department was not concerned. They cut off the man's benefit and left him at the mercy of the local home assistance people.  That poor man had no money to fight his case.  If the insurance people had any doubt that it was the result of an accident, their proper procedure would have been to continue the payment of the benefit and take proceedings in the court against the man's employers.  Instead of that they left the poor man in bed for two years without giving him any assistance.</P>
    <P>There was another case where the Unified Society held that the poor man was 70 years of age.  Evidence was submitted to them that he was not 70 years.  They refused to accept that evidence.  After the lapse of four or five weeks that evidence was supplemented by his birth certificate, which proved that the man was right.  But, up to Christmas I found that the man had not received his benefit and was still on home help.  We got word that there was some mistake, not in any certificate that had been issued, but we got proof that the certificate had been sent to the local agent 20 miles out of his area.  That had been sent from the Health Office in Dublin; it went to the wrong agent.  Then, in that case, a second certificate had to be procured. We have other cases where on the most frivolous pretexts men were turned down and placed as a burden on home help and on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Then again, we have in this society full-time agents who are paid the miserable wage of 30/- to 40/- a week. I ask the Minister to contrast the payments to these poor agents who have to travel long distances around the country with the treatment that is given to a member of the Committee of Management who only attends once a week.  There is no question in that case of cutting down the remuneration. You have blue lights, green lights and red lights in the office.  I want the <Col N="77" /> Minister to see that there will not be so much of this red-tape in future, and that it will not be a question of red light, green light or blue light, but that the man will get benefit when he has presented a proper claim.  I have submitted several cases where men have been entitled to benefit, but have not got it.</P>
    <P>I can well understand there being some excuse in the case of a small society.  We understood that once the business was centralised in Dublin that particular care was to be taken that the people in the rural areas would be attended to.  Instead of that, these people have been made wait, and where they do receive benefit sometimes they do not get it for a month.  I have definite information that one man who had been in receipt of benefit of 7/6 a week since the Unified Society was set up, has been cut down now to 1/6.  The sooner the Committee of Management is changed the better.  It should not be a case of one man going down once a week, and for that one day's attendance he gets better pay and better treatment than the poor agent who has to go through rain and storm around the country collecting money.</P>
    <P>If the thing is to be made a success there must be a satisfied staff.  A man cannot take a real interest in his work when he is only getting £2 a week, while he sees thousands spent in Dublin in connection with the management. We were assured that there were to be increased benefits once the Unified Society was set up and that there were to be no further complaints from the insured people.  I can only say that in my ten or 12 years' experience on public boards I never heard so many complaints as we have at present about the delays in the payment of benefit.  I am not blaming the agents.  They send their reports here to Dublin, but there does not seem to be any co-ordination in the system.  With the number of red lights and green lights they have one would imagine that it was into an Indian prince's chambers one was going, rather than into an insurance office.  Instead of spending money on tomfoolery the money should be spent in giving benefit to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to-day to a question by Deputy Byrne about delays in the payment of benefit, I furnished a statement that I believe to be correct.  From inquiries made I find that 98 per cent. of the benefit was paid out 24 hours after the certificates were received.  Never in the history of any of the former non-unified societies was such a high average reached.  Deputy Everett talked about complaints.  He did not send any complaints to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>But not to me. Send on the complaints to me and I will go through them.  I am nearly certain if these complaints are sent on to me, that it will be found that 90 per cent. of them will turn out to be the fault of the people themselves or of the agents.  That is my experience after examining the complaints that have been sent in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The Deputy said he had many other cases. I would be very glad to examine them and will do the same for Deputy MacEoin or any other Deputy who sends me a complaint.  I do not like to have these complaints.  I do not like these people to be without their money. It is not a creditable thing, but from the examination of complaints that I have already undertaken I am satisfied that the delays are due in 90 per cent. of the cases to the people themselves sending in the wrong number, the wrong address, the wrong age, and so on.  I would be glad if every Deputy in the House would take that invitation and send any complaints they have to me.  I will have all these complaints examined and Deputies will be told the result of that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other points raised by Deputies Norton and Dillon, I want to say I have not changed my views on the question of social services. I do hope to see many useful developments arise as a result of the <Col N="79" /> unification of the societies.  The unification, to my mind, is only the first step in the endeavour to put this so-called health insurance on a real health insurance basis.  I do not regard this as a proper measure of insurance for the promotion of health. There is a variety of other important steps that I hope, in good time, will be taken to co-ordinate the social services.  To begin with the first step and one that seems to me to be the most necessary&mdash;unification&mdash;has only just been taken.  Unification of the various organisations connected with the national health societies has never been accomplished and it will take some time with the assistance of everybody to bring that about.  It will take some time to have various other steps completed before the other things we have in mind can without very great initial cost be added to national health insurance.</P>
    <P>Some of the services that were previously given by some of the societies will then be brought into existence. I believe these things must come. National health insurance must be made a real insurance for the promotion and preservation of health and social services generally.  Instead of being scattered as they are, they must be co-ordinated and reorganised. That is a heavy undertaking and it will take time.  We have only got over the initial step this year.  I am not going to say anything about the Committees, but I will say this much, that an examination is being made of the situation, particularly in so far as it affects national health insurance. The amendments and improvements that I have in mind are a cumbrous business.  To get this Committee into the form that is necessary for the due consideration of these matters is a thing that is not being lost sight of, and at some date in the future, as soon as this work connected with the unification is accomplished, I hope to be able to make some announcement with regard to the further steps that will be taken in the direction of improving, co-ordinating and developing national health insurance and similar social services.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet anticipated excesses on certain sub-heads of the Vote, i.e.:&mdash; sub-head C&mdash;Incidental Expenses, £300; sub-head G&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones, £240; sub-head I&mdash; Improvement of Estates, etc., £80,000; sub-head J&mdash;Advances to meet deficiency of income from untenanted lands purchased under the Land Acts 1923-33, £2,000, together with expenditure under two new sub-heads, i.e.&mdash; sub-head Z1&mdash;Purchase of Tolls and Customs (Knox Gore C.D.B. Estate), £362; sub-head Z2.&mdash;Assistance to Migrants from the Gaeltacht, £300. These items amount in all to £83,202, <Col N="81" /> against which are set-off anticipated savings on other sub-heads amounting to £37,252, and an anticipated excess in respect of Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £7,800, leaving the net amount required £38,150.</P>
      <P>The anticipated excess of £300 on sub-head C is due mainly to an increase in the cost of advertisements and the excess of £240 on sub-head G to increased payments for telegrams and telephones, both arising, in the main, from the greater activities of the Department in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>The anticipated excess of £80,000 on sub-head I (Improvement of Estates, etc.) is due to the increased amount of work undertaken in connection with the Government's policy of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the division of untenanted land.  The expenditure during the current year on roads, fences, drains, dwellinghouses and out-offices has been in excess of the average of recent years and much useful work has been done to date.  The original provision under sub-head I, i.e. £250,050 contains a sum of £240,000 in respect of improvements, but the expenditure on improvement works during the current year up to the 31st January last amounted to over £251,000, and it is expected that, in consequence of the exceptional amount of work which the Department will be undertaking in connection with the division of untenanted land within the next couple of months, the total expenditure for the whole year will not be less than £320,000.</P>
      <P>It is also anticipated that there will be an excess of about £2,000 on sub-head J. on account of the deficiency in income from untenanted land purchased under the Land Acts, 1923-33 to meet payments to the Land Bond Fund for interest on purchase moneys outstanding and to pay rates and other outgoings in respect of lands on hands pending allotment.</P>
      <P>The untenanted lands affected by this sub-head are those which have been divided amongst allottees but have not yet been published in lists of holdings under Section 24 of the Land Act, 1931 and those lands which are still on hands awaiting allotment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision under sub-head ZI&mdash;<Col N="82" /> the estimated amount required is £362 &mdash;is to meet the purchase price of the Ballycastle tolls and customs on the Knox Gore Estate, County Mayo. This estate was originally purchased by the Congested Districts Board but the Ballycastle tolls and customs were excluded from the sale owing to a delay in making title.  This matter has now been satisfactorily disposed of and the necessary conveyance to the Land Commission as successors to the Congested Districts Board has been made.  The expenditure, however, being of an unusual type could not be charged against any of the existing sub-heads in the Land Commission Vote and in acordance with the usual practice it is being met out of this new sub-head.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head Z2&mdash; estimated amount required, £300&mdash;is to meet special expenditure which will be incurred in connection with the migration of congests from the Gaeltacht to the new colonies which are being established in County Meath. The Government are anxious that these migrants should be given every possible opportunity to succeed in their new homes and, as many of them will be persons of small means, it is proposed to make provision for various needs before their arrival.  As it is expected that some of the first migrants will arrive in the early spring, it is essential that a portion of each of their holdings should be cultivated on arrival.  It is proposed also to give the migrants practical instruction in the form of agriculture best suited for the development of their new holdings, but that will be attended to by the Department of Agriculture and this Vote is not concerned with it.</P>
    <P>The total of the foregoing excesses and of the two new sub-heads amounts to £83,202, which sum is off-set by savings on other sub-heads amounting to £37,252 and increased Appropriations-in-Aid of £7,800, leaving the net amount of the Estimate £38,150.  The anticipated savings are spread over various sub-heads, the principal being under sub-head S. £5,000 and sub-head W. £20,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> The anticipated saving of £5,000 on sub-head S (amount required to complete purchase proceedings pending under the Land Acts, 1903-09) is due to the fact that the sum originally provided for this service, i.e., £25,000, will not all be required this year.  This sub-head provides for advances and bonus moneys payable under the Land Acts, 1903-09.  The anticipated saving under sub-head W (fees payable in connection with proceedings under Section 28, Land Act, 1933) is £20,000. This sub-head provides for the payment of lodgment fees to sheriffs and county registrars in respect of warrants issued under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, for the recovery of unpaid instalments of land purchase annuities, etc.  This is the first year in which it has been found necessary to make this provision and the amount originally inserted in the Estimate, i.e., £48,000, was necessarily conjectural. It is not anticipated that expenditure will exceed £28,000, so that there will be a saving on this service of £20,000. Small anticipated savings spread over a number of other sub-heads of the Vote account for the balance amounting to £12,252.</P>
    <P>The estimated increase in appropriations-in-aid is due to increases under the following heads: Excess annuities, £3,000; Repayment of fees in connection with sheriffs' proceedings under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, £2,000; other miscellaneous items, £2,800.  Excess annuities represent the recoupment of that portion of the expenditure in past years on improvement of holdings which was made repayable by means of annuities as distinct from free grants.  Lodgment fees recovered by sheriffs and county registrars in connection with proceedings under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, are repayable by them to the Land Commission and are appropriated in aid of the Vote.  The original Estimate under this head was £8,000, but it is estimated that this will now be exceeded by £2,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, in fact, asking the Dáil for a sum of £83,302 in addition to what was already voted.  There are, of course, appropriations-in-aid <Col N="84" /> and so on, making the net sum £38,150.  The sum of £83,000 is largely made up of the item £80,000 against sub-head I of the original Estimate for the improvement of estates.  The Minister, in putting the new Estimate to the House, said this expenditure was necessary because of the fact that the Department was proceeding as rapidly as possible with the division of untenanted land.  That would be excellent if it were a fact.  It is not a fact and that is proved by the Minister's answer in the House on 13th February to questions put down by various Deputies from this side of the House covering the whole Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>The reply was set out in tabular form and is to be found in columns 833 and 834 of the Official Report for 13th February.  There is set out there a table showing the number of persons placed on the land and the number of acres divided for the years 1925 to 1934. It makes very illuminating reading when one considers what the Minister has said, that this Vote is to be largely directed to carrying out the Government's policy of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the division of untenanted land and the amount of propaganda made by the Government and their spokesmen with regard to this question.  Everywhere you have had it blazoned forth that this is the Government which was really placing the people on the land; that we have got a Government who are placing the people on the land at an extraordinary rate as compared with their predecessors. Here are the facts.  I will go back only to 1927, because from 1927 to 1931 I was responsible, as Minister in charge of that particular Department. I shall merely give the number of persons placed on the land from 1927 to 1934; I shall not trouble the House with the acreage.  In the year 1927 there were 864 persons placed on the land; in 1928, 982; in 1929, 711; in 1930 1,013; in 1931, 614.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Now comes the change of Government.  They started in 1932 by putting 456 persons on the land; in 1933, 517, and in 1934, 485.  In no year <Col N="85" /> since this Government came into office have they placed as many people on the land as we placed in our slackest year, in the year 1931, when we placed 614 persons.  That is the &ldquo;proceeding as rapidly as possible&rdquo; which the Minister talks about.  These are figures supplied by the Minister's own Department in reply to a question.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs in view of those figures that they have come to the House and looked for a further Vote. I am not opposing the Vote.  As a matter of fact, every year this particular Vote for the improvement of estates came up here on the main Estimate we have stated that there was not sufficient money being asked for if the Government were serious in intending to deal with the division of land. If I remember rightly, this money for the improvement of estates can only be expended pending the vesting of estates; once an estate is vested it passes as it were, from the purview of the Land Commission as far as improvement is concerned, and no further money will be expended upon it. We are not going to vote against this, but it is an extraordinary thing that more money is required now in spite of the fact that fewer people are being placed on the land and less land is being divided than in any year during the nine years preceding the change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make just one slight comment on the new Vote with regard to assistance for migrants from the Gaeltacht. I was not here at question time to-day when a question was put by Deputy Davin as to the order in which persons are being dealt with now when an estate is being divided; but Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has told me that it is something like this: (1) herds, etc. employed on the estate&mdash;that was always the way; (2) landless men; (3) migrants.  If that is so, that is an extraordinary change.  It means that we are going away from the policy of dealing with the existing congestion in order to deal with the landless men. The Minister spoke of this money being made available for some particular scheme for bringing persons to County Meath.  If the policy of the Land Commission now is that when <Col N="86" /> an estate is being divided landless men, who, perhaps, have really no touch with agricultural work, are to get preference to migrants, or congests in other words, it is a matter that should be explained to the House. Other schemes which prevailed in the Gaeltacht for dealing with the economic conditions there have been abandoned by the Minister's Department or are in process of being abandoned.  If that is so, one felt at least that when it came to the Land Commission side of his Department the Minister would make up for that by being particularly generous towards congestion in the Gaeltacht. That cannot be so if, when estates are being divided in Deputy Davin's constituency or in Meath and so on, he is first of all going to tackle the local landless men problem before he brings in any migrants from the Gaeltacht to relieve the congestion there.  That is all I have to say on the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the figures that Deputy Lynch has read out to the House.  I can remember the Minister for Lands in West Donegal and when he came there he always brought with him a torchlight procession with a brass band.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw him he had them.  In any case, he came as a harbinger of a Christian Government to explain to the people of West Donegal that his ambition was to supplant a ranchers' Government, a Government that ground down the poor, that fostered ranchers and that denied to the hard-working people of this country an opportunity of earning a livelihood upon the land.  If he were to be given an opportunity of driving the Land Commission to do the duty that they were there to do, there would be land for the people and bread for the poor. We all remember that talk&mdash;the Christian Government; back to the land; the land was going to be given back to the Irish people.  Propaganda became so fast and furious that even so distinguished a man as G. K. Chesterton got lyrical and wrote an article about it to say that there had <Col N="87" /> arisen in Ireland a great prophet who was going to put the people back on the land.  The prophet set to work and after three years' strenuous labour the prophet has not put on the land in any single year much more than half of what his predecessor did without any talk at all.  Do I err on the side of severity when I characterise that as hypocrisy, when you stump the country and delude the unfortunate people into believing that you are sustainers of Christian principles, that the evidence of your Christianity is the rapidity with which you are going to divide the land, and it is then discovered that you are not only insincere but incompetent to boot?</P>
      <P>I think those figures are figures that will astonish the people of this country.  I think that they astonish some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party themselves.  I think it is a good thing that the people of this country should realise that when there was no talk at all about the great things that were going to be done, it was possible to put 1,000 people on the land in one year and that when we were deafened by the blatant propaganda about the lofty Christian principles that were inspiring the new Government, we never could rise above 500.  If Christian principles on the subjects of plunder and murder were put into practice a little more vigorously, and there was less talk about Christian principles in setting people on the land, there would be less cause for criticism of the Supplementary Estimate which we have before us now. I am glad that the Land Commission are getting this money if it means that they are going to speed up the work and I trust that, with this added money, the Minister will be able to redeem at least part of the high falutin' undertakings he gave to the strains of a brass band in the glow of a torchlight procession in Donegal. I hope that he will have more success in these activities of his new office than he had in his last office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one question I should like to ask: why is it I can never get an answer from the Land Commission? <Col N="88" /> From most Departments of State if you write a letter to them, you can get some information out of them, but write a letter to the Land Commission and you might as well post your letter in the refuse box in O'Connell Street.  I freely confess that when you approach a particular officer of the Department with a formal complaint in regard to any specific case, immediate steps are taken to trace your communication, but an ordinary letter addressed to the Land Commission on any matter of ordinary every-day work may remain unanswered from anything from six to nine months.  In one case I remember I was for nine months trying to get information from the Land Commission. Immediately I wrote to the principal officer of the Department, I got what I was looking for.  I do seriously submit to the Minister that the method whereby correspondence is dealt with in the Land Commission requires a general overhaul and vigorous measures should be taken to ensure that persons who make legitimate inquiries by correspondence will be attended to and will get the information they require.  Deputy MacDermot suggests that they are too busy answering Fianna Fáil clubs.  That may be the case but then the reform may not be required inside the Land Commission and I have no doubt that if the Minister will start out with his torchlight procession and his brass band he will be able to discipline the Fianna Fáil clubs as effectively and, I hope, more effectively, than he is able to control the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is another point to raise.  I remember when the offensive section of the 1933 Land Act was going through which gave the Land Commission power to issue warrants to the sheriff, I made the point that it was a monstrous thing that the Land Commission should have the power to issue warrants authorising the sheriff to seize in cases where tenant purchasers were genuinely unable to pay.  The Minister for Defence was in charge of the Bill, and I remember his saying that it was unthinkable that the Land Commission, with their long experience, <Col N="89" /> would dream of making a seizure on any tenant purchaser who was genuinely unable to pay.  He pointed out that it would be mere folly to do so because the annuity was a recurring charge, and that it would be futile to enter a man's land and take away a man's means of livelihood to satisfy one gale, as that would mean that he would be totally unable to pay any subsequent gale.  I took that with a grain of salt, but I determined to test it out. A man wrote to me a full statement of his case, pointing out that he was literally unable to pay, though most anxious to pay.  I wrote back to him and said that if he would give me leave to take his letter to the Land Commission and, if needs be, to quote it in Dáil Eireann, I was in a position to say that he would not be further pressed, and that the Minister had given a clear undertaking that in cases where men were genuinely unable to pay they would not be liable to seizure.  I sallied off to the Land Commission with my letter, and I think I satisfied the Commission that the man was genuinely unable to pay.  I left hoping that the Minister's undertaking would be redeemed, but to the best of my knowledge and belief no exception of any kind good, bad or indifferent was made in that case.  I want to ask the Minister to state specifically now on this Estimate, that if satisfactory proof is put in his hands that a man is genuinely unable to pay, though willing to pay if he can sell his stock or get money in any other way, will the Minister forbid seizure being made at his place, so long as it is possible to satisfy the Minister that the man is not shirking payment, but is genuinely unable to pay?  I should like to get a categorical answer to that question.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has become a very serious nuisance in the country.  In a number of cases in the early days of the Irish Land Commission when they were dividing estates, they made by-roads.  I should say first that these by-roads frequently do not connect two main roads and under a judgment of Chief Baron Palles, it has been decided that the county council may not spend money on the maintenance of roads which are <Col N="90" /> not roads of public convenience.  It is only roads that connect two main roads which are held to be roads of public convenience.  So you have now a situation in which the county councils will not maintain these roads. In some cases you have labourers cottages built along these roads and the Board of Health will not repair the roads.  As far as I can find out, nobody is responsible for the maintenance of the roads with the result that in one case, with which I am personally familiar, the residents of labourers' cottages along the roads have literally to wade out of their houses.  Might I suggest to the Minister that if he has the power, he should take some steps to transfer these roads to somebody upon whom a statutory obligation would rest to maintain them or else that he should take such steps as may be necessary to put these roads into repair himself?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House the average price being paid for land acquired under the 1933 Land Act.  The gravest possible complaints are being made that land is being acquired under that Act on terms which amount almost to confiscation.  The Minister may have seen correspondence in the public Press alleging that the terms on which a certain farm of land has been acquired amount to confiscation.  It is most important that the Minister should make a comprehensive statement in order to assure the people that the terms of the 1933 Land Act are not being used for a purpose for which they were never intended, and that the Minister very clearly assured the House they would never be used for.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>The President contradicted the statement I made when this Bill was last before the House, that Archbishop Mannix would be an alien under it.  I have since looked at the Bill, which is now before the Seanad, the Citizenship Bill, and also the relevant clause of the Constitution, and I find that what I said was strictly accurate.  As matters stand to-day we are, in fact, imposing alienship, and labelling as aliens a considerable number of distinguished people who were born in this country. If they do not become citizens under the Constitution they do not become citizens under this Bill.  It is true that they have not been branded with the designation of aliens, and it is true that something may happen in the Seanad, which may come to the rescue of the Government as that House often does in these matters. According to the Citizenship Bill, as passed in this House, I have no doubt about my statement being accurate. That Bill is now before the Seanad, and is not yet passed, as, very wisely, I think that House is holding it up until they see what this Bill will be like.  When the Citizenship Bill was introduced I suggested that we should wait until we got the text of this Bill before deciding what Irish citizenship would be, because we did not know who would be an alien.  Now, we have a simple definition of an alien, which imposes that title on a large number of Irish citizens.  It would be well if we had adopted the same procedure as the Seanad.  In any case, we do not know if the original Bill will pass the Seanad or what amendments it may be decided to insert there.  As we stand to-day we are imposing unnecessarily the stigma of alien on a considerable <Col N="93" /> number of people of Irish descent who hitherto, if not actually political citizens of this State, have, nevertheless, been spared the title of aliens.</P>

I stated on the last occasion that that statement was made that I did not believe any interpretation of the Citizenship Bill could make Archbishop Mannix an alien.  We have covered a large number by Article III, <Col N="94" /> and in addition we have inserted a provision that those who were born here, if they return, can automatically resume citizenship.  If abroad they can be regarded as citizens by registration. It is hardly necessary to say that Archbishop Mannix and other distinguished Irishmen born here do not become aliens.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 16, to delete the words &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 22, before the words &ldquo;A title to real or personal property&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the rights of aliens in respect of property.  The first sub-section starts off&mdash;&ldquo;Subject to the provision of this section.&rdquo;  The second sub-section has not these limiting words.  If they are required in the first sub-section I suggest they are required in the second sub-section, but what I am putting to the Committee is that they are not required in either sub-section, because the third sub-section says &ldquo;nothing in this section shall operate&rdquo; in relation to a variety of things.  If there is no limitation in sub-section (3), then there is no force in saying in sub-sections (1) and (2) &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this section.&rdquo;  The object of the amendments is to have sub-sections (1) and (2) the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So far as a layman's reading is concerned&mdash;this is, I think, a very common form&mdash;the intention appears to be quite clear. Certain people interpreting sub-sections (1) and (2) might possibly say that rights of property were given which would include certain franchises. In this sub-section, we say that such an interpretation is ruled out.  I think that this is the common form for dealing with matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's fear is that the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in <Col N="99" /> sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 3 may be interpreted as including franchises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It might possibly be so interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either it will have that interpretation or it will not. Those are the only possible alternatives. Consider both of them.  If it has not that meaning, then the section does not give it.  Is that right?  If it is interpreted as having it, then even the negative expression in sub-section (3) gives it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be quite right if we were absolutely and completely certain that we could point to one interpretation and one only.  Then the logic of the Deputy would be perfectly sound.  But we have to remember that statutes are interpreted by the courts and that individuals may strain the meaning and may possibly read into them a meaning which we do not intend they should carry.  We want to make clear in this sub-section that our intention is not to allow aliens to qualify by sub-section 1 in this particular way.  We want to make clear by this sub-section that that is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I attempt an explanation of this in another way. What I am arguing about is the phrase &ldquo;nothing in this section.&rdquo; My argument is confined to that.  The sub-section says &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate&rdquo;&mdash;let us take one phrase only&mdash;&ldquo;to qualify an alien for,&rdquo; let us say, any franchise for which he would not be qualified if the section had not been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section could possibly be put in another form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing on it as it stands at the moment and it is completely without meaning.  Let me start again.  &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate&rdquo; to give an alien any franchise which he would not have if <Col N="100" /> the section had not been enacted.  Is not the implication of that that if this section does give him a particular franchise, he gets it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not give him anything outside this interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it does not, there is no use in saying it does not.  If the section does not, in fact, give him anything, there is no use in saying it does not.  Is not that clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a fallacy in that argument.  You have to take the two interpretations&mdash;(a) and (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be a case in which a person might think that the intention was to confer this special right, which it is not the intention to do.  We say that this particular sub-section is not to be interpreted as giving that right.  This is, I think, the usual form in which such an exclusion is put.  I am not a draftsman but I have seen a number of Acts in which this form is used.  I see the point at which the Deputy is driving but I take it that this is the usual form in which such an idea is expressed.  We have to consider the two possible interpretations and we say that one of these interpretations is to be ruled out.  It is a question of what the interpretation usually given to a paragraph of this sort is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a last effort, is it correct to paraphrase sub-section 3 (a) in this way&mdash;This section will not give an alien a franchise which he would not have if this section were not enacted. Is that a correct paraphrase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we get back to the parts of Section (3) which give rights.  They are certain property rights.  If property is interpreted as bringing in this word &ldquo;franchise,&rdquo; you have not cut out franchise.  If the first paragraph means not merely property but something called &ldquo;franchise,&rdquo; then <Col N="101" /> you have given it in an interpretation you are assuming some judge to take. When that judge gets down to (3) he will say &ldquo;This section is not to operate to give an alien something which he would not have if the section had not been enacted.  I find by the section that he gets something.&rdquo;  Therefore (3) (a) shows he gets it.  What is the use of (3) (a)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point, but it seems to me that no judge would take that view.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), before paragraph (c), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) to qualify an alien to be the owner of any aircraft registered in Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to qualify for ownership of aircraft.  The point in this is that, by a convention, aircraft registered in Ireland must be owned by Irish citizens, and we want to make it clear by this that ownership is not conferred on aliens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that some confusion might be caused by this, which would run through the whole Bill.  When this Bill becomes law, you may find that some presently registered aircraft are owned, in fact, by newly claimed aliens.  The law of Great Britain with regard to aircraft is slightly out of date, but aircraft registered in any part of the British Commonwealth are recognised in Great Britain and Northern Ireland as being British registered aircraft and they are subject to British regulations in that respect.  I think that even to-day there are in Great Britain Irish <Col N="102" /> registered aircraft owned by persons who, when this Bill becomes law, will be aliens.  So long as they remain in Great Britain they will retain the rights of British registration in Great Britain, but if they come over here they are liable to have their machines confiscated.  Of course, it may only apply to one or two cases.  However, I do not see any particular objection to the insertion of the amendments, but it will be confusing, and I hope it does because that will tend to persuade the Government to bring in legislation to deal with aircraft which is at present outstanding.</P>

      <P>Well, I was taking it in the context of this argument here, because it said here &ldquo;to qualify any person,&rdquo; and the section, in so far as it is a granting section, only referred to aliens.  Leaving that aside, however, now it is &ldquo;to qualify an alien for any right or privilege conferred by <Col N="103" /> an Act of the Oireachtas on any class or group of persons, whether defined as citizens or as nationals of Saorstát Eireann or in any other manner whatsoever, of which such alien is not a member at the relevant time.&rdquo;  What is the meaning of that?  What Acts of the Oireachtas are contemplated which would confer &ldquo;rights or privileges on persons or on any class or group of persons, whether defined as citizens or as nationals of Saorstát Eireann or in any other manner whatsoever&rdquo;?  I can understand their being conferred on people defined as nationals or citizens. Leaving those two aside, however, we are not dealing here with the type of legislation which says that citizens or nationals of this country shall have certain rights and privileges to the exclusion of everybody else.  There is something different here.  There is some addition.  What type of legislation is contemplated which will grant rights and privileges to people who are not defined as being citizens or nationals and from which it is proposed to exclude, by not including, aliens or an alien?  Could we get an example of the type of privileges that is in view?</P>

      <P>An example will be found in the Civil Service Regulation Act (No. 5), 1924, a copy of which statute has just been handed to me. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of that Act states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every such competitive examination (with the exceptions hereinafter in this section mentioned) shall be open to all persons desiring to attend the same who are born in Ireland of Irish parents or who are the children of such persons or who are citizens of Saorstát Eireann or the children of such citizens, and who pay fees,&rdquo; etc.</P>
      <P>Even when the Act is passed, there may be children of such citizens who would not be citizens themselves. Accordingly, this is designed to take all into the net, so to speak.</P>

      <P>The right to sit for an examination?  Let us be quite clear on this.  The governing words of this limitation are these: &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate to qualify a person for some rights or privileges given by the Oireachtas&rdquo; unless in certain cases Nothing in the section shall qualify.  What is in the section?  Real or personal property may be taken, acquired, held, and disposed of by an alien, and a title to real or personal property may be derived through, from, or in succession to an alien.  Is it really argued that the right to sit for an examination could be interpreted as being granted by sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 3, because that is the only example I have yet had?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate to qualify any person for any right or privilege conferred by an Act of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  What is it sought to prohibit an alien from getting?  We start off with a wide section saying that, so far as property is concerned, in the taking or disposing <Col N="105" /> of it an alien and a citizen are the same.  Having said that, we come to paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) which seems to be intended to take the whole thing away.  What is it intended to block the alien from getting?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In legislation such as the Control of Manufactures Act, certain rights are specifically confined to certain groups.  Now that we have a Citizenship Bill these must be looked up and co-ordinated.  Certain privileges have been confined, and may, in the future, be confined to certain classes of persons.  This provision simply means that under any Act in the past, although considered not so excluded, an alien shall not have any rights conferred on him by Parts I and II of sub-section (3).  That seems to be perfectly obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be perfectly obvious but it is very much in the background. There is no relevant example. One example was that of sitting for an examination, but that is not relevant at all.  We were given as examples the Control of Manufactures Act.  There were five examples advanced.  There was the Finance Act, two Acts dealing with the control of manufactures, the Cereals Act and Cement Act.  Two of these died and a third is obsolete. There were certain definitions given. None of them was the same but in all we have the category of citizens.  We are looking forward here to defining citizenship&mdash;nationals on the one hand and aliens on the other&mdash;with some further category of people.  Are we going to make this section define the rights and privileges of people whose rights and privileges have no relation to the holding of property or to the disposal of property?  If it is to be generally interpreted in that way how is it that in sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) aliens have the same rights as citizens when the Oireachtas could, at any time, say whether they have or not.</P>

      <P>Then Section 3 had better be taken and reconsidered because it is not at all clear that that is <Col N="106" /> what it says.  It does not say the Oireachtas may so declare.  It says nothing in the section showing the period to qualify an alien for certain rights.  Its relation is not to citizens and aliens as contrasted classes.  One set of aliens is opposed to another, or a group of aliens is placed at one end and citizens and some specialised group at the other.</P>

I am quite satisfied that the draftsman, when he got the headings, drafted the Bill in the ordinary manner.  I am quite satisfied that it will be interpreted by judges and lawyers in the sense that while we have got to show that aliens in general have certain rights&mdash;the rights of property and so on&mdash;we have made an exclusion.  We cannot enumerate every right but we arrive at the rights they shall have by saying that they have these rights the same as citizens except a, b and c and so on.  That is the interpretation intended.  I doubt if you will find any lawyer who will agree with the Deputy in the view he has taken.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section 2.</P>
      <P>This, in a sense, is the main amendment that I have on the Paper; at least all other of my amendments gravitate round it.  We are now establishing in a more or less permanent form the law respecting aliens in the country.  The situation has been that we took over and adapted what, without any disrespect I might call a panic piece of the legislation of 1914, when there were spies emanating everywhere, and when there was a definite inclination on the part of people to hunt up every alien and pursue him. In that country there were pieces of legislation passed which had preambulatory words in the main section phrased like this: That during a time of war or of imminent national peril, the Government might, by order, do various things.  Then, when the war was over but when the anti-alien complex had not been entirely discharged, they brought in an amending Act in which they gave this power for a further year&mdash;outside the year of that imminent national peril or time of war &mdash;to carry on the same sort of provisions against aliens.  We carried them in here and by the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act of each year, we did carry forward with regard to aliens a lot of powers which were bred entirely in the atmosphere of the panic of the war situation in 1914 in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing now to make that no longer an annual law which could be debated when we get a saner mind with regard to this whole matter of aliens.  Here we are now putting into the permanent legislation of this <Col N="110" /> country this whole section which gives the Minister, by an Aliens Order, power to do &ldquo;all or any of the following things.&rdquo;  One of the things&mdash;and I refer to this in anticipation of another amendment&mdash;that the Minister is empowered to do is to give all officers of the Minister for Justice, that is, the police, and all military and police forces of the State all powers, including powers of arrest and detention and the powers of searching persons and places as are necessary in the Minister's opinion for giving full force to compliance with the order.  All that is if and when the Minister thinks proper.</P>
    <P>Let me take one thing, and it is a matter on which I make a point of importance later.  At the moment, under the Constitution, the citizen's dwelling house is inviolable and at the moment the citizen's person is free from arrest except in accordance with the law.  There are certain legal prescriptions at present, for instance, on a case made by a chief superintendent of the Guards to a district justice that there is reasonable suspicion about certain matters, the district justice may, by written warrant, authorise a named person to enter within a specified period into a man's house to search for treasonable documents.  Orders are also procurable under the Firearms Act, but, hereafter, if there is an Aliens Order, the Minister can immediately graft on a section or a phrase which will enable him to enter any house under the pretext that there is an alien there and that the citizen in whose house the alien is presumed to be hiding is trying to prevent compliance with the Order.  I do not think that is a power that should be lightly given, and if we are giving it, we should have it so free from restrictions and impediments that the Minister of his own volition, when he thinks it proper, can operate all this mass of things with regard to aliens.  Some of them are proper at any time, and all of them, if you like, in time of war, in time of rebellion or in time of imminent national danger, but that they should all be granted if and when the Minister thinks fit, I do not think is proper at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I have put down a series of amendments to try to divide this whole thing out and to have any power you like granted, or taken, because it will be taken as a matter of fact&mdash;and we might as well admit it&mdash;if there is war either imminent or in progress, or if there is armed rebellion either imminent or in progress.  There should be some other phrase that will give a certain discretionary power &mdash; the imminence of national peril or national emergency&mdash;but something at any rate which if the Minister hereafter had operated certain powers in what I can here, in anticipation, describe as an unscrupulous way, would enable us to raise the matter and have the whole thing thrashed out, so that we could get some set of circumstances in which we would declare that such and such a thing was proper and, at other times, not proper.  It is no answer to me to say that this is the situation at the moment because that situation has developed in the peculiar way I have set out&mdash;this panic legislation that was held over in Britain from year to year; which was then taken over here in its adapted form under the Adaptation of Enactments Act and has lasted here from year to year, so that it is open to anybody at the end of each year to raise this business of the powers the Minister has and to raise, say, his exercise of them.</P>
    <P>But now we are getting away from that.  So far as this Bill purports to be anything, it purports to be a permanent piece of legislation for the country and surely we should not rush in with all these regulations, proper enough in war time, and seek to put them in even though we are dealing with aliens and not with our own citizens.  Surely it is not right to have all this enforceable against aliens, particularly when the enforcement of it against aliens may drag in citizens and may drag in such a thing as the forcible entry of a citizen's house by somebody authorised by the Minister for that purpose.  In these circumstances, the Minister has not to satisfy a district justice on the sworn evidence of somebody that he believes somebody is conniving at a breach of <Col N="112" /> the Order.  The Minister can do this of his own volition, if and when he likes, and I think that a power of this sort, which certainly runs contrary to the ordinary idea of the freedom of the person and the freedom of the dwelling-house of folk who come to live here, and which is entirely contrary to the guarantees we give to our own people with regard to their houses and their persons, is not right.</P>
    <P>It is not right to have all these things abrogated, without stating the circumstances under which they will be abrogated, by reason of the peculiarly wide fling that is given to this measure by the use of this phrase: &ldquo;If and when he thinks proper.&rdquo;  I think the words should go out and should be replaced.  I do not suggest that the alternative I propose meets the situation, but I did put up suggestions to reveal the mind I had. Give any or all powers which anybody can think necessary in time of war or in time of armed rebellion, but limit them in time of peace or if there is going to be any wider power than is now being given, let us consider the situation and let there be some mind of a judicial type operating, if there is going to be such a thing as a raid on houses or the arrest of a national arising out of some part of the operation of this.</P>

      <P>It is strange that the Deputy should have all these qualms now.  He was operating all these powers up to 1931.  I suppose he will say that we are introducing permanent legislation but I would ask him what particular abuses suggested themselves to him at that particular time that he thinks it necessary to safeguard the future against action by Ministers who may be in a position such as he was in?  It seems to me that these powers have existed.  They have not been unfairly used and I see no reason to apprehend that they will be unfairly used.  There is one point the Deputy has made which I think is of some substance and to which I am prepared to agree&mdash;that there should be some warrant for entering into a house and that it should be <Col N="113" /> provided in this Bill that an officer of the Minister or an officer authorised under the Bill can go before a district justice and obtain a warrant for search.  As matters stand, without an authorisation such as would be given under this Bill, the warrant could not be granted.  I cannot accept the deletion here, but I am prepared to meet that part of the Deputy's contention by inserting on the Report Stage an amendment which will provide that before the house of a citizen, or the house of an alien resident here, is searched by authorised officers, a warrant should be obtained from the district justice.  I cannot go any further now.</P>

      <P>I intend slightly redrafting this section on the Report Stage.  It would be better if we divided this into two parts, one part dealing with the general Aliens Orders and the second part dealing with deportation and exclusion orders.  In the case of the general Aliens Orders we can bring them before the House with the usual conditions that anything that was done under them, until they ceased to have effect, should be valid.  Deputy McGilligan is talking about war conditions and he has admitted that in the case of war, all these things go by the board.  There is no use in making provision for war conditions because the Executive Council of the day will take all the steps that are necessary, and if they are not able to get immediately from Parliament the necessary powers, they will take those powers in any case and look to Parliament afterwards to approve of their action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us know where we are.  The Bill as it now stands is giving the Minister power if and whenever he thinks proper to do all or any of a variety of things&mdash;to prohibit aliens from landing in or entering the Saorstát; to impose on aliens restrictions and conditions; to prohibit such <Col N="114" /> aliens from leaving the Saorstát; limiting such aliens to particular places or means of travelling or prohibiting them leaving particular places; directing the deportation and exclusion of aliens; requiring aliens to comply with the provisions of legislation and so on. If, and when the Minister thinks proper, he may impose by an Aliens Order &ldquo;such obligations and restrictions on the masters of ships entering or leaving Saorstat Eireann,&rdquo; with regard to the carriage of aliens and he may &ldquo;confer on officers of the Minister and the military and police forces of the State all such powers (including powers of arrest and detention and powers of searching persons and places) as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary for giving full effect to or enforcing compliance with such order.&rdquo;  That is the Bill presented. The Minister may, whenever he thinks proper, make an order and he can confer on himself, on the police, on the military and on the Customs and Excise officers, the powers of arrest and detention.  He may, under the same order, even arrest nationals and search premises and he can do that without bringing the order before the House.  That is a shocking situation and I was told on the last day we discussed the Bill that that was possible at the moment.  I deny it. Remember when this panic legislation came from Britain under the 1914 Act there was a preamble in the Bill which stated that the Minister may, in times of great national danger, do certain things in the way of arrest and detention. The 1919 Act extended that outside the period of national danger by saying &ldquo;for a period of a year further.&rdquo;  But then it went on to say &ldquo;that any order made under this Act during the currency of this section&rdquo;&mdash; that is during the year&mdash;had to be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament. Then if there was an address presented on the matter it could be annulled.  This Bill was sought to be got through on the last day by saying that there was nothing claimed in it for which there was not power already, so that when the Minister thought proper he could, without a search warrant, have a citizen's house raided by a <Col N="115" /> Customs Officer or an ordinary soldier or a member of the Gárda, not an officer, if he thought it was necessary to do that in order to get compliance with this order.  I put down amendment No. 16 here to say that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>During the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion the Minister may at his absolute discretion make and publish in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> an Aliens Order which shall take effect as from the date of such publication. Save and excepting such aliens orders so made and published during the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion every Aliens Order made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling such order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which such House has sat after such order is so laid before it such order shall be annulled accordingly.</P>
      <P>I am now told despite the claims that were made that our new freedom was no more restricted than the old freedom, the President is prepared now to bring in a section which will necessitate having the Aliens Order brought before the two Houses.</P>

      <P>If the Order is to come before the House the objection is that they are bound to give colour to the whole section and that the whole thing is a matter entirely for the discretion of the Minister.  If you are going to limit it by having certain things operate only when the district justice is satisfied, you must take out the section which is governed by the phrase &ldquo;if and when he thinks proper.&rdquo;  The section confers on the Minister the power to do all these things.</P>

It is simply a matter of conferring them if the Minister thinks it is right to confer them in order to ensure compliance with the order.

Surely there will be a civic guard officer in the neighbourhood or sufficiently handy?  Of course it does not matter a whole lot, but if you are going to give this power to such a numerous section as the guards and the military it makes very little difference if you put in Customs and Excise officers.

It came in in a later Act and at first I thought it was required if you are going to deport a man and you want to label him an Italian or a Turk or something in order to get him to his proper destination.  I understand the only power that can be operated is to put the man on board ship, selecting the ship having its first port of call a place nearest to where you want to get him.  In order to do that, you do not want to dub a man of a particular nationality.  Why should we take it into our hands to say of a man whom we are deporting that he is X, Y or Z nationality so long as we can class him an alien?</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>(1)  Every person who does any act, whether of commission or omission, which is a contravention of any provision of an aliens order made or deemed to have been made under this Act shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, and the court, before which such person is so convicted, may, either in addition to or in lieu of any such fine or imprisonment, order such person to enter into recognizances, either with or without sureties, binding such person to comply with the provisions or any of the provisions of any such aliens order.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every person who fails to comply with an order of the court, made under the foregoing sub-section of this section, requiring him to enter into recognizances, shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), line 29, and in <Col N="124" /> sub-section (2), line 40, to delete in each line the word &ldquo;summary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is also a point upon which I require information.  The section says &ldquo;shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100.&rdquo;  I am not sure if that is intended to mean that these matters will be for the District Court and only for the District Court.  Of course, other statutes have given the District Court power to inflict fines of a big amount.  But the persons here mentioned are no longer confined to aliens because a national can be brought up under this for helping to contravene an order.  I suggest that either the penalty be lowered, certainly for the first offence, or else that it be not compulsorily confined to the District Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the purpose of this is that if you did not have the word &ldquo;summary&rdquo; that of course you would have trial by jury under the Constitution.  We have this in many enactments and there is nothing extraordinary about it.  It is considered the proper procedure.  With regard to the amount of the fine, the Deputy will notice that it says &ldquo;a fine not exceeding £100.&rdquo;  The question is whether the amount is rather high.  On the whole, I think that in a case of this sort there ought to be a substantial penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The more important point is with regard to trial by jury because there is the right given.  There is the matter of giving the people the right to trial by jury for an offence of an important type.  Whatever may be done with aliens under this Bill, if nationals are to be brought up for contravening orders, some consideration ought to be given to the right that people ordinarily have of having an offence triable by jury.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not, of course, hold any longer to the rather curious statement he made the last day that there was some violation of the Constitution in this.  Of course, when the Bill becomes law the provisions of the Constitution will be complied <Col N="125" /> with.  The only point I think is whether the amount of the fine is not too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the fine indicates the gravity of the offence.  A fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months indicates the view taken by the State of the seriousness of the offence.  I do not care much what you do with aliens, but nationals can be brought up under this, I suggest; and if that is so, then I think that the spirit of the Constitution should be allowed to rule.  I have not argued that if and when this is law its being law can be alleged to be a breach of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my argument the last day.  I tried to explain that even in interjections.  I said that the Constitution guaranteed certain things, but that every one of them can be taken away by law, according to the latest judgments.  But if that is so, the attempt to take these things away by law certainly is not in accord with the spirit of the Constitution, whatever you may say about the legality of what happened or what has been achieved.  I say that the situation here is that there is an Article with regard to trial by jury.  I ask only for discrimination to be made between the trial of aliens and others. We are making new laws.  Let us walk warily with regard to our own citizens however ruthless we may be with regard to aliens.  There will not be very many cases I hope of citizens suffering under this.</P>

    <P>(2)  Save if and so far as may be authorised by a licence issued under this Act, it shall not be lawful for an alien to carry on or continue to carry on after the appointed day either alone or in partnership with another person or other persons any trade or business under any name or style other than the name or style under which such trade or business was carried on on whichever of the following days was the later, that is to say, the 6th day of December, 1922, or the day after the date on which such alien began to carry on (either alone or in partnership with another person or other persons) such trade or business.</P>
    <P>(3)  In the case of a trade or business carried on by two or more persons in partnership under a style or name which is substantially a combination of the respective names of such persons, no change in such style or name which is made in consequence of and substantially corresponds to a change in the membership of such partnership shall be a change of such style or name for the purposes of the next preceding sub-section of this section.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first sub-section of Section 7 tells us that, except by licence, it shall not be lawful for an alien to assume any name other than the name by which he was ordinarily and usually known on certain dates.  We leave that and get on to the second sub-section, which <Col N="127" /> says that it shall not be lawful for an alien, either alone or in partnership, to carry on any trade or business under any name or style other than the name or style under which such trade or business was carried on on certain dates.  I suggest that if you take the first case and apply the Registration of Business Names Act you have got all that is required.  In other words, if you insist that aliens will go by their own names, and if you then insist that businesses will be carried on in such a way that the actual names of the people engaged in the business are shown on the notepaper and on the circulars, then you have got all that you want.  That is why I want to delete these sub-sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things involved here.  There is first of all the change of name, which shall not be done except by licence.  Then there is the further provision under which they shall have to register the change of name.</P>

      <P>Again, I think this is separate legislation.  If it is supplementary to existing legislation and if there is no contradiction between them, I see no harm in having it here.  It seems to me there is no contradiction. The only point the Deputy is making is that it may not be necessary.  It seems to me that it is necessary.  The change of name is independent.  He will have to do two things, to get a licence in order to change his name for other purposes, and, in the case of business he must have it registered.</P>

      <P>I think there is a growing view in this country that the more people are compelled to use their own names and prevented from going under hidden or disguised names, the better for every purpose&mdash;for coping with criminals, for publicity in business, and for knowing the people with whom one is dealing.  For having some better line to antecedents and credentials, there is a definite tendency and a growing conviction that the more people are compelled to go under their own names, without any licence to change, the better.</P>

      <P>But look at the mass of exceptions.  I think you should have a clean-cut situation.  I do not like the licensing provision at all, but it is there, and let us hope that it will be sparingly used.  You have the case of a man who bears either his original name or a name which he is licensed to carry.  I hope that the licensed name will be reported to the House and that we shall get it published.  Then we shall know the exact position with regard to individuals.  You propose by this Aliens Bill to achieve various things, but included in the Bill are sections which teem with restrictions and licences.  You have a variety of dovetailed phrases, and somebody interpreting this Bill afterwards will say: &ldquo;Look at the tendency of this. Is not the tendency entirely in the way of giving this right to get a little bit underground as far as carrying on business is concerned?&rdquo;  If you take the clear-cut case, the alien is only entitled to use such a name as will be given by licence.  That licensed name is going to be announced to the community by the Dáil.  Surely you erect, in that way for the courts who will interpret this Act, a definite signpost that aliens should be revealed as aliens and should be made to use their own names as far as possible.</P>

      <P>It seems the Deputy is viewing the Bill much in the same way as I view it.  I regard it as a <Col N="129" /> Bill which seeks to do what the Deputy wants.  The exceptions are there only to provide for cases of exceptional hardship, or to prevent hardship which might be caused if the Minister had not this power.  It is intended that the Minister should have power to deal with an exceptional situation.  Surely the Deputy does not suggest that the exceptional powers are intended to be freely operated, otherwise there would be no sense in having a restriction clause?  A moment ago the Deputy was talking about the harshness of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Bill is one that is meant to be a severe Bill.  It is intended to be such.  All the exceptions that are provided for here are only intended to give the Minister power to meet an exceptional situation which may possibly arise.  He wants to be empowered to meet such exceptional situations and to have this discretion, but the whole tendency is that that discretion should be sparingly used.  I do not think that for a number of years past there has been very much use of the discretionary power.</P>

Let us take a group of three consisting of two aliens and a national who want to carry on a business a month after this Bill passes.  They start business and call themselves &ldquo;Murphy and Sons.&rdquo; They have that title on the first day they start and they can therefore continue to carry on.  But supposing that <Col N="131" /> two people break up that business, that it goes into liquidation, or that they sell out and dissolve a partnership, and that five aliens are got in with an Irishman, if they want to start a month later as &ldquo;O'Shaughnessy and Company&rdquo; can they not do so?

Supposing they dissolve partnership.  It may be a business of a localised purpose in which two are left with certain moneys. They want more people and get in three others and an Irishman and they start as &ldquo;O'Shaughnessy and Company.&rdquo;  That is the name they gave the business the day they started. I do not think the phrase carries out what is meant.  What is meant is continuity of business but that is not clear from the terminology.

      <P>No.  For instance, there is power of deportation.  The Minister has ample powers to deal with exceptional cases of the kind mentioned. I am afraid you cannot possibly end abuses by legislation that will anticipate everything that people will do.  That is one reason why it is essential that the Minister should have very wide general powers, and that is why we are trying to meet exceptional cases.  You cannot possibly arrange that with ingenuity you will be able to do so by legislation.  Any legislation we have will hardly stop every avenue. The only way is to give large powers to the Minister to deal with exceptional cases.  If the Deputy had put it in an amendment to deal with one particular class or with some of the possible evasions we might see if it could be done.  It seems to me that the main task to have in mind is to see that in such business you will not have continual changes.</P>

I do not want to give power, if I can help it, to a person to be allowed to carry on under what, I think, are the rather loose ties imposed on aliens in business in partnership.  In the case of an application to the Minister, the proposal is to allow an alien to use something even beyond what we have allowed in the preceding section.  Why should that be granted simply because this deals with an alien who desires to carry on under a style and title prohibited by the previous section.  I want to know why he should be allowed to apply to the Minister for a licence to continue to use an otherwise prohibited style and title.  This was a point that was raised on the last occasion by Deputy Norton, and he got a rather insufficient reply to it. Would the President say what it is intended to meet?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934/35&mdash;(Deputies O'Higgins and O'Donovan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Motion which is before the House to-night could not, in my opinion, be framed in a better setting than it is at the present time. The conditions that apply all over the country with regard to local authorities, the position of the farming community, the position in respect of uncollected annuities&mdash;in fact, the general condition of the country&mdash;demand that some steps be taken&mdash;must be taken&mdash;to deal with the present state of affairs.</P>
      <P>From time to time I have had opportunities of reading reports of various local authorities all over the country, and all I can say is that they make very sad and very doleful reading at the present time.  For some time past the finger-posts have been all directed towards a state of affairs such as exists now, but I do not think that anybody anticipated that it would come so soon. I do not think that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health thought last year that he would be confronted with such a situation as that with which he finds himself confronted to-day.  Last year, when local authorities were framing their estimates the Minister for Local Government and Public Health felt quite buoyant over the situation.  To-day the local authorities have got notices from the Local Government Department that they must delay the rate estimate; that they are not yet in a position to make out how much of the agricultural grant will have to be deducted, and consequently they cannot make up their rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Motion really only asks, in effect, that there ought to be no rates asked for during the period of the economic war.  That is really what it amounts to.  I think that no fairer or <Col N="139" /> no more righteous request could be made, particularly if we consider the statements made by responsible people on the opposite benches before they came into power.  One wonders occasionally what it was that prompted the President to make the statements he did about derating if he did not believe in it; and if he believed in it in 1932, surely to goodness it ought to be making some impression on him to-day. Personally, I think that if we had derating in this country&mdash;if we had complete derating, and if it was part of the policy of the Government and part of the system in the country that we had derating&mdash;it is quite possible that we would have to alter our local government methods.  It is quite possible. I do not know, however, that that struck the President in 1932.  In 1932 the President, speaking down in Kells, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmer's burden required to be lightened, and it could be effectively done if they retained at home the £3,000,000 of land annuities which were now needlessly being sent over to England every year. Two millions of the three would give complete derating to all agricultural holdings, big and small, and to the farm buildings as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder what became of that promise. I wonder would Deputy Corry be able to tell us about that promise.  I mention Deputy Corry specially because I am going to give him special attention later on.  Deputy Corry made a speech at a meeting of the Cork County Council, which was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on April 6th, 1932. That is a long time ago.  It was before Fianna Fáil had really felt the responsibilities of Government.  They were just in at the time.  Deputy Corry, of course, was not as well up as the President was, because, when the President got in in April, 1932, what he said was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have definitely pledged ourselves that at least £2,000,000 of the £3,000,000 a year collected in land annuities will be used for the benefit of the farming industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a way out.  The President was looking for a way out then, but <Col N="140" /> Deputy Corry was not.  Deputy Corry was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 6th April, 1932, as having said, amongst other things:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The annuities will certainly go to complete derating.  Every pledge we gave is going to be honoured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how does Deputy Corry regard that pledge to-day?  Now, no matter what speech we take up at that period&mdash;whether it is Deputy Corry, whether it is the President, whether it is the Minister for Defence, whether it is an election poster&mdash;we find them all plastered over with this idea of derating.  We are asking now for derating during the period of the economic war.  I wonder are we going to get it.  If President de Valera thought in 1932, or if Deputy Corry thought in 1932, that we could not get on without derating at a time when we were getting practically three times as much for the export of our live stock as we are getting to-day, I wonder what do we need now?  We need home assistance now.  We had an election poster issued in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> They even took advantage of that unnational paper, as they call it, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and they issued an advertisement.  This is the burden of that advertisement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With £2,000,000 of the £3,000,000 involved the farmers can be relieved completely of the rates of their holdings. Another £1,000,000 is available for the relief of taxation or for such purposes as the Dáil may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it were not a tragedy, would it not be a great joke?  What did Fianna Fáil do, when they came into power, to carry out their promises of derating? How did they treat the ratepayers? What was their attitude towards them? When they came into power in 1932, what did they do?  The grants which the county councils were then getting were very different from the grants they are getting now.  As a matter of fact, if I take the case of my own county council it will probably give a better idea of what happened.  When they came into power they threw £250,000 into the Agricultural Grant at the time.  That was the first gesture. They wanted to show what they could do.  They wanted to do something to <Col N="141" /> justify the things they had been saying. Roscommon's share of the Agricultural Grant that year was £75,000.  The following year, when Fianna Fáil had their first opportunity&mdash;their very first opportunity&mdash;of allocating the Agricultural Grant, they cut down our share in Roscommon to £61,000, and cut down every other county's share by a like amount.  They reduced the Agricultural grant by a sum of £448,000.  That was how Fianna Fáil kept their promises.</P>
    <P>Let no member of the Government Party try to get away with the view that if they did not give derating and stopped a proportion of the Agricultural Grant that their predecessors were giving they halved the annuities. They did not.  They doubled the annuities.  Deputy Corry knows that and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health knows it.  There is no use endeavouring to hide that fact. What has happened in regard to halving the annuities?  How has it affected the farmers?  The British say they have collected practically £5,000,000&mdash;£4,800,000 odd.  That is their account of the matter.  The President admitted on the adjournment debate before Christmas that the annuities were being paid to England, but against our will.  It means little, whether it is against our will or not, when they have to be paid; the money is gone anyway.  The net amount the farmers were responsible to England for was £3,000,000.  England is now collecting £5,000,000, and, in addition, our Government demands 50 per cent. of the annuities.  In spite of all that Fianna Fáil says they have halved the annuities.  That is how they have been halved.  They are at least double on the farmers of the country.</P>
    <P>On March 3rd, 1932, at a time when we were living in wonderful prosperity, in comparison with to-day, one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, Deputy Harris, had a motion at the Kildare County Council which was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of March 3rd for consideration.  That was before the Fianna Fáil Party came into power. The motion set out, among other things, &ldquo;the utter impossibility of the <Col N="142" /> ratepayers meeting any demand for rates during the coming year.&rdquo;  That was in 1932.  Immediately Deputy Harris found that his own people formed the Government he withdrew that motion.  He was right.  He knew what his men were made of even though Deputy Corry was saying that they were returned to redeem their promises.  What happened all these promises?  What was it that brought about the complete change of mind ? Or was it a change of mind, or only humbug, or a hoax thrown out to get votes?  I wonder what it was.  Whatever it was the Fianna Fáil Party took advantage of derating to get elected to this House and to become the elected Government of the country.  In 1931 our agricultural exports amounted to £18,329,669; in 1934 they dropped to £6,015,462.  And we do not want derating now, but we did want it when our exports were over £18,000,000.</P>
    <P>What is the real situation in this country?  I do not want to make any wild statements.  I have here before me estimates from counties other than my own county.  I have an estimate from the Offaly County Council, which has a majority of Fianna Fáil members, and of which a Fianna Fáil Deputy is chairman.  What do we find there ? Here is what we find.  In 1934, according to their estimates, they had a bill of £11,590 for home assistance as against £6,500 in 1931.  That is the improvement that has been brought about in this country under Fianna Fáil policy.  If they wanted derating in 1931 and 1932 when home assistance was £6,000 in Offaly, surely they want it now when home assistance is over £11,000.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I think the request embodied in this motion is a very modest one.  All these promises made by Fianna Fáil were probably part of the Plan and the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; having failed the promises went with it.  The &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; certainly failed.  I think the Minister for Local Government will admit that.  They had a plan to cure unemployment.  What has happened that plan?  If we go into the figure of unemployment we do not seem to be convinced that the plan has worked.  If I take up the Offaly County <Col N="143" /> Council again, presided over by a Fianna Fáil Deputy, what do I find ? He said the other day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is an advertisement published in every paper in the country asking the people to suggest ways by which the Government can reduce unemployment, and members of this Council would be well advised to put their suggestions before the Department dealing with the matter.  It is a very serious problem and it concerns everybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We agree.  I wonder what happened the &ldquo;Plan.&rdquo;  They are going out now searching the highways and the byways to make up for the loss of the &ldquo;Plan.&rdquo; Of course, if the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; has only been lost I am sure if the Government issued an advertisement it would turn up.  The £5,000,000 may turn up. Even so, I doubt if it would be of any use.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the Galway County Council.  What is the position in Galway ?  Take any of the county councils at random.  What is the position of the ratepaying community?  We had a meeting last October in Roscommon of the Finance Committee of the county council.  As a matter of fact, they were all of one mind in politics with the Minister, and the business they met for was to examine the refund lists.  The refund lists, as the Minister knows, are lists the collectors turn in of uncollected rates in the county.  Now the Finance Committee of the Roscommon County Council, in going through these lists came to the conclusion&mdash;and they were all Fianna Fáil members&mdash;that there was a certain amount of rates that should be wiped out as irrecoverable, and that a sum of £7,800 should be carried forward to the better times that were coming this year.  Some members of that county council were short-sighted enough afterwards to say it was the big men who were not paying their rates and annuities.  Mark you, that Finance Committee had its responsibilities and its obligations and I have no doubt whatever that they acted up to their responsibilities and to their obligations.  They could not, <Col N="144" /> and should not, have passed one single item of that as being carried forward unless they were convinced that the people were not able to pay.  They must first satisfy themselves that there was nothing there to seize and if there was, they should have ordered its seizure.  The money was not collectable then.  Why was it not collectable? Let Fianna Fáil answer that.  It is a pity the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here to tell us, as they told us at the end of last year, that on every side we had evidence of prosperity.  I wonder has the Minister for Local Government evidence of prosperity. Certainly, we have not got it.  Galway County Council, as reported in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of 2nd February, 1935, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The demands for home assistance have been steadily increasing and the estimate of £17,500 for the coming financial year is the highest on record.  In 1927, the figure was as low as £10,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is from Galway.  There was another statement from the West Cork Board of Health.  The West Cork Board of Health was in a bad way, according to the <i>Southern Star</i> on 2nd February, 1935.  Deputy Corry probably knows all about that.  According to the report in that paper, they were in a very bad way and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;unless the board received money immediately from the county council, home assistance payments would have to stop next week because the overdraft would then be exhausted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the county council had none.  The whole country, so far as the local authorities are concerned, at the present time is living on overdrafts. How long they can continue is a matter for speculation.  I have here a very interesting statement from a very strong, stout and stern supporter of Fianna Fáil&mdash;the chairman of the Westmeath County Council.  The chairman, according to the <i>Longford Leader</i> of 26th January, 1935, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The county council find it very hard to get in the rates and the board of health has no money to pay either home help or the officials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> Now are we justified in asking for derating?  At the same meeting, the secretary of the county council, Mr. Roche, in discussing the rate collectors and whether they had done their duty or not, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sheriff took cattle recently for rates and after feeding them for a week he had to return them as he could not sell them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That discloses a very bad state of affairs in this country.  In addition to all that, we are threatened now with the withholding of our grants for the non-payment of the annuities&mdash;the annuities which have been halved. Surely to goodness, if there is that prosperity in this country which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce can see, the people ought to be well able to pay the annuities, which have been halved.</P>
    <P>I have here reports from the Kerry County Council, the Clare County Council and the Wexford County Council, together with a very illuminating resolution passed by the Wexford County Council&mdash;a gloriously illuminating resolution, passed, of course, by a Fianna Fáil majority.  This is the resolution:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a list of ratepayers owing three years' rates&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how did they manage to carry on for three years without paying rates?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>Apparently, your crowd did not collect them when they were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that so ?  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  Does the Deputy know the procedure?  Does he know what has to be done with the refund lists?  He does not ?  They have to be returned to the Minister for Local Government and he has been in office since 1932.  The 1932 rate, the 1933 rate and the 1934 rate represent three years' rates.  My friend, Deputy Mulcahy, was not there at all.  It is a miscalculation of the Deputy's.  The resolution set out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a list of ratepayers owing three years' rates and who hold farms of a poor law valuation of £30 or over be prepared and furnished to the <Col N="146" /> Land Commission, with a recommendation that if annuities in these cases are also in arrear for two or three years, the Land Commission should consider the advisability of taking over those farms and handing them over to persons who are prepared to work them.</P>
    <P>That is from a member of the county council in Wexford.  If those people did their duty or if the Minister did his duty, he would not pass a single refund list on which anybody appeared who was able to pay his rates two or three years ago.  That is his job; that is what he is there for.  Members of the county council have a certain responsibility of their own, but the Minister has his.  The county council in Wexford &mdash;whoever they were, I do not know&mdash; passes refund lists, and after they have been approved by the Minister&mdash; evidence that they were not able to pay &mdash;the council comes along and says: &ldquo;We ask the Land Commission to take the land off these poor people whom the county council has decided are not able to pay their rates.&rdquo;  That is the position.</P>
    <P>Of course when Fianna Fáil came in we had a great flourish of trumpets with regard to the number of people who were going to be employed on the land as a result of innovations in the application of a certain amount of the grants for employment.  Of course, as was admitted afterwards by the Minister, it was no more than a gesture, and a very poor one.  It was a very poor gesture indeed because, taking all in all, the amount gained by the farmer by way of relief of rates for employing one labourer the year round at 25/- a week was too small to induce him to employ labour.</P>
    <P>Mind you, the administration of these innovations was very costly.  The county councils were asked first to prepare lists consolidating all the ratings belonging to the same people under £10 and then, to put into operation a credit note system.  That has been in operation now for three years.  It started at the end of 1932, after Fianna Fáil had come in, and they gave £250,000 to be administered by way of credit note.  It cost the County Roscommon over £1,100 in the three <Col N="147" /> years to make out the accounts necessary to administer the Minister's innovation.</P>
    <P>That is what it comes to and it means a corresponding amount for each county council.  And what was the net result of it?  As far as the employment of labour was concerned it was, in my opinion, nil.  Take the case of the Roscommon County Council, where £7,800 have been carried forward this year. That sum has been carried forward against people who are not able to pay it.  That is the contention of the Finance Committee, and I believe they are right.  Whatever number of people that £7,800 represents, in the way of arrears of rates those people have lost their credit notes.  These notes are not operative.  Instead of having carried forward against them the amount that they owed, less the credit note which ought to have been given in the proper way, the whole amount is carried forward against them.</P>
    <P>I drew the Minister's attention to this already and I think that it is an absolutely unfair method of dealing with the matter.  The county councils are free or otherwise to adopt the credit note scheme.  I do not think a perusal of the accounts of the county councils to-day, taking one with another, and considering the councils that have had credit notes in operation, the county councils that have no credit notes in operation, and county councils that have two and some of them three credit notes in operation, would convince one that the system has been an inducement to the people to pay.  The councils that were always foremost in paying up are still foremost and those that were always last are still last, irrespective of whether they had credit notes or not.  But the unfortunate people who cannot pay their rates have those rates carried forward against them.  These people are the victims of the credit-note system.</P>
    <P>I think that the motion down in the names of Deputies O'Higgins and O'Donovan is a motion to which the Government ought to give their closest attention.  It is the type of motion on which the members of the Fianna Fáil Party when on this side of the House <Col N="148" /> waxed very strongly.  That was in the time when the country was prosperous &mdash;before they went into power.  Now we do not hear anything about it.  I would like the Minister for Local Government and Public Health seriously to consider, if he has not already done so, what steps he proposes to take&mdash;if he does not have derating&mdash;in order to meet the present situation in the country.  If the alarm created by the Minister for Finance with regard to the grants is going to be fulfilled and if these grants are withheld, I wonder how it is expected that we are going to carry on?</P>
    <P>We will be told, of course, that the farming community can pay their rates if they grow wheat, if they grow beet and if they cut turf.  But if they have cattle, no.  There is no profit in cattle and there was not before Christmas.  When the quota motion was discussed here immediately before Christmas there was no room in Britain for another beast of ours according to the Minister for Defence. Not a bit of room.  No additional beast could be got in.  That market was wanted absolutely for the British cattle.  It was an extraordinary thing afterwards, and I am very glad of it, that the Minister and his party found that there was quite a lot of room in Britain for our cattle.  Not alone that but they also found that it would not impair our patriotism to burn British coal.  That was an extraordinary change.  If it does not impair our patriotism to burn British coal, it should not impair the Minister's patriotism if he said to the President that he ought to live up to the promises which he made in 1932 and that if ever there was a case for derating in this country, conditions at the present time make that case water-tight. We have the sick, the poor and the needy to look after.  There are big responsibilities on boards of health. County councils have to take responsibility with regard to roads and other social services, and we are going to be saddled with new responsibilities. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health sat idly by whilst his colleague, the Minister for Finance, demanded that those local authorities, <Col N="149" /> who minister to the needs of the sick and poor, must in future pay stamp duty, a thing which the British Government never asked for because of the type of work which the local authorities had to do in maintaining public services.  It was because of these services that they were exempt from stamp duty.  Now why must the Minister for Finance come along and say that the rate collectors must stamp the receipts for the rates?  I wonder what does the Minister for Local Government and Public Health think about it?  I wonder what fight did the Minister make for his Department when that matter was brought on?  We have courthouses to build and we have provision to make for their maintenance. The county councils must build the courthouses which the county registrar demands.  But the councils must not have control of them.  According to the Bill before the Oireachtas they must not have the custody of them.  The county councils must build pounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The responsibilities of the local authorities are increasing, their expenditure is increasing; and their champion, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, or the man who ought to be their champion, does not budge while the Minister for Finance puts extra charges on them.  I think that anything I may say would not be nearly so eloquent in favour of derating as the present conditions in this country.  If the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Fianna Fáil Party look around them and if they will look at the demands on the various local authorities all over the country; the increasing demands for overdraft accommodation in the banks and the insistence of the Minister for Finance that the grants must be withheld, the Minister himself will be convinced that he must do something either by the way of derating or by some other measure in order to see that the local authorities are allowed to carry on.</P>

      <P>To be candid I feel rather nervous to-night in following such a very excellent speech by my colleague Deputy Brennan.  In rising to support this Motion I would like to have the opportunity of being able to debate this in a non-political atmosphere.  One would like, in dealing with a very important and very grave matter such as is embodied in this Motion, to be able to discuss it as a matter of urgent business.  But this institution is the last place in which to discuss business, whether it is good or bad.</P>
      <P>To-day, when we were considering the Land Commission Vote, I was interested to hear Deputy Lynch making a comparison between the previous Administration and this Administration in relation to placing new holders on recently divided land and in that comparison he indicated that the activities of the present Government made a very unfavourable comparison indeed.  One began to inquire as to the reason.  The more I listened to Deputy Brennan's speech to-night, the more did I become convinced that land to-day is a liability and instead of being a means of earning great national revenue it is to-day a means of hurrying many into a state of bankruptcy.  Even if tremendous relief were given to-morrow by the Government towards rates in different counties, that would not prevent many farmers from going to the wall within the next six or twelve months.  I wonder is there any relationship between that state of affairs and the fact that so few people are anxious to earn their livelihood by the land at the present time?  I wonder if the rates liability and the diminished earning capacity are the deciding factors that are keeping our people from seeking occupation on the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who are observant are aware that in country districts the young people are rapidly leaving in order to make their way towards the cities and large towns.  Why are they leaving their own native areas and heading for the towns?  The fact is that there is nothing to be gained by remaining on the land; they cannot make a decent livelihood there; there <Col N="151" /> is no future for them on the land.  The average holding is only capable of giving a livelihood to the father and mother and perhaps one or two of the children.  As a matter of fact, they can eke out only an existence, not a livelihood. In what way can this situation be remedied?  Can it be done by relief of rates?  Certainly not.  Relief of rates would be merely a crumb on the table, so to speak.  This is an appeal to the Government, put forward in a business way, in a non-political way, to come to the rescue of the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>I believe that the bounty system will have to be reinvestigated.  The millions we hear of will have to be applied in some other fashion&mdash;for instance, in some manner so that they will go towards the relief of rates.  I am quite convinced that a business man, if permitted to investigate the whole position of the bounty system, would agree that the bounties would be better allocated if given to the farmer in the form of relief of rates.  There should be some effort made towards complete derating during the period of the economic war.  I believe if a serious effort were made in that direction it would be of tremendous help to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>At the present time we find local authorities, who have a big say in the handling of rates, more interested in politics than in anything else.  Some months ago we had an election for urban and county councils and representatives were elected whose primary duty it is to look after the poor and sick and to control local affairs generally.  Insteal of looking after that business, we have them repeatedly fighting out political matters pure and simple.  The result is that at the present time there is more attention paid to politics, political clap-trap and political kudos than to the all-important question of how most economically to administer local affairs. I think it is time that the county and urban councils should be advised to attend to their affairs in a more business-like way.  If they did such grave motions as this would not have to be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> The rates at the present time are intolerable.  They are crushing farmers out of existence.  Numerous homesteads throughout the country are seriously affected.  The funny thing is that those who are most crushed are the people who have least to say.  It is a galling thing for a public man who endeavours to invoke assistance for these unfortunate people to find himself accused of trying to make political capital out of it and of sponsoring and encouraging a non-ratepaying campaign.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises the serious condition of affairs that exists. Times were never harder.  The household budget of the small farmer is gravely affected.  The large farmer, if a farmer be regarded as large by reason of the property he holds, is in many instances worse off than the small man. They are both struggling to make ends meet.  The Minister is a sensible man, and I sincerely hope he will have the situation examined so as to see what relief can be given.  I am quite certain he will realise that what I am saying in support of my colleague Deputy Brennan is perfectly true.  He will understand, I am sure, that my attitude on this question is not prompted by any reason except the good of the community whether in the towns or in the rural districts.</P>
    <P>In my area it has been found very difficult to collect the rates, and it will surprise Deputies to know that, despite all that has been done by the Government, the cultivation of beet has done very little towards helping to relieve the situation in regard to rates.  In many instances, in addition to the low prices obtained for cattle and agricultural produce, farmers found that their cheque for the beet, with which they hoped to be able to pay their rates, barely covered the artificial manure guarantees and the advance that the factory had given.  Never in my recollection have conditions been so bad in the intensive tillage area from which I come.  Everybody knows that the sugar beet factory was established in that part of the country to help the farmers owing to the big drop in the price of grain, and the farmers looked upon it <Col N="153" /> as one of the great stand-bys to help them in that way.  Unless better conditions prevail, and a better price is forthcoming for beet, the rates position will be far more acute than it is, and instead of asking for relief in this way, this House will have to demand remission of rates altogether and the giving of subsidies to the farmers; and that will be known as national home assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been rather disappointed with this debate up to the present.  The Motion on the Order Paper is:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that, owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-35.</P>
      <P>It does not ask for derating, neither does it ask for relief of rates during the economic war; but for relief of rates during the current year.  I should like to see this motion debated within those limits, although what has been said in dealing with it in a wider way has been very interesting and all quite true.  But the only way to get hold of a slippery adversary is to tie him down to narrow limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for derating was made before the advent of the economic war. It was accepted by the then Opposition Party, now the Government, as a necessity to keep agriculture on its feet.  Apart from the conditions that warranted derating before, with the economic war an entirely new situation arose which has not been met by the Party which claimed that agricultural land should be relieved from rates even before that situation arose. Whether a good or bad case existed for derating prior to the economic war, I shall apply my argument to the demand for relief of rates during the economic war.  After the special grant given in 1931-32 of £750,000, a sum of about £1,500,000 or £1,700,000 would entirely meet the bill for rates on agricultural land.  It has been mentioned that the present Government as a gesture threw in £250,000 during the year 1932-33, but where did they get it? <Col N="154" /> To provide the £750,000 given in 1931-32 new taxes were imposed of ½d. per lb. on sugar and 4d. per gallon on petrol.  During that year these taxes were producing only for eight or nine months but they produced sufficient to cover the £750,000.</P>
    <P>When the present Government came into office in 1932 those taxes were there producing not for eight or nine months, but for 12 months; and, as can be verified by reference to the sugar and petrol consumption, those taxes during that 12 months provided from £1,100,000 to £1,200,000.  So that the new taxation imposed to provide a special grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land gave the present Government in the year 1932-33, when they gave an increased grant of £250,000, bringing the special grant up to £1,000,000, a profit on the transaction of from £100,000 to £200,000. Those taxes are still producing from £1,100,000 to £1,200,000 per year.  The taxes imposed for the extra agricultural grant in 1924-25 are also still producing revenue, as are the taxes imposed to meet the £600,000 of the original agricultural grant.  The present Government are getting the benefit of all these taxes.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, let us see what are the special conditions created by the economic war.  Our Government refused to pay a sum of something less than £5,000,000, if we deduct the sinking fund for certain debts, to the British Government.  The British said they would collect that amount and they set about collecting it.  In the year ended 31st March last, the British collected off agricultural produce £4,372,622.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Local Government that that sum covers land annuities and rates.  And agriculture paid it all.  I am not going to deal with the annuities side of the question at all.</P>
    <P>Besides the annuities, there were other payments to the British which, I think, can be bulked under the two headings of local loans payments and pensions.  They would amount to about £2,000,000.  They were provided for our Exchequer prior to the economic war by certain taxes.  They were paid out <Col N="155" /> of our revenue here to the British. Since the present Government came into office these same taxes have been providing this £2,000,000 odd for the Exchequer.  There has been no reduction in taxation because of the fact that this £2,000,000 is no longer paid to the British, although we were told on thousands of platforms, and on as much paper as would cover the country, that once the present Government came into office this payment would not be made to the British and that there would be a corresponding relief in taxation. There has been no relief in taxation. That £2,000,000 is yet being paid by the taxpayers into our Exchequer, and it is not paid to the British.  Yet the British get it.  How do they get it? They have attacked our Government through the farming community.  The British Government was not able to come here and put their hand in the till, so to speak, to take out the £2,000,000 and say: &ldquo;This is our money.  We are taking it away whether you like it or not.&rdquo;  No, they did not do the job in that way.  They imposed taxation on agricultural produce going into Britain and collected every penny of that debt.  From whom?  From the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>The position boils itself down to this: that our Government collected £2,000,000 from the taxpayers to meet a certain obligation.  They said they would not meet that obligation, but the party to whom the obligation was due took £2,000,000 from the farmers of this country in respect of that obligation. Our Government then says: &ldquo;Very well; sure it is only the old farmers from whom you are taking it.  What about it?  We have the £2,000,000 and it will help us to balance our Budget. It will help us to supply free milk, to straighten corners, to talk of wheat, beet and peat to people who know nothing about them.&rdquo;  They collected that money to meet a certain obligation which they did not meet.  The party to whom that obligation was owing came then and seized the goods of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>This Motion simply asks that farmers be recouped for the money which has <Col N="156" /> been seized from them, to pay a debt which the Government had already collected but had not paid.  It asks that the farmer be recouped by our Government for money which they have collected under false pretences or for the value of the goods which have been seized from the farmers by the British Government.  That is the whole case as I understand it.  I should like the Minister for Local Government to say why that money was collected here to pay a debt when that debt was not paid.  I must not be misunderstood when I say &ldquo;to pay a debt.&rdquo;  I do not want to say that the Government should pay that as a debt, but the money was collected.  If that payment had not been made to the British in the years prior to the present Government coming into office, quite obviously the taxation of this country would be £2,000,000 less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Give me a more convenient word and I shall use it.  It was a payment that was made to the British.  Why does our Government not reduce the national taxation because of the retention of that money? What have they done with that £2,000,000.  Say, that I owe a man £10 and I say I will not pay it.  Somebody takes the amount out of a company of which I am a member and we cannot prevent his doing that.  Must not I in honour, recoup that company?  I do not know about the legal side of it.  I shall not bother about that because we have quite a number of lawyers on all sides of the House to go into the legal aspect of it.  I am not going into it, but in honour, am I not bound, if another person pays a debt for me, to recoup the friend who pays it?  That is the whole proposition.</P>

As the object of the Motion is to give the farmers of Leix-Offaly a chance to pay decent wages I hope the Deputy will go into the right Lobby this time.  It must be some of the far-seeing butchers in Leix-Offaly who were heard to say that they bought 100 head of cattle before the prices were fixed.

Obviously the Deputy mentioned them in order to show that they were a complete set-off to the amount the British are collecting on our exports.  The bounties for the year under review amounted to £2,000,000, but the British collected special duties amounting to £4,500,000.  I am sure the Deputy and his colleagues will appreciate that the £2,500,000 of a difference represents what agriculturists lost, because the <Col N="159" /> £2,500,000 were knocked off the wholesale prices of agricultural exports and about fifty-fifty of what was consumed in the home market.  The Deputy will appreciate that producers lost £2,500,000 on the export surplus and an equal amount on the home market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the replies I received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to-day lacked not only the information that I felt I was entitled to as a Deputy, but were so far short of the ordinary courtesy which we feel we are entitled to, that I have been obliged to ask the indulgence of the Chair and the House in an endeavour to get information out of the Parliamentary Secretary, which is essential for the County Councils of Roscommon and Galway.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that I should relate, briefly, the facts in connection with the River Suck.  The maintenance works were in the hands of the River Suck Drainage Board previous to 1926.  Those drainage boards were, I understand, set up under some special Act of Parliament and the Board of Works had no authority over them.  No Government department had.  In the year 1926 representations were made to the Board of Works that not alone was the River Suck Drainage Board neglecting its duty by failing to do necessary work on the river and its tributaries, but that it was charging the people living along the banks of the river with a drainage rate.  As a result of the representations made, the Board of Works ousted this drainage board and proceeded to restore the works on the River Suck at a cost of £16,000 or £18,000.  The drainage ratepayers were not acquainted of this at all, but notification was sent to the County Councils of Roscommon and Galway that such restoration work was about to take place, although at the time these Councils had no responsibility whatever with regard to this river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to their charging order, <Col N="161" /> the Board of Works spent £18,825 5s. 3d. on restoration work on the River Suck and its tributaries.  Thirty per cent. of that was to be a free grant, the remainder to be paid by the ratepayers on the River Suck.  I am not able to give the correct date as to when the work was completed by the Board of Works, but I think it was about the end of 1927 or early in 1928.</P>

      <P>It was started, however, in 1926 or in 1927.  When the Board of Works, as they understood, finished their job, they quit.  Neither the Board of Works nor the River Suck Drainage Board took any responsibility for the future maintenance of the river. That position continued from 1929 to 1933.  Then the Board of Works woke up.  The first thing they did, before issuing the charging order and making out the schedule, was to decide that of this sum of £18,000 which they had spent on the river £13,179 15s. 9d. was to be payable by the ratepayers.  They charged interest, calculated over a number of years, on this sum of £13,000 odd, against the ratepaying community on the River Suck.  The interest charge amounted to £4,508 9s. 2d., and this was added to the £13,179 odd.  So that instead of charging the people living on the banks of the River Suck with the payment of the sum of £13,000 odd, they have been charged with the payment of practically £18,000.  According to the charging order, the exact figure is £17,688 4s. 1d., an increase of over 34 per cent. upon this ratepaying community, for which I hold they have no responsibility whatever, and for which no work has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the County Councils of Roscommon and Galway, they endeavoured to get this matter settled up. They had no responsibility whatever for the payment of this sum of money but they were informed that a charging order was made out and that the care of the works would be turned over to them by the Board of Works.  On two occasions deputations were appointed to attend at the Board of Works in Dublin to endeavour to settle up outstanding <Col N="162" /> matters with relation to the River Suck, the outstanding matters being that, originally, there was a drainage board which had responsibility, which had assets and liabilities, the liabilities exceeding the assets. The question for consideration was: If the Board of Works hand this river and its maintenance over to the county councils, who is going to be made responsible for the liabilities of the old drainage board?  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has taken up the attitude all along that that was the county councils' job &mdash;that, to use his own words, &ldquo;it was our funeral.&rdquo;  It was never our funeral until he made it our funeral, nor was it ever our job.</P>
    <P>I maintain that it is the business of the Government to straighten this thing out before they hand it over to the county councils.  Why should we be made the scapegoats in this, considering that we had no responsibility in the matter?  As I have said, we endeavoured as far as we possibly could to get the matter settled up.  We came up on two occasions to the Board of Works.  Certain proposals were put up but agreement could not be reached. The first proposal was that a contribution should be made by the county councils concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary promised that if they made a certain contribution he was prepared to approach the Government to have its contribution increased from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent.  We failed to get that through at either county council. Another proposal was put up by the Parliamentary Secretary to the effect that his Department would take over and discharge all the liabilities of the old drainage board, provided the two county councils put into operation the schedule and charging order which the Board of Works was about to make out.  We were not informed at that time that the schedule and charging order would include this sum of £4,500 odd, which was never spent there but which represented interest that had accrued during the period when nothing was being done on the river by anybody, and when the Board of Works had neglected to prepare its schedule and charging order.  In response to <Col N="163" /> that proposal, which, as I have said, was put up by the Parliamentary Secretary, the case made by the county councils was this: That over a period of years preceding 1926&mdash;from 1919 to 1926&mdash;the River Suck and its tributaries had got into a condition in which the Board of Works had felt compelled to spend £18,000 on restoration works, while from 1927 to 1933&mdash;a period of six years&mdash;the river and its tributaries were again neglected.  Nobody bothered their heads about it.  It was not the county council's business to do anything in connection with it during that period.  It was nobody's business.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the county councils naturally and, I hold, justly demanded that the Board of Works should put the river and its tributaries in order before it asked them to take them over. It took £18,000 to restore the works in 1927 or 1928, and it would take practically a like amount to again restore the works in 1933 due to the six years neglect that I have just referred to. The attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary was that the county councils must take the works over and be responsible for their future maintenance. The position that we found ourselves in was that the river had been neglected, flooding was occurring and various complaints were being made.  In view of all that the County Council of Roscommon has a very big responsibility in the matter because two-thirds of the charge is falling on our county.  We have quite a lot of ratepayers living there.  We find it very difficult to collect the ordinary rates and now we are being asked by the Department of Finance to put on a new rate&mdash;not alone a rate to bring in 70 per cent. of what they spent on the work but to increase that by 34 per cent. for interest.  In addition to that, we are to put on a maintenance rate and restore the river to what it ought to be.  How the county council could meet that demand, I do not know.  We did not find agreement on either of the occasions on which we came to the Board of Works to discuss the matter. We were quite prepared to put the charging order into operation, provided the river was put into condition for us. <Col N="164" /> But why we should be asked to take over responsibility for everybody's neglect is more than we can understand. On the 28th of April of last year, after both proposals had been turned down &mdash;one was that we should make a contribution and the other was that the Department of Finance, or the Board of Works, should accept responsibility for discharging all the liabilities of the old Drainage Board&mdash;and when we thought that negotiations were still proceeding, we were informed that we would now have to take over the river.  The terms of the letter were:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposal made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the representatives of the County Councils of Galway and Roscommon at the Conference held on the 14th October, 1933, is set out in our letter of 16th October, 1933, to the Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the proposal that they take over the responsibilities of the old Drainage Board.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This proposal has not been accepted by the councils and must, therefore, be regarded as having lapsed and is withdrawn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no solution arrived at but we got the charging order and the schedule setting out the charges on the people, which involved a sum of 34 per cent. in excess of that originally proposed. Roscommon County Council refused to comply and it is for the Minister for Local Government or somebody else to abolish the county council if he likes.  The county council refused to take over the River Suck or accept the charging order, which is an order under seal.  We are still in that position and will be until this question is settled.  The council passed a resolution drawing the attention of the Board of Works to the matter and asking to have a further conference.  On the 9th October, 1934, a letter was received, by way of reply to that resolution, from the Board of Works, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We beg to state that, as pointed out in our letter dated 25th July last, it is desirable, before suggesting a time and place for the proposed conference, that we should have an opportunity of considering the joint <Col N="165" /> proposals of the Galway County Council and your council in connection with the outstanding matters requiring adjustment.  We must request, therefore, that your council will co-operate with the Galway County Council in that matter and furnish a statement of the specific proposals which the joint deputation will submit for consideration.  On receipt of this statement we will suggest alternative dates for the reception of the joint conference.</P>
    <P>That was sent on the 9th October last. The Roscommon County Council got into communication with Galway County Council.  Deputations were appointed by both councils.  These deputations met and considered the question on the 26th October, 1934. The representatives of Roscommon County Council were: Donal O'Rourke (chairman), J.F. Ansbro, and Matt Davis&mdash;all tried and true Fianna Fáil people.  Galway Council was represented by Deputy Mark Killilea, John Cunningham, and Peter Colleran.  A report of that meeting, held at Ballygar on 26th October, was sent to the Department of Finance or Board of Works on 29th October.  Only three days after I put down my question last week was there a reply to that communication. The River Suck is still flooding and the whole business has left a very bad taste in our mouths. The way in which the Board of Works has dealt with our suggestions and correspondence and treated our deputations is symbolic of the truculence with which the Parliamentary Secretary endeavoured to answer me to-day.</P>
    <P>When I put those questions to-day I was genuinely interested in getting information for my county council. The question was before the county council yesterday but we could not decide with regard to the striking of a rate.  We do not know where we are and the rates are accumulating against these poor people&mdash;rates that have been increased by the Board of Works by 34½ per cent.  When I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance if penal interest to the amount of £4,000 was being charged against these people, his reply was that no penal interest was being <Col N="166" /> charged.  I asked him if interest to that amount was being charged and he refused to answer.  I hope he will give us the information now and that he will go further and explain what he proposes to do.  Both county councils have met at various times and endeavoured to find a solution of the matter. It is not good enough for any Government Department to say that a 1924 or 1925 Act gives them the right to do this and that the local people have got to bear the burden.  Not alone do they say that but they say that interest must be borne by these people to the amount of £4,500 in respect of the money advanced.  There is absolutely no justification whatever for that charge because that interest accrued not through the negligence of anybody on our side but through the negligence of the Department of Finance or the Board of Works.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying that in a woman's letter the only thing that matters is the postscript. All the talk of the Deputy led up to this: (1) that there is a law which they have refused to obey and (2) that that is a law which was passed by Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;&ldquo;a rotten law,&rdquo; according to them.  He goes on to the assertion that the cause of all the trouble was the neglect of the Department of Finance or the Board of Works under Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;a rotten Government, a rotten law, and a rotten administration.  That is the Deputy's whole case in relation to the Suck.  His whole case is that we have come in and, among other things, have taken over from them the Suck.  There are quite a few others in which precisely the same allegations are made.  It is not for me to deny them.</P>

There is nothing discourteous about that any more than there was anything lacking, <Col N="167" /> either in courtesy or frankness, in accusing the Board of Works of a grossly illegal act and in the attempt illegally to extract money.  The Deputy's question was to ask the Minister for Finance&mdash;so on and so on&mdash;if it includes a sum of £4,508 penal interest; and the Deputy said that, although he had had the charging order in his hands and although he professed to know what he was talking about.  There is all the difference in the world between punishment and being asked to pay a legal debt.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talked for quite long enough.  If he had sat down without saying the last sentence, he would have been a lucky man.  Penal interest can only be charged in relation to instalments which are in arrear, and no money has been charged with that, and the Deputy ought to know it. If the Deputy knew what he was talking about, he must have known that in putting down that question he was putting down an insinuation intended to create a prejudice for which there was no warrant whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show you.  We were ready to issue a charging order.  The Board of Works, as a continuing entity, was ready to issue the charging order on the 13th of July, 1932.  Any neglect was before that date.  But we did not issue it.  Why?  We did not issue it because we were asked not to.  Any neglect before 1932 belongs to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. Any delay after that was at the request of the Roscommon County Council. Any interest which accumulated before 1932, through neglect or otherwise, was the responsibility of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the facts.  Now we take the next thing.  Are they being charged in the form of interest anyway? Now, I have a good deal of sympathy with the two county councils engaged in this matter, but we are certainly not being met by Deputy Brennan nor <Col N="169" /> being helped out of the difficulty which was made by his Government.  Assume for a moment that we had been in a position to obey the law and hand over the drainage district immediately it was finished.  Then, the Roscommon County Council and the other County Council would have come immediately under the obligation of paying in the form of annuities all that has now accumulated in the way of interest.  In other words, what the Roscommon County Council is complaining of is that instead of paying its annuities they have kept owing them to us.  That is the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>

I do frankly recognise that those two counties did inherit from the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and its administration a difficult position, and I have done all that can be done to try to find a way of helping them.  I am prepared to continue to do so and I am prepared to tell the conference of <Col N="172" /> the two county councils, when we meet them, as I hope, at an early date, what that solution, as far as we can make it, is.  All I can say at the moment, however, is that there is not one penny of interest being charged up that is not laid down absolutely as imperative on us by the law of Cumann na nGaedheal.  There is not a single thing wrong in connection with the administration of the Suck at the moment that is not a heritage of the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration.</P>
