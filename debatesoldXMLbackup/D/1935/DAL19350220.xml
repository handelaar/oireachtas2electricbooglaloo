      <P>asked the President if he will state the names of the members of the Irish Free State delegation to the World Economic Conference of 1932, and if he will state whether they have presented a report to the Government, and whether it is the intention of the Government to publish that report, and if so, when; and if not, if he will state what are the reasons for withholding the report from publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question refers to the World Monetary and Economic Conference held in London in June, 1933, not 1932, as stated.</P>
      <P>Senator Joseph Connolly, Minister for Lands and Fisheries, was the Saorstát delegate at the Conference.  He was accompanied by Mr. Joseph Brennan, Chairman of the Currency Commission; Mr. J.W. Dulanty, High Commissioner in London; Mr. J.J. McElligott, Secretary, Department of Finance; Mr. John Leydon, Secretary, Department of Industry and Commerce; Mr. D. Twomey, Department of Agriculture; Dr. T.J. Kiernan, Secretary, Office of the High Commissioner in London, and Mr. A.W. Bayne, Department of Finance, as advisers and experts.  Mr. T.T. Cremins, Department of External Affairs, acted as General Secretary of the delegation.  A number of other delegates and advisers were appointed, but no occasion arose for their attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minutes of the proceedings were published daily during the Sessions in the Journal of the Conference, a complete set of which was sent to the Oireachtas <Col N="2058" /> Library on the 9th August, 1933.  In view of this fact and of the failure of the Conference to reach decisions on any of the major questions considered, no formal report has been presented by the Saorstát delegation, nor is it proposed to ask for one.  The remainder of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>Does it not appear an extraordinary thing that with such a substantial and expert deputation sent to an important Conference, a summary of the conclusions to be drawn from the discussions at that Conference was not presented to the Government by the delegation?</P>

      <P>asked the President whether any correspondence has taken place between the Government Information Bureau and any newspaper published in County Wexford with reference to news matter published; if any demand was made for the withdrawal of statements made in the newspaper in question, and if so, what was the reason for making such a demand; if any threat was used to <Col N="2059" /> withdraw Government advertisements if a contradiction of statements made was not published, and if it is one of the functions of the Government Information Bureau to undertake censorship of Irish newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In September last correspondence took place between the Director of the Government Information Bureau and the Editor of <i>The People,</i> Wexford, in reference to a false statement about a Department of State contained in the letter of the special correspondent in Dublin of that paper, published in the issue of September 15th.  The text of the entire correspondence was published in <i>The People</i> newspaper.  From it the Deputy will see that no threats were made by the Director of the Information Bureau, and that the Editor of the newspaper withdrew the false statement and expressed regret for its publication.</P>
      <P>It is not one of the functions of the Information Bureau to undertake censorship of Irish newspapers, but it is one of its functions to make available to the Press, so far as possible, accurate information regarding State activities, and to correct false reports harmful to the nation.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that, in this particular case, threats by innuendo, at any rate, were brought against a Wexford newspaper to prevent them in future from making whatever comment they wanted to make on the growth of unemployment in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no threats by innuendo or otherwise, as the Deputy will see from the correspondence. What was drawn attention to was an attempt to create a <Col N="2060" /> panic by suggesting that there was a panic in certain State departments.</P>

      <P>A Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of sites for the building of 1,000 cottages was made by the Tipperary (South Riding) Board of Health and Public Assistance.  I confirmed the order in so far as sites for 598 cottages were concerned and recommended the acquisition of alternative sites for 151 cottages in addition.  The Commissioner is at present engaged in arranging for entrance on the lands pending the fixing of compensation with a view to an early commencement of building operations. A loan of £180,000 has been applied for from the Local Loans Fund and the matter is at present before the Commissioners of Public Works.  An overdraft of £2,000 on housing capital account has been sanctioned to 31st March pending receipt of first instalment of loan.  No unnecessary delay will take place in starting the building of the cottages.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the applications of any deserving agricultural labourers living in condemned houses were rejected, unless the proposed sites were unsuitable or that some statutory requirement of the Labourers' Acts was not carried out, but if the Deputy furnishes particulars of the cases referred to in the question I will have inquiries made with a view to bringing the applications to the notice of the Commissioner administering the affairs of the Board.</P>

I do not propose to take any steps to alter this disqualification. Persons entitled to receive unemployment assistance are paid for every period, after the first week, during which they prove in the prescribed manner that they have been continuously unemployed, that they <Col N="2066" /> fulfil the other statutory conditions and are free from statutory disqualification; and from the commencement of payment they are paid at the full rate to which they are entitled under the Act.</P>

The number of such appeals lodged in the Dublin Employment Exchange, up to and including 9th February, 1935, was 1,641.  Of this number 1,525 had been lodged prior to the 1st January, 1935.  As appeals are filed for the country as a whole in the order in which they are received and dealt with in that order it is not possible, without considerable labour and expense which would not be justified by the result, to segregate for the purpose of analysis appeals lodged in the Dublin district and subsequently dealt with through the ordinary machinery.  I am, therefore, unable to say how many Dublin appeals are awaiting determination by the Unemployment Appeals Committee.  Every effort is being made to dispose of the appeals as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>It does not necessarily follow, however, that the determination of an applicant's appeal will improve his position under the Act.</P>

      <P>The application by Mrs. Margaret O'Donoghue, Rockview, Portlaoighise, Leix, for an award under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, in respect of the death of her son, Edward, was rejected because the Army Pensions Board reported that the death of deceased was due to disease not attributable to military service.  Before issuing their report, the Board fully considered all the medical evidence submitted in connection with the case.  The certified cause of death is &ldquo;appendicitis, general peritonitis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If, however, Mrs. O'Donoghue is in a position to produce evidence not already submitted, I will be prepared to have the case referred to the Board for further consideration in the light of such evidence.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I move: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The Bill is a routine measure.  It was prepared in the Department of Justice many years ago and is being introduced now because the need for it has increased.  It provides for the establishment and maintenance of pounds by local authorities.  The present legal position is most unsatisfactory, the principal statute dealing with the matter being the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1851.  That Act imposes on local authorities the duty <Col N="2087" /> of providing pounds on being so requisitioned by three or more justices of the peace, under the present practice by the district justice. The expenditure which may be incurred is limited to the sum of £10. The legislation is antiquated and is obviously unsuited for the present time.  The result is that in the great majority of counties the number of pounds is altogether inadequate; indeed, there are some counties in which no pound accommodation exists. Owing to the limitation of expenditure such pounds as are provided are quite unsuitable for the keeping of animals, especially during bad and inclement weather.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the provision of proper pound accommodation is obvious.  Pounds are required to facilitate the execution of court decrees with which the local ratepayers are vitally concerned and they are essential for the keeping of animals found straying on the public highways to the danger and the inconvenience of the legitimate users of these highways.  The present Bill provides that each local authority shall provide and maintain in its area such pounds as the county registrar, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, shall direct and it removes the present limited expenditure of £10 which, as I have stated, is quite inadequate.</P>

      <P>The measure so innocuously introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce takes on quite a different complexion for other people.  I should like to describe this as a Bill for the better provision of machinery for getting the accursed crowd out of the Government's way, to use the Minister for Justice's own nice phrase&mdash;a phrase upon which he started off on his Ministerial mission. The Minister tells us that there are not sufficient pounds in the country, and he is anxious to have pounds provided in which animals can be kept away from inclement weather. There certainly are not sufficient pounds in the country to meet the type of work that is being carried on at <Col N="2088" /> present by sheriffs under the direction of the Ministry and its policy.  The House was informed to-day that some aspects of the Ministerial policy as regards farmers are so peculiar that Government advertisements have to be refused to newspapers that will not boost that policy.  The farmers who are suffering under that particular kind of policy have now to provide pounds, out of what funds they can gather, the better to get themselves out of the way of the present Ministry.  There are not sufficient pounds in the country&mdash;admitted.</P>

      <P>I want to argue, as part of the Second Reading discussion on this, that in Offaly, for one place, there are sufficient pounds not to have the ratepayers further mulcted to provide pounds to meet a situation which one particular specimen can describe. The attitude of the Ministry is that when goods like these are seized pounds have to be provided for them; and it is unreasonable to impose, with penalties for all kinds of interference, a further burden on the ratepayers. Section 9 provides: &ldquo;Every person who damages or breaks into any pound or releases from or takes out of any pound any animals or cattle lawfully <Col N="2090" /> impounded therein; or uses violence, threats or bribes for the purpose of securing the release from or the taking away of any animal or cattle lawfully impounded in any pound; or uses violence, threats, or bribes for the purpose of inducing or preventing any person who has been appointed under this Act to be a pound-keeper or to be assistant to a pound-keeper from undertaking or executing the office of such keeper or assistant; or for the purpose of inducing any such person to execute the duties of such office, corruptly or negligently, shall be guilty of an offence under this section...&rdquo; Where a Bill contains a provision like that, with a penalty of £50, I think that Deputies are only discharging a public duty when they point out that at present it is possible for the sheriff to seize, at the instance of a rate collector, from a man to whom the county council owes £27 15s., these particular articles in respect of a claim that they have against him for rates for £25 5s. 11d., and that action of that kind is an incitement to violence and an incitement to interfere with pounds, goods in pounds, and the people looking after them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

I should like to ask the Minister if the Westmeath County Council under this Bill are going to be asked either to extend or improve the pound which already exists at Mullingar. At the present time the Ministry are not using it.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Ministry is such that they use a pound there which they have established for themselves inside barbed wire in the old military barracks.  This is a question which might very well be asked in the discussion of this Bill: who is to be responsible for accidents happening to beasts in these pounds?  On Saturday last, in respect of a land annuity of £7 10s., two cows and a calf were seized in Mullingar and put into the pound which the Ministry are providing for themselves there, declining to use the one provided by the county council.  It was found on Tuesday, when the auction took place, that both those cows had seriously injured their udders against the barbed wire.  They had not been milked for more than 24 hours, and the owner suffered to a large extent through a loss of value as a result of the serious injuries to those cows.  I should like to ask who is going to be responsible for damage that takes place inside those pounds in cases where cattle have been seized and taken away from the custody of the people who owned them.  The question that requires to be answered with regard to County Westmeath is why the present pound in Mullingar is not being used, and whether the ratepayers of County Westmeath are going to be mulcted for a further sum.</P>

      <P>In order to accommodate the cattle that his Government is seizing from the hardworking people of this country.  Why is he seizing those cattle?  Is it for his personal amusement, or is it because he is such an incompetent that he has reduced this country to a heap of ruins in the course of three years?  My argument is that it is because he is so incompetent as head of the Government of this country that it is impossible for the vast majority of the people of this country to meet their legal obligations in the ordinary way. The ordinary way would be to sell their produce in their ordinary markets, and, with the money they get, to pay their way.  Instead of that, we are going to provide pounds in every parish in Ireland.  Instead of allowing a man to go out and sell his cattle, or whatever he has, in the ordinary market, and discharge his obligations, we have such a case as Deputy Mulcahy referred to, where for a comparatively trifling debt&mdash;say, £25 or £26&mdash;£200 or £300 worth of property is going to be removed to the pounds to be provided under this Bill, and sold to the members of the secret police for half or quarter of their <Col N="2094" /> value.  That is a development which is introduced on a note of jocularity by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This at least may be said, that the Minister for Justice had not the indecency to come in and introduce it himself.  He knew perfectly well the issues that would be raised upon this Bill, and the moral that would be pointed.</P>

The Minister knows perfectly well also that if I was betrayed into an indiscretion in that matter it was with no intention of offering an insult to Mr. Ruttledge. I very much regret if he is temporarily indisposed.  In many ways this Bill may serve a useful purpose&mdash;not certainly the prime purpose set out on its face, but in bringing home to the people in every village where the Minister for Justice arrives with his mason to erect a pound what Fianna Fáil has done for the country.  I think our friends on the Fianna Fáil back benches, some of whom have been extremely industrious in interrupting, should rise and tell us now why it is that at this critical stage of the national progress, when we are marching with our heads erect towards the Republic, we have got to prepare for the Republic by erecting pounds in every parish in the land.  Perhaps Deputy Donnelly will tell us something about that or perhaps the Deputy sitting behind him can explain to us now the necessity for those pounds.  Why <Col N="2095" /> do we want those pounds?  What has happened in the course of the last two or three years that has made the pound accommodation of this country inadequate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a period in 1875 when there was a considerable growth in the pound accommodation of this country, and it took a long time to bring about a situation in which all those pounds fell into a desuetude in which they crumbled away, and in which they ceased to be a feature of the everyday life of the country because the people wanted to pay their way and were able to pay their way.  Why this recrudescence of pounds?  Is it because this country is being brought back to the same position in which it was in the seventies of the last century?  A good many people will begin to ask themselves whether that is the reason.  I suggest to the Deputies on the back benches of Fianna Fáil that it is the reason.  You want more pounds, and if you go on much longer you will want more and more pounds to accommodate the property of every citizen of this State, and it will not be Fianna Fáil's fault if those pounds will proceed to fall into the desuetude which their forerunners fell into 50 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this particular Bill for a number of reasons. One of the first and principal reasons is that the Minister has not told us what liability the various county councils are likely to incur under this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  At present a county council is liable for one or two pounds, which were quite adequate when they were built, but this Bill is going to make it incumbent upon county councils to provide pounds wherever the registrar demands them. It may be that we will have to have a pound for every parish or half-parish; <Col N="2096" /> and every one of these must be suitably equipped.  The Minister said that those we have in existence are inadequate.  If pounds are to be properly equipped for the keeping of dairy cows, seized in mid-winter, it is going to entail very heavy expense upon county councils.  I may mention, incidentally, that I was present at the sale two days before Christmas Day of six dairy cows which had been impounded in one of those pounds for five or six days, and I say the situation was absolutely deplorable.  These cows were kept in a pound during the most severe weather we have had this winter.  They were seized six days before Christmas Day and sold four days later.  Subsequently, three of these cattle aborted by reason of the treatment they received in the pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the reason you are going to vote against this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the policy I am going to vote against.  If suitable pounds are to be provided against such occurrences as I have mentioned they will have to be increased by 1,000, if they are to be adequate, and if we are to provide against the driving of dairy cows unsuitable distances both in mid-winter and mid-summer.  If we are to provide suitable accommodation for the miscellaneous collection of seized property, such as Deputy Mulcahy illustrated, dairy cows, dry cattle, horses, furniture, and goods and chattels of every description, it is not one but five or six pounds that will be necessary in every parish.  The county councils are, at the will of the registrar, to provide pounds in every district.  We do not know the amount in cash that every county council will have to be responsible for in such circumstances. If only on these grounds we are justified in opposing this Bill. To the knowledge of the Minister the county councils of Ireland are quite unable to provide the services that originally they were intended to provide, and now we are going to put upon them an expenditure of which the Minister could not give us a reasonable estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another objection to this measure is this: The Government are going to <Col N="2097" /> provide all these pounds or places for impounding animals, at the command of the registrar, who, in turn, acts on the command of the Minister, as a temporary necessity.  When the present policy of the Minister is replaced, or when the present Ministry goes out of office, another policy will have been substituted.  There was quite sufficient pound accommodation during the régime of the previous Government; in fact, some of the pounds fell into disuse because they were not needed.  We are going now, under this Bill, to undertake at great expense to provide pounds for a temporary necessity in order suitably to maintain animals impounded.  We are going to put all this unwarranted expenditure upon the county councils and, incidentally, upon the ratepayers. This Bill provides for a lot of things but one thing is not provided for by this Bill.  If the pounds are necessary, in the temporary circumstances of the unfortunate policy of the Ministry, provision has to be made for the pound-keepers and for the duties of the pound-keepers, but I do not see any section providing that the pound-keepers shall properly care and feed the animals.  It is notorious, in connection with seizures in the country, that not alone was the accommodation, owing to the temporary necessity, inadequate, but what was worse, the cattle were not fed.</P>
    <P>One thing that should be provided for, above all others, is that if cattle are seized they should be properly fed. It is notorious, in almost every instance that that was not so.  Here in this Bill, which prescribes the duties of the pound-keeper, there is not one word to provide for the feeding and maintenance of the unfortunate animals that are seized.  Are we then to have a recurrence of the incident to which I called attention, the abortion of milch cattle in the country and the cruelty of store cattle being kept in pounds on inadequate food?  We had an instance of a seizure in Limerick where 18 or 20 infant calves were fed upon hay because the pound-keeper could not provide milk.  Provision should be made for suitable feeding for animals <Col N="2098" /> when impounded.  The necessity for this Bill is only temporary.  The situation does not call for permanent pounds to be put up at the expense of the ratepayer.  There is no shortage of pounds if ordinary conditions prevailed in the country.  The only shortage of pounds there is, so far as the farmers are concerned, is the shortage of the pound usually referred to as £ s. d., and that is very short.</P>

      <P>I must confess I am very much astonished at the attitude of the Opposition in regard to this Bill.  We have had a considerable number of questions appearing on the Order Paper, from week to week, as to the condition in which cattle have been found after their release from the pounds that are already in existence throughout the country.  Fired with a high sense of their duty to the animal kingdom the Opposition have criticised the Government for not making better provision for the maintenance and detention of animals that have been seized.  It is largely due to the efforts which the Opposition have made in that regard that this Bill is introduced here to-day.  I would have thought they would have hailed this as one of their Parliamentary triumphs.  I am thoroughly at a loss to account for the attitude they have taken up in regard to it.  I can only assume it is because they are afraid that the pounds will be used, not merely for the detention of long-eared and long-tailed animals, but of long-tongued ones as well, in which event, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come back to this point, that the reason why pounds are necessary is in order that the animals which have to be seized by the action of the sheriff&mdash;it is a well known method of collecting a debt and enforcing a creditor's rights on a debtor&mdash;may be properly cared for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> The reason for the Bill is that the pounds in this country have not been properly maintained, and that, as Deputy Bennett himself has admitted, very serious hardship is caused to animals and possibly very serious loss inflicted upon their owners.  As it is probable that pounds will have to be employed for a little while longer in the country, until this movement is dealt with, as it will be dealt with, everything should be done to ensure that animals which are seized in these circumstances will, when produced for sale, be in a proper and healthy condition, or, if returned to their owners on payment of their debts, as in the case of Colonel Fraher's property, they will be returned in as good a condition as that in which they were when seized.</P>
    <P>That is the whole purpose of the Bill. I do not know what regulations will be made for the proper maintenance of the animals when they are in the pound, but I am perfectly certain that if the owners of these animals&mdash;I am making this point in reply to the point which I presume Deputy Belton is going to make&mdash;want them to have a mustard bath or to be wrapped up in flannel or cotton wool, the local authorities will be perfectly prepared to make provision for doing that at the expense of those to whom they belong.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister would want to be a superman and not the moderate man he is if he could say anything to justify such a Bill, so that I do not think the subsequent speakers could have been far wrong in <Col N="2102" /> saying that the Minister put up no argument to justify this measure.  I notice that all these duties are imposed on the local authority without giving the local authority any authority over the pounds.  They cannot even appoint the pound-keeper; he must be appointed, and his duties specified, by the county registrar, over whom the local authority has no authority.  I see that my old friend is introduced for the convenience of the Attorney-General&mdash; mandamus bristling all over the Bill. All pounds that were necessary in this country were there before the present abnormal conditions came about.  In fact, there were too many pounds.  It is only a while ago since we in the Dublin County Council handed over a pound to a man who made use of one wall of it to build a new house.  We gave him the pound to make a yard.  I suppose when the Minister for Justice has his flying squad up to the point of efficiency, that pounds or a substitute pound in the locality will be required.  And for what purpose?  The Minister for Finance said it was the usual method for a creditor when a debtor will not pay his debts, to seize the goods of that debtor and put his stock into pound.  But every Minister who sits on those benches knows in his heart &mdash;every member on the Fianna Fáil benches and every supporter of theirs in the country knows&mdash;that this is not a case of the collection of a debt. They know that before this monstrous tyranny was imposed on this country that, as a matter of fact, these pounds were going into ruin for want of use. Nobody wanted them.  The people were paying their debts until this tyranny was imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister for Finance referred to a conspiracy and was pulled up.  But I say that a conspiracy is necessary in every townland in the Free State to prevent the farmers from having to pay their land annuities twice over.</P>

      <P>Nobody is so blind as those who will not see.  The Minister does not want to see.  I put it to the Minister whether or not there were enough pounds in this country to house the cattle seized for ordinary debts until he became a Minister?  There was not a pound scarcely in use in the whole country.  As a matter of fact the question of a pound came up in some way or another a year or two ago at a meeting of the Dublin County Council.  There was not a councillor present who could tell us whether there was or was not a pound in the county. And we were supposed to be in control. The reason was that there was no use for a pound.  The people were paying their debts.  The Minister may sneer at that.  But he has not to dig a living out of a farm at the present time.  If he had, the smile on his face would be the other way now.  Boiled down to practical utility, these pounds are wanted all over the country for one purpose only and that is to impound the cattle seized from the farmers of the country for an alleged default in the land annuities that the British <Col N="2104" /> Government have told President de Valera they have already collected.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to attempt a discussion on the general policy of the Government nor even on the policy of the Government on the question of land annuities.  But the proposal is to erect pounds.  There must be some justification for their erection.  I am only mentioning the position in connection with land annuities as being the only justification for the erection of pounds.  I will leave the matter at that.  I shall be very interested to hear the Minister or any member of the Government Party here give us any other reason for this attention to pounds just now.  I notice in the Bill Section 6 (1), which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every pound-keeper shall control and manage the pound of which he is appointed pound-keeper under this Act but such control and management shall be for and on behalf of and subject to the directions of the county registrar.</P>
      <P>The county council must build the pound.  First of all, the county registrar shall tell the county council that a pound is wanted in a district.  The county council must erect that pound there.  If not my friend the Attorney-General will bring his old reliable mandamus; the pound is ordered in that particular district and has to be built.  The keeper of the pound is appointed by the registrar, and his duties and perhaps his remuneration are classified.  I have not read the whole of the Bill in detail, but the local authority is to pay the piper.  The county registrar, over whom the local authority has no control, calls the tune. This, of course, is another manifestation of the manner in which the present Government supports democratic control and administration.  In Section 7 (1) we have:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> Whenever a local authority fails or neglects to maintain in proper order and condition any pound which such authority is required by this Act to maintain, the Minister may authorise the county registrar to procure such repairs or other work to be done to such pound as may be necessary.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Government have brought this in.  I am glad they are showing their hand.  I know that any Deputy in the Government Party with any pretensions to farming is conspicuous now by his absence, but he will have to answer for a lot when he goes down to the cross-roads.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Attorney-General do not come across petitions from their followers, but I know that petitions are rolling in every day dealing with the subject of how the Government are handling the agricultural position.  The only reply they have to give to people who are very much concerned about the financial stability of the country and who consulted the Minister for Finance and his advisers very recently&mdash;the only answer they have to give those people and their own followers through the country is the provision of more pounds to imprison cattle seized from farmers for a debt already paid.  They are going to make the local authorities keep the animals in good condition so that the friends of the Minister for Defence can come down from South Armagh and take the cattle from Clonmel in good condition across the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did read it and I must say it is not very clear.  The Bill as drafted places the county councils in a most extraordinary and unique position. The county councils are expected to contribute money for the erection and maintenance of pounds and they have not one word to say in regard to the expenditure of the money or the management of the pounds subsequently. Surely that is treating local authorities in a most autocratic way?  In sub-section (1) of Section 2 it is a matter for the county registrar to decide where additional pounds are necessary.  On the other hand, the local authority may be very definitely of the opinion that such additional pounds are not necessary.  There you have a difference of opinion.  The county registrar will persist in his view that the pounds are necessary, although the opposite view is held by <Col N="2108" /> the local authority.  The members of the local council, who know the requirements of their areas intimately and who know the accommodation already in existence for the purpose of accommodating the seizures made by Government officials throughout the country, are forced, simply at the behest of an official who may or may not be acting fairly or justly, to provide additional accommodation and to spend an additional share of the ratepayers' money.  It seems to me that it is iniquitous to expect local bodies to contribute the ratepayers' money in this fashion without a shred of control either in regard to the expenditure of the money on the erection of pounds or the maintenance of the pounds subsequently.  So far as my knowledge of certain parts of the country is concerned, I am satisfied that there is ample pound accommodation. The Minister has not attempted to indicate the areas in which this additional pound accommodation is required.</P>

The function of the local authority is to provide the money; they exercise no control over the expenditure of that money.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the introduction of this Bill is certainly a very strange and a sad commentary on the present Government's policy.  I think the Minister and the other members of the Government would be very well advised to ask themselves why there is a need for such a measure as this.  There is no use in shelving the issue or attempting to side-track it.  The Minister knows perfectly well that there is something wrong in this country that has brought about the need for pounds.  It is one or other of two things, and for neither of these two things can the Government deny responsibility.  One is that the people are unable to pay, and the other is that they have become so demoralised that they do not want to pay their debts. That is the reason for the pounds. It is indeed a sad commentary on the administration if this co-called democratic Government, the members of which told us when they were coming into power that they were going to establish a Government which would depend on respect for the law, not upon such things as Coercion Acts or <Col N="2110" /> anything like that.  Respect for the law &mdash;and this is what we have!</P>
      <P>My real objection to the Bill, as has been pointed out by Deputies Roddy and Belton, is that the county registrar, a Government official, is the man who is in authority.  If the Government wants pounds provided for their own purposes and for their own officials to be in control and in command, why do they not erect them?  I remember on many occasions hearing and being a party to county councils in the past passing resolutions against the state of affairs that existed, under which they were responsible, as they are still responsible, for the maintenance of courthouses while the sheriff held the control.  Now we have this carried forward and emblazoned in this Bill.  Not alone is this democratic Government calling upon the people to build pounds, and going to take these pounds out of the hands of the people's representatives into their own hands, but even though the county council will appoint the pound-keeper, the Minister has the right to dismiss him.  If that is the Government's idea of democracy they can have it; but I do not think that many people will agree with it.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is another side to this.  If the Government want to get over this difficulty they will have to create such a situation in this country, both morally and materially, that there will be no necessity for pounds as the people will be able to pay their debts. If they go by the statements of people like the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Lands, pounds will not be required in another year's time because we will have no live stock trade in this country and there will be nothing to put into them.  Taking it any way, the Bill, in my opinion, is a mistake, and is very ill-conceived from the point of view that the ratepayers have to erect the pounds and maintain them and appoint the pound-keeper and pay him; while the Minister has the power to dismiss him.  I think that is ridiculous and absurd.</P>

      <P>I do not see any necessity for this Bill.  In the County Westmeath the county council have provided pounds in Mullingar, Moate and other <Col N="2111" /> towns.  The Government, however, are not using these pounds as they have a special pound of their own with a special squad in the barracks at Mullingar. If the Government would only settle the economic war they would not want any pounds.  It is a shame and a disgrace for any Government to bring in a Bill such as this.  In Westmeath they have a squad with ten or twelve motor cars which leaves the old barracks every morning and goes out to a townland and stays there for three days.  They might have only four or five decrees for that townland and they go into four or five houses.  The sons and daughters of these people who are visited can be seen running to their neighbours to borrow the money to get rid of these court messengers.  It is a shame and a disgrace for any Government to have a thing like that happening. I ask the Minister or some responsible person to travel for a few days in Westmeath with these court messengers, and he will come up against the poverty that exists there.  There is no movement in Westmeath against the payment of rates and annuities&mdash;it is sheer poverty and necessity which prevent them being paid.  The Government should withdraw the Bill and settle the economic war and then there will be no need for pounds.</P>

      <P>One would assume from that observation that this was really to keep the roads clear and to ensure that there will be no accidents to flying squads meandering through the country, and that that was the intention behind the Bill.  But really the operative section is Section 2 which says: &ldquo;Every local authority shall provide in the functional area of such local authority such pounds as the county registrar shall, with the approval of the Minister, direct...&rdquo; So that a single Government official in an area can insist, with the sanction of the Minister, <Col N="2112" /> on having as many pounds provided in the area as he thinks fit, and the expense in connection with the provision and management of these is to be borne by the ratepayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I consider that in these matters there should be the greatest possible care taken to avoid any clash between the Government official and the local authority.  I speak with some experience in connection with that matter as a member of a local authority for a good many years, and I say that there is a disposition on the part of officials of local authorities, and of local authorities themselves, to have disputes with people who interfere with them, or whose area is adjoining theirs, or who in any way come into contact with them and are not under the direction of the particular local authority in question.  In many instances, where courthouses are under the control of the local authority, if a person, perhaps not living in the area, draws attention to some defect, unless the greatest possible care is taken there is a conflict.  I think that even the Attorney-General is aware of that.  In this particular instance we cannot ignore the fact that within the last two years an Act was passed which transferred certain powers from the courts to the county registrar.  The county registrar, or the sheriff, now gets from the Land Commission authority to collect land annuities.  He is armed with an authority equivalent to that sort of a court.  The official charged with that particular duty in many counties, having from 5,000 to 10,000 of these instruments which are equivalent to court orders, informs the Minister that he wants more pounds&mdash; that he is going to get busy.  Is not that the fact?  That cannot be denied. Even the statements made by Ministers as to the number of cases in which, with the assistance of the county registrar, land annuities have been collected bear out my statement.  The person whose duty it is to issue these instruments, which are equivalent to a court decree, finds that he wants the <Col N="2113" /> number of pounds in his district doubled or trebled or quadrupled and, as long as he gets the consent of the Minister, the local authority has no option except to provide them.  Their work in connection with housing, roads, sewerage, public health, etc., is going to be interrupted if the sheriff comes knocking at the door.  He has the authority of the Minister; he has mandamuses, and every possible scheme that ingenuity can devise to make the ratepayers pay the costs of what one individual, subject to no authority except the sanction of the Minister, can demand.  It is not a good system by any means.  The registrar writes up to the Minister and says that he wants four, ten or 20 pounds.  What does the Minister do?  Ask the Civic Guards are they necessary or write over to the Land Commission inquiring how many decrees the sheriff is going to issue, and if he finds that he has a 1,000, he will give him 1,000 pounds if he wants them?  What corrective is there on the Minister in connection with this? None.  These two individuals are absolute in their power and discretion as to the expense that may be placed on the local authority in connection with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, to my mind, is not good business. There ought to be some association between the sheriff and the local authority before such machinery as can be put into operation by means of this Act could enforce costs upon the local authority.  Then you come along to Section 5, sub-section (4), which says that every pound-keeper appointed may be dismissed by the Minister, no cause being given.  I do not expect that is going to be done except in perhaps very isolated cases, but even a pound-keeper has some rights in the matter.  Every morning he may expect a note from a Minister saying that he is dismissed and there is no more about it.  In the general run of cases a man appointed by the local authority is appointed in the first instance at, let us say X pounds per annum, and he goes from that to X and a quarter pounds after a certain number of years.  The moment a man is dismissed the county registrar can appoint another man at the <Col N="2114" /> salary then prevailing.  Later on the county council appoints its man, and probably appoints him at X pounds instead of X and a quarter pounds. That does not appear to be good business. We go on then to a case in which the county registrar directs that there is a wall to be repaired, or some other costs to be incurred in connection with the improvement or the maintenance of the pounds.  The county registrar, who knows nothing perhaps about building or anything of that sort, spends money on this place, and all he has got to do is to send up the accounts to the Minister.  There is nothing in the Bill to show that the Minister will exercise any discretion in connection with the matter, and I am positively certain that in this case the Minister probably knows as much about building as the county registrar. He simply puts on his imprimatur, and the county council is mulcted at once in perhaps twice the costs.  It may so happen that the local authority may not meet for a couple of weeks; nevertheless the county registrar can operate, ordering the goods, maybe, at the highest price, and the local authority is mulcted in the whole amount.  The whole thing is symbolic of the state of affairs in the country. If it were not for the section in the Land Act which gave authority to the county registrar to impound people's property without any other authority than a direction from the Land Commission there would be no necessity for this Bill.  The Minister's smile is indicative of his agreement.</P>

      <P>I wish to protest against this Bill.  Since the old landlord system was done away with, it was one consolation to the people to see that there was no necessity for a pound in the country.  In my experience all over the area with which I am connected there was no necessity for pounds for the last 13 years, at any rate.  The present Government as a result of their own policy now see the necessity for re-establishing them.  I do not wish unduly to take up the time of <Col N="2115" /> the House, but I should like to refer to an accusation which was made by the Minister for Finance that we on those benches had advised the annuitants not to pay their annuities.  We did not advise the tenants not to pay their annuities, but I myself as a farmer feel that they have paid their annuities under duress.  The Minister also said that one of the reasons for putting up those pounds was that they had to take special steps to collect those annuities. I maintain that they have already been paid, and in that connection I can give no stronger argument than the statement of President de Valera, speaking on economic conditions in the Saorstát, as reported in Volume 54, No. 5 of the Official Debates of the 19th December last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President: As far as we are concerned, we came back here on Tuesday, prepared to sit all night and all week if necessary.  As I was saying, our attitude towards the British market has been simply this: There were £5,000,000 odd being paid out of this country, which we believed were not due from this country.  Deputy MacDermot tells us that one of the reasons why the British would be kind to us would be to enable us to pay that £5,000,000; in other words, that they would take it in kind.  We would pay over our cattle, and the value of that meant that in 1931 we would be getting 8d. a head net when we paid over that £5,000,000. I quite agree that the British would be very anxious to give us that opportunity. Of course, they would, and they would be right and wise in doing so.  Our attitude, however, was that this money is not due.  We are prepared to sit down and talk about it and put it to arbitration, if necessary, but we are not going to pay it.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Leary: But we have paid it.</P>
      <P>The President: Not with our will.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Leary: I am glad the President admits it.</P>
      <P>The President: It has been taken from this country wrongfully, I admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> Mr. McGilligan: But it is going.</P>
    <P>The President: I have pointed out that there are people who think they are being well treated when they are given an opportunity of sending over all their fat cattle to pay a debt which is not due.  Well, it does not matter either way, as far as the actual result is concerned, to anyone, because it is taken from us against our will, and, I believe, wrongfully.  We have got to resist, as best we can, that wrongful taking away; but our attitude has been at no time an attitude of not using any market we could get.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There it is in black and white in the words of the President that we have already paid those annuities.  I certainly say that the tenants of this country have every right to protest against paying them a second time. There is nothing morally wrong in their doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to say much on this matter; I merely rise to protest against the Bill.  I remember in my young days I did not know what a pound was like.  Now, people are so accustomed to pounds and jails for the last five or six months that they do not know when their cattle will be in the pound or when they themselves will be in jail.  So far as the farmers are concerned that is the position, and I am sorry that it has come about.  I wish to make the strongest possible protest against that.  It does not matter so much who pays for the pounds or who controls them.  That is relatively a small matter, but I consider it important as showing the mind of the Government, showing the trend of things, showing what is passing in their minds, and what they have in view for <Col N="2117" /> the country.  It simply means that what we regarded as an abnormal period, during what is called the economic war, is going to be made normal.  The abnormal is going to be made normal by the present Government, as far as I can see.  It appears now that the pounds and jails are going to be the latest industry which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have to boast about.  I wonder will he go down the country with his key to open all those pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect we will have it soon, but I hope the present Government will be put out before there is any need for it.  I hope the jails are not overflowing yet.  I am not going to delay the House, but I should just like to read a quotation which will give the House an idea of what condition Fianna Fáil is leading the country to&mdash;something which we did not ever expect to see fulfilled during the régime of the Fianna Fáil Government:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Guards will be set on every crossroads to prevent trespass.  There will be three great cesses or taxes laid on so that the poor men of the nation will deny houses and property. Pounds will be filled with cattle and the jails with men for the non-payment of cesses; thus men will be in confinement without a crime.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an extract from the Prophecies of Saint Columbkille, translated from the Irish Parchments, 592, by the Rev. M. Taafe, and published in 1860.  The people who lived in those times did not think the time was so near, and certainly nobody thought that Fianna Fáil, after the beautiful promises which they made to the country, were the Party which were going to fulfil this terrible prophecy of Saint Columbkille.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been somewhat disconcerted by the length and the irrelevance of the discussion which has taken place on this Bill.  I have also been somewhat surprised by the more than usual discrepancies in the arguments from the various Deputies on the opposite benches. I gathered from Deputy Mulcahy's speech and also from the speech of Deputy Bennett and, to some extent, that of Deputy Belton, that although they had a vague inkling of the necessity for this measure, they were prevented by some political prejudice from doing anything or saying anything in its favour, although they appreciated that some such measure was required.  In these circumstances, in so far as their speeches might be taken as conveying some appreciation &mdash;however indirectly&mdash;of the fact that the Government was rising to its responsibilities and carrying out its duties, I am rather inclined to let the credit come to us in the ordinary course.  Of course, we had a speech from Deputy Roddy, in whose opinion the Bill was no credit to the Government. He was followed by Deputy Brennan and then by Deputy Cosgrave, who proceeded to criticise the Bill in detail.</P>
      <P>Now we did not conceive this Bill; we did not frame it or print it.  The Bill was fathered by the late Cosgrave Administration.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, the late Minister for Justice, was the author of this Bill.  He had it drafted exactly in the form in which it now appears before the Dáil.  He sent it to the Department of the then Attorney-General.  I notice that the ex-Attorney-General has just left the House.  He guessed what was coming. When the Executive Council debated and approved it eight years ago, Deputy Cosgrave was in the Chair, but Deputy Cosgrave now criticises this Bill a great deal.  Well, it is their Bill.  It was they who framed it, approved of it and actually printed it, but for some reason best known to themselves they did not introduce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was not introduced then because another Bill was thought of to take its place.  Another Bill was brought in much more drastic in its effects, a Bill relating to pounds, not arising out of the present situation or the non-payment of land annuities, but relating to what were the normal circumstances of the day when Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Cosgrave and their colleagues were the governors of the country&mdash;the Court Orders Act of 1926.  That Act enables the under-sheriff to seize and impound cattle anywhere, whether in a legal pound or not.  If Deputies opposite had taken the slightest trouble to read this Bill, and particularly if they had read their own legislation relating to pounds, if they had even endeavoured to show some logical sequence in their ideas to indicate the knowledge they possessed about the conditions throughout the country, they would not make the foolish speeches that they made to-day. Deputies commented on the fact that pounds are being used which are not county council pounds?  Why? Because there was a Bill passed in the Dáil in 1926, on the initiative of the then Government which enabled those pounds to be used, and which enabled cattle to be impounded anywhere; and they were so impounded in any class of pound.  The Government to-day should be commended for their humanity; it is a more humane Government.  These pounds which were being used in the past, we were told to-day by Deputies opposite, are getting into decay; they were not suitable for the proper housing of seized cattle or wandering asses or straying goats.  So we are going to build bigger and better pounds for the housing of wandering asses and <Col N="2120" /> straying goats and for the housing of any cattle that it may be necessary to seize.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy had some ideas as to what our intentions were when he said that this Bill was designed to provide machinery for the purpose of getting the Opposition out of the Government's way.  That was the first sentence of his speech.  I can assure Deputy Mulcahy that it is not necessary to associate the Party opposite with wandering asses and goats.  They do not embarrass the Government; they simply amuse us.</P>

      <P>The Opposition have got out of the way; they are in their own way to a considerable extent, and we need no longer concern ourselves about them.  This Bill, as I explained, merely enacts in modern form existing legislation. There is an Act for the provision of pounds in operation here since 1851. That Act which had Deputy Cosgrave's approval did not confer any discretion on the county councils as to how many pounds they were to provide.  That Act required the county councils to provide whatever pounds were necessary on the requisition of three justices of the peace.  At the present time they must provide whatever pounds are necessary on the requisition of the District Justice.  This Bill merely substitutes the county registrar: that is one of the changes.  Another change is to remove the inadequate limitation of £10 which under the existing law is the maximum amount that the county council could spend upon the provision of a pound.  If pounds are unsuitable to do what Deputy Bennett pointed out and what Deputy Brennan pointed out and what Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy pointed out they must be replaced.</P>

      <P>Bigger and better pounds are to be provided.  Deputy Dillon, who in one of his usual speeches indicated that he did not know what <Col N="2121" /> the Bill was, that he had not read the Bill, and, even if he did read it that he did not understand it, made the suggestion that this Bill should appear on the base of a monument erected in Dublin to the Government.  It is not a bad idea.  The provision of pounds is essential to the preservation of civilisation. A pound is essential to the preservation of civilised conditions in any country.</P>

      <P>If Deputies would only think it out they would realise that there is something in it, not merely because they are necessary to enforce court decrees, whether Deputies like to have them enforced or not, but also because modern conditions require it. Straying asses and wandering goats must be removed and must be provided with the accommodation that they require in a pound.  Deputies also might remember the necessity for reading the Bill and trying to understand it before talking about what is in it.  For instance, the functions of pound-keepers is dealt with in the Bill.  Deputy Bennett made an impassioned speech on the failure of the Government to provide that pound-keepers should feed the cattle in their charge.  Obviously he had not read the Bill.  That is in the Bill, and the operation of the Bill will provide more effectively than is provided for by the present law for the proper custody of cattle or animals of any kind in pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this Bill has any connection with the campaign, with which Deputies opposite are associated, for the non-payment of land annuities. Whatever powers are required to deal with a campaign of that kind were provided by the Act of 1926, to which I have referred.  This Bill is necessary in order to prevent pounds falling into decay and pounds being located in unsuitable conditions and to provide simpler and better machinery for the provision of new pounds or the replacement of unsuitable pounds. Deputy Mulcahy objected to the provision in the Bill which makes it illegal to break into pounds or to remove <Col N="2122" /> animals from pounds.  The Deputy is wandering far from the path of constitutionalism. The bravos of his Party went to Kilkenny pound, twice, I think, and although that pound consists of a yard surrounded by houses inhabited by a number of human beings&mdash;not animals&mdash;they exploded bombs and mines of various descriptions in that pound and endangered the lives of the people in these houses.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I move that the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Bill, 1935, be read a Second Time. The Bill, as its Title shows, is intended to make better provision for securing the due provision and maintenance by the councils of county boroughs and counties of these courthouses and to restate in modern language, with comparatively minor amendments, the existing law as regards the provision and maintenance of courthouses by the local authorities.  The Bill is necessary because the law on the subject is inadequate, clumsy and difficult to enforce especially since the setting up of the new system of courts in the 1924 Act.</P>

      <P>The point in connection with this Bill is the maintenance of these institutions.  You will have trouble so long as one person says a thing must be done and another person has to do it and pay for it.  It would be better for the maintenance of the courthouses if this work were done by the State as a whole.</P>

      <P>There is a question with regard to Section 4 of the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the general or particular directions of the Minister, the custody <Col N="2127" /> and control of courthouse accommodation which is provided and maintained under this Act shall, where such courthouse accommodation is used for the purposes of a District Court and no other Court, be vested in the district court clerk for the district in which such accommodation is situate.</P>
    <P>How will that affect the courthouses? Many of these are rented by the county councils and some of them are only wanted one day every month or two months.  How will that affect the existence of these courts?  They really belong to the county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I would like to move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  The Bill, as Deputies will no doubt have observed, is based largely on the report of the Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad which considered these matters some five years ago and presented its report on the 6th November, 1930.  I do not propose at this stage to delay the House any longer than is necessary to refer to the more important amendments effected by the Bill and to indicate in what respects we have or have not implemented the Joint Committee's report.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the two most important changes embodied in the Bill are:&mdash; (1) the increase in the strength of the Supreme Court and (2) the alteration in the method of hearing appeals from the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making these two important alterations of the existing system we are acting on the recommendation of the Joint Committee of both Houses. <Col N="2128" /> It may, however, be said, with considerable truth, that whilst we are in these two important matters following the Committee's report in the general sense, we are not implementing the report, so far as it concerns these matters, in its entirety.</P>
    <P>The Committee's recommendations were: (1) That the Supreme Court ought not to consist of only three members; (2) that there should be such addition to the number of judges of the High Court as may be necessary to enable that Court to perform all its work without any accumulation of arrears; and (3) that appeals from the Circuit Court should be dealt with locally by way of rehearing, two High Court judges sitting together, at least in the more important cases, and the stenographer's note to be retained, not as the basis of the appeal, but as a useful adjunct.</P>
    <P>The extent to which these recommendations have been carried out and the extent to which they have not been carried out may be summarised as follows, viz.: (1) It is proposed in Section 4 to appoint two more judges of the Supreme Court, but we are providing that any appeal or other matter may be heard by a court consisting of such number of judges being not less than three nor more than five as the Chief Justice shall determine; (2) it is not proposed to add to the number of High Court judges; and (3) we are providing in Part IV of the Bill that appeals from the Circuit Court should be dealt with by way of rehearing, locally; that is, we are abandoning the method introduced by the 1924 Act, whereby these appeals are heard in Dublin on shorthand notes and reverting to the system which operated in the days of the old county court.  We are, however, providing for one judge only in the hearing of the appeals, and we are not making any provision for the retention of the stenographer's note.  On these two matters the Bill diverges from the recommendations of the Joint Committee.  Also, it is provided in Section 39 that appeals in civil jury cases will be heard in Dublin on the notes of the Circuit Court judge and <Col N="2129" /> that every such appeal shall be brought by way of motion for a new trial.</P>
    <P>Deputies will doubtless expect an explanation of the extent to which our proposals fall short of the Committee's recommendations.  As far as the constitution of the Supreme Court is concerned, we contemplate that a full court of five will be available for cases of the first importance, and that a Supreme Court of three members will still be competent to deal with a great number of appeals from the High Court. I do not think that anybody will seriously suggest that every case that goes to the Supreme Court is of such importance that it could not be dealt with by a court of less than five members.  If our proposals receive the assent of the Oireachtas, the position will be that the two additional Supreme Court Judges will be frequently available to assist the High Court and that the two other ordinary Supreme Court Judges may, in certain circumstances, be also available for this purpose.  It is partly due to this provision that the recommendation of the Joint Committee as regards increasing the personnel of the High Court has not been followed.  Furthermore, we are providing that all the ordinary judges of the Supreme Court will be available in addition, of course, to the High Court Judges for dealing with appeals from the Circuit Court.  We believe that these arrangements will obviate the necessity for an increase in the personnel of the High Court without causing any undue embarrassment to the Supreme Court or affecting the dignity or standing of that court as the final court of appeal.</P>
    <P>In providing for one judge only for Circuit Court appeals we have borne in mind that there is a large body of opinion in favour of this course, and also that it will eliminate the possibility of dissatisfaction arising in cases resulting in a difference of opinion between two appeal judges.  I think the experience of those concerned with the working of the courts generally is that as an appellate tribunal one judge is, on the whole, a more satisfactory tribunal than two.  A further point is that if appeals are to be heard by two <Col N="2130" /> judges, it is almost certain that the appointment of at least one additional High Court Judge will be found necessary. So far as official stenographers notes are concerned, our view is that these notes first became a feature of civil cases in the courts as a result of the system of appeal established by the 1924 Act, and we think that with the abandonment of that system the official stenographers' notes must also go.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent that, over and above other considerations, the Government in arriving at decisions on the points with which I have been dealing felt compelled to have due regard to the interests of the general taxpayer as well as to those of the litigant, and I frankly confess that where the decision was in doubt one way or the other the deciding factor has been the necessity for economy.  The result is the compromise which is expressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the same line of thought, I may, perhaps, here allude briefly to the provisions of Section 47 of the Bill regarding the pensions of justices of the District Court.  Here again we have thought ourselves obliged to adopt a middle course between the existing law and the recommendations of the Committee. Under the 1924 Act a justice of the District Court has the same pension terms as a civil servant; he cannot obtain the maximum pension until he has served for 40 years.  The Committee recommended full pension after 15 years' service.  It is to be feared that, in making this recommendation, the Committee did not advert to the fact that men are usually appointed to the District Court Bench at a comparatively early age and that the recommendation, if carried into effect, would, in fact, entitle several of the existing justices to retire on full pension at a very early age indeed.  This proposal was naturally regarded with great disfavour by the Minister for Finance, and we finally reached an agreement on the basis of full pensions for justices of the District Court after 30 years' service and proportionately smaller pensions for a lesser number of years' service, with a concession to those few of the original justices who, by reason of their <Col N="2131" /> comparatively advanced ages on appointment, are required to retire before they had served even two-thirds of the necessary 30 years.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee made certain minor recommendations regarding the existing Rule-making Committees which were designed to improve the working of these Committees.  We have introduced in Part VI of the Bill certain proposals which will, we hope, achieve more fully the object aimed at by the Joint Committee.  The present law as regards the making of Rules of Court is that they are made by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the appropriate Rule-making Committee and do not come into operation until they have been approved by a resolution of both Houses.  The Department of Justice has made representations that that system has not worked well in practice.  There was delay and confusion as regards both the District Court Rules and the Circuit Court Rules, and no serious attempt has been made to revise or codify the Rules of the High Court.  The Minister for Justice has formed the opinion that whatever advantages there may be in theory from having the Rules of Court made by an Executive Minister and debated in the Oireachtas before coming into operation, these advantages are completely overshadowed in practice by the delay and confusion caused thereby.</P>
    <P>In the case of the District Court Rules, to which I have referred, one of the Houses declined to pass certain Rules&mdash;a very small and insignificant part of the total&mdash;and the question then arose as to whether this refusal invalidated all the Rules, and after the Rules had been in operation for a considerable time this question actually went to the Supreme Court and resulted in a majority decision for the validity of the Rules.  In the case of the Circuit Court Rules, a complete code&mdash;compiled with great care&mdash;was rejected by one of the Houses and rejected substantially on the plea that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was too extensive, a plea which was not only really irrelevant but which was itself rejected in principle by the <Col N="2132" /> Joint Committee which advised that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should remain unchanged.  We think that less cumbersome machinery is necessary if Rules of Court are to be made and changed speedily as may be required in practice, and we have, accordingly, proposed to leave the making of these Rules in the hands of the Rule-making Committees, subject only to the consent of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>We also propose to give each Rule-making Committee a definite statutory secretary, so that interested people will know to whom to address any complaints or suggestions which they may desire to make.  Furthermore, we are imposing in Section 70 a statutory duty on the secretary to summon a meeting of the Committee once at least in each year for the purpose of considering the practice, procedure and administration of the court in relation to which the Committee is constituted. The Committee is required by the same section to report to the Minister for Justice whether any and, if so, what amendments should be made in the Rules.  I am sure it will be agreed that that is a great improvement on the present position.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill gives effect to a proposal of the Joint Committee that jurisdiction in the winding-up of companies and in lunacy should cease to be exercised by the Circuit Court. We have, however, after careful consideration, decided to allow the Circuit Court jurisdiction, as regards minors, to stand.  It appears to be popular and useful.  The Bill also carries out a number of other less important recommendations of the Joint Committee upon which I do not think it necessary to dilate at this stage. There are also other recommendations which we think may best be left to the Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>I propose to refer briefly to certain of the Committee's recommendations of a more or less important nature which we have not adopted.  Possibly the most important of the recommendations in this category is that dealing with the question of transfer of actions from the High Court to the Circuit <Col N="2133" /> Court.  Under the existing law as interpreted in a judgment of the Supreme Court&mdash;Hosie v. Lawless&mdash; the question for the court to consider, on an application to transfer an action pending in the High Court which might have been commenced in the Circuit Court, is whether there is anything in the action which takes it out of the general policy of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and makes it more fit to be tried in the High Court than in the Circuit Court.  The Joint Committee recommend that an action should not be transferred to the Circuit Court if it was shown that it was reasonable that it should have been commenced in the High Court. In other words, the Committee considered that access to the High Court should be made easier than it is under existing conditions.  We have not accepted this recommendation.  I think the House will agree that if an action is within the jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Court by the Oireachtas, it is proper that it should be prosecuted in that Court unless it is shown that there are some special circumstances obtaining which make the action more fit to be tried in the High Court than in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The Committee recommended that the ages of retirement of judges and district justices should be extended. The present position is that judges of the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court are required to retire on reaching the age of 72 years, and that district justices must retire at 65, except in the cases of the Dublin Metropolitan and Cork City justices, who may continue in office until reaching the age of 70 years.  The Committee proposed that the ages of retirement of Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court judges should be 75 years and of district justices, 72 years. We do not think it would be wise, in the interest both of economy and efficiency, to alter the present retiring ages, and we are accordingly not accepting the Committee's proposals in this respect.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the Committee which we are not implementing is that dealing with the qualification for appointment as district <Col N="2134" /> justice.  Under the present law a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than six years' standing may be appointed a district justice.  The Committee wanted the qualification period extended to 10 years.  The qualification periods in the case of Supreme Court and High Court judges is 12 years, in the case of Circuit Court judges 10 years.  Having regard to these figures, I do not think the period of six years in the case of district justices is too short, and we do not accordingly propose to make any change in the existing position.</P>
    <P>There are certain proposals in the Bill to which I should perhaps direct special attention at this stage, for the reason that they do not arise directly from anything contained in the Report of the Joint Committee.  Thus Section 8 of the Bill is entirely new in this sense.  This section transfers from the Chief Justice to the President of the High Court, or a judge nominated by him, the jurisdiction as regards minors and persons of unsound mind which is historically associated with the Lord Chancellor.  It seemed to us that the Chief Justice's time was so intimately associated with the work of the Supreme Court that any special duty thrown upon him must necessarily delay the work of the Supreme Court generally, or, to put the matter in an admittedly exaggerated form merely in order to make the point perfectly clear, it might be said that under the present system the whole Supreme Court is required, so far as loss of time is concerned, to deal with this class of business.  Also it seemed to us not altogether proper or elegant that an appeal should lie, even in theory, from the decision of the highest judge in the State.  Discussing the matter with the Chief Justice, I found that he had no objection to the proposal, subject to certain safeguards as regards the privacy of the work and the adequacy of the High Court personnel to cope with the extra work, with which I was in full agreement.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that as regards the circuits of the Circuit Court, it is proposed to abandon the eight statutory circuits created by the 1924 <Col N="2135" /> Act in favour of nine circuits which are to be specified by order of the Executive Council.  When the 1924 Act was passed it created eight statutory circuits and eight judges, one judge to each circuit.  It was soon discovered that the Dublin circuit required two judges permanently, and that two of the other circuits were so heavy as to require between them practically the whole time of another or tenth circuit judge.  Accordingly, after an interval during which things were tided over by the appointment of temporary judges, an Act was passed (No. 15 of 1928), authorising the permanent appointment of two or more judges of the Circuit Court, in addition to the original eight, two of the ten judges to be &ldquo;movable&rdquo; judges, assignable by the Minister for Justice from time to time to whatever circuit stood in need of assistance.  In point of fact, however, one of these two theoretically &ldquo;movable&rdquo; judges has been assigned since his appointment to the Dublin circuit, and the other spends almost his entire time in the counties of Donegal and Sligo.  On the other hand, in certain other circuits the judges are not fully occupied.  In these circumstances, we propose to abandon the idea of &ldquo;movable&rdquo; judges, which has in fact caused some confusion, and to reapportion the country into nine circuits, of which the Dublin circuit will have two judges and the other circuits a judge apiece. If possible, we hope to arrange matters so that one of the judges outside Dublin will have a circuit considerably lighter than the other, with the intention and on the understanding that he will devote his spare time to assisting in the Dublin circuit.  We hope in this way to get the entire work of the Circuit Court kept up to date without increasing the number of judges, and without too frequent exercise of the power of appointing temporary judges, which power, however, we are retaining as a precaution. I may perhaps add that the task of dividing the country into circuits so as to ensure that each judge will have enough work to do, and yet not too much work is not an easy one: the pace <Col N="2136" /> at which different judges work varies greatly, and there are at present circuits which leave their existing judges a fair amount of leisure, but which might overtax other judges.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that power has been taken by the Minister for Justice in Section 61 to fix court fees with the approval of the Minister for Finance, and without reference to any other authority.  The present law in the matter is contained in Section 57 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, and under that section the Rule-making Committee of each court has a veto over any proposals to increase fees.  It is the definite view of the Minister for Finance, which certainly seems to be supported by statistics from other countries, that the revenue derived by the State from litigants in our civil courts by way of court fees is too small in proportion to the amount which the general taxpayer has to contribute towards the maintenance of the courts, and cases have been cited where the amount of court fees did seem ridiculously small in comparison to the large sums which the litigants were prepared to pay and did pay for other purposes in the same cases.  It is felt that the Executive Government has a right and a duty to determine the proportion in which the general taxpayer, on the one hand, and the litigant on the other hand, shall provide the sums necessary for the maintenance of the civil courts, and that the decision formed by the responsible Ministers on that subject should not be liable to be vetoed by the Rule-making Committee.</P>
    <P>I think that the provisions of Section 49 of the Bill call for some special mention at this stage.  It has unfortunately happened that one or two justices of the District Court have from time to time been guilty of indiscretions, not serious enough to call for their removal from office, but serious enough to justify a formal rebuke and warning.  I am glad to say that these cases are rare: the great majority of the justices manage to do their work without giving offence to any reasonable person.  Nevertheless, we feel that there should be some middle course open to the Government in dealing with a justice who, whilst he does not <Col N="2137" /> commit any one definite offence serious enough to justify his dismissal, is not keeping up to the general high standard of dignity and reticence.  At present no such middle course is open.  There is statutory power to remove a justice from office, but there is no power to warn or censure him.  Under the Act of 1924 a justice may be removed from office for misbehaviour on the certificate of the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General.  We are now asking the President of the High Court to join the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General so as to form an advisory committee of three whose duty it will be to investigate fully any complaint referred to it by the Minister for Justice and to recommend what action should be taken.</P>
    <P>The present tribunal, as everybody who has any experience in such matters will probably agree, is an unsatisfactory one.  First of all, there is the difficulty which I mentioned a moment ago with regard to the constitution of the courts for hearing circuit appeals&mdash;that it is a court of two.  It is a most unsatisfactory tribunal in my opinion.  We propose, under this Bill, to constitute a committee of three, and give to the majority of that committee jurisdiction either to recommend the transfer or punishment otherwise of the District Justice in connection with whom a complaint has been brought before it, or to refuse to do either of those things.  It will be observed that on that committee there are two judges.  Therefore, the jurisdiction of dealing with the District Justices is, one might say, committed to a judicial authority.  I think this is a great improvement on the present system, apart altogether from the necessity and value of the additional provisions as regards the way in which the District Justices may be dealt with. There is only one other matter to which I think it necessary to refer and that is the proposal for a majority verdict by nine members of the jury in both civil and criminal cases.  Deputies are probably aware that that particular provision is not new, in this sense, that it was first embodied in the Juries Act which expired some two years ago, and during the operation of which in all <Col N="2138" /> criminal cases the law was exactly as is proposed to be provided for under the present Bill.  There has been a good deal of criticism of that section, and I do not wish to say that the Government are wedded to it or want to insist upon its being embodied in the Bill.  If the weight of opinion is in favour of the law being allowed to remain as it is at the moment I think there will be no objection to that course on the part of the Government. This particular Bill has been under draft for a considerable time, and until some considerable period had elapsed from the passing out of effect of the 1927 Act we had not an opportunity of judging exactly what would be the effect of returning to the old law with regard to unanimous verdicts.  I think it is arguable that the experience has been, since a return was made to the old law, that no great difficulty has been found in the working of the criminal law, and that there has not been any greater number of disagreements in criminal cases than there were during the period of its operation.  It may well be that the value of that provision was more theoretical than practical.  However, when we come to deal with it on the Committee Stage I imagine that the matter will probably be fully discussed and we can have the views of those who are interested in it.</P>

      <P>I think I have now outlined the main features of the Bill at sufficient length to justify the House in passing the Second Stage. When the Committee Stage comes to be discussed we will probably have constructive criticism, and any suggestions for the improvement of the measure, whether from Deputies or interested bodies or individuals outside, will be considered.</P>

      <P>We propose to oppose this measure and vote against it on the Second Reading.  When we <Col N="2140" /> take up that attitude on this Bill in the particular circumstances that the country is confronted with at the moment we realise the great principle that was laid down by the Joint Committee which dealt with the matters that were before them in connection with the Courts of Justice, when they said they were</P>
      <P>&ldquo;convinced that the peace and credit of the country will depend more than anything else upon the impartial and efficient administration of the law by courts which will have the confidence and respect of the people and of the legal profession.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take the view that this Bill, as it will work in practice, will not command the confidence either of the people or of the legal profession.  We object to the Bill because it is inopportune in the circumstances of the present time.  We object to the Bill because it will increase the cost of litigation both to the State and to the litigants.  We object to the Bill because neither the state of business at the Bar, nor in the legal profession generally, warrants the provisions in this Bill nor does the economic condition of the country warrant it, nor the national finances. And we object to the Bill because it contains principles which are thoroughly unsound and even vicious. We object to the Bill, lastly, because not in one single instance in the major aspects of the Bill does it follow the recommendations of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find in this Bill provision for the appointment of two new Supreme Court judges.  Let me say at the outset that I am thoroughly in favour of the Supreme Court&mdash;the final court of this land&mdash;consisting of five judges. But let me quote for the House the resolution proposed by Deputy Little, and seconded by Senator Comyn, during the proceedings of the Joint Committee in reference to the proposal that the Supreme Court should consist of five judges.  The recommendation of Deputy Little and Senator Comyn, the two representatives of Fianna Fáil on the Joint Committee, will be found on page xciv of the Report of the Joint <Col N="2141" /> Committee.  Deputy Little moved and Senator Comyn seconded:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee are, however, convinced that the considerations which, it is stated in evidence, weighed against any recommendation by the Judiciary Committee of 1923 for an increase in membership of the Supreme Court are even more compelling to-day.  The Committee are of the opinion that there should be no increase in the cost of the Supreme Court until the increased prosperity of the country warrants it, and until the volume of business in the Superior Courts urgently requires it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil members of the Joint Committee in 1929 were of opinion that the prosperity of the country at that time did not warrant an increase in membership of the Supreme Court.  The amount and volume of business in the Supreme Court at that time did not warrant the proposed reform.  Compare the conditions, as regards prosperity, at that time with the present time.  Is there any possible justification, not merely for the provision as regards an increase in the membership of the Supreme Court, but for any of the other various provisions in this Bill which will very largely increase the cost to the State and to the litigants, considering the plight of the farmers as it existed at that time and as it exists at present.  In the year 1930-31, when the recommendations of the Joint Committee were under consideration by the last Administration, they came to the conclusion, acting honestly as they always acted, that they would not be justified in putting the taxpayers of the country to the increased expense consequent upon the putting into operation of the recommendation of the Joint Committee.  It was because they had the feeling that the country at that time was not in such a position that they would be justified in increasing the expenditure on the courts of justice that the Joint Committee recommendations were not carried into effect.  The country at that time was in a far better position, economically, than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> I believe before this debate is finished the House will hear the views of the farmer Deputies on this side of the House as to whether they are in favour of increased expenditure on the courts of justice and on litigation at a time when most of them are on the verge of penury and starvation.  If Deputy Little and Senator Comyn thought, in 1929, that the prosperity of the country was not such as to justify increased expenditure in these directions, there certainly is no justification for such expenditure at the present time.  Much as I am in favour of the reform of the judicial system, on the lines of this Bill, and on the lines represented by the Joint Committee, I could not possibly vote for this Bill in the circumstances of the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have no information from the Attorney-General, acting for the Minister for Justice, as to what the cost of this Bill will be.  Deputies should remember when they are considering that aspect of the case that a very large proportion of legal business has been taken away from the ordinary court of justice in this country.  Deputy Little and Senator Comyn did not think in 1929 that the volume of legal business at that time justified the putting into operation of the reforms recommended by the Joint Committee. Deputy Little does not know, because he is not in active practice at the moment, what the state of the legal business at present is.  But we who are in active practice know that there never was, certainly not in my time in the last twenty years, a period when there was so little business doing.  The Bar is feeling the pinch and the legal profession generally is showing the repercussions from the economic conditions. There is very little business in the Supreme Court this term&mdash;there never was so little business in the Supreme Court in my time.  Deputy Little who in 1929, when the Supreme Court was overworked, and unable to overtake its business, thought it was not an opportune time to increase its membership, now thinks fit to put into operation these recommendations when the economic conditions do not merely justify them, but do not in the least <Col N="2143" /> degree warrant them.  This Bill is going to cost a lot.  We do not know how much.  A lot of the ordinary court work is taken away.  The Military Tribunal is doing a considerable amount of criminal business.  The Government has set up a new tribunal in connection with the Land Commission&mdash;an appellate tribunal.  The land annuities cases are taken over from the District Courts and handed to the county registrars. Notwithstanding that, the Government are prepared to say that the prosperity of the country and the state of legal business justify them in bringing in this Bill.  The Government are prepared to say that this condition of things justified them in appointing two Supreme Court judges and in changing the system of appeal from the District Courts which will involve very considerable expenditure, which must come out of the taxpayers' pocket.  It will be necessary for judges to go on circuit. The Bill makes provision for registrars, for clerks, for forms, judges' allowances and travelling expenses, judges' lodgings, judges' servants, and all the rest.  It makes all these provisions and it shows, as the Attorney-General frankly remarked to-day, and the opinion he expressed is mine also, that even under the provisions of this Bill it will not be possible to carry out the system of rehearing even with the increased judges provided under this Bill.  The provision for Commissioners of Assize clearly demonstrates the Government's views that even with two additional Supreme Court judges and even with perambulating judges of Assize, it will not be possible to overtake the hearing of Circuit Court appeals under the new system.</P>
    <P>All these new and additional expenses are going to be put on the taxpayer at a time when there is no justification for it and litigants are going to be charged these, as the Attorney-General has frankly admitted here to-day.  It is quite clear that Section 61 was put in at the instance of the Department of Finance, who want litigants to pay their whack, and there is no provision in Section 61&mdash;I may refer to it again later but in case I do not, I want to refer to it now&mdash;<Col N="2144" /> giving any control by this House or by the Seanad as to the amount of fees that will be charged.  It is one of the fundamental principles, or ought to be one of the fundamental principles, in connection with courts of justice that every citizen should have the right to refer to the courts of the land at the least possible price to himself.  Under this Bill, it is proposed to increase the fees to litigants and the effect of that may be to keep poor people out of their rights, to keep them from defending themselves in the courts of this country and to keep them from establishing their rights through the constitutional courts set up in this country.</P>
    <P>There is that danger in the Bill. It is obvious that the Department of Finance wants to extract some of the cost of this new system out of litigants' pockets.  It is a compromise, the Attorney-General says, between the taxpayer and the litigant&mdash;a compromise which will injure both and benefit neither, in my opinion.  It is going to increase, as I say, the cost of litigation, both to the taxpayer and to the litigant.  I have referred to the fact that there never was such little legal business as at the moment. I said that during this last term&mdash;the term we are now in&mdash;the Supreme Court had just enough work to keep it fully occupied and no more.  We have been able to dispense with one of our High Court judges and the work of the High Court has been carried on for the last three or four months&mdash; since the Long Vacation&mdash;on a staff of four judges.  But we are going to appoint two new Supreme Court judges and we are going to change the whole system at a time when the economic conditions in this country are in such a parlous condition.</P>
    <P>There are five or six principles in this Bill, five or six matters of major importance, and I want to draw the attention of the House to each of those in a very few words.  The greater portion of the Bill is taken up with matters of unimportant detail and I do not propose to refer to those at the present stage.  They can be dealt with more appropriately in Committee. The first big principle that appears <Col N="2145" /> in this Bill is the principle of the increase in the number of judges of the Supreme Court.  I stated at the outset, and I restate here, that I am personally strongly in favour of the final Court of Appeal in this country being a court consisting of five judges. It is one of the few matters that are in common with the Government Party and every Party in this House, I think&mdash;certainly with this Party&mdash; that we have no use for the appeal to the Privy Council.  We are both in agreement on that, but, because we are, it is incumbent upon us to give to the people of this country, and to the people of other countries who may come and litigate their affairs here against citizens of this country, a strong Court of Appeal which is the final Court of Appeal, finally declaring rights and laying down the law which will affect the citizens of this State for all time, until changed by the Oireachtas.  It should be a court that would command the confidence and respect of every single citizen in the State, and command the confidence and respect of every citizen in other States who does business with us, because, as the Joint Committee said in their Report</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The peace and credit of the country will depend on the impartial and efficient administration of the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People who are going to have business dealings with us want to see what kind of a court they are going to be faced with, in the event of dispute arising in the course of those business transactions and you are not going to have any feeling of security, you are not going to have any feeling of confidence by people coming here, or our own people unless you have a strong and efficient court.  I make no reflection, nor did the Committee who made their recommendations make any reflection, on the existing Supreme Court which consisted, for the last 11 years, of only three judges.  The Chief Justice, in giving his evidence, pointed out to the Committee that he, in 1923, when the new court system was being established in this country, had recommended that there should be a Supreme Court of five <Col N="2146" /> judges.  Everybody was in favour of that at the time, but there had been a Civil War, and it was not felt by the Government at that time that they would be justified in the financial conditions consequent on that Civil War in having a Supreme Court of five judges.  But they were convinced, and were always convinced and agreed <i>in toto</i> with the recommendations of the Joint Committee, that there should be a Supreme Court of five judges.  There should not be, and it is quite unjustifiable to set up in this country, a system by which you have a Supreme Court, the highest court in the country, the court that is supposed to command the greatest respect for its decisions, consisting of three judges and two others who will be sometimes in and sometimes out.</P>
    <P>The new members of the Supreme Court will be sometimes High Court judges and sometimes Supreme Court judges and there may be sometimes a court consisting of three Supreme Court judges and two other High Court judges hearing appeals from the judgment of those two Supreme High Court judges.  The thing is ludicrous nonsense.  It is unjustifiable in principle and will bring nothing but disrespect for the court system of this country if persisted in.  I would prefer that we should wait until the country was able to stand the cost of a proper Supreme Court, consisting of five members, rather than to have the mongrel proposition that is embodied in this Bill.  There is no justification whatever for it.  This Supreme Court, the Attorney-General says, should normally consist only of three judges and it is only in cases of first importance that the five Supreme Court judges should sit for a hearing and he said that he did not think it would be suggested that every case is of such importance that the five judges should sit upon it.  I suggest that every case that goes to the Supreme Court of this country is of such first-class importance as to warrant a hearing before five High Court judges.  Nobody is able to tell, when a case goes to the Supreme Court, what point of law is going to be involved in it.  Nobody but an <Col N="2147" /> official who has never practised in the Supreme Court or in any of the courts of this country would ever make such a suggestion and the Attorney-General himself, I am sure, does not agree with it.</P>
    <P>Cases that come before the Supreme Court are of relative importance. Some are of supreme importance, some of great importance and some of less importance, but the thing that has to be remembered is that every case decides a principle, small or great, and that principle is laid down by the Supreme Court of this country and is the law of this country.  From that point of view, every case that goes before the Supreme Court is of equal importance in so far as it lays down those principles and in so far as it acts as a guide to other litigants coming into court.  Is it to be said that the Supreme Court is to consist, sometimes of three and sometimes of five judges, and that when you see a case decided in the Supreme Court by three judges, the decision is not to have the same binding force, the same weight as precedent and the same effect in laying down what is to be the future law, affecting the rights and liberties of the people of this country, as a decision of the five judges?  Is there to be an appeal from the decision of the three to a decision of the five?  Where is it to begin and where is it to end?  There can be nothing but confusion and nothing but ultimate disrespect for a court that will be composed in the manner in which it is proposed that this Supreme Court will be composed under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 5 deals with the power of making these new Supreme Court judges into temporary High Court judges.  As drafted at the moment, the Bill puts these Supreme Court judges on the same par as the Military Tribunal.  They will be an <Col N="2148" /> inferior tribunal subject to <i>certiorari.</i> It is proposed&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that the Chief Justice may request any ordinary judge or judges of the Supreme Court to sit in the High Court as an additional judge thereof, and every judge of the Supreme Court so requested shall sit in the High Court and be an additional judge thereof for such purposes and during such time as shall be specified in such request.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, when we are practising at the Bar we can go down to one of these new judges sitting in the High Court and ask him for what purpose is he there, for what length of time is specified in the request, and we can say to him that he is to sit there only for such purpose and during such time and no longer.  If he goes one inch outside of what is specified in the request of the Chief Justice, then that judge is no longer a High Court judge; he is not a judge at all and he is subject to <i>certiorari</i> because his jurisdiction is limited, in the same way as that of the Military Tribunal. I do not know if such a position was intended.  If this is a question of principle, or if it is only a question of drafting, it is clear that it should be altered. There is no justification for taking these Supreme Court judges and putting them into the High Court.  The only justification for the proposal is one of expense.  I think that may be inferred from one of the remarks made by the Attorney-General.  That is the real reason.  Rather than to bring such a vicious system into our courts it would be better not to have such a reform introduced at all.  We should have the Supreme Court judges sitting and doing nothing else but acting as an appeal tribunal in this country to maintain the liberties and rights of the people.  It would be much better to do that than to bring in the mongrel proposals embodied in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only objection there. The Supreme Court judges have to go on Assize.  They have to go and rehear cases of £50, £10 and £5 all over the country.  I will be told that the old Lord Justices of Appeal in the British days used to go on Assize. <Col N="2149" /> If that argument is made to me, it leaves me cold, because I have no respect for that system.  I think it ought not to be referred to.  That is what we are doing in reverting to the point of view of the Supreme Court judges having to do the work of Assize. We are reverting to the British system. The Fianna Fáil Government, the patriotic Government, is reverting to the British system of Supreme Court judges going on Assize.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is wrong.  They are going to deal with small cases at Assize.  The Joint Committee point out that 90 per cent. of the cases heard in the Circuit Courts from 1924 to 1929 corresponded roughly to the cases that would have been within the jurisdiction of the old Circuit Court&mdash; having regard to the fall in the value of money.  It is quite true that 90 per cent. of the cases heard in the Circuit Courts would have been within the jurisdiction of the old county courts. Those are the cases that will be heard by the judges who ought to be aloof, sitting solely in the Supreme Court, building up for themselves respect in the country and in the legal profession as men learned in the law, and as men fit to lay down the principles of law as members of the Supreme Tribunal in this country.</P>
    <P>They are to go around and hurriedly hear small cases and hear them, perhaps, without sufficient time for due or adequate consideration.  I would like to go more fully into this matter but there are other points with which I want to deal.  I want again to appeal to this Government not to enforce a system such as that embodied in this Bill.  So far as I am personally concerned, and I speak for the other members of this Party, I want to say that if this Government brought in a proposal to have an ultimate tribunal of five permanent members of the Supreme Court it would receive enthusiastic support on this side of the House.  So far as my Party is concerned, we will fight the present proposal all through until this Bill leaves the House.</P>
    <P>The next big aspect of this Bill is the reversion to the British system of rehearing civil bill appeals.  I realise that the majority of the members of <Col N="2150" /> my own profession&mdash;I cannot speak for the members of the solicitors profession&mdash;are in favour of rehearing.  I state explicitly that I am personally entirely against that system, both in principle and as a result of my own experience on circuit for a fair number of years.  The Supreme Court provisions in this Bill do not follow the recommendation of the Joint Committee. Neither do they profess, in reference to the new system of rehearing appeals, to follow the recommendations of the Joint Committee.  The Attorney-General, in his statement, passed very lightly over the reason why the recommendations of the Joint Committee were not followed.  I am against the system of rehearing on principle.  In any event, if there is to be rehearing it will only be possible as a system which will give satisfaction and justice to the litigants if it is worked on the principle, recommended by the Joint Committee, of rehearing by two judges.  There is no possible justification for rehearing by one judge an appeal from another judge.  A High Court judge, because he has been appointed to the High Court, is deemed to know more than the Circuit judge.  If we go back and speak not of the present but of the old judiciary, will not everybody who has ever been on circuit admit that you were faced with this situation: that the appeal judge had to rehear a case heard before the County Court judge, who was a better lawyer and a better judge of fact and life than the High Court judge, who was appointed because of his political affiliations.  I am not now reflecting on any High Court judge or any future judge who may be appointed.  It is sometimes a matter of accident.  Even at the present time I will say that there are one or two Circuit Court judges who are the equals of the High Court judges.  I will not go any further than that.  But we will find that there will be a rehearing from one Circuit judge who commands the confidence of those who are practising before him, who commands their respect and in reference to whose decision on a particular case both sides are satisfied that he has correctly decided.  But one side or the other, <Col N="2151" /> the side that is beaten will appeal in the hope that a judge of less experience, less knowledge of the world, perhaps even less knowledge of the law, will hear the appeal from the Circuit Court judge.</P>
    <P>If you have two judges, at least you have two minds against one mind. Under this new system of rehearing you have one mind against another mind, the mind of a man who ought to be in no hurry hearing the case, the Circuit Court judge who, perhaps, knows from long years of experience as a Circuit Court judge, the mentality of the people with whom he is dealing. There is an appeal taken from him and it is heard by a man from Dublin in a hurry with no knowledge of the particular mentality of the country people of the county where he is sitting as Assize judge at the moment.  That is not a system that can be justified in principle, nor is it a system that will ultimately give satisfaction to the litigants.  I know I am, in a sense, like a voice crying in the wilderness on this question of rehearing.  I know probably that this will be passed, but I do take this opportunity of voicing my own protest against that system. The system of rehearing is bad in principle.  The reasons for it are given in the evidence that was submitted before the Joint Committee by the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice, notably amongst others, and I do not propose to restate it.</P>
    <P>If the system of appeals must be changed, then there should be at least two High Court judges hearing the case and in no other way can it be hoped that this system will give ultimate satisfaction to the litigants or the public, or command respect. Again, that would be a costly matter. But why persist in this if we are not able to stand the expense?  I would prefer to support the present Ministry in the expense of such a system. I would prefer to see them appointing the additional judges necessary for that system rather than support the proposals contained in the Bill, and I would be the first to congratulate such of my brethren at the Bar who are lucky enough to gain the <Col N="2152" /> advantage of the opportunity offered by such proposals.  That is not enough.  This Bill departs from the recommendation of the Joint Committee in a further very vital respect. The Attorney-General has not made any reference to the reasons why the provisions of Section 39 of the Bill were introduced.  My colleagues at the Bar think that the provisions of the Bill about rehearing will benefit their profession.  I sincerely hope so, as a member of a trades union, whilst I look forward with dismay and considerable perturbation to trekking around the country again on the occasion of Assizes.  If it is going to benefit the profession, Section 39 of the Bill is going to take the substance out of any appeals that are going to be heard.  What is the meaning of it? It is entirely unjustified.  The Attorney-General did not make any reference to it in his statement, and, since I got this Bill, I have been unable to see what is the point of it.  The provisions of Section 39 are to the effect that there is to be no rehearing of any case in the Circuit Court where it has been tried by a jury.</P>

      <P>I did not catch it.  If the principle is to be accepted that there is to be a rehearing, why not go the whole way?  Either have it one way or the other.  Have it on the present system, which is a good system but has not got a proper chance.  Have it altogether on the present system or altogether on the new system, but to have another mongrel provision in the Bill about rehearing is not satisfactory. What is going to happen?  Everybody is entitled as of right, in accordance with the present law, to a jury in cases of tort.  Everybody is going to have a jury from this on, in cases of tort in order to avoid a rehearing.  Take a running down case, a negligence action.  The plaintiff will have it. Why?  He will have it because his junior counsel down there, making his way at the Bar and looking for business from the solicitors, will address the <Col N="2153" /> jury and he will appeal to them, as in fact they have been appealed to, and he will say &ldquo;Are you going to find Paddy Murphy of Ballydehob guilty of negligence, your own fellow-townsman?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The Attorney-General is quite wrong.  The provisions in this Bill are fundamentally different from the provisions in reference to appeals at the present time.  The appeals at present from jury actions in the Circuit Court are on the notes of a stenographer. The appeals proposed here are on the judge's notes, doing away with the stenographer.  Anybody who has had any experience of the practice by way of new trial motion knows what that means.  At present the two judges in the City of Dublin have the notes before them and so everything in a negligence action is submitted to them.  In the past few weeks I reversed a decision in a negligence action on the notes.  I am quite satisfied, and I say it without hesitation, that if that case came up on the judge's notes I could not have stated the case.  The principle at the moment is rehearing on stenographer's notes where there is, in theory at least, an appeal on fact.  The new system proposed by those people who are the <Col N="2154" /> protagonists of the full rehearing is, that in cases of tort there should be, not a hearing on fact but a hearing on law based, not on stenographer's notes, but on the judge's notes.</P>
      <P>Could I pause a moment and say one word about stenographer's notes as against the system of judge's notes?  I intended to refer to it later in connection with what I regard as a very vital omission from this Bill, the omission to carry out the recommendation of the Joint Committee that there should be stenographer's notes on trials by judges with juries and trials by judges without juries in the High Court.  Every practitioner knows, and the Attorney-General knows, that there is no more unsatisfactory form of appeal than an appeal on a judge's notes.  The judge's notes consist of the hurried scraps he takes down in his notebook of the evidence given during the progress of the hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accuracy or inaccuracy of these notes depends on the capacity or incapacity of the judge to take down the evidence.  Many judges prefer to retain the evidence in their head because it gives them the advantage of watching the witnesses and of ascertaining from the demeanour of the witnesses whether or not they are telling the truth.  Now the judge has to forget about the witnesses and to spend the time during which he should be observing the demeanour of the witnesses taking notes.  One person is able to take a full note, another is not.  The person who is able to take a full note may or may not be a good judge.  Your capacity to take a note of evidence does not determine whether or not you are a good or a bad judge.  The effect of this will be, if you have a first-class judge hearing one of these cases, doing his business, watching the witnesses, controlling counsel, managing the case firmly, keeping it within proper limits, that his note must of necessity be scrappy and must be merely confined to such notes or hieroglyphics as will enable him afterwards to refresh his memory.  It will not be possible for anybody to appeal from such a note, because you cannot state to a court of <Col N="2155" /> appeal what was the issue in the case, what was the evidence in the case, or sometimes even what were the grounds of the decision in the case.  It is a thoroughly vicious principle which is introduced here.</P>
    <P>I was going to appeal, and I do it here and now, perhaps somewhat out of its order, for the adoption of the recommendation of the Joint Committee providing that there should be official stenographers in the High Court.  Those of us who have practised before a judge and jury know that one of the most important things in connection with any subsequent appeal from the verdict of that judge and jury is the judge's charge. That judge's charge does not appear on his notes, because it is delivered orally.  In the hurry at the end of the case, after the charge, counsel have to get up and object to the charge there and then on certain specific grounds.  You have to be pretty slick to be able to do it; but you also have to bear in mind that if you do it the judge may be cross and annoyed and may bring back the jury having heard your objection to his charge, and do you down before the jury.  You have, therefore, to be very careful how far you object to the judge's charge.  But if you do not object, and you appeal by way of new trial motion on that judge's notes, you cannot say a word about it in the Supreme Court because you will be asked: &ldquo;Where is your objection noted by the judge?&rdquo; Unless the judge is able to write shorthand, the notes must of necessity be scrappy, because a judge hearing a case in the High Court must watch the jury, must watch the witnesses, must watch counsel, and also must retain in his head everything that has been stated.  He must concentrate upon what is going on and the effect of the evidence given and, in the course of the hearing, sift the wheat from the chaff, the relevant from the irrelevant.  If he is taking notes as a scrivener his attention must be diverted.  In paragraph 93, the Joint Committee recommended as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  An official stenographer should report the proceedings at every <Col N="2156" /> sitting of the High Court when engaged in the trial of cases, civil or criminal, with witnesses, whether with or without a jury.  The official transcript in the former case to include the judge's charge and any directions or advice to the jury, with all objections taken or requisitions made, and in the latter his judgement, but omitting in both the speeches of counsel.</P>
    <P>Such report to be available to the parties upon such terms as to payment as the Rule-making Authority shall prescribe.</P>
    <P>(b)  That the services of an official stenographer should be available for the Supreme Court to take down and transcribe judgments.  The transcription should be submitted to the judges concerned for revision and be afterwards made accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>Embodied in those recommendations of the Joint Committee is a reform that has been badly wanted by the legal profession on behalf of the public and the litigants for many a long year.  The Attorney-General in his opening statement said they proposed to drop the system of stenographers because it had its origin in the system of Circuit Court appeals originated by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The system of stenographers existed long before the Circuit Courts, but it existed at the expense of the litigants.  It was a very costly affair and was not even part of the official record of the proceedings. It did exist in the Chancery Court and it exists at present in those courts which correspond to the Chancery Court.  It is nonsense to say that because stenographers were brought in for Circuit Court hearing by way of appeal on stenographers' notes and because that system has been done away with, therefore the stenographers should disappear from the Circuit Court and the High Court.  They were never more needed than they would be if this new system is tried.  They were never more needed than at present in the High Court, or rather I should say, in that part of the High Court in which the system of shorthand transcription <Col N="2157" /> does not exist; because it does exist in those two courts&mdash;Mr. Justice Johnston's and Mr. Justice Meredith's&mdash;which correspond to the old Chancery Court.  In those courts at present the evidence is taken down by an official stenographer paid by the State, and the transcript of the evidence, as taken down by the stenographer, is the basis upon which appeals are taken in the Supreme Court.  Why should not that be extended to the High Court?  It would be a small expense which would be largely paid for by the fees charged to the litigants.</P>
    <P>Not merely is that recommendation of the Joint Committee rejected, but the old vicious system of judge's notes is resurrected again in reference to jury trials before the Circuit Court. The Joint Committee recommended that the official stenographers should be retained in the Circuit Court; not that their transcript should necessarily form part of the record of the proceedings in the Circuit Court, but that it should be available to any of the parties to the suit in the Circuit Court on payment of the prescribed fees. What is the objection to that?  I do not know&mdash;it passes my understanding.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest objections to the new system of re-hearing is the facilities for perjury which it holds out. Everybody knows that cases were brought in the County Court as a trial run and then the litigants changed their cases when they came before the Judge of Assize.  It is proposed to return to that system of re-hearing; but it is not proposed to give that safeguard against perjury recommended by the Joint Committee. Why I do not know.  Why should it be necessary, as is proposed in this Bill by inference, to put out of employment, without compensation, those people who have been employed for the last 11 years as official stenographers? Not a single provision is made in this Bill for these people who have been in employment for the last 11 years.  They are going to be turned out on the roadside without compensation. Many of these official stenographers were men who had been attached to the <Col N="2158" /> Press; sometimes to the provincial Press and sometimes to the Dublin Press.  They have lost touch with their former occupation.  Other people have got inside them.  They have lost their connections with the Press.  They are going to be turned out now from the positions which they have held for the last 11 years, because the present Government will not provide in this Bill, at very small expense, a safeguard against possible perjury due to the system of re-hearing proposed in the Bill, or a reform which the public, the judiciary, the Bar and the solicitor profession have wanted for many years in the High Court.  The Chief Justice gave evidence before the Joint Committee in reference to paragraph (b) of Recommendation 93, and again it was based on the necessity for having some system which would command the respect and confidence of the country.  At the present time the Supreme Court lays down the final principles which have to guide judges in reference to the cases that come before them.  Judgments are sometimes written and sometimes delivered orally.  There is no State official attached to the Supreme Court for the purpose of taking down those judgments. In many instances, cases of importance have not found their way from the Supreme Court into the law reports.  The result has been that because they are not available, because even counsel cannot be aware of them, cases have had to be re-argued in the Supreme Court, at enormous expense to the litigants, which would never have been brought into court at all&mdash; not to say into the Supreme Court&mdash; if it had been possible to ascertain decisions by means of the system proposed here in this recommendation. This could be done by perusal of an official record lodged in the Supreme Court offices.  I think the Attorney-General should give favourable consideration to the proposal for the reestablishment of official stenographers. If he cannot see his way to the establishment of official stenographers in the Circuit Court on the rehearing, at least he should give effect to that much-needed reform, and have official stenographers in the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> The Attorney-General, in a rather brief and vague manner, has passed over the provisions of Section 8 of the Bill, transferring lunacy and minor matters from the Chief Justice to any and every judge of the High Court.  I, personally, am utterly and irrevocably opposed to the provisions of Section 8 in that respect, and so far as I am concerned I will oppose it at every stage. The system of lunacy and minor matters being committed to the care of the Chief Justice has been in operation for eleven years to the supreme satisfaction of the litigants, the public, the judiciary and the legal profession.  During all that period there have been only three appeals taken from any judgment of the Chief Justice.  What is the necessity for the change?  Nobody asked for it.  There was never a whisper of it from the public.  Certainly the Chief Justice did not want to shirk that work, and the system as it obtains to-day is due entirely to the anxious care and the personal and individual attention which the Chief Justice has given to every patient in a lunacy matter, and to every minor under his charge.  Nobody wanted this change.  So far as I know, not one single member of the public has asked for it in the last three years since the present Government came into power.  I see no necessity for it, and see a lot that may be said against it.  The Attorney-General said in as tactful a manner as possible that one of the reasons why this was proposed was that when the Chief Justice is sitting on Friday to hear lunacy and minor matters the other two members of the Supreme Court are doing nothing.  He tried to say that.  I say it bluntly, but he said it very tactfully. During the time when the Chief Justice sits on Friday, from 11 o'clock until six or seven o'clock in the evening, the other members of the Supreme Court are not doing nothing.  They avail themselves of the opportunity and are engaged in considering judgments which they have reserved during the week.  On the following morning&mdash; Saturday&mdash;all three judges of the Supreme Court meet in conference in the Four Courts.  The Chief Justice is <Col N="2160" /> ready to do the work, so far as I know. He is doing work which requires the individual attention of the judge to whose charge this particular jurisdiction is committed.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will take the trouble to read the evidence of the Chief Justice before the Joint Committee on the question of lunacy and minor jurisdiction they will see the reasons why this section should never have been introduced into the Bill.  Unless you have a judge who is prepared to give individual attention to each individual patient and minor very grave abuses and very grave hardship to unfortunate patients will be liable to arise, as they arose in the past.  It will be seen from that evidence that the Chief Justice gave each case his own individual and undivided attention.  Personal touch is required in dealing with such matters as lunacy.  Under this Bill it is proposed to take that work away from the judge who will have time to do it, and give it to God knows whom.  Under this Bill the Chief Justice will not have to go to Assizes.  He will be here during two months of the year when his brethren in the Supreme Court will be at Assizes, and when the members of the High Court will be at Assizes. Who is to look after the patients in lunacy during that period except the Chief Justice?  In the interval, the members of the High Court will be busy on jury cases, non-jury cases and all the rest of it.  Under the provisions of the Bill there is no single judge definitely appointed to deal with lunacy and minor matters.  Under the provisions of Section 8 the jurisdiction is transferred from the Chief Justice to the President of the High Court, or such member of the High Court as he may appoint.  In other words, you can have any of the six judges of the High Court, or the two members of the Supreme Court, at any given moment from day to day or from time to time. Under the provisions of this Bill there will be nobody capable of giving the personal attention which is required in lunacy matters, and which has been given during the last 11 years by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say it is undesirable that there should be appeals from the <Col N="2161" /> Chief Justice to the Supreme Court. As I have already pointed out, there have been only three such appeals during the last 11 years&mdash;an absolute tribute to the manner in which that jurisdiction has been administered. But is it wrong in principle, according to the standards of the present Government, that there should be such an appeal, even in theory, as the Attorney-General says?  There will be appeals from the two additional Supreme Court judges to their colleagues in the Supreme Court.  Why should it be wrong in principle that there should be, even in theory, an appeal from the Chief Justice to the Supreme Court, while it is not wrong that there should be an appeal to their colleagues from the decisions of the other two members of the Supreme Court sitting as judges <i>ad hoc</i> in the High Court?  I would appeal to the Government to drop this provision. There is no point in it.  I cannot see any necessity for it.  Under whose care is the staff to be on the present proposal? At the present moment it is under the control of the Chief Justice. Under the provisions of this Bill I cannot see that the staff is under anybody's control.  However, that is a small point.  I take that as one of the principles in the Bill which is utterly unwanted, utterly uncalled for, wrong in principle, and one which is liable to work grave injustice to patients under the care and control of the courts in lunacy and minor matters.</P>
    <P>Next, and even more vicious, is the principle contained in that portion of the Bill which deals with the removal and transfer of district justices.  If I approved of this Bill in every single detail, with the exception of the provisions of Section 49, if I wanted a new Supreme Court such as is suggested here, and if I wanted a new system of rehearing, such as is embodied in the Bill, I would vote against this Bill so long as it contained the provisions of Section 49.  These provisions are nothing more than an effort by the Executive Government to get control of one branch of the judiciary and no principle can be more vicious than that.  I took a note of the <Col N="2162" /> words the Attorney-General spoke in this connection.  I was anxious to know how the Government would justify that particular provision.  He says that one or two justices have been guilty of what he called &ldquo;indiscretions,&rdquo; that they were very rare, and that the great majority of district justices do their work as they should do it.  There is a provision for removal for misconduct in the original Courts of Justice Act, but these are significant words which are used by the Attorney-General: &ldquo;There should be a middle course.&rdquo;  Open to whom?  Is it to the Oireachtas?  Is it to the judiciary, even?  No.  &ldquo;To the Government.&rdquo; These are his own words justifying Section 49: &ldquo;There should be a middle course open to the Government.&rdquo;  In other words, the officials of the Department of Justice should be able to transfer district justices from one end of the country to the other merely because they were not imposing sufficient fines or sufficiently long terms of imprisonment or were giving people the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act.  That is in essence what is contained in Section 49.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive anything more vicious than the principle contained in that section and it will have my inveterate and continued opposition so long as we have any control over the Bill.  There is no provision of the courts system set up in 1924 which has worked so admirably or which has given such general satisfaction as the District Court.  There have been, as the Attorney-General says, cases where district justices have suffered from an inability to keep their mouths shut, but that is all.  Those are the only indiscretions I know of.  I take the test of whether a man is a good or bad district justice to be: Do you ever hear of him?  If you never hear of him, if his pronouncements are not used as headlines in the newspapers, then, in my view, he is a first-class district justice; but if he is regarded as good publicity by the newspapers, then he is a bad district justice.  But good or bad, whether he does his work keeping his mouth shut, or whether he is unable to restrain himself from <Col N="2163" /> giving <i>ex-cathedra</i> pronouncements on morality, sociology, or other topics, that is a matter which you should not try to remedy in this way.  The remedy for that is not the method proposed in the Bill.  The remedy is to appoint only good men and to give them the advice I gave on more than one occasion: &ldquo;Keep your mouth shut.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government want this middle course, the Attorney-General says, and there is a species of veneer put on that because the section says that the complaint shall be referred to a tribunal consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General.  That is to be the justification for this section.  Governmental and Departmental interference is writ largely over that section. The Minister for Justice is to make the complaint.  The Minister for Justice is to censure the man because he has said something that perhaps a political Executive of the day will not approve of.  The Minister for Justice is to make the complaint.  He is to censure and the Executive Council is to remove. The Minister and the Executive Council are in every line of that.  The Minister for Justice may refer the complaint to a committee of whom the Attorney-General is one and he has to get only one man, who perhaps was the previous Attorney-General, to agree with him.  Assuming that that was the most blameless tribunal, the best tribunal you could possibly get for this thing, is it not going to subject district justices to interference in the exercise of their judicial functions merely because there is a threat that the Minister for Justice can make a complaint about them to this advisory committee?</P>
    <P>It is perhaps not without its significance that while this section provides that the district justice is to have no remedy against the decision of the majority of this tribunal, in the courts of the land, there is no provision that he is to be heard by the tribunal. Nowhere in the section is there a provision for giving him an opportunity of being heard.  The decision is to be final, conclusive and not appealable to <Col N="2164" /> any court in the land.  It is not to be heard in public.  It may be heard behind his back, so far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned.  There is no provision enabling this advisory committee to publish a report saying that the Minister for Justice has exceeded his functions and abused his powers and is himself worthy of censure for having brought the case before the advisory committee.  That is carefully left out.  There is a provision for censure.  There is a provision for the Minister for Justice transferring, but there is no provision enabling this committee to publish a report exonerating the district justice from perhaps a groundless charge, perhaps a political charge, or a charge based on political bias against the district justice.</P>
    <P>Why should district justices more than any other branch of the judiciary be selected for treatment of this kind? It is arguable that district justices are within the provisions of the constitutions in relation to the judiciary.  I do not say it is a sound argument, but it is arguable.  Let that pass for the moment.  The district justices system is undoubtedly an integral part of our court system.  It is as I have said a system which has given the greatest satisfaction to all litigants.  Why should the presiding judge in that court be selected rather than anybody else for this class of treatment?  Why did you not select the members of the Appeals Tribunal in the Land Commission? They have quasi-judicial functions and they have judicial tenure.</P>
    <P>They are not mentioned here. Circuit judges, High Court judges, judges of the Railway Tribunal, and Supreme Court judges are not mentioned.  Someone is harking back to the system of removable magistrates, because someone hankers to have control departmentally by this provision of district justices, without it being asked for by the public, or any branch of the legal profession, and without it being mentioned before, or recommended by the Joint Committee. Straight out of the blue we find ourselves faced with this outrageous and vicious proposal in this Bill.  Why the district judges should be <Col N="2165" /> picked upon I do not know.  I speak impartially because I have as much objection as anyone to judicial pronouncements <i>ex cathedra</i>, on all sorts of topics, but I say that they are not more prone to that than the members of the other branches of the judiciary. I hold that circuit judges are about the best.  It would be wise if district justices just considered the facts and remembered that they are not put into a position in order to make pronouncements <i>ex cathedra</i> on all and sundry, on relevant and irrelevant topics, arising out of petty larceny or cases involving moral principles.  That is the only evil that exists.  The remedy is: appoint good men and you will have no trouble. This is not the way to do it.  It is a vicious principle, and I am certainly surprised if the Attorney-General stands for it.  I hope before this Bill leaves the House that we will have the pleasure of hearing the Attorney-General saying that he has been convinced that there is no necessity for this particular provision in Section 49, and that that provision having seen the light of day now for the first time, we will see it buried for ever.</P>
    <P>I was extremely interested in the provision for majority verdicts, and I looked forward with considerable feelings of anticipation and pleasure to hearing the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice.  I thought the Minister for Justice would be presenting this Bill to-day; and that we would have heard both the Minister and the Attorney-General justifying the insertion of a section which is precisely word for word a copy of the section dealing with majority verdicts in the Juries Protection Act, 1929.  This side of the House rang with denunciations then. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was then Deputy Lemass, and the Minister for Justice, who was then Deputy Ruttledge, as well as the Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, were brought into play, and even the President, who was then Deputy de Valera, leader of the Opposition, laid down the fundamental principles about majority verdicts.  I regarded this section as one of the sections which was going to provide me with considerable pleasure.  It was <Col N="2166" /> obvious to-day that the Attorney-General finds himself in considerable difficulty.  Personally I had a very great feeling of sympathy for him in the position in which he found himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and the Executive Council were apparently persuaded that they ought to embody in the Bill a provision for majority verdicts in criminal cases.  Let us see one or two of the things that the present Ministers said, not about the Juries Protection Bill, but about the principle of majority verdicts in criminal trials.  This section found its way, not into a Courts of Justice Bill, and not even into a Juries Bill, but into a Juries Protection Bill.  It was put into that Bill because, as Deputy O'Higgins said during the course of the debates, juries at that time were being regarded as perambulating Aunt Sallies, to be shot at sight by certain members of armed organisations then existing in this country.  Jurymen had been shot and intimidated, and one had been killed, and it was in order to give them some measure of protection that the principle of majority verdicts was introduced, as temporary protection. If a majority verdict was there, each of the 12 men could answer some patriot who came up to him with a gun and asked: &ldquo;Why did you find that man guilty?&rdquo; He could say: &ldquo;I did not find him guilty.  I was one of the three.&rdquo;  The whole 12 could be one of the three, and consequently the patriot with the gun would not be able so easily to find out who in fact delivered the verdict.  That was the genesis of the provision about majority verdicts, that found itself sponsored, in circumstances of considerable difficulty, by the last Government.  They have not departed in any way from their adherence to majority verdicts in criminal trials.  They were forced into it by murder, intimidation, and threats of murder and violence.  As he was then, Deputy Lemass, in column 1620, Volume 29, of the Dáil Debates said that the accused had a fundamental right to have a unanimous verdict in criminal cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2167" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Second Reading of the Juries Protection Bill, column 1620, Volume 29.  He said that the accused had a perfect right to have a unanimous verdict, and in moving a motion on behalf of the then Deputy Ruttledge, Deputy Lemass was still more rhetorical.  This is what he said at page 1012 of Volume 30 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are opposed to the principle of majority verdicts in any trial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went the whole hog this time, criminal and civil:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We think it degrading the whole system of trial by jury and liable to make its operation farcical.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Lemass, who is now Minister for Industry and Commerce, and who sponsors an endeavour to have a section in a Court of Justice Bill&mdash;not a Juries Protection Bill&mdash;said about majority verdicts.  The then Deputy Ruttledge said he did not know on what principle, or what ground the Minister could justify the introduction of such a system.  The President, who was then leader of the Opposition, also spoke on behalf of the principle of unanimity.  This is what he said in column 1564 of Volume 29:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... the institutions that have grown up through a long series of years and have been accepted ought not to be put aside and destroyed simply because a particular Executive finds it convenient for the moment to put them aside.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present Executive comes in with a proposal to put this institution of the unanimous verdict in criminal trials aside, and it does not know why it wants to put it aside.  That is what the Attorney-General said, that the Executive Council put this provision into the Bill and did not know why they did so.  They did not know whether they would recommend it and did not know whether they would stand over it or not.  The President having now taken up that attitude took the attitude in 1929 that institutions that have grown up through a long series of years ought not to be destroyed because a particular Executive finds it convenient for the moment to put them aside.  He went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" />&ldquo;The ordinary method of trial by jury and unanimity of verdict has been accepted.  Take, for instance, the case of unanimity of verdict which has been accepted mainly on the the theory that a man is innocent unless he is proved guilty and that, if there is any reasonable doubt he should get the benefit of the doubt. That is all reversed in this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not know why this section was put into the Bill.  The Attorney-General does not know.  As we stand we do not know why this section was put into the Bill.  We do not know its purpose, and we do not know if the Executive Council want to retain it in the Bill or not.  These matters have taken me a considerably longer time to deal with than I had intended.  There are some other matters that we can more properly deal with on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  But there are one or two small points that I want to refer to briefly because they raise questions of principle.  Some of them have been referred to by the Attorney-General in introducing the Bill.  One of these was the remittal or transfer of actions.  I regret that owing, perhaps, to the acoustic properties of this Chamber I did not quite get the explanation the Attorney-General gave for the departure in this respect contained in the report of the Joint Committee.  But I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that Section 12 of the Bill, which provides for the remittal, and transfer of actions, is, in the first place, as has been admitted, contrary to the recommendations of the Joint Committee, and is, in my opinion, unconstitutional, <i>ultra vires</i>, and will be void if it ever becomes law.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee examined the question after hearing evidence as to the manner in which transfer from the High Court should be made to the Circuit Court and made certain recommendations. These provided most specifically that the jurisdiction to make these transfers should not be vested in or conferred upon the Master of the High Court.  But here we find in Section 12, precisely the opposite of what the Joint Committee recommended and we have no explanation of why that is done.  Every citizen, <Col N="2169" /> according to the Constitution, has a right of access to the High Courts of the State set up under the Constitution. If a citizen of this State institutes an action in the High Court, under this provision he is going to be deprived of his specific right by the Master of the High Court who is merely in a permanent position and who is a man incapable legally&mdash;I say incapable legally because he is a man I have a great respect for personally&mdash;of deciding matters judicially.  Here he is going to decide a matter affecting the fundamental rights of the citizens.  I recommend that that provision should be taken out and that a private citizen should not have to expose any further illegality or inefficiency on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a provision arising out of this matter which has given rise to very great perturbation in the minds of both branches of the legal profession and that is the provision under Section 21. We have had no explanation of that from the Attorney-General.  We could not expect him to deal with every section of the Bill, but I hope he will deal with this section at another time. I am only voicing the very strong view, both of my own branch of the profession and of the solicitor branch of the profession, on the section which provides for the remittal of actions from the High Court to the Circuit Court, and which gives the Circuit Court the right to award more damages than £300.  In these circumstances every case started in the High Court could be transferred indirectly to the Circuit Court.  It is felt that this is an indirect method of opening up a very wide jurisdiction to the Circuit Court.  I recommend that that matter should be very fully investigated, and that on the Committee Stage we should, at least, be told the reason why this is necessary. We should be told what it is they want to achieve or else it should be excluded altogether.  The Government do not appear to know whether they want a majority verdict in criminal cases or not and I do not think they know whether they want Section 21 in this Bill or not.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another point and that is in regard to the Judgments <Col N="2170" /> Extension Act.  We are in a very humiliating position with regard to that.  The Joint Committee reported upon this matter and recommended that there should be a reciprocal arrangement between this country and Northern Ireland and between this country and Great Britain in the matter of the mutual enforcement of Judgments, the grant of Probates and Letters of Administration, and matters of that kind.  The Attorney-General must know that there is, and has been, in existence for a long time a very admirable document dealing with the whole suggested matter of the extension of judgments between this country and Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that some arrangement should be made.  The Ministry has entered into a Coal-Cattle Pact recently.  Let them use their opportunities to the full and try to make a new agreement with Great Britain to enforce this.  We are in this position. A judgment obtained in England against a Free State citizen can be registered in the Four Courts here, but if we get a judgment against an English subject we cannot register it in England, and have to sue him all over again, whereas an English litigant can register his judgment in our courts against an Irish citizen.  That should be remedied as far as possible.  Then there is another point.  The point I have just touched on arises out of this Bill.  This next point, perhaps, is not strictly relevant to the scope of a Courts of Justice Bill&mdash;it is the question of arbitration.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that arbitration ousts the jurisdiction of the courts of justice and, therefore, it is relevant, I think, to a Courts of Justice Bill.  The matter I wish to mention now is one that has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause, very great hardship to citizens of this country unless something is done.  I shall illustrate by referring to what everybody knows of their own knowledge, namely, the usual arbitration clause in an insurance policy.  This is a tremendous weapon in the hands of a powerful company like an insurance company against an ordinary poor or ignorant person.  It ousts the jurisdiction of the courts.  It is nonsense <Col N="2171" /> when one takes out an insurance policy to say he agrees to all the conditions that can be enforced against you.  The real fact is that a person entering into an agreement like that has no choice.  The Chief Justice pointed out that business people seem to think that there is some kind of magic in arbitration proceedings for which they have to pay than there is in judicial proceedings before an independent judge paid by the State to do the job for which they prefer to pay a layman.  I would like to see arbitration done away with altogether, but I say that reform in that direction is absolutely necessary and can wait no longer.</P>
    <P>In every contract providing for arbitration there should be a provision that the arbitrator should have power to award the costs of the arbitration. What is it that happens at present? There is a claim, say, for £50 or a £100 on an insurance policy.  The company disclaims liability and the matter must go to arbitration.  Very often a poor ignorant person has to go to arbitration in these matters.  The arbitrator has no power to award costs.  The arbitration is held and perhaps there is sufficient money for the person involved to place his case before an arbitrator or arbitrators.  The arbitrator makes his award and sits down on it until somebody pays him for it and the insurance company will not pay him because they know perfectly well that it will be against them.  Unless that person, with a claim of £50 or £100, is in a position to pay as much as the claim which is the subject matter in dispute is worth for the costs of the arbitrator, he will never hear how the arbitrator has decided.  That is an evil that brooks no further delay, I suggest, and it ought to be remedied at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I have said a lot of hard things about this Bill and about the Government that introduced this Bill.  I want to end on a note of congratulation.  I do not often congratulate the Government but I do congratulate them on this, that they have seen the error of their way in one respect.  Very great moral <Col N="2172" /> damage was done some years ago when the Fianna Fáil Publicity or Propaganda Bureau or whatever it was&mdash;perhaps Deputy Donnelly was responsible for it&mdash;issued a huge advertisement in which they set forth a detailed list of the salaries of the judges, starting with the Chief Justice at £4,000 a year and continuing with the salaries of the Supreme Court judges at £3,000 a year. Deputy Little and Senator Comyn, in the continuation of the motion I have already read in 1929 recommended as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee are of opinion that there should be no increase in the cost of the Supreme Court...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have read this part before.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... until the increased prosperity of the country warrants it and until the volume of business in the superior courts urgently requires it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They went on and further they recommended&mdash;Deputy Little and Senator Comyn&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;any changes made in the Supreme Court should be accompanied by a reduction of salary in the light of a comparative study of the salaries paid to judges of equal rank in other European countries; for instance, in France, where the scale of judicial salaries is much lower than the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement and that advertisement to which I have referred may have been good political propaganda for the Fianna Fáil Party, but it did great moral damage in this country.  I am glad to see&mdash;and I congratulate them upon it&mdash;that the Government have now seen that even though they could get political kudos and public-house votes from holding up the judiciary of this country to contempt, as they did, it is not a thing they ought to stand over as a Government, so that we have both sides of the House committed to the independence of a properly paid judiciary, a judiciary that is not to be the sport of political propaganda any more and no more will Fianna Fáil, or anybody else, whether as a Government or in opposition, or whether they want votes or do not want votes, go out and say: &ldquo;We are out to cut the judges' <Col N="2173" /> salaries.&rdquo;  I congratulate the Government sincerely and not cynically on that change of front.  I think it is a proper thing that that should be recognised&mdash;and I am making no cheap debating point in raising this here to-day&mdash;on both sides of the House and that there should be no further effort to gain votes at the expense of high principles.</P>

      <P>What I want to say on this Bill is more or less from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street.  Deputy Costello has covered the technical aspects of this legislation with great ability and in detail, but I want to draw the attention of the Government to certain matters which one might have expected a Bill of this kind to touch upon and which do not seem to be dealt with.  Deputy Costello, in another connection, has pointed out that it is a very fundamental right of the citizen to enter the courts for the purpose of getting judgment in any matter wherein his rights are jeopardised.  The Constitution is extremely solicitous to secure that right to every citizen, but we find that, in practice, while the Constitutional right is preserved, many would-be litigants are constrained to forego justice because they cannot afford the cost that litigation imposes upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very well remember when the Land Act of 1932 or 1933 was passing through this House, a very scandalous section of that Act was defended on the ground that the alternative method of collecting debts claimed by the Land Commission was made desirable by the fact that the cost of court proceedings to recover them was too high, and that it was in the interest of the tenant purchaser that the courts should be set aside and that the sheriff should be authorised to make seizures without reference to the court at all, because this procedure would spare them the monstrous costs that were levied on proceedings by the Land Commission to recover annuities which they believed to be due.  Now, of course, from the expedient adopted in the Land Act of 1933, the most evil consequences flowed, and I am happy to think that litigation is at present proceeding which will <Col N="2174" /> require the courts to pass on the effectiveness of that legislation, and if the courts decide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your suggestion, Sir.  If a situation arises whereunder litigants in those matters and all other matters will be required to approach the courts in the usual way, we will find ourselves face to face with a situation which calls forth the strongest possible condemnation from the supporters of the Government itself.  We will find a situation created whereunder ordinary litigants in this country will have to pay costs which every supporter of the Government has already denounced as grossly excessive and sufficiently excessive to justify a very serious interference with the normal functioning of the judiciary in the country.  The simple remedy for that would be to get up and clamour for an all-round cut in the costs of the High Court and the courts of minor jurisdiction in this country.  To my mind, that would be a fatal mistake, but what I think the situation calls for now is that provision should be made for an inquiry into the whole question of the cost of the administration of justice in this country and the best method whereby the process of the court could be made available, not only in theory but in practice, to every citizen, be he rich or poor, and that there will be secured to every citizen, even though he be a poor man, the full process of the law against the wealthiest corporation which would seek to infringe his constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter touched upon in this Bill which presents itself to the ordinary layman in a way which is perhaps slightly different from that in which it presents itself to the lawyer.  The ordinary litigant down the country who starts proceedings in the Circuit Court finds that before he can get his case heard at all months elapse. After an appeal is brought from the decision of the Circuit judge, years may elapse before a conclusive decision <Col N="2175" /> is arrived at.  That simply means that justice is not available to the people at all.  Because it is of the very essence of efficient administration that it should be rapidly available to litigants.  The effect of dilatory administration of the law is to create feuds and ill-feeling and possibly crime where such things should not arise at all.  I have repeatedly pointed out in this House to more than one Minister for Justice that the delays in the Circuit Courts and in the High Courts are defeating the ends of justice. I put it to the Minister that while he is passing this legislation through the House now, adequate steps should be taken to secure that people who have differences could go to court and get a verdict within a reasonable time.  I consider the maximum delay that should be imposed upon a litigant would be the time to elapse between the cause of action arising and the next session of the court in the area where the litigating parties dwell.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has referred to Section 49 of this Bill.  I want to join with him most earnestly in protesting against the principle laid down there. I am well aware that the same old story is going to be told in connection with this section as is told in all similar circumstances. That is that while there is some slight infringement in the fundamental principles of the independence of the judiciary there are ample safeguards.  We hear that daily told, time and time again, in respect of fundamental principles that are being encroached upon in this House. We are always told that we might encroach with safety, that there are ample safeguards.  In every single case where that undertaking has been given consequences have flown from the encroachment on those fundamental principles and these are consequences of a most disastrous kind.</P>
    <P>We all know that one of the most valuable things we have in this country is the absolute independence and incorruptibility of the judiciary, which does give the whole body politic a sense of security; that at least as long as the citizens can go into the courts they have an absolute guarantee that there is someone there who will vindicate <Col N="2176" /> their rights, without any possibility of an Executive penalising the judge for his impartiality and possibly for his courage in giving what is an unpopular verdict from the Government point of view.  Now, one branch of the judiciary are going to be made liable to reprimand, or they are removable by the Minister for Justice after receiving a report from a committee of judges and the Attorney-General.  On the surface it looks perfectly all right.  You are going to get the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General examining a complaint made by the Minister for Justice coldly and judicially returning their report and the Minister for Justice absolutely restricted by the terms of that report.  The fact remains that once you create a situation whereunder you can say to a district justice, &ldquo;Now, mind your step or the Minister for Justice shall start trouble with you,&rdquo; at that moment the independence of the judiciary is gone.</P>
    <P>We all know that any member of the judiciary can be removed from office on a motion passed by this House with a certain majority.  The Minister for Justice might say to-day to a judge of the superior court or of a court of inferior jurisdiction: &ldquo;If you pursue the line you are pursuing I will remove you from office.&rdquo;  Of course it is necessary that there should be some machinery whereby when a man is patently unfit for his duties and for his office he should be removed from office.  But it is deliberately laid down that the machinery to remove him is one that commands the support not only of the Government's supporters but of the vast majority of the elected representatives of the people.  That is done in order to make it completely impossible to remove a judge.  That is done to create a situation under which the judge is as independent as it is humanly possible to make him, once he has been elevated to the Bench.</P>
    <P>Now, we have for the first time a point where the independence of the judiciary is to be contracted.  The whole history of legislation in regard to the judiciary from the earliest times has been one of steady extension of judicial independence at the expense <Col N="2177" /> of the Executive.  The stronger democracy has grown the more insistent it has become that the judiciary shall be independent of the Executive.  The stronger democracy is everywhere the stronger you will find the judiciary.  The moment you have an autocracy or dictatorship in history or at the present day, that very moment you will find that the first organ at which autocracy strikes is the judiciary.  Dictatorships always strike first at the judiciary.  That is the first element that the dictator wants to get under his control. You are taking power in this Bill towards contracting the independence of the judiciary and bringing it within striking distance of the Executive.  What I want to say to Deputies on the other side is this: do try to remember that a day will certainly dawn when Fianna Fáil will not be the Government, and when the independence of the judiciary will be a matter of vital concern to every member and every supporter of that Party.  It is so easy to forget when you want to have a skelp at somebody who is politically offensive to you that the day may come when the independence of the holder of that office may mean the difference to you between slavery and liberty.</P>
    <P>Those of us, and there are many in this House, who have lived outside this country know what an essential difference it makes to the whole enjoyment of individual liberty to have an independent judiciary.  Many of us have seen the effects of having an elected judiciary which has to depend for continuation in office on the goodwill of the mass of the voters and who, in certain circumstances, will allow themselves to be swayed by popular clamour for a particular verdict though, according to their own consciences as judges, the verdict should go the other way.  The moment that situation develops, every man in the State becomes the bond slave of a tyrannical government.  We have seen during the last twelve months time and time again in hours of the most violent political stress, political leaders going into the courts of this country and being delivered from jail by the <Col N="2178" /> High Courts.  We have seen all the most fundamental rights of the members of one political Party assailed by the members of another political Party in the name of the law and we have seen the members of one political Party go into the courts and upset the Executive.  Why have they been able to do it?  Because a long tradition of independence gave the judiciary that quality which made it possible for them to examine the question dispassionately and to decide the issues raised in a purely legalistic way without any reference whatever to what the effect on the popular mind might be.</P>
    <P>What alarms me about this proposal is its specious harmlessness.  To my mind a section of this kind coming before Dáil Eireann containing a perfectly bald statement asking for power to be conferred on the Minister for Justice to dismiss a judge whenever he wanted to, would be far less dangerous than the type of section we have here because the average Deputy would instinctively recoil from giving an arbitrary power to a politician to dismiss the judiciary at his own sweet will.  But here we have the safeguards, the exhortation to break in upon the principle under cover of these adequate safeguards, and what I want to impress upon the House now is this: The safeguards are not worth a thread if you once let the principle go, and I am profoundly convinced that nobody knows that better than the Attorney-General himself.  I cannot imagine how he has allowed himself to be put in the position of fathering a proposal of this kind.  He knows well the evils that will flow from interference with the independence of the judiciary.  He knows well that whatever advantages may arise from the ability to check or reprove a district justice, the corresponding evils infinitely outweigh them. It is impossible to get perfection in any human institution and all we can try to do is to get the greatest good. We have something that heretofore has been sacrosanct and of incalculable value to everybody, both minority and majority.  Section 49 is going to strike a deadly blow at that whole principle <Col N="2179" /> and I appeal to the Attorney-General to mend his hand in that particular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am fully aware of the present position, and I am asking the Attorney-General to allow the present position at least to stand.  I would be very much interested to hear his defence of the proposed middle course that he adumbrates in this Bill. I know that Deputy Costello and his colleagues, when they formed the Government of this country, were responsible for a proposal to validate majority verdicts in criminal trials, and Deputy Costello has read out the trenchant observations that that proposal drew from the Opposition, as it then was.  I want to join with the Opposition, as it then was, the Government as it now is, in a remonstrance against the system of majority verdicts in criminal trials, more especially in trials where the penalty prescribed by law is death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jury system is a strange system inasmuch as its historical development is extremely obscure.  Many learned works have been written on the exact way in which the jury system did develop.  Many of the most learned jurists differ as to when it first was instituted and how it really developed in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. But, however it developed, it has come down to us as a system whereunder 12 men or 12 men and women are required to declare somebody guilty by a unanimous verdict before he is adjudged by a court of law or before he is condemned to whatever penalty the law might prescribe.  I can imagine that in civil trials, that is to say, in actions, the unanimous verdict is not of such vital importance because, unless I am mistaken, the application of the jury system to cases of that character does not go as far back in history as the jury system does in the case of criminal trials. But it seems to me that where a man is on trial for his life and where, after hearing the evidence and the charge from the judge, and such observations as prosecuting counsel and counsel <Col N="2180" /> for the defence have to make, and there still remain three men out of the 12 who believe the man to be innocent, no legislature can properly lay down that the prisoner at the bar should be made subject to the supreme penalty.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to argue as to why a jury should not consist of nine men or why a jury should not consist of six men, and if you can make a case that nine men would constitute as good a jury as 12 it seems reasonable enough to say if you can get nine men out of 12 to agree, if the other three did not happen to be in the box would you not have it a unanimous jury?  The only answer I can make to that is that all I require is that whatever number you have in the box will be unanimous in the judgment they give before any person shall be made liable on the capital charge.</P>
    <P>I am not sure, if I was pressed for a logical reason to defend that, that I could find one.  But I say that in a matter of such grave consequence, the lesson of centuries of experience ought to guide us unless we have some very grave reason for departing from the system which we have inherited.  The jury system has obtained in this country since the 12th century; it has obtained in England possibly since the ninth century; and it seems to have worked very well.  I think the vast body of experienced lawyers would say that very few people escape punishment because juries have failed to agree when they ought to agree.  I think a great many lawyers will agree that a large number of people have been spared from grave injustice because one or two men have had the courage to stand out on a jury and resist the majority of the men in the box who were swayed one way or another by some salient fact in the case as stated by the prosecution.  I freely confess that I find myself rather at a loss to produce any logical argument to defend the unanimous verdict as against the majority verdict.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  I find myself forced back to this sound <Col N="2181" /> ground for resisting change.  I know that the system has worked well in the past; I know it has resulted in substantial justice being done.  I hear no adequate reason advanced for changing the system; and until I hear such reason advanced, I do not wish to risk the evils that may arise from a change. If the Attorney-General will turn that over in his mind, I think he will find perhaps a little logic in the reason I put forward, but a great deal of commonsense.  The new broom is always anxious to discover a short cut, a more efficient way of doing the job, and he suddenly discovers that in choosing what seems to him a more efficient way to do the job he has only chosen a way that was in use 1,000 years ago and which was altered in order to avoid some abuse that manifested itself as a result of that way of doing the job, and when he goes back unwittingly to the old way of doing it, the very self-same abuse begins to manifest itself that obtained before the change was made.  We have the system of unanimous verdicts; we have the 12 men.  It has worked very well.  It has resulted in substantial justice; and I appeal to the Government to leave well alone in view of the fact that they can advance no substantial reason why they should alter it.</P>
      <P>I would be glad if the Attorney-General would address himself to the question of costs which I mentioned earlier and to the extremely tedious progress of litigation in the Circuit Courts and in the Appeal Court which hears appeals from the Circuit Courts, and to consider ways and means (1) of bringing costs within the capacity of the poorest person in the country to pay; and (2) to consider ways and means of speeding up litigation so that people will get verdicts within a reasonable time after the cause of action has arisen.  I do not want to repeat myself, because I dealt with this question during the Attorney-General's absence, and doubtless he will look into it.  I also invite his special attention to Section 49 and to that question of the majority verdict. I urge on him to drop Section 49 and to give us back our unanimous verdicts of 12 good men and true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have all to give a vote on the subject, we have to make our minds at rest with regard to provisions that strike us as important. There are two sections which I should like the Attorney-General to explain or defend&mdash;Sections 22 and 57.  In these you have the provision that where an action is taken in the court and the court finds it has no jurisdiction, the judge is empowered to give such costs as the defendant would have been entitled to if the case had been tried and the decision was against the complainant.  I should like to know what is the purpose of such a proposal as that, whether it is a new idea in the law, or whether there are grave abuses prevailing in the matter of people bringing actions in the court for which there is no jurisdiction, and that it is imperative that means should be taken to stop these abuses.  As the clauses stand they look to me rather an outrage.  If I think I have reasonable cause of action and I find my way to the court and the court, having heard my case&mdash;it looks from the way the sections are worded as if it was expected there would be an argument on the subject&mdash;finds that it has no jurisdiction on the matter the judge is empowered to impoverish me is he likes for daring to go into his court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should every individual be supposed to know the law so well that he should be able to tell on what matters the court has or has not jurisdiction? We are all supposed to know the law.  That is one of these conventions which is accepted, though it seems to me a very ridiculous convention in present circumstances.  I am not going to question it now, but surely it should not be within the power of a judge, as I say, to punish with severity an individual who, thinking he has a grievance against his neighbour, against a corporation, <Col N="2183" /> against the Government, attempts to assert his grievance and to plead his grievance in the court?</P>
    <P>Further, let us consider the more ordinary case, where such a complainant would have employed a solicitor, and the solicitor advises him that he has a case and he brings the case to court.  Mind you, the Bill does not propose to punish the solicitor although he has been hall-marked by the Incorporated Law Society as a proper person to advise on and practise the law.  The Bill proposes that it is the person who has dared to consult a solicitor who must pay the damages. Surely if there is punishment due in the case, the punishment is due to the solicitor who allows his client to prevail upon him notwithstanding his advice that the court has no jurisdiction. I should certainly like to hear the Attorney-General's defence of what seems to me an outrageous proposal.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point which, I think, has been just slightly touched upon by Deputy Dillon.  This Bill is largely conceived under the idea that there is no such thing as poor people or people of only moderate means in this country.  The Bill is not of the slightest importance to 80 per cent. of the people of this country, and I cannot understand why in the new situation, which applies not only in this but in every other country, the Government can afford to look on at a position where it is enmeshing people in law of every kind, and where the lives of the most rural of the people are being organised and urbanised by legislation every day. The Government is offering no machinery and proposing no means of enlightening the people as to their rights, or enabling them to assert their rights in law.  We will be told, of course, that the poor man has no difficulty in finding a solicitor to take up his case.  I wonder if that is quite true. Remember, the poor man does not, any more than anybody else, like to go begging for favours to a solicitor, and even getting the favour from a solicitor often means that he pays much dearer for it in the end than if he had the means to pay the solicitor at the beginning. Even if he did find the solicitor, <Col N="2184" /> in a lot of the cases which concern him nowadays, getting the solicitor is only half the job.  He is facing an insurance company, with regard, say, to employers' liability.  He is facing an insurance company with regard to a road accident or something of that sort, and the solicitor has got to speculate on all the expenses that will be attached to bringing the case to a successful fruition; he has got to finance the case for his client.  Is that satisfactory to the Government? We passed here elaborate legislation enabling people to get damages in cases of accident in their employment, but we offer them no means whatever of getting their rights under that Act.  I think lawyer Deputies opposite will admit that there are several hundred pounds expenses before the case is decided in the court; that senior counsel might be required; that all sorts of interlocutory motions and all that sort of thing may have to be faced; that appeals may have to be faced, and that the best possible way for a wealthy person to defeat a poor person's action against him, particularly if he thinks that poor person has a good case, is by a system of appeal.</P>
    <P>From my experience, the position has become extremely serious with regard to this question of enabling people to avail of their rights under the law.  At present, for instance, in a great many towns there is quite a ferment with regard, for instance, to town tenants' grievances, or what are alleged to be town tenants' grievances.  We passed an Act here in 1931 of which, with great respect to the House, I do not think more than four or six Deputies had even an approximate understanding, and I greatly doubt if the average lawyer throughout the country has much of an understanding of it either.  In my opinion, a lot of the grievances which are being complained of at present are covered by the 1931 Act, but where are people to get information with regard to that Act or to get advice upon it?  To get useful advice on such a complicated piece of legislation would require a large amount of money, and it is not alone people in poverty but people of small means who are practically outside the <Col N="2185" /> law at present because their opportunities of asserting or defending their rights within the law or defending themselves within the law are so very limited on account of the expense. Many Deputies could tell of their experience since the Road Transport Act was passed in 1932.  They could tell of people, who, simply through failing to understand a rather difficult Act and lack of opportunity of having the law explained to them, have landed themselves in trouble so that their whole means of livelihood are destroyed. That, of course, is not quite the same thing.  In that case the trouble is an excusable ignorance of the law, but the real point I want to emphasise is that with the present spate of legislation, which is affecting the lives of the people every day, the Government will have to take notice, I think, of the fact that so many people are, first of all, finding it difficult to understand the law, and again, finding it practically impossible to get their rights under the law.  I think it would be found, if there were an examination made of the position in other countries, that almost every country in the world has faced that problem in recent years.  I think it would be found, for instance, that in Sweden and in Belgium&mdash;in those two countries at least&mdash;provision is made for enabling poor people to take an action without having to pay the stamp fees and other charges that belong to the initial stages of a serious action, and further, to get assistance of the best lawyers in their actions.  In the South American Republics, as far as I know, there are elaborate systems of enabling poor people to make use of the courts.  Again, I say that as far as I am concerned, at all events, I take very little interest in this Bill. At the most, I think it can affect only about 20 per cent. of the people, and I suggest that the rights of the other 80 per cent. are worthy of the attention of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. R. Holohan Mr. R. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill because of the extra cost and expense that are put on the people of the country.  First of all you have the appointment of two judges at a salary <Col N="2186" /> of £3,000 each, and another person at a salary of £1,700.  At the same time you had here a couple of hours ago a Bill passed in this House for the provision and maintenance of pounds in this country for the confiscated cattle of the unfortunate people.  Owners whose cattle are confiscated and brought to those pounds are called upon to contribute their share of the salaries of those judges.  I am not arguing the point as to whether £3,000 is too much or too little for those judges.  I know they are entitled to a decent payment, but I think this is a time during which appointments which cost so much should be avoided, in order not to increase the burden of the unfortunate people in the country who are not able to pay their way at the moment.  I oppose the Bill from that point of view&mdash;because of the unreasonable amount of expense that is going to be involved.  I do not believe it is necessary that those judges should be appointed.  They could be done without for a few years more, until the people of the country are a little more prosperous and in a better position to meet such expense.  When the big majority of the people are hardly able to get sufficient to maintain themselves and their families, this is hardly the time to make further appointments of people with salaries such as are proposed in the Bill.  I think it is about time to call a halt to such appointments, and I oppose the Bill because of the expense involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>My opposition to this Bill is based on grounds somewhat similar to those indicated by Deputy Holohan.  I oppose it on the grounds of the expense involved for the community; and, secondly, because I think that the time is not appropriate for the introduction of the Bill.  Everybody knows that the people engaged in the chief industry in the country are in a precarious condition economically and unless there is a desperate need for any legislation involving the expenditure of further money, now is not the time to introduce it.  The position of the agriculturist at the moment is that he is not able to bear the cost of <Col N="2187" /> the present administration, not to speak of any additions to it.  He does not believe that this is an appropriate time for the introduction of a Bill such as this, however much it may be needed.  There does not appear, to the mind of any ordinary layman, to be any extraordinary urgency for the introduction of the Bill now.  It would appear to the agricultural community that instead of there being any great necessity for additions to the judiciary, either in the High Courts or in the Circuit Courts, there is a necessity at the moment for reduction in the number of public servants.  If we take the average farmer's position, he seldom appears before any court, either on the civil or criminal side. That has been the general experience, though in the last year his contact with the law has been more frequent than hitherto.</P>
      <P>For instance, if the farmer is backward in the payment of either his annuities or rates, he is denied the benefit of the ordinary courts.  He is not brought before a judge of the High Court, a judge of the Circuit Court or a justice of the lower courts. He is left to the tender mercies of the registrar or the bailiff to decide his case.  The mere fact of there being judges does not affect him very much. If his son, a young man, joins a particular political organisation, as many young men do, which is not favourable to the Government of the day, and if, in the exuberance of his youth, he does something that does not appeal to the Government, he is not brought before the ordinary courts.  He is not brought before a high court or a lower court.  The ordinary judicial systems have nothing whatever to do with him.  He is brought before a substitute court, a military court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a farmer's son commits a political offence he is not brought before a judge of the High Court or of the lower court.  He is brought before the Military Tribunal. So that there appears to the agricultural community to be no necessity at the moment for any extension of the courts.  To the layman in the country, there appears to be no justification for the extension of the number of judges. He objects to the expenses that it will entail.  He is already burdened with sufficient expense and he finds it very hard to manage.  In expenditure of public money, particularly in a time of economic crisis such as exists at the moment, the country expects value for every pound expended.  There should be pound for pound value, but in this case what do we find?  A pound for the farmer at his own expense and pounds for aspiring Fianna Fáil legal luminaries at the farmer's expense. There is no equity whatever in the matter. These, shortly, are the principal grounds on which I, for one, as representing the agricultural community, base my opposition to the Bill.  The Bill, in itself, may be in parts a good Bill, but there are certain sections of it which do not appear so good.  There are certain sections of the Bill which, if it were introduced even in a reasonable time and if the necessity arose for it, one might also have to criticise. I do not intend to spend any portion of my time in criticising the various portions of the Bill with perhaps one exception.  That is Section 73, which provides for a majority verdict.</P>

      <P>I certainly would vote against the inclusion of the majority verdict in this Bill for the reason that I hold that in criminal cases a prisoner is entitled to the verdict of his peers. That is an old way of putting it.  He was entitled to be judged by his peers, by all his peers, and the verdict to be given was to be the unanimous verdict of the jury.  We have down through the ages that expression emphasised on several occasions by judges on the Bench.  It is familiar to almost everyone who reads the paper that in extreme cases the judge, when charging the jury, lays particular stress upon the point that the accused is to be given the full benefit of any doubts that exist in the minds of any particular juror or in the minds of the jury as a whole. If that is the judge's view in charging a jury what would be his opinion, if he could express it, on the majority verdict of nine of a particular jury, which left it open to three out of 12 to be opposed to the verdict of the majority?  If the evidence in a particular criminal case was so strong as to convince three out of 12 men that the case against a defendant was not proved, that they would not agree with <Col N="2190" /> the majority of their brethren that the criminal was guilty, is not that a certain demonstration that there was a large element of doubt in that case?  To my mind, it would be certain verification of the judge's charge, that if there was a doubt the defendant should get the benefit.  I do not know in how many countries the principle of majority verdicts prevails.  It is certainly a principle to which I would object very strongly being introduced here at any time.</P>
      <P>There are other sections in the Bill to which one might possibly take exception, but I wish principally to voice my objection to this Bill on the ground that this is not an appropriate time to introduce it; that the expense incurred will have to be borne by people who will get the least benefit; that there appears to be no urgent necessity for its introduction, and that the proposal might wait until times were more prosperous; in other words, to recall the public expression of members of the Government a couple of years ago that this was not an appropriate occasion for incurring additional judicial expenditure because of the depression. That argument prevails much more strongly now than it did then.  This is certainly not a time when any extra expenditure should be incurred in this State for any purpose, without dire necessity or proper reasons.  This is not a time at which there is any necessity for the introduction of this Bill, and for that reason I am opposed to the Second Reading.</P>

But it is not very many years since the Deputy spent a whole night here trotting along the Lobby in support of the Tribunal.  The matter was so urgent then that a meeting of the Seanad had to be held in order to rush a Bill through in the middle of the night.  The Deputy now objects to a crack of his own whip.  He also complained that farmers cannot go to court in cases in which the sheriff is sent down.  A rather faster procedure was carried out in 1924, when we had the income tax people and the sheriffs <Col N="2191" /> chasing after income tax due in 1919&mdash; some of which was not due at all, but which we did not get the chance of proving.</P>

But he voted in favour of them, although he says now that he is opposed to such a proposal.  I do not know what kind of a man the Deputy is, because the three things that he complains of are the three things that he supported and voted for ten years ago.  The Deputy referred to the convincing manner in which juries are addressed.  We need only go back a few months to wonder how some juries were convinced.  For instance, a jury was convinced that farmers were innocent and that labourers were guilty in seizure cases.  The farmers who were brought up were found innocent and allowed out, while the labourers were found guilty, the evidence against both being the same.  The labourers went to jail and the farmers went home.  I wonder what kind of a jury was in that case.</P>

Does Deputy Corry remember the statement he made in this House that no man was worth £1,000 a year?  What a happy knack he has of forgetting his own actions! I do not want to talk about the legal side of this Bill, because that has been dealt with very ably by members of the legal profession on both sides of the House.  I am certainly challenging the right of the Government to bring in the Bill, and to put taxation on the people at this time, seeing they have made no case whatever for its introduction.  I did not even hear the Attorney-General making the case that the High Court or the Supreme Court could not function, except at great inconvenience, without an addition being made to the number of judges.

      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not follow his own example in the past, having regard to what he said about extra expenditure.  It is from that viewpoint that I object to this Bill.  I would be one of the last persons to object to the judiciary, above all others in the State, having salaries in keeping with their responsible positions. That has to be faced.  If we are not able to pay them decent salaries, it would be better to have fewer members of the judiciary and to <Col N="2193" /> pay them well, rather than have Deputy Corry talking about reducing the salaries of judges and everyone else.  That is the line of argument which the Deputy took up in the past. He is committing the country to more expense and taxation by standing by the Government now.  I was hoping that the Deputy would say something about the advertisement that the Fianna Fáil Party put into the newspapers. I remember it, as I read it more than once.  It is the greatest pity that the Deputy could not produce it to-night, in order to inscribe on it the number of extra positions and the amount of extra salaries that have been added since the Fianna Fáil Government came into power.  I would like to have a comparison made with the numbers at the time that the cry was &ldquo;Down with salaries!&rdquo; and the present time.  It is from that point of view that I object to the Bill.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Corry and many members of the Fianna Fáil Party could only speak their minds, having regard to the statements they made, they would object to this Bill just as much as I do.  I suppose they have to answer to the Party Whip.  That is the unfortunate thing about Parties and Governments.  Deputy Corry does not believe in this Bill, and does not want it any more than I do, but he has not the pluck to stand up and to say so. With these few words I have made my protest against the Bill in the shortest time that it was possible for me to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise with diffidence on this Bill because my reading of history leads me to the conclusion that any real reform that has ever taken place in regard to the administration of the law has been forced upon the legal profession from outside. Possibly, a member of the legal profession is not the most valued contributor to a debate of this sort.  There are, however, a few thoughts arising out of practice in both branches of the legal profession, extending over 27 years, that I feel may be helpful to some members of this House.  I begin by an appeal to the Government to reconsider Section 73, the clause which provides that a verdict of nine <Col N="2194" /> members of a jury in a criminal trial is, in fact, to be deemed the verdict of the twelve.  It is, I think, an unfortunate provision.  It may or may not have been justified in the past as a temporary measure, but that it should creep into our law with the permanence that will follow from the passage of this Bill is, I feel, a matter for regret.  It is not the mere regret of breaking with an established usage or an old tradition.  It is a feeling that has been prompted by experience in the defence of prisoners.  The prisoners that I have prosecuted have been few, but up to 1924 I defended very many.  Looking back on it I have had the feeling that, where there was a disagreement by a jury, in most cases there was some colour of reason for that disagreement, and that more especially in criminal cases involving grave issues, involving the life of a citizen or involving a long period of penal servitude.  That disagreement sometimes is an expression of the doubt that ought to be the prisoner's privilege.  Sometimes it is in the nature of a piece of unmerited good luck.  The instances in which the real criminal will escape because 12 ordinary men fail to agree are so negligible that I suggest to the Government they might consider whether they are worth legislating for.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to look at another aspect of the case: that the real criminal usually has a kind of propensity towards crime.  If it should so happen, as I have said, that by unmerited good luck he escapes by successive disagreements the probability is that that man will commit another crime, and the next time he is put on trial for his fresh offence, it is highly improbable that he will have similar good fortune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in my view largely a matter for the consideration of the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General. They have, of course, statistical information available to them that is not available to me.  I merely put it in this way: that I think Section 73 is worthy of reconsideration by the Government and that, possibly, when they are reconsidering Section 73 they will advert to a kindred matter which many consider an unfortunate omission from this <Col N="2195" /> Bill.  That is the abolition which took place in 1924 of the right to a jury in a civil action where the claim was for unliquidated damages arising out of contract.  In the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, it was provided that every citizen had the right to demand a jury in any action that originated in a wrong, independent of contract, but on the strict reading of the statute it is manifest that in any action arising out of contract, as distinct from a wrong independent of contract, he has not that right.  The result is that in a type of action, such as one for breach of promise of marriage, which in a way is essentially an action founded on a wrong though in form based on a contract, there is no right to a jury.  Similarly, in any type of action, say for breach of contract by dismissal or arising out of the sale of goods, or out of a building contract where you may have the most grievous charges of fraud levelled against a man, he is not entitled to have these issues tried by a jury.  To most people the difference between a charge of fraud and a charge of crime is so slight as not to be worth noticing.  I ask the Government to consider whether in this Bill they could not restore the right to which we were accustomed in this country to have jury actions for unliquidated actions tried by a jury.  I do not suggest for a moment that we should revert to the practice which had existed previous to 1924, of having what are known as liquidated or very definite claims arising out of contract tried by a jury.  I feel that that probably was a very good reform.  It was in the interests of the commercial community.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the hearing of appeals from the Circuit Court dealt with in Sections 39 and 40 of the Bill I feel that the Bill may not prove altogether successful.  Under Section 39, which deals with civil actions tried by a Circuit Court judge and a jury, there is provision for appeal to the High Court, sitting in Dublin.  In substance, the re-hearing is to be upon the judge's notes.  I join with, at least, one appeal that I heard&mdash;I was out of the House for some time&mdash;for reconsideration of that clause and the principle enshrined <Col N="2196" /> in it.  I agree, to a large extent, with the case made for reconsideration.  It may be that, in certain types of action, tried in a particular county, justice would not be done where the findings of fact are by a jury drawn from a very limited area.  It might well be desirable, in the interests of justice, that a fuller right of appeal than that contained in Section 39 should be given. There has also been a certain amount of criticism of Section 40, which provides for the rehearing of Circuit Court appeals other than those in jury cases and certain other cases which are rare. Most of the appeals from the Circuit Court will fall to be dealt with under Section 40 and I venture to put it to the House with some force that it is not the most desirable form of appeal that could be devised from a Circuit Court judge to one other judge, whether he be a High Court or a Supreme Court judge.  Public opinion would probably be better satisfied if the ultimate and final decision in Circuit Court appeals were to be based upon the opinions of, at least, two judges. If the appeal were to be from the Circuit Court judge to two judges, it is obvious that, even in the event of the two judges disagreeing, the litigants would know that two minds concurred &mdash;that the Circuit Court judge and one at least, of the judges of the Appeal Court concurred in a certain finding. It seems to me that there is a good deal of force in the criticism that has been advanced in respect of this section and that it should receive some consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Curran has raised the question of the expense of the Bill.  That is, of course, a very important aspect of the whole matter and the House might be assisted if it knew to what extent the administration of justice on the civil side is self-supporting. There is a very large contribution by litigants in the way of the fees and the stamp duties they pay in instituting and carrying on their various cases, many of which are virtually of a non-contentious nature and do not entail any call at all upon the time of the judges.  The total amount of the fees and stamp duties so paid must be very great and must go a very long <Col N="2197" /> way to case the burden upon the taxpayer. But, assuming that there is an appreciable burden remaining on the taxpayer, it may well be considered whether the present system is not unfair to some citizens who are unlucky enough to be drawn into litigation. In the Circuit Court a good deal of the litigation is, in a sense, wanton, and could be avoided altogether, but people will go on with their actions. I have known small farmers who, under the system that existed since 1924, started, perhaps irrationally and indiscreetly, an action in the Circuit Court and were brought to the High Court on appeal.  The entire cost of the appeal, including the transcript of the shorthand notes and the fees paid to solicitor and counsel, exceeded £100.  Contrasted with the cost of the hearing of appeals from the county courts prior to 1924, that is a staggering amount.  Then, the entire cost, including fees of solicitor and counsel, in similar cases, ranged from about £5 to a maximum of about £9.  Now, in many cases, they run to £100.  That is an appalling burden to place upon a small farmer or a small trader.  I venture to think that if Deputies from rural constituencies inquire into cases that come from their own areas, they will find that the existing system of hearing Circuit Court appeals does, undoubtedly, impose a very severe burden on the citizens concerned.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters which I should like to see dealt with in this Bill or, if not appropriate to this Bill, then in some other Bill having to do with the administration of justice.  One of these matters is provision for poor persons carrying on litigation.  In at least one other country, the enactments relating to the administration of justice provide for the payment out of public funds of such stamp duties and fees as the State would enact, in cases of litigation carried on by a poor person.  They provide also for payment of a trifling amount for travelling and similar expenses and for some little remuneration for the solicitor.  The barrister engaged in the case is expected to give his services gratuitously, and <Col N="2198" /> that service is apparently given gladly and freely by busy advocates.</P>
    <P>I should like to see established the basis of a system like that in this country whereby the poor person, subject to supervision of course, would be able to resort to the courts of the land without being liable to pay State fees or stamp duties and whereby there would be an organisation set up which would place at his disposal gratuitously the services of solicitors and barristers. I am sure that the services from both branches of the profession would be available if such an organisation to make them available were set up. Another system that has found favour in, at least, one continental country is a system whereby, in certain classes of case, there is no advocacy at all.  That greatly cases the burden of litigation. Many cases of this class could be carried on without the aid of paid or professional advocates, but if a professional advocate has a right of audience in court, and one of the litigants invites that aid, it is inevitable that his opponent will also invoke professional aid, thereby greatly increasing the burden of expense.</P>
    <P>The points arising on this Bill are so largely matters of detail and so much better suited to Committee Stage that I find it difficult to make a Second Reading speech in reference to it.  I have dealt with this matter of the majority verdict because I think that it involves a point of principle.  I think that the absence of a jury in cases of unliquidated damages also involves a point of principle.  I have suggested to the House that a majority verdict may be necessary in times of stress or excitement or passion.  The administration of justice in a certain type of criminal case has also been touched upon by Deputies in this House; I refer to what Deputies have said about the trial of certain criminal cases by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress on the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving that motion, I wish, in the first place, to express a mild protest at the manner in which this particular motion has been side-tracked by a Government majority so that it comes up now at the tag-end of the financial year 1934-35, when, apparently, it has little meaning.  That was a deliberate attempt, by the use of a Parliamentary majority behind the Government Party, to side-track a motion standing in the name of a private member&mdash;a motion which had direct, and very direct, application to a very grave state of affairs in the country, and to a particular financial year&mdash;in order that, when it would eventually come up in spite of majority forces, it might then be argued that it had lost its point because that financial year was drawing to a close.  However, far from agreeing that because the financial year, 1934-35, is now drawing to a close and that on that account this particular motion has lost some of its point or some of its effect, I am inclined to the view that it is all for the best that the motion has been delayed deliberately for so long, because we are now in the unfortunate position of being able to see and experience, each one for himself, what was foreseen many months ago when this resolution was tabled: that a point would be reached owing to <Col N="2200" /> the economic war when an industry, hammered and battered and deprived of its profit, would be unable to continue to pay similar overhead charges to what it was called upon to pay when profits were coming out of the industry. That particular statement or that state of affairs is not met or remedied by anybody deliberately blinding their eyes to the existence of such a state of affairs, or by any glib-tongued Deputy or Minister getting up and trotting out the old played-out bogey that there is a political conspiracy at the back of this: that there is not any real indication of inability to pay, but that the public generally are so docile and so easily involved in anti-State conspiracies and dishonest moves to default in their commitments to the State: that the whole state of affairs is due to the work of political conspirators who are anxious for political gain or political purposes to see the State or the local finances of the State go into a bankrupt condition.</P>
    <P>I would say on behalf of this Party &mdash;and we have given many assurances of the fact&mdash;that we are at least as anxious for the welfare, stability and prosperity of this State as the people sitting opposite.  I say that the bankruptcy of local boards or the bankruptcy of this State would be at least as sad a day in the lives of members of this Party as in the lives of any of those who decorate the Government Front Bench at the present moment. I think that it is merely dodging a very difficult problem and closing our eyes to a very tragic state of affairs for any of that stuff to be trotted out from one side of the House or the other.  The mere official returns published by the Department some few days ago indicate that the arrears of rates outstanding on the 31st December had reached the huge figure of £2,100,000.  They indicate that that was an all-over figure; that there was a very serious state of affairs in what might be regarded as the best county from the point of view of ratepaying; and that the whole picture presented by the official returns was an appalling picture for anyone to view, namely, that the percentage of outstanding arrears had reached in many counties <Col N="2201" /> a figure of over 70 per cent.; that 70 per cent. of the rates had been uncollected in a great number of counties with nine months of the year gone; that two counties alone, Mayo and Monaghan, had arrears amounting to less than 50 per cent., and that other counties had arrears outstanding of over 80 per cent. of the total rate.</P>
    <P>Now, the question that must be faced is this: Are over 80 per cent. of the people in those counties deliberately dishonest?  Are they out deliberately to diddle the State?  Are they out, with their eyes open, deliberately to bankrupt the local finances of their county, or is there any other explanation? Is it deliberate fraud on the part of the public, or is it inability, on the part of the ratepayers, to pay? If it is inability to pay, what change of circumstances has come about to account for that inability to pay? Looking at the rate collection returns &mdash;the figures published for the last four years&mdash;we find that on the 31st December, at that period of the year 1931-32, the amount outstanding in that year was 46 per cent.  At the end of the following year, the amount uncollected had risen to 54.5 per cent.  At the end of the next year it had gone up to 60.3 per cent. and at the end of the year closed that figure had jumped to 65.9 per cent.  There you see no sudden conspiracy but a gradual disimprovement, acute in the last two years.</P>
    <P>When we examine the circumstances of this particular country ratepayer over the same period, we find in the last two years there has been a very serious interference by Government politicians to the damage of agricultural industry.  We find the squabble between a few politicians on this side of the water and a few politicians on the other side of the water has brought about a state of affairs that the entry to the market for goods produced by our farmers has been partially closed, and the entry fee has been raised from nothing per finished beast going into the other country to £6 for the finished beast.  It is up to anyone, quite opposed to political parties and divisions, to argue that where an industry had an open <Col N="2202" /> market, and no tax upon its goods going into that market, that the overhead charges on the industry were too heavy.  If when the market was open, and there was no tax upon the animals going into that market, it was sought to convince the people of the country that the overhead charges were too heavy, then when the market is curtailed and the tax is up to £6 on every beast sold, how can it be held that they are still able to pay the same overhead charge?  When the members of the present Government were speaking of overhead charges upon the farming industry, and when there was no economic war or curtailment of the market, or any heavy tax on goods for sale, one after the other, they all stood up in a row and protested against the crushing taxation of the farmers and their inability to pay the overhead charges on their industry.</P>
    <P>I put it to the members of the Government that this particular motion should be accepted as a matter of necessity.  It will do neither the Government nor the political Opposition nor the ratepayers nor those dependent upon local rates any good if this particular state of affairs is prolonged so that the last beast on the farm has to be sold in order to get this year's rates and nothing is left for next year's rates.  We have an appalling state of affairs where the farming community cannot pay annuities, British taxes and local rates, and meet the ferocity and intensity behind the annuities campaign which has brought about this slump in rate-paying, because both payments cannot be met.  We have in connection with the annuities and their non-payment hundreds of pounds worth of goods seized for a debt of £50 or £60 and sold for £50 or £60.  That may appear to some to be a good day's work. But the farmer has been robbed.  His goods have been sold at knock-down prices.  Some &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo; has made easy money.  The annuities have been paid, but then the rate collector comes along.  What is his position and what is the position of the occupant of the farm?  What is the position of the man despoiled of £300 worth of goods which have been knocked down for £50 <Col N="2203" /> or £60 plus costs?  He is unable to pay his rates, so that we have the dismal picture of 50 or 60 per cent. of the rates outstanding for nine months of the year.  We have threats and suspensions, councils dissolved and commissioners replacing them; we have rate collectors dismissed and replaced by others.  Whether it is a county administered by a county council or a Government commissioner we are up against the same problem, where neither Government commissioner nor new rate collector can draw blood from a turnip, particularly if the land annuity sheriff has been there before him.</P>
    <P>I have so far stressed the point that the appalling condition that exists is due to inability to pay.  I have not made any reference to the point that the present Government is bound in honour, if they are prepared to honour the pledged word of their leader, to accept this particular motion.  time and again, and in practically every county of the Irish Free State, Mr. de Valera, as he then was, addressed huge meetings.  At each of these he solemnly pledged his word and that of his Party that if they were elected as the Government in this country, they would de-rate the agricultural land in the Irish Free State. That pledge was made when there was no economic war and no curtailment of the market and no tax on produce. According to him conditions even then were such that when the time came the first act of statesmanship should be that agricultural land should be de-rated. Inside and outside of the Dáil, in the most specific language, President de Valera made that promise from many platforms.  The nearer the general election approached, the more specific were his terms and the more clear and precise his language.  I shall quote for the information of the House some of the promises made by Mr. de Valera on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Speaking at Kells, County Meath, 14th June, 1931, as reported in the <i>Leinster Leader</i> of June 20th, Mr. de Valera used the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers' burden requires to be lightened and it could be effectively <Col N="2204" /> done if they retained at home the three millions of land annuities which were now needlessly being sent over to England every year. Two millions of the three would give complete de-rating to all agricultural holdings, big and small, and to the farm buildings as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That speech was delivered in the County Meath in which there are many large farmers, and everyone of those large farmers had a vote.  In County Meath it was necessary to stress the fact that there would be no discrimination. When he spoke of de-rating, he spoke of de-rating for big farmers as well as small, and he spoke of de-rating for buildings as well as land.  We have heard a lot of talk from the Government Benches in the last year or two when a quick thing was being done that at all events the people had approved of it; that the Government had a mandate; that it had been submitted to the people; that the people had voted, and whether it was right or wrong, that mandate would be respected and that no choice was left to the Government.</P>
    <P>Does not that mandate apply to this particular motion?  Is that speech made in Kells to be explained away by some Deputy Dowdall on the ground that it was not a promise but that it was only a statement?  Is that to be turned away as the reckless statement of an irresponsible or untrustworthy politician?  Is it the light word of a man who did not know what he was talking about?  Was it a promise made merely to gull the farmers of Meath or was it a carefully thought out statement of policy by the alternative President of this country?  Are the Fianna Fáil Party, by their votes on this motion, going to imply that it was only so much chaff thrown out to catch the sparrows; that the leader of their Party at that time was not a man whom they were prepared to back; that his word was not one that deserved to be honoured; and that the argument as to a mandate only applied to the Government when they were acting against the interests of the people and that it was an argument which did not carry weight if it was to be used in the interest of a class of the people?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> That was the Meath statement and in the Meath speech, the point specially made by President de Valera was that he proposed de-rating for all farmers, big and small and for farm buildings as well as land.  Let us pass away from Meath.  Speaking at Newcastle West the President is quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 4th January, 1932, in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What about the five millions they were sending out of the country? That would give them complete de-rating and they would have about one million left to adjust unfair land annuities where extravagant prices were given or encourage schemes of cultivation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He made a speech again on January 18th, 1932.  We were at this time up against a general election.  The language had got to be a lot clearer; the promise had got to be made pat, so that the last farmer anxious for de-rating would be caught in the net and the man to make the promise had got to be the man on top, the man who was likely to be President a month hence, the man who would be head of the legislative machine of this country, and so we had any ambiguity or any looseness of expression removed.  Here is the statement that was made then:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have definitely stated that we will retain three millions in the Irish Exchequer and that two millions out of the three will de-rate agricultural land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;buts&rdquo; and no doubts and no reservations about that &mdash;the clear promise of the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the clear definite statement of the man who is to-day President of the Irish Free State.  This motion is tabled in the hope that these particular promises will be honoured, that these words uttered in public with the full responsibility of a leader of a great Party will be honoured by the colleagues who sit behind him, and that the national life of this country will not be lowered or demeaned by a responsible public man, occupying, as he then did, the second biggest position in the public life of this country, going out on public platforms to commit himself to <Col N="2206" /> promises which he never meant to carry out in order to secure votes.</P>
    <P>The sanctity of mandates! Mandates appear to be sacred if they are to be used against the interests of the country, but mandates do not seem to apply when there is an urgent pressing case in the interests of the people of the country.  Is there any Deputy from rural Ireland on the opposite benches who is going to stand up in the course of this debate and say that the farmers are as well able to pay rates as they were three years ago, that the farming industry is so profitable at the moment that it can afford to pay the crushing taxes imposed by the British Government, half the land annuities and the present rates and, at the same time, rear a family, educate children, pay wages and maintain the farm as a factory or little industry?  Is there any Deputy representing rural Ireland who is prepared to argue that, and who is prepared to go back to his constituency and stand over that argument?  There are men over there who know just as well as I do that, when they, from these benches, made the case three years ago that the overhead charges could not be borne&mdash;and then there was no economic war&mdash;it is unthinkable to suggest that these overhead charges can still be borne in the presence of the crushing taxation arising from the economic war.</P>
    <P>In discussing this particular motion, I want to confine myself to the ability of the farmers to pay, and to the fact that that promise was made in the most solemn way by the Leader of Fianna Fáil who is now President, and I want to avoid either provoking or invoking a debate about the causes or effects of, or responsibility for, the economic war, except in so far as the effects take from the capacity of the farmer to pay them.  I would rather that this debate would take place around the capacity or incapacity of the farmers to pay.  I should like, if it could be argued someone on those benches to demonstrate to me that the farming industry has increased so much in its profit that it is able to pay from £4 to £6 per head on every beast produced; that it is able to pay the taxes on the poultry and on <Col N="2207" /> the eggs; and that it is able to pay still the same overhead charges as three years ago.  If that particular case cannot be made, then surely there is a case for remission, and surely there is a case for reduction.  Assuming that the President spoke in all honesty and with a sense of responsibility, when three years ago he informed the public that the overhead charges were crushing; that the industry could not continue to exist if those charges remained, and that he considered as head of the Fianna Fáil Party and alternative President of this State, that agricultural land and buildings, big farms and little farms should be de-rated, and that it was the proposal and the promise of the Fianna Fáil Party to do that.</P>
    <P>I want to know if that promise is to be trampled in the dust, if that particular pledge is to be dishonoured, if that particular word is to be withdrawn when the votes are in the ballot box?  What is the justification for the changed attitude?  What has happened since except that the votes have gone into the box?  Has not everything that has happened since worsened the lot of the farmers?  The action of the British Government was deliberately designed to crush out of existence the Irish farmer.  Is the Irish Government going to lend a hand in the crushing process?  Is it not sufficiently tragic to have the sheriff busy from homestead to homestead collecting land annuities without having a return visit from some officer to the same homesteads to collect the rates?  It is not too late yet.  The money has not been paid in.  Of the total rates there are 66 per cent. outstanding. I imagine if the 34 per cent. that was paid in were examined on a geographical basis it would be found that that 34 per cent. has been paid in by the people in the towns and villages and that the 66 per cent. outstanding is made up entirely of the rates on agricultural land.  Even if some of the rates on agricultural land have been paid in, the cost of refunding is not an immense task.</P>
    <P>I submit that if the Government has one mandate clearer than any other mandate it is a mandate to derate the <Col N="2208" /> farmers in this country.  I would suggest further that if there is any class in the community that has been deliberately picked out by the Government in fighting their economic war, one class that is getting hammered and knocked by one tariff after another, it is certainly the farmer.  I submit that if there is to be any reality about the whole absurd situation that the first thing a warrior should do when he sends his troops into battle is at least to provide first aid for the injured.  The most obvious, the simplest and the most effective type of first aid that can be rendered to the casualties in the present deplorable war is the derating, as the President promised, of agricultural holdings of land and buildings, big and small.</P>
    <P>I do not want this resolution to be met by the parrot-like reply of the Minister for Finance, the cry that we heard made on so many occasions when we made any proposals.  I do not want the parrot-like reply: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; and then to hear the litany of so much on tea and so much on sugar and so much on petrol and what it would take to bring in this sum.  Those taxes have a very variable complexion in the eyes of the Minister for Finance.  The thing that is a hard tax when it is removed becomes a soft tax when he is reimposing it.  The thing that is a necessity when he is removing it becomes a luxury when he is imposing it.</P>
    <P>This principle of complete de-rating as outlined by the President and the promises he made would cost, approximately £2,000,000.  I do not presume to have examined the Estimates with minute care.  I do not presume to have formulated this proposal as the result of a plan, but I do suggest that those who do claim to have examined the Estimates with minute care and to have formulated a plan for reducing the taxation of this country by £2,000,000 without interfering with social services or interfering with the efficiency of the machine, could well devote that £2,000,000 to the purpose outlined in this resolution.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has dealt very clearly with his case and I do not propose to add very much to what he has said, but I would like that all sides of the House would apply themselves to the essential points to be argued and that no Deputy should try by long-distance oratory to obstruct and take away the little time granted for Private Deputies' Business.  This motion has been held over for the last 12 months. There are many other important motions on the Order Paper.  The little time given occasionally for Private Deputies' Business should not be wasted by bringing in irrelevant matter, and for that reason I should like to see all sides confining themselves to the essential side of the motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has referred to the promises given by the President before the election and to the speeches made by the President and many others on his side of the House, as to the condition of the farmers at that time.  It was absolutely true that at that time the farmers were in a position in which they were entitled to the complete de-rating that was promised to them.  That was because they were in a worse position at that time than the farmers in Northern Ireland with whom they were competing in the British markets.  But it was not merely because of these things, though these things were an important consideration.  It was as a matter of social justice that they were entitled to de-rating.  Before the present Government came into power the Free State farmers were, to the extent of £2,000,000, worse off than their neighbours across the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates on agricultural land was another name for income tax imposed upon the farmer, a tax that does not apply to any other class in the community. That tax was imposed for the purpose of running public services. That is my view of the question. De-rating, apart from the poverty of the farmers and of any promises given, should be given to them as a matter of natural justice.  They should be given <Col N="2210" /> equal treatment with that given to any other class in the community.  This is a tax imposed on the farmers' estimated income from their land that does not apply to any other class of income. If a farmer had an income only of £20 a year he has to pay this income tax in the shape of a rate out of that income. That is a most important consideration. Apart altogether from the condition in which the farmer finds himself now, de-rating is a natural right due as a matter of social justice.  This claim can be put forward now, and put forward at any time.  But if the farmers in the last normal year, 1931, were in a worse position than the farmers across the Border, I propose to give figures now to show the comparative position in which the Free State farmers stand at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I will anticipate the arguments that will come from the other side.  We have had them already at least one hundred times.  They tell us that the farmers are getting something as good as what they were getting.  I do not agree with that.  I submit there is no substitute for justice.  The farmers claim social justice and they are not going to take something else for what is their right. There may be a question as to where the money is to come from.  If the farmers are being treated unfairly and are being robbed, it is not for them to say where the money is to come from. Suppose a pickpocket made a good living for many years and his victims rose against him and told him that that could not go on any longer, and he said, &ldquo;Where am I to get my living from now; how am I to replace it?&rdquo; it is not the duty of his victims to tel him where to find it.</P>

It is very unjust to put farmers in jail when they owe nothing and when they really have paid their debt four times over.  It is certainly time that many of the farmers should be released from jail.  It comes badly from the Fianna Fáil Government to be putting farmers in jail after their fine <Col N="2211" /> promises before they got into power. They got into power on false pretences.</P>

      <P>It is their policy to keep the farmers in jail now.  When the farmers are in jail and the cattle are in the pounds, who is going to pay the money necessary to run the State? I have dealt with the position of the farmers in 1931 and I owe an apology to no one when I say that their position was not as it should be.  They have not been treated justly.  I propose to compare their position in 1931 with their position to-day.  No matter what position they are in, they are entitled to justice in the matter of taxation.  Senator Connolly was at Cavan a few days ago and he explained there &ldquo;that a transition period was inevitably difficult, but the Government were making every effort to level the burden and to make the change over as easy for the people as possible.&rdquo;  What does this motion propose? It proposes to go a short step on the way towards levelling the burden.  It does not ask the Government to level the burden, but it goes a step in that direction.  If the policy of the present Government is to level the burden they should have no hesitation in accepting this motion.  It is not now, as Deputy O'Higgins said, at the end of the financial year, that this motion should be taken into consideration. The Government should long ago have accepted it&mdash;as soon as it was put on the Order Paper, in order to make some little effort to level the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to give a few figures because by-and-by we shall be getting figures from the opposite benches, not for the purpose of proving anything or convincing anybody, but for the purpose of confusing everybody.  I daresay we shall hear about peat and wheat, bounties and subsidies and reduced annuities.  In the figures I will quote I will give them full credit for everything they have done.  I hope that will satisfy them.  The special duties that were collected for the last year, for which we have a return, amounted admittedly to £4,552,000.  Even the President of the Executive Council had <Col N="2212" /> admitted that the British have collected that amount.  Deputy O'Leary read a quotation in which the President admitted that, so there can be no dispute on that point.  That is the amount collected from special duties, but what have the farmers lost by the quota restrictions?  The best way to find out that is to calculate the number of cattle exported in the last normal year, 1931, and multiply that number by the value of licences as they are sold in the Dublin market and all through the country.  Nobody can be dissatisfied with that method of calculation.</P>

      <P>The licences have been valued at £3 10s. to 35/-.  In order that there will be nothing contentious I will take the average value of the licences at £2.  I am sure nobody will quarrel with that figure.  As a result of the quota restrictions, every average beast lost £2 over and above the duty. Multiply 766,000 by 2 and you get 1,532,000.  Add £1,532,000, the value of the licences, to the £4,552,000 that the British claim to have collected and that the President admits was collected, and you get a total of £6,084,000.  That is what the farmers have lost on what they have exported to Great Britain in one year.</P>

      <P>We exported half of our produce, and the exported surplus ruled the price for what was sold on the home market.  Now we have to double the figure of £6,084,000, and we get £12,168,000.  There is another item that has not been calculated.  I know a little about it, but I do not want to refer to it now.  There are a lot of cattle smuggled and there is no tariff collected on them yet.  The British have not collected anything on them. The farmers are losing just the same. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said here a couple of months ago that there were not 100 cattle smuggled; yet his own Department has supplied information which I will read out for the House.  Ministers would state almost anything in this House. According to a return issued by the <Col N="2213" /> Free State Department of Industry and Commerce there were exported from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and the Isle of Man in November, 1934, 30,161 animals, and for November, 1933, the figure was 24,163, an increase of 5,998 for the month of November alone. The duties were on and the smuggling was going on also in 1933; yet there was an increase to that extent for 1934 as compared with 1933.  You may double that figure to find out the increase in number as compared with the year before the duties went on. From January 1st to November, 30th, 1934, the exports of cattle from Northern Ireland were 244,871; in 1933 they were 200,577, so that there was an increase of 44,294 over 1933.  Again you might double that figure to find out what they were before the duties went on.  You might multiply that by at least £6 to find out what we lost. However, I am not taking that into calculation.  I only just draw attention to it.  I do not think it necessary to take the smuggling into account at all. We have a figure then of £12,168,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give another item that affects the farmer.  Taxation, which was going to be reduced according to the Fianna Fáil Party, was increased by £8,000,000 and the farming community has paid at least half that.  I think no one will disagree with that.  That means another £4,000,000 added to their burden, which brings the amount which the farmers have lost up to £16,168,000.  Then we come to the other side of the account, as I want to give Fianna Fáil credit for everything they have given.  They have given £3,000,000 in bounties and they have reduced the annuities by half, which I think comes to £1,500,000, roughly.  That would be £4,500,000.  Of course I am subject to correction on these figures.  If the bounties amounted to more than £3,000,000 I am quite prepared to accept the figure submitted. I do not know if £1,500,000 is correct for half the annuities.  Taking £4,500,000 from £16,168,000 we find that the balance is £11,668,000, which represents the net loss which the farmers have sustained as compared with 1931.  Although the farmers <Col N="2214" /> were badly treated in 1931, they were worse off last year by £11,668,000.</P>
    <P>What does this motion ask?  It asks for the remission of rates, which would amount to about £2,000,000.  If that were granted, instead of levelling the burden, as the Minister for Lands stated in Cavan they were straining every effort to do, it would only reduce the farmers' losses from £11,668,000 to £9,668,000 as compared with 1931.  I expect we shall be told that things have altered since 1931; that the quota restrictions are not due to the economic war but to British depression and British policy.  We have been told that a hundred times.  If that is so, why have they not had the same effect in other countries of the Commonwealth?  What is the average trade figure for all the other countries in the Commonwealth?  I am not selecting one particular country, as I do not want to waste time giving the figures for all the countries.  However, I went to the trouble of calculating them all together and I find that the other countries of the Commonwealth taken together have increased their export trade to the British market by 46 per cent. for the year 1933 as compared with 1931; while the Free State exports to the British market were reduced by 40 per cent.  If our export trade had increased to the same extent as that of the other Commonwealth countries Deputies can figure out what our position would be to-day.</P>
    <P>If Great Britain has changed her policy and if all this is due to the depression and to the causes assigned by Fianna Fáil, how did the other Commonwealth countries succeed in increasing their trade to that extent? I think the explanation of that was given in the British House of Commons a short time ago when a question was asked by Mr. Buchanan in regard to the Potato Import (Regulation) Order as to whether the Irish Free State had been consulted in the same way as the other interests concerned.  In the course of supplementary questions Sir T. Rosbotham said there was no intention of prohibiting the importation of Free State potatoes.  Mr. Dingle Foot said there was a serious political implication in the inclusion of the Irish Free <Col N="2215" /> State in the Order.  It was being treated like a foreign country.  Mr. Elliot, the Minister of Agriculture, said an opportunity was offered to the Irish Free State to make a trade agreement with them which, for reasons of their own, they did not accept.  It was clear that for the time being, therefore, the Irish Free State was in a different position from other countries in the Dominions which had made trade agreements with that country.  Does not that put the thing plainly?&mdash;that it was not due to British policy that Free State exports to that country were affected adversely, but it was due to the failure of the Free State Government to do as other Commonwealth countries did at the Ottawa Conference. Two Ministers from this country went to that Conference.  If I do not mistake the Vice-President was one of them.</P>

      <P>It looks very strange anyhow, but it appears they were not successful negotiators.  I have already given a short reference with regard to Senator Connolly's views.  Senator Connolly speaking at Cavan, and referring to the British market, also said that &ldquo;it had become very urgent <Col N="2216" /> that we in this country should re-adjust ourselves to the new conditions as quickly as possible, and change our basis of production to the needs of the market that existed.  The farmers would find their best salvation in adapting themselves as speedily as possible to the production of commodities for which there is a definite home market.&rdquo; That is Senator Connolly's view.  He belongs to the Upper House.  He thinks that we all talk through our hats in this lower House, and he has a very poor opinion of the Ministers who sit on that bench in this House.  I am sorry if this House of ours is not able to hold its own against the Upper House.  Senator Connolly evidently thinks it is not.  I will just read for you a short extract from a speech delivered in County Cavan in August last by a Minister of this House&mdash;the Minister for Finance.  Speaking at Bailieboro in August last he said: &ldquo;that he believed that the end of the year would see the end of most of their troubles.  Things were going in such a way in Great Britain that the end of the year would see the end of the quota restrictions, and their cattle would be let into the English market at such a price and in such numbers as would establish the Irish agriculturist on his feet.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is reported in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of the 20th August.  The Minister for Finance gave the farmers to believe that they were going to have such a market for their cattle that the best thing they could do would be not to mind Senator Connolly or President de Valera or those other gentlemen who were telling them to change over.  He actually told them there never was such a time as they were going to have, and that they should rear all the calves possible. Another Minister then comes along like a destroying angel.  There never was anything since the plague was in Egypt as bad as that another Minister should, when there was going to be such a price for cattle, come along and tell them to kill their calves. That was what the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2217" /> told the farmers.  That is what the farmers are being told by this Government.  They have lost this £9,668,000 for last year as compared with 1931, and yet I do not know whether the Government means to accept this motion or not.  This motion does not ask them to do what Senator Connolly said they were straining every effort to do&mdash;to level the burden. It is asking them to go a short step in the direction of levelling the burden. It is a step which, even if that burden were never there, the farmers are entitled to as an act of natural justice.</P>

      <P>I beg to support this motion which has been moved by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy O'Donovan.  Like Deputy O'Higgins, I cannot see what answer there is to it, not only on the merits of the motion itself, but particularly in view of the policy of the Government preceeding the 1932 election.  Everybody connected with a rural constituency will know that if there was one promise more than another which caught the agricultural community at that election, it was that of retaining the moneys sent to Great Britain and using portion of them for the de-rating of agricultural land.  I cannot recall the President's exact statement to the effect that he would apply it also to agricultural buildings.  The House will recall that part of the plan.  The President's statement on the point was specific and deliberate.  The Fianna Fáil Party was to give the agricultural community a better export market for surplus produce.  In that regard, the last phrase read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;giving agriculture a chance which it has not had since 1922.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Giving agriculture a chance which it has not had since 1922&rdquo;?  What was its position then, and what is its position now? Let us assume that it was bad then. Let us assume that the burden of £3,000,000 was a serious one.  Three million pounds is the sum involved in this case&mdash;not £5,000,000.  The money due and payable by the farmers under the pre-1923 Land Acts amounted to £3,000,000.  Last year as against that sum England collected £4,532,000.  In other words, she collected one and a half times the amount due from the agricultural community.  What is the position?  A Bill was passed in this House in 1933 purporting to have the land annuities.  That looked, on its face, a very specious thing.  It needed to be examined in order to show how false the position was.  What is the liability of the farmers of this country? In respect of the land bonds that were issued in this State under the 1923 Act there was a liability of £1,250,000. The land annuities were halved under the 1933 Land Act.  Presumably, all of the halved annuities would be collected and that is about £2,000,000. On that item alone, the Government here makes a profit of £750,000.  The sum to be collected on interest on local loans is approximately £600,000. That is not paid over.  That is another sum of money which is collected by the Government here and put into the Treasury as revenue.  That is also coming from the agricultural community, another £600,000.  No circumstances are conceivable in which the agricultural community could be in a worse position than it is in at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assume that these moneys were a burden on the agricultural community. Let us not forget that each item of the annuities due and payable, is due and payable on a contract made by the tenant farmers of this country.  There were various steps whereby the rights were passed on and the liabilities accepted by others but, in origin, every solitary annuity that is payable by the tenant farmers of the country is due and payable on an original formal contract made between the landlord on the one part and the <Col N="2219" /> tenant on the other.  The Minister has been referring to something about my past, to the fact that I referred, in the years 1926 and 1927, to the Financial Settlement of 1926.  I referred to it then and I was of that opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Here you have a Government in office, the members of which sought the votes of the people of this country, and got them, on the plea that the Government that was then in office was destroying the agricultural community; that in fact it had been destroyed; that it was impossible for it to live and prosper under the conditions then existing and that it was essential to eject the Government then in office and to return them.  That was the position then.  Accept that as true for the purposes of argument.  What is the position to-day?  Reference has been made here to smuggling.  I sat here in amazement when the Minister for Industry and Commerce said across the House that there was no smuggling going on.  And I come from Donegal! I was so dumbfounded that I refused even to smile.  Of course the figures quoted by Deputy McGovern prove the statement up to the hilt.  I did not want that proof.  I know the facts. Why are cattle being sent down from the West of Ireland in lorries to Ballybofey and Stranorlar and then sent by by-roads and various devious routes to Castlederg and other places over the Border?  Is that because this Government is giving agriculture the chance which it did not enjoy from 1922 to 1932 under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government?  Is that the reason why men are being bludgeoned by the Specials, and why they are actually being fired at by the Specials when trying to smuggle across these cattle?</P>

      <P>I have a concrete case in mind of which I know the full particulars.  I am not going to discuss it in this House, but if I quoted them here it would astonish Deputies, for two reasons.  The first is because of the difference in price for cattle on this side of the Border and cattle on the other, that is to say, the price at a fair in Donegal, nearest to the Border, say the fair of Stranorlar, and the price at a fair on the other side, say in Castlederg. Deputy Donnelly could tell you the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no cattle fair in Lifford.  You cannot compare the price of cattle in Lifford with the price obtained at a fair in Strabane, because there is no cattle fair in Lifford.  I am talking about the price at a cattle fair in Stranorlar and the price at a similar fair in Castlederg. Take the average full grown animal reared in Donegal.  The difference in price obtained, say, at Stranorlar and Castlederg is £7.  The average land annuity in County Donegal&mdash;at least 68 per cent. of them&mdash;is under £3.  In West Donegal, in the poorest part of the county, there are land annuities as low as 1/-.  These poor men who pay 1/-, 2/- or 5/- in land annuities lose £6 on one beast having four teeth.  If that be so, is it placing a terrible burden on the Government or is it asking anything unreasonable from them if we ask them to accept the terms of this motion?  The present condition of affairs has been brought about by the Government, and while it may be urged that in voting for the Government the farmers who supported them have been a party to the arrangement, it cannot be denied that the Government Party, when seeking their votes, made certain promises to them.  These are the conditions under which the farmers are <Col N="2221" /> living.  Mark you, in County Donegal the position is that the farmer cannot switch over to any other system of farming.  There is no transition period for him.  The speech of the Minister for Lands in Cavan last Sunday is no use to him.  He cannot change over.  He cannot grow wheat, beet or tobacco. His position is chronic.  For good or for ill, there is nothing for him but the one thing, and that is the rearing of live stock.  These men live by the few pounds they make on a few cattle and sheep, and there is no alternative to that system.  It is true that the bogs are now being opened up, but what is the position of the people of Donegal in that respect?  Where can they market their peat?  They are some hundreds of miles away from Dublin, where there is a market for the peat, and the shipping and trans-shipping of that peat would result in its being ashes by the time it reached Dublin. The small farmer is, therefore, driven back to the old chronic position&mdash;a few live stock.  There is no transition period for him.  You cannot change his position.</P>

      <P>With regard to flax, they have always grown flax, and they are experts in the production of it.  They have been doing it down through the ages even at a loss.  For the last four or five years they have suffered a loss, but they have been doing it because it was part of their course of tillage.  What will the adoption of this motion cost?  £1,250,000. I do not think the Minister will contradict me in that.  The maximum sum that it is going to cost the Exchequer is £1,250,000.  Probably I shall be asked where it is going to come from?  I do not like putting forward proposals for economies, but I should like to take a line from what the Minister himself said on numerous occasions, and keep him to his own promise.  He suggested repeatedly in this House and outside this House how economies could be achieved&mdash;economies, remember, when the taxation of this country was much lower than it is to-day.  You will all recall that part of the famous plan. <Col N="2222" /> You have it off by heart and you could recite it verbatim.</P>
      <P>In that famous pronouncement the Fianna Fáil Party stated that they had examined the whole basis of taxation in this country, and that they were satisfied that even without taking into consideration the pensions of the ex-R.I.C. and other pensions to ex-officials of the British régime, they could save £2,000,000.  They could reduce the taxation imposed on this country in 1931 by £2,000,000.  We do not want £2,000,000 for this purpose.  We only want £1,250,000.  If somebody in 1931 suggested that the taxation then imposed should be increased by £8,000,000, or if the then Minister for Finance proposed to increase it by £8,000,000, what a cry of indignation would go out through the country.  Deputy Donnelly would make the welkin ring up and down the country about the atrocious proposal of the Government.  Yet they have imposed an additional £8,000,000 in taxation.  That has been done by Deputy Donnelly's Party and there is not a word of protest from him.  Of course, he did not go back to his constituency to tell the people that for the first time in history the Irish £ is as good as the English £ in relation to the pact for the exchange of coal and cattle.  He did not relate that to the facts.  When I read the Deputy's statement I did not know to what he was referring.  Another member of the Party made a speech, I think it was the Minister for Lands, when the Deputy's meaning became clear.  He is trying to convince the farmers of Offaly that the pact confers a benefit on them and that they are in a better position to meet their payments, and that there was a greater income for them.  I wonder would the Deputy tell the House how that will occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is to be an increased export of cattle, but England is going to collect, on the world price of the cattle, a tax of 40 per cent.  On the other hand, we are going to import English coal at world prices, and pay an additional import tax of 5/- a ton.  I wonder how the farmers <Col N="2223" /> in Deputy Donnelly's constituency will find the £ to be as good as the English £, seeing that 40 per cent. will be taken off.  That is very good mathematics ! Apparently, Deputy Donnelly thinks that anything is good enough for his constituents if he thinks he is going to increase their prosperity by reducing the value of the £ by 40 per cent.  It is a very simple way of doing things.  When a division is being taken on this motion I shall be anxious to see if Deputies on the Government Benches will vote against it, or if they will go to their constituencies and tell them that only £1,250,000 are involved.  If the agricultural community is in the first line trenches, as every Minister and backbencher in the Government Party admits, will they vote against granting them this small benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question to which attention should be drawn.  It would be a wise thing for the House and for the Government to agree to this, in order to relate the position of farmers in the Free State to that of farmers in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  Putting aside the question of derating, and the action of the British Government in derating agricultural land, it must be remembered that our farmers are competing in the British market and, as far as possible, they should be placed in a position similar to that of farmers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. From that point of view the farmers here are entitled to the same treatment and should not have to demand it.  In its wisdom the Government should see that similar benefits are conferred on farmers here, in order to put them on a basis on which they can compete, apart altogether from the economic war, and assuming that our farmers were not bearing the losses they are bearing.  Of course, the Minister told us that there is a transition period.  As far as I am concerned there is no transition period.  I have stated the position in my constituency. It is chronic, notwithstanding the wheat, beet, tobacco and other schemes.  That is the position every <Col N="2224" /> day the economic war goes on.  The position with regard to smuggling is that conditions have been tightened up. I can tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that smuggling is not the soft thing it was six months ago. Conditions on the Border have been tightened up.  In one corner of this State we seem to be nobody's child.</P>

I also ask the House not only to pass the motion but to see that it is put into practice as a bare act of justice, owing to the position in which the Government have placed the farmers.  Even if the economic war did not exist, and if the sufferings of the agricultural community were not what they are, it would be necessary to pass such a motion, in order to put our farmers into a position to compete with those in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Rates, overhead charges and the standard of living of the agricultural community are about the same, but our farmers should be put in the same position as others if they are to compete with them.</P>

      <P>The following question was on the Order Paper in my name to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that a seizure of furniture was made at the residence of Colonel Liam Fraher, Ballynanty, Bruff, County Limerick, for arrears of land annuities between the hours of midnight and 2 a.m. on the morning of 7th February, and if he will explain the reasons for this action at such an unreasonable hour.</P>
      <P>In his reply, the Minister for Agriculture, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, who, I am sorry to learn, is ill, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed.  The seizure referred to was made on the 6th February, at the hour of 11.30 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a supplementary question I asked if that was so why were the sheriff and forces on the premises at 2 a.m. on February 7th and the Minister replied &ldquo;To get paid&rdquo;.  Surely that in itself is almost a sufficient answer to my question. If a seizure had been effected previously why should the sheriff have 14 hours subsequently to apply for payment? It is not the usual procedure for a sheriff, when he has made a seizure, to come the next day to ask for payment of the account.  The seizure generally serves the purpose. I admit that the sheriff was on the land at the hour mentioned&mdash;11.30 a.m.  He produced a warrant and asked for the rent.  Colonel Fraher replied that he could not pay as he had not the amount but that he had half the amount, and would give it.  The court messenger said that unfortunately half could not be accepted.  There was a conversation lasting one and a half or two hours between the officials and Colonel Fraher and his friends.  They discussed the matter amicably, and I may say that from first to last the action of the officers and the Gárda was courteous.  There is no reflection and no charge against them. Their conduct was courteous during the <Col N="2226" /> 14 hours they were there.  Two or three hours later the court messenger left the premises and proceeded elsewhere, obviously to consult his superiors.  He returned at a later hour and said that unfortunately he could not accept the half: that if he did it would be creating a precedent for the county.  Colonel Fraher said &ldquo;That being the case you had better take something.&rdquo;  There were cattle on the land, cows and dry stock and 101 pigs in the yard.  Colonel Fraher is one of those men who farms well.  He is a credit to the farming community.  He tries, as far as he can to fulfil what, in the Minister's opinion, would be all the requirements of good farming.</P>

      <P>He is luckier than some of us because he possesses some stock. The fact is that some of us have not any stock.  But the mere fact that Colonel Fraher had some stock does not prove that he had sufficient money to pay his annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say this to Deputy O Briain: that he had better not follow the example of the Minister for Finance to-day who attempted to prejudice the case that he knew I was to make to-night by getting up and making the most insidious charges against an honourable gentleman whose boots he is not fit to wipe.  The Minister said that this particular gentleman was in receipt of a pension from the State.  Colonel Fraher is in receipt of a pension from the State for faithful and honest services rendered.  No Deputy on the opposite side can refute that statement.  It was an ill-wind that blew the Minister for Finance on to those benches to-day to cast a slur on this particular gentleman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Colonel Fraher as a soldier, as a gentleman and as a good farmer is all that one should expect of a decent citizen of this State, but he is in the position that, even though he has <Col N="2227" /> land and stock, he has not cash to pay his annuities.  He is in the position of the rest of us, that having paid once he is unable to pay a second time. On this particular occasion he was willing that the court messenger should take cattle when he could not pay.  The court messenger did take a ramble around the fields to see what stock was on the land.  My information is that the first animal the court messenger saw was a bull.  I think he was rather intimidated by the bull and returned.  I do not know whether or not he inspected the 101 pigs in the yard, but if he did he must have come to the conclusion that Colonel Fraher's dry stock and pigs were not a convertible security.  We all know that what they are worth to-day is very little.  At about 4 or 5 p.m. he announced, for the first time to Colonel Fraher, that if he could not pay he would have to take something. Colonel Fraher said: &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; The court messenger said that he would have to send for a lorry and that it might not arrive until the morning.  On hearing this Colonel Fraher said to him: &ldquo;If you remove your forces from my place I will give you my word of honour that everything that is now on the land and premises will be there when you come back again.&rdquo;  But the word of honour of a soldier and of a gentleman was not sufficient for the representative of the Minister in collecting the annuities. The word of honour of a soldier and of a gentleman of this country who, in dark times, and at every time, fought honourably for his country was not sufficient for the representative of the Minister; the word and honour of the representative of a family which, in all periods of this country's history was in the forefront of the fight for the people's rights, was not accepted.</P>
    <P>Colonel Fraher has a reputation which cannot be sullied on the benches opposite or anywhere else.  The record of his family and of his predecessors is a proud one.  His predecessors were always in the forefront of the fight for tenant right.  They were in the fight at Ballycohey.  Why was not the stock taken on this gentleman's <Col N="2228" /> land and why was it necessary to take the furniture?  Was there not sufficient stock there?  Perhaps the reason is this, that when the sheriff walked into Colonel Fraher's house the first thing to catch his eye was a rather admirable painting&mdash;I should have said two admirable paintings&mdash;of Griffth and Collins and portraits of Parnell and Davitt.  Was it because this gentleman had on the walls of his house proofs of his nationality and his patriotism, and that the representative of the sheriff envied him in his possession of these things, that he decided to seize property instead of stock on the land?  Did he think that these portraits and property would be saleable commodities at a sheriff's sale.  At any rate, whatever the cause, he was evidently bent on offering all the indignities possible to this particular gentleman.  He had been offered cattle and other stock as well as the pigs, but would not take them.  His forces remained in possession of this gentleman's premises and lands for 14 or 15 hours.  During that time no attempt was made to seize anything. It was not until long after midnight that any intimation was given that there was to be a seizure.  It was two minutes past two o'clock in the morning when the representative of the sheriff laid his hands on Colonel Fraher's furniture to remove it.  A neighbouring farmer&mdash;Captain Morkell, a brother officer of Colonel Fraher, who was present&mdash;said: &ldquo;I am hanged if I am going to stand by and see your property seized and such an indignity offered to yourself, your wife and your family,&rdquo; and he paid the amount.</P>
    <P>What, I ask, was the object of having this midnight occupation of a farmer's premises?  There was no necessity for it in this particular case.  There was no resistance and no semblance of resistance offered by the tenant.  The sheriff's officer could have seized on the 6th or on the following day, the 7th, and if there had been a seizure of the stock there was no difficulty with regard to putting them in a pound.  We had a long debate to-day on a Bill in connection with pounds.  Within two and a half miles of Colonel Fraher's land there is the only decent pound in <Col N="2229" /> County Limerick, one in which cattle are properly cared for and treated.  His cattle and other stock could have been safely sent to that pound, but that did not suit the representatives of the Crown or the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>You are the representatives of the Crown in this country. Instead of seizing the cattle and taking them to the pound, the representatives of the sheriff proceeded to inflict on this unfortunate tenant farmer an indignity that was never offered to tenants during the worst times in this country, in the worst days of landlordism when evictions were taking place and you had general ill-treatment of farmers.  During those penal times you had not those midnight seizures with the representatives of the sheriff remaining in occupation of a tenant's premises.  It remained for an Irish Government to offer that indignity to not only an honest farmer but a farmer with the attributes of Colonel Fraher, a gentleman with a distinguished military record, a distinguished patriotic record as well as a good honest record as a farmer, a better record than that of most Deputies on the benches opposite or on these benches.  He is a hard-working, industrious man, endeavouring in the most honourable way to bring up his family.  It was against him that the charge was levelled to-day by the Minister for Finance that he was in receipt of a pension and that he should be one of the first men to pay his annuities.  Were it not for his pension, Colonel Fraher would be in the position of most of us, and that is that we have not the wherewithal to meet demands for the annuities or other debts.  If, perchance, the sheriff's men should come to visit us either in the open daylight or during the midnight hours, as they did in the case of Colonel Fraher, then, unfortunately, as we have not the means to pay, we will have to let our furniture and effects go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precedent established in this case is one that we do not want to see repeated.  We do not want unfortunate <Col N="2230" /> farmers to be in danger of having the sheriff, the bailiff or the police coming to their houses in the middle of the night and, perhaps, terrifying their families.  They were not terrified in this case.  The Guards were most courteous, but there is no assurance that a farmer will not have his premises entered by the forces of the law during the nocturnal hours, or that officers of the law will not remain in occupation during those hours.  I know of the case of two ladies who could not pay, and their furniture was taken; but that happened in daylight.  There is no assurance that, on the next occasion, the seizure of the remainder of their furniture will not take place about midnight.  It is because of that danger that I raise this question.</P>

      <P>The court messenger took possession of the furniture at that time and naturally he had to get a lorry to take it away.  It would appear that, amongst the friends of Deputy Bennett, it was difficult to get a lorry to remove the furniture, and the court messenger had to telephone to Dublin for a lorry. There was delay in getting the lorry down and considerable expense was put upon Colonel Fraher in respect of the lorry from Dublin.  The messenger had to wait until the lorry arrived, and the lorry did not reach there until 2 o'clock in the morning.  It is wrong to give the impression that there was a raid made on this house at 2 o'clock in the morning.  The court messenger arrived at 11.30 a.m. and, owing to the difficulty of getting a lorry, the money was not paid.  Evidently Colonel Fraher believed that Deputy Bennett's organisation was strong enough to prevent a lorry being supplied to take the furniture away, and he did not believe he would be made pay until the lorry arrived.  The lorry did not arrive until 2 o'clock.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett said that Colonel Fraher was told that the lorry would not arrive until, perhaps, the early hours of the morning and that he offered to give his word that, if the court messenger, withdrew, nothing would be removed before the following day.  I do not know what passed between the court messenger and Colonel Fraher but I do know that, if the court messenger were to let an opportunity like that slip, he would get into very serious trouble.  Evidently, he was not prepared to take that risk. Whether he was prepared to take Colonel Fraher's word or not, I do not know.  Possibly, he was afraid that some of the friends of Colonel Fraher or Deputy Bennett might come in his absence and take the furniture away. At all events, he thought it safer to remain there until the lorry arrived and take the stuff with him.  I quite accept what Deputy Bennett says, that Colonel Fraher is a gentleman, a soldier, a farmer and so on but he is a foolish man because if he had had the sense to know sooner that this conspiracy against the payment of land annuities was not going to succeed, he could, at least, have saved himself the £5 extra he paid for the lorry.  If he had had the sense not to believe too strongly in the power of Deputy Bennett's organisation to save him from paying his land annuities or having any of his property seized&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett tells us that a neighbouring farmer and a brother officer paid up the amount at the last moment&mdash;when the lorry arrived.  He, also, must have believed that the conspiracy was going to succeed because he could very easily have done that in the early hours of the afternoon before the lorry was sent for. He would then have got away with the <Col N="2232" /> payment of the land annuity and sheriff's costs, without the additional cost of transport.  But it appears to be necessary to convince people like Colonel Fraher, who was probably better able to pay than many another farmer, that this conspiracy will not succeed before they will actually pay up, even though the delay leads to a considerable amount of additional cost. Deputy Bennett did mention, in a speech down in Limerick, that this was a political fight.  I do not know whether Colonel Fraher is a follower of Deputy Bennett or not but I assume he is. Naturally, any follower of Deputy Bennett looks to him for a lead.  These people believe that if they support Deputy Bennett in this &ldquo;political fight,&rdquo; they will be helped out and, naturally, Colonel Fraher thought it was up to him to fight to the bitter end.</P>

      <P>In spite of the description Deputy Bennett has given us of the plight of some of his followers, I do not know if he is prepared to put up a defence fund to compensate Colonel Fraher and others for the additional expenses which they incur in this way.  As has been shown here, there was very heavy additional expense in paying for the lorry and that would have been avoided if the land annuity had been paid promptly. I was asked why, in this case, the sheriff did not seize animals instead of furniture.  Of course, the sheriff used his own discretion.  He takes whatever he thinks most suitable in the circumstances and, in this case, he evidently decided to take the furniture. I remember members of the Opposition urging, on one occasion, that it was unfair to take a man's stock&mdash;cows and so forth&mdash;because it was taking away a man's means of livelihood.  In all probability, the sheriff was being kind to Colonel Fraher in seizing his furniture rather than his live stock. Whatever the reason he decided to take the furniture.</P>
