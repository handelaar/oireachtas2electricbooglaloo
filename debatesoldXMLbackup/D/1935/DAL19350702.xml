      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that maternity nurses in the employment of local authorities purporting to act under instructions from their union are refusing to sign certificates requisite for claims for maternity benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts in the cases of mothers confined in the county home unless they are paid a fee of 5/- by the claimant, and whether he will take steps immediately to notify public authorities that all necessary steps must be at once taken to end this practice.</P>

    <P>The figures for the Local Offices, which have since 1929-30 been transferred from one Area to another, have been attributed for both years to the Area to which they at present belong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether an order under Section 17 of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, has yet been made declaring artificial knitted silk fabric to be a reserved commodity for the Gaeltacht Services, and, if not, will the interests of the firms manufacturing this commodity for their own requirements be considered before the order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. It is required by Section 17 (5) (c) of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, that the Executive Council shall not make a Reserved Commodity Order until they have considered such objections as may have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  This requirement will be duly complied with.</P>

It is not, however, proposed to take any decision in the matter pending the receipt of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service, which, it is hoped, will be available at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has abandoned his intention (as expressed in the Financial Statement made in May, 1933) of borrowing for Export Bounties against the security of the Deferred Annuities Fund in view of the fact that no such fund exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my Budget Statement for the financial year, 1933/34, I explained that it was intended to borrow in that year the sum of £1,225,000 for Export Bounties and Subsidies on the security of certain assets which arose out of the economic war as an offset to the liabilities imposed by the latter.  In the table explanatory of the Budget circulated on the following day this proposal was referred to as &ldquo;Borrowing against the Deferred Annuities Fund.&rdquo; This was merely a brief and convenient description for the purposes of a tabular statement of a proposal I had already fully explained in my Budget Statement, and it should not have been construed as a declaration of intention to set up a separate fund to account for the receipts from deferred annuities.  The Deputy will appreciate that the soundness of the proposal and the reality of the assets latent in deferred annuities receipts are not affected by the non-existence of a Deferred Annuities Fund as a separate entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply am I to understand that the statement contained in the explanatory circular bore the same relation to fact that the statements referred to by Deputy Dowdall bore to the real intentions of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Norton I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where it is shown that a worker to whom the immediately preceding sub-section of this section applies was dismissed from his employment on the grounds merely that he absented himself from his work in the manner authorised in the said sub-section, the employer of such worker shall be guilty of an offence under this section and his conviction thereof shall not prejudice the right of such worker to enforce any claim against such employer which he may have independently of this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, there is something to be said for the suggestion in the amendment, but in practice I think it will prove to be completely ineffective.  If an employer wants to victimise a worker for availing of his rights under the section he will find some other pretext for dismissing him from his employment rather than the way mentioned in the <Col N="1370" /> sub-section.  Therefore, I think the safeguard which the amendment suggests would be entirely illusory.  I do not know if it is possible to devise an effective safeguard, but I should like to consider that.  I think it will be very difficult to find any method of ensuring a safeguard which cannot be evaded, but I will consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what is intended by the amendment, but I am not prepared to accept it if it has the meaning which I attribute to it. The proposal in the Bill is to ensure that where a worker has been continuously employed for two months then he will get an extra day's pay upon the termination of that employment in discharge of the employer's obligation to him in respect of holidays. It will be necessary to modify this sub-section in some respects, because as it reads at present I think it is open to the interpretation that an extra day's pay will have to be given no matter what the period of employment was.  The intention is to ensure that the obligation only arises after two months' continuous employment has taken place.  It would be undesirable from everybody's point of view to have a situation in which a worker employed for two or three days would have to get an extra day's pay at the end of the period, because it would discourage an employer taking on workers on trial.  The intention is to ensure that the worker shall get a week's holidays after a year's employment. If the employment is less than a year, then he will get a day's pay in respect of every two months' continuous employment.  That is, if the employment lasts for two months he gets one day's pay; for four months, two days' pay, and for six months, <Col N="1371" /> three days' pay, etc.  That is what the section is intended to provide.  I think it goes a little further than that, but, if so, it will be amended to ensure that the intention will be given effect to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been read that a worker would be entitled to a day's pay as well as a day's annual leave.  I may be interpreting the Minister wrongly, but he speaks about a day's pay.  That is not quite the same as a day's leave.  I want to see if the Minister means that if the employee is dismissed before he serves 12 months he will get for a period of two months one day's pay, for a period of four months two days' pay, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The five days' pay does not become payable unless the employment is terminated.  If it is terminated there is no obligation in respect of holidays.  This question of a day's pay or two days' pay only arises when a worker is dismissed, and is very largely designed to prevent employers evading the holiday obligation by employing workers for periods of less than a year.  The obligation to provide a week's holiday and this day's pay cannot possibly arise together, because the obligation under this sub-section does not arise unless the worker is dismissed from the employment of the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the definition of &ldquo;continuous employment,&rdquo;<Col N="1372" /> which I propose to embody at a later stage, on the termination of employment the worker becomes entitled to two days' pay if the employment lasts two months, but this gives full discharge in respect of holidays.  If he restarts, the date on which he restarts will be the date of his employment for the purpose of the holiday section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out, at an earlier stage, the danger of an employer trying to circumvent this Act by terminating the services of his employee at the end of 11 months. This section would remedy that.  If they do not give the holidays they must give wages.  This Act is designed to give holidays, not in lieu of wages, and to prevent a man working during his holidays for somebody else, but what is to prevent an employee and an employer under this section entering into a conspiracy so that the employer could dismiss the employee, give him a week's wages in lieu of holidays, and then take him on again?  Then at the end of another 11 months he could dismiss him again, give him a week's wages, and take him on again and so avoid the whole obligation of giving holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about that?  I am only pointing out the way in which an employer and an employee might get over the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man completes a year's work he becomes entitled to holidays.  We want to prevent him working for other persons while on holidays, and we propose to see if we can get an amendment to effect that. As the Bill stands, there is nothing in it that prevents workers during the week's holidays to which the Bill entitles them from working for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister did undertake, in deference to a suggestion by Deputy Norton, to consider an amendment that would succeed in persuading an employee to take his holidays even though, as I suggested, he might do a job for a neighbour.  But suppose that an employer and an <Col N="1373" /> employee did not want to have a week's holidays in their business, and the employer said: &ldquo;I will employ you on the 1st January, and on the 1st December I will dismiss you.  That gives you a claim to five days' pay against me. I shall give you the five days' pay, and I will re-employ you on the 2nd December. We will then go on for another 12 months.&rdquo;  In that way, if you have collusion between the employer and the employee the whole effect of the holidays can be done away with by the suggestion of 53 weeks pay for 52 weeks work.  Has the Minister that case in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a case is not likely to arise except in a very isolated instance. I saw no way to get over it. Given collusion between the two parties, the holiday obligation could be evaded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the employment year referred to will be the anniversary of the worker's employment or of the last time he was taken on.

      <P>If the Minister's intention is to reduce the value of this section to the workers he ought to reconsider the position.  Suppose an employee is dismissed after five months and the Minister contemplates amending this section in the manner indicated, what annual leave will the worker be entitled to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the employer can get service of an employee for one month without any intention of granting him a holiday.  Is that proposed in the interests of the employers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; in the interests of the workers.  The effect would be to deter an employer taking on a worker on trial.  As it stands here, if the worker was taken on for one day he would have to get two days' pay, and I think that would be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one step, but it is not the whole case.  Suppose an employer has a worker in his employment and has him working for five months and three weeks, the obvious thing for him to say, in his own interest is, it is better to get rid of the man before six months' service is complete. If it is six months he must get three day's wages; not less than six months, two day's wages.  I think the Minister could deal with an emergency if taking him on trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>To leave the section as it is in this Bill.  The Bill was approved by the Minister when it was introduced. When he saw and read this sub-section, he was apparently satisfied.  Now, he proposes to amend sub-section (4) in such a way as to enable the employer to employ a worker for seven weeks in every period of two months without giving any holidays.  I think you might as well delete in many cases the provision for holidays with pay if the Minister is going to do that.  I would urge the Minister, whatever difficulties have to be dealt with, not to deal with them in the way the Minister suggested in his own speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that under sub-section 4, if the employer dismisses a worker after he has rendered service for portion of a period of two months, he must get a day in respect of that fragmentary period, and he must get a day for every completed period of two months.  If a worker has done seven weeks' work he gets one day.  If he has rendered service for two completed periods of two months each and seven weeks in addition, he must get three days' holidays.  The Minister has answered a question as to whether that view is correct, in the affirmative.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to leave the section as it stands, and not amend it in the way he proposes, because I fear if he does, the effect of the amended section will be to provide employers with a loophole which would enable them to evade the provisions of the Bill in respect to holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no objection, I wish to move amendment No. 62, which stands in the name of Deputy Anthony.  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 39, to delete the word &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The statement made by the Minister that he proposes to amend sub-section 4 in such a way as to provide that an employee with seven weeks' service can get no holidays, no holidays with pay, makes this amendment particularly necessary.  In the Bill it is provided that an employee will get one day's holiday for each completed period of two months' consecutive service in such employment.  An employer, realising under this section that he will be liable to pay the worker for one day's holiday in respect of every completed period of two months, will find that it is advantageous to himself if he can pay off the worker a few days before the two months period is completed.  Apparently judging by the amendment which the Minister is going to bring in to sub-section 4, the employer is going to be facilitated in that by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will not interrupt, I shall do my best to tell him. The object of this amendment is to ensure that the worker will get one <Col N="1377" /> day's holiday with pay for every completed period of two months in such employment.  Under the section which the Minister at first liked, but which he now dislikes, it was provided that the worker would only get one day's holiday with pay, for every completed period of two months' consecutive service, so that a worker who came into the employment of an employer on the 1st January and remained with him until 28th February, was entitled to one day's holiday with pay under this section, but the employer could defeat the object of this section by paying the worker off, let us say, on 26th February&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to deal with the problem by saying that once he has completed a period of two months' service&mdash;and two months' service is obviously not two consecutive months' service&mdash;he shall be entitled to one day's holiday.  I suggest that under this amendment it is possible to enable an employee who has given services for two months, not necessarily consecutive, to claim one day's holiday for that two months.  I did not draft the section.  I can only amend it as I find it and I suggest this is the most practical way to amend <Col N="1378" /> it, to benefit the workers who are intended to be benefited by it.  If the Minister says it has no meaning, well that is his own fault.  I think it has a very definite meaning.  It has a meaning which will enable an employee to get a holiday for every two months' service.  If the period has to be consecutive an employer can evade the obligation to give holidays by discharging the worker for a few days before the full period of two months is completed and re-employ him afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has not appreciated the meaning of the section at all, having regard to the fact that the obligation to pay only arises after the worker is dismissed.  I do not think that this amendment will clarify the section in any way.  It would make the section, in fact, practically unintelligible. I agree that we have got a definition of two consecutive months service, but to get a definition of service that would not be consecutive would be an impossible task having regard to the nature of the whole section.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Pay in respect of annual leave shall not be payable to a worker who is dismissed by his employer because of either misconduct on such worker's part or of the destruction of property caused or brought about by such worker.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not accept this amendment.  If we were to accept it we would have to provide for some means of inquiry into the circumstances of the dismissal of a worker where the facts were contested.  As it stands, the amendment would give rise to endless trouble because the employer might say that he had dismissed the employee for the destruction of property or for some similar offence and the employee would contest that. Therefore it would be necessary to have some kind of tribunal before which the case could be argued.  In view of that, I think it is better to leave the section as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What tribunal is necessary for the purposes of this measure that is not already available to a worker in the case of wrongful dismissal? As the situation is at present, if a man is working for me and is being paid on a weekly basis, I have no right whatever to dismiss him without giving him either a week's notice or a week's wages in lieu of notice.  If I fail to do either he can sue me in the civil courts for damages for wrongful dismissal, and the judge can measure the damages by the amount of the notice to which the man is entitled.  Now, suppose I dismiss a man and decline to give him a holiday, or pay in lieu of the holiday to which he will be entitled under this measure, the same course is still open to him.  He can sue me for wrongful dismissal and assess his damages at a week's notice, plus the rate of his holiday pay under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1935.  The judge, in assessing the damages, will measure them by: (1) payment in lieu of notice, and (2) payment in lieu of the free time which had accumulated to the employee under this measure at the date of his dismissal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is resisting this very reactionary amendment.  Deputy Dockrell wants to say that &ldquo;Pay in respect of annual leave shall not be payable to a worker who is dismissed by his employer because of either misconduct on such worker's part or of the destruction of property caused or brought about by such worker.&rdquo; Under this amendment the employer is to be the sole judge of misconduct. He is to be the sole judge of whether the worker was guilty of the destruction of property or whether the destruction of property was brought about by the action of such worker.  If it is alleged that the worker is guilty of the destruction of property or that the destruction of property is brought about by the action of the worker, is there not a simple way of testing whether the worker is guilty or not? Should not that be the test to be adopted by the employer rather than <Col N="1381" /> keeping in his pocket the money representing payment for the worker's annual leave to which he is entitled under this Bill, apart from the amendment?  The whole test in connection with the holidays is service with the employer.  If the worker renders the service, then he will be legally entitled to his holidays when this Bill becomes an Act.  It is obviously unfair for the employer to set himself up as sole judge as to whether the worker has been guilty of misconduct or of destruction of property or as to whether the destruction of property has been brought about by the action of the worker.  Deputy Dockrell must appreciate that, particularly in the latter part of his amendment, he is arrogating to himself a power which properly belongs to the courts.  If the employer feels that he has a grievance against a worker as regards the destruction of property or conspiracy leading to the destruction of property, there is a simple way by which the matter may be tested in the courts.  He should, at least, make the payment until such time as the worker is proven to be guilty of any such misconduct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Norton that he is trying to make the case that this is something quite different from what occurs in ordinary practice.  It is not very common, but it does occur that workers, wilfully or through intoxication, do something that they should not do.  They are dismissed without being paid the wages due them.  They have a very proper remedy&mdash;they can sue the employer.  If this amendment is accepted, the employer will have to pay them the holiday money due, even though he withholds the wages.  I think that any payment for holidays might as well go the same course as the wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Dockrell is not claiming that it would be just to the worker to establish the principle here that an employer has the right to dismiss him and leave him to challenge his action in the courts. That would be all right if the worker and employer were in a position of equality so far as capacity to avail of the law is concerned, but the dismissed man may not have 5/- in the world. To say to the worker, &ldquo;You have your remedy if you think I have dismissed you wrongly&rdquo; is not being just to the worker.  Surely, Deputy Dockrell does not suggest to the House in connection with holiday money or anything else that the worker should be compelled to go round on his knees to solicitors in order to get a member of that profession to take up his case on his behalf.  Deputy Dockrell assumes that the law can be availed of equally by the worker and employer. That is far from being the case in practice.  In many cases, workers have to accept unjust dismissal simply because they have not the means of challenging the action of the employer in court.  I know a man who has been idle for the last two years.  If he had the means of going to law, his last employer would be in jail for the wrong he had done that man.  What is a worker to do if he is not able to avail of the law?</P>

      <P>I think that this amendment is not one which, in its present form, should be passed.  I should like <Col N="1383" /> to know what the position is with regard to the final remark of Deputy Norton&mdash;that, if it could be proven that the employee acted wrongly, he would be satisfied to have him deprived of his holiday money.  I should like to know from the Minister if that will be the position under the Bill if no amendment is passed, because that is a very important admission from Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I thought that Deputy Norton was taking a rather dangerous line in his opposition to this amendment.  I do not think that the employer has any right whatever to withhold arrears of wages from an employee whom he has dismissed for misconduct.  Deputy Dockrell seems to suggest that he had.  What is involved here is something in the nature of arrears of wages.  If a worker works for an employer for four months, he will have earned not only so many weeks wages but also, if dismissed at the end of that period, two days' pay in lieu of wages.  If dismissed at the end of that period&mdash;no matter what the cause&mdash;he is entitled to get the arrears of wages due to him, including the two days' pay in lieu of holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is misdirecting himself.  If there is a weekly contract of service and the employee is guilty of gross misconduct, justifying his peremptory dismissal in the middle of the week, the worker has no claim in law for the wages which would be due to him.  There is a maxim in Equity dealing with the matter but, at the moment, it escapes me.  Suppose the employee's contract is from Monday to Saturday and, on Wednesday, he is guilty of an act so gravely wrong as to justify the employer in dismissing him peremptorily, he has no claim for the pay which accrued due in respect of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that is the correct view about the present position. The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the benefit accruing due under this Bill, of so many days' holidays in respect of each two months worked, will not obtain if he is dismissed for gross misconduct. That is the only justification for withholding it from him.  Deputy Norton asked why the employer should be constituted the judge of misconduct, and why should the employee be entirely in the power of the employer. No such situation is involved in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It says &ldquo;because of either misconduct on such worker's part or of the destruction of property caused or brought about by such worker.&rdquo;  The amendment means misconduct on the part of such worker. Let us assume that the amendment meant misconduct brought about destruction of property.  In that event the employer is released from the obligation placed upon him by Section 20 (5).  If the amendment is accepted, a situation may arise in which a trade union may advise an employee: &ldquo;We could not help you to sue the employer in these circumstances because you were obviously properly dismissed, and you have no claim against him.&rdquo; Although the trade union advised the employee that he has no case in common law for damages, he can sue <Col N="1385" /> under sub-section (5) for money in lieu of holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man was disqualified from any common law rights, as a result of deliberate misconduct or destruction of an employer's property, it is equitable that the misconduct discharges the employer from all further liability to a man who misconducted himself.  I would like to see some system instituted whereby, if an employer acts with gross misconduct towards an employee, the employee would have stringent remedies.  I think the common law provides pretty stringent remedies against an employer who ill-treats an employee.  It should be remembered that inherent in every contract of service in a Christian country there is not only an obligation to pay wages and to do work, but there is an obligation on the employer to treat a man who works for him decently, and an obligation on the working man to act decently and generously towards the employer.  If either behave with gross misconduct towards the other, in my opinion they are exonerated not only from their statutory obligations but the Christian obligation or relationships between employer and employee cease to operate.  Both are thrown on their strict rights and are entitled to enforce them, one against the other. It is a mistake to break in on that arrangement, and I suggest, although an employee definitely has been guilty of gross misconduct and destruction of an employer's property, there still faces the employer a claim for something that has accrued due.  If people behave with gross impropriety, or gross disloyalty, either employee or employer, let them take the consequences of their action.  They should be made to do so.  I am not in favour of weighing unduly on behalf of an employee or an employer.  Let justice be done.  Let both sides know that if they treat one another unjustly they must take the consequences.</P>

      <P>We cannot regulate the matter in the delicate way that Deputy Dillon would like.  What the amendment of Deputy Dockrell proposes to do is to insert a provision in the Bill, <Col N="1386" /> assuming statutorily that the worker is guilty of an offence in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And withhold the pay. Let us assume that the worker is entitled to holidays, and that on a certain Saturday morning the employer says: &ldquo;I am satisfied that, as a result of certain negligence on your part, a quantity of goods was damaged, which would not be damaged if you had been zealous, and because of that fact I am not going to pay you for any holidays which have accrued.&rdquo;  The worker goes off and he can get no pay according to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The worker was expecting a week's pay on that Saturday. Let us assume that he expected also to be paid another week's pay on 12 months' service, but as a result of what the employer considered to be certain negligence on his part, when goods were damaged, he informs him that he is not going to pay him for the week's holidays.  As the employee finishes with the employer, according to the amendment he is going to spend his holidays during the following week looking for a solicitor to take action against the employer for withholding a week's pay. This assumes in advance that the worker is statutorily guilty of an offence and is the employer's title to withhold the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the assumption is wrong the employer will not only have <Col N="1387" /> to pay a week's pay in lieu of notice, as well as pay in respect of the holidays, but will also have to pay the employee's costs in legal proceedings. If the Deputy imagines that employers like to pay costs any more than employees, it is absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be taken into consideration that the workman is the weaker person financially.  His capacity to sue the employer arises, and his capacity to sustain his assumption against the employer also arises, while the amendment wants to assume that the worker has been guilty of an offence, in advance.  The Deputy has drawn the amendment in such a way that it does not impose any obligation on the employer to initiate an action in law as to whether he was justified in withholding the money or not. The amendment wants to make it possible for the employer to be able to make allegations against the workman, that he caused the destruction of property or conspired in that direction, or brought about destruction of property, and, in the meantime, the Deputy wants the week's wages to remain in the pocket of the employer. Deputy Dockrell is not concerned about the fine points at all.  He is not concerned about going to any court to initiate an action as to whether such action was justified or not.  The Deputy's object is to secure that the money will remain in the employer's pocket until such time as the court decides the question.  It is an extraordinary contention.  The Deputy is trying to establish by the amendment a kind of jungle law.</P>

Deputy Dockrell, in any case, comes here to advocate what in effect is jungle law.  He says in effect:  &ldquo;A worker has been guilty of misconduct or of damage to my property; I owe that worker money in respect of holidays, and I am going to keep that money until he pays me for the damage he has done.&rdquo;  Let me put it to the Deputy this way.  Suppose the worker left the employer's employment on Saturday, and suppose that he left a coat and a case behind him.  According to the philosophy of this amendment, the employer would be entitled to seize that coat and case and to say: &ldquo;I am going to hold on to these, until such time as you make good what I, not the courts, consider you have wrongfully done.&rdquo;  That is the effect of this amendment.  It means that the employer is entitled to seize all goods that he can seize from the worker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in satisfaction of a claim by the employer based upon an unproven allegation.  Deputy Dockrell knows perfectly well&mdash;in any case, if he does not know it, he has enough legal minds around him to advise him on the matter&mdash;that if he can substantiate a claim against a worker for malicious destruction of property, there is a legal remedy for dealing with it.  Nobody wants to stand for the worker who is guilty of malicious destruction of property but the Deputy does not want to take the obvious remedy for dealing with such conduct.  The Deputy wants to make sure that he wins from the outset.  He wants to make sure that he can collar the worker's wages and keep them, trusting to two things: (1) that he actually has the wages, and (2) that the worker may not have sufficient resources to enable him to pursue his <Col N="1389" /> claim through the courts.  Obviously, that is an unfair attitude for the Deputy to take.  He wants to strengthen the position of the man who is already well-to-do as against the position of the man whose sole worldly goods are his capacity to sell his labour.  I should like to hear Deputy Morrissey on this amendment in order to see whether he agrees with the other members of his Party, and I venture to say that nobody&mdash;unless it is somebody who wants to make sure that the employer will win in any case &mdash;will support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that both Deputy Norton and Deputy Dillon are slightly astray here.  In the first place, if I dismiss a man on account of damage that he has done, I cannot retain any wages.  I can do it, but there is no law justifying it.  I think that that should govern the principle of the Bill.  I have been an employee myself for many years, and I believe that wherever an employee does something that would justify his dismissal, the employer should have the absolute right to dismiss him, with or without notice; but in any case I have ever known, where employees were dismissed, a civil bill can be taken out in the district court and you can issue a <Col N="1391" /><i>quantum meruit</i>, and I have never seen a case where the worker was not paid for the amount of work he had done.  If this section, as it stands, would put an employer in such a position that he could not dismiss an employee, I think it would be a very arbitrary position and would mean that employees could be quite reckless with their employers' property.  I have been an employee for a long period of my life, and I would not stand for any employee being permitted to destroy property without being penalised in some way&mdash;being penalised at least by dismissal from his employment.  Of course, Deputy Norton says that the employee is in a bad position.  He is not.  As I said already, I have never known a case, even where there was justification for dismissal, where the judge gave a decree against the payment of wages for the amount of work done.  The same would apply with regard to the question of the holiday. Perhaps the amendment might be redrafted to improve it.  Otherwise, I must say that as a person who has been an employee for many years, I do not see much wrong with it.  If it only asserts the right of an employer to dismiss an employee who has been guilty of misconduct or who has maliciously damaged his employer's property, I do not see much wrong with it.</P>

The Minister will see that, apparently, <Col N="1392" /> as the Bill at present stands, by doing that consistently, he could avoid the obligation to give a man any holidays at all.  As far as I can see, the same thing applies unless you eliminate the word &ldquo;consecutive,&rdquo; and then you are thrown into a worse dilemma, because if you eliminate the word &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo; you are left in the position that if you employ a casual labourer for a day you must give him a day's holiday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  He <Col N="1393" /> will be entitled to a day's pay for each two months of consecutive work done, but the main purpose of the section is to provide some deterrent against the dismissal of employees periodically in order to prevent their becoming entitled to the holiday week.  Whatever change in the section is necessary to ensure that, while, at the same time, not requiring that a man who gets one day's work will get two days' pay, will be introduced.  I think it would be undesirable that we should have the extra day's pay even if a man does only one, two or a few days' work.</P>

      <P>This is the section in which the Minister takes power to make regulations declaring any specified form of industrial work to be excluded as industrial work &ldquo;for the purposes of any or all of the sections of this Part of the Act.&rdquo;  I should like the Minister to tell us in what circumstances he proposes to use the provisions of this section, from the point of view of excluding industrial work from the provisions of this Part of the Act.  Is this intended to deal with the situation indicated by the Minister in Section 4, sub-section (2)?  Can we have some general idea from the Minister as to what the object of this section is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this section is to give power to deal, by way of exclusion from any sections of this part of the Bill, with difficulties that will arise.  The best example I can give is the case of boiler men and preparatory workers.  There is a certain hour stated in the Bill before which industrial work cannot be done.  The work must commence at a certain hour.  We may change that hour but <Col N="1394" /> there will be an hour stated, whatever it will be.  If work is to commence at that hour, in some concerns certain workers must come in an hour or half an hour beforehand in order to prepare the ground, such as boiler men and other preparatory workers.  It may be necessary for an engineer to work on the repairing or renovation of plant at times outside the ordinary working hours, and it is desired to have power to exclude certain forms of work of that kind from any of the provisions of this part of the Bill, where a case is made for it.</P>
      <P>I understand that certain men employed in certain breweries have to come in for an hour on Sundays for the purpose of testing temperatures, and, as the Bill stands, they will be prohibited from working for 24 hours in the ensuing week.  Unless we amend the Bill in some other way to exclude such work, I would be inclined to make an order excluding them from the obligation not to work on Sunday. I think it is in their own interest that they should be excluded, because no man wants to get 24 hours without pay to compensate for one hour's work done on Sunday.  Other cases will no doubt arise out of the circumstances of particular industries where there will be an occasional form of work which, for some good reason, cannot be made subject to all the provisions of the section and, upon a case of that kind being made, an exclusion order covering that class of work would be made in relation to the particular section from which the difficulty arose.</P>

      <P>There are certain provisions in the Bill which will have to <Col N="1395" /> be amplified.  We can deal with them when we come to them.  There is a starting hour of 8 o'clock fixed, but I do not think we need fix 8 o'clock exactly, provided the total working day is not increased.  I think I would be disposed, in connection with Sunday and holiday work, to permit of a certain restricted amount of work being done on those days, to get over difficulties in special cases, but we can discuss that when we come to it.  In any event, I think it is necessary, having regard to the nature of the legislation and the fact that this is the first time that we had a Bill of this kind before us and do not quite know, and cannot possibly know, the circumstances of every industry, that there should be some general power of exclusion where these obvious difficulties are going to arise in applying the principles of this part of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister excuse <Col N="1396" /> me, as I may not be here for that section, for drawing his attention on this general empowering section to the situation obtaining in bakeries and, particularly, in rural bakeries?  For instance, it is practically impossible to get a continuous working day for rural bakers.  You have a situation in which they come in at, say, 5 o'clock in the morning and go off at 11 o'clock, having set what they call sponges.  These sponges will mature until, perhaps, 3 o'clock, and the men will then come in and work from 3 o'clock till 5.30 and go off for the rest of the day. On the face of it, that is a 12-hour working day, but in fact it is only an eight-hour day.  It has in it, however, the evil element of broken hours and I cannot see any method whereby, in that particular industry, that situation can be avoided.  What I want to press on the Minister is that before putting legislation into effect, he should look carefully at the special conditions applying, not only to these industries in general, but to these industries in their own particular localities.  He will find in some places where bakers are working on a straight dough, for instance, that the hours worked will be quite different to the hours of bakers who are working on what is called a sponge.  Not only will there be the technicalities of each trade but the Minister will find, in rural industries, rural technicalities being introduced into each separate trade.</P>

On the last day on which we discussed this Bill I sought to give the Minister power to make regulations prohibiting the number of lowly-paid workers in each industry. The Minister on that occasion said that he did not want that particular power, because if he had it the rest of his official life as Minister would be spent in receiving deputations urging him to prohibit the number of lowly-paid workers in particular industries.

If there is a good case for saying that an amendment prohibiting the number of lowly paid workers in an industry should be resisted because the Minister would have to receive deputations asking him to prohibit the number of such lowly-paid workers, then there is an equally good case against this particular section, because once it is enshrined in this Bill the Minister will be deluged with deputations requesting him to make regulations excluding certain specified forms of industrial work from the scope of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to keep to Section 22.  The Minister in any case has included a section in this particular Bill authorising him to make regulations excluding certain forms of industrial work.  He knows perfectly well that he will be deluged with deputations asking him to make those regulations excluding certain forms of industrial work.  The Minister is quite content apparently to receive deputations on the subject of making regulations under this section, while it was apparently undesirable to ask the Minister to receive deputations under the section I sought to have inserted, namely, to give him power to prohibit the employment of lowly-paid workers in a particular industry.  This section is a bad one. Even if one could conceive a case for dealing with industrial work of a certain emergency kind, I think the Minister has too much power under this section, because I fear that the object of this section will be to widen the gap in respect of the particular kinds of industrial work which are excluded from the scope of the Bill. In the section the Minister takes no power whatever to ensure that such benefits as are in the Bill are preserved to the worker in the excluded industrial undertaking, unless in Section 44 the Minister proposes to take power of that kind.  It seems to me to be a very insipid kind of power the Minister is taking, and he <Col N="1400" /> seems to be doing very little to ensure that even in respect of an excluded form of industrial work those employed in that form of industrial work will be safeguarded, and, so far as is possible under the Bill, have preserved to them such benefits as are in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 23.</P>
      <P>The Minister, if he is satisfied that the amount of any form of industrial work which is required to be done for the purpose of carrying on an industrial undertaking is at any time abnormally increased, may grant to the person who carries on such industrial undertaking a permit to employ workers to do such form of industrial work at any time in a period (not being longer than two weeks) specified in such permit, in the same manner as if such form of industrial work were excluded industrial work for the purpose of all or any of the sections of this Part of this Act as may be specified in such permit, and whenever a permit granted under this section is in force the form of industrial work to which it relates shall be excluded industrial work for the purpose of such sections when done in such industrial undertaking in the period specified in such permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 67:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 23, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may by order from time to time declare any form of industrial work or any industrial undertaking other than a form of industrial work or an industrial undertaking which is specifically excluded from the provisions of this Act to be a form of industrial work or an industrial undertaking to which this Act applies and such order shall operate and have effect so as to apply the provisions of this <Col N="1401" /> Act to any industrial work performed in or in relation to any such industrial undertaking as is specified therein in like manner as if such form of industrial work or industrial undertaking were particularly mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 3 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to give the Minister power to include within the scope of this Bill certain forms of work which are at present excluded.  This amendment is designed to enable the Minister to declare a form of industrial work or an industrial undertaking to be of the kind necessary to bring it within the scope of this particular Bill.  In an earlier discussion which we had on this Bill I mentioned the case of a carter who might be drawing sand or stones to or from a quarry, and who was as much an industrial worker as the person engaged in quarrying the sand or the stones.  I think it is desirable in a case of that kind, that, if such a person is not brought within the scope of this particular Bill, the Minister should have power, on a detailed examination of the circumstances of the case, or on joint representations being made to him by the workers and employers, to declare that kind of work to be industrial work within the scope of this particular Bill.  It is well to mention that this Bill excludes completely from its scope workers engaged in transport.  I think it is even still doubtful whether bakery workers are included.  It excludes shipping workers, carters, and delivery men.  Circumstances might arise where it was desirable that certain of those workers, either as a class or as a section of a class, should be included within the scope of the Bill.  It is not sought to make it mandatory on the Minister to include such forms of work; the amendment is designed to enable him to include such forms of work if circumstances should arise in which the Minister would consider it desirable to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment is not necessary.  It proposes that the Minister may declare any form of industrial work, other than <Col N="1402" /> industrial work which is specifically excluded, to be a form of industrial work to which the Act applies.  That is the case.  The Bill covers any industrial work other than agricultural, commercial or domestic work as defined in the Bill, which are specifically excluded.  The Deputy's amendment, therefore, is not necessary.  All industrial work, except that which is specifically excluded, is in fact within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

They might go to the courts and claim that they should be excluded.  That would be contrary to the whole spirit of the text of this section.</P>

      <P>I think if the Minister looks up his own speech he will find he said that.  That is a form of industrial work.  A certain man mines sand, another man gravel, and the person who carts the stone and the gravel is as much an industrial worker as the man who is mining the sand or the gravel.  I am seeking to give the Minister power to include a person who is doing that particular kind of work, so as to ensure that any sort of industrial work dovetails into the work done under Section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most refreshing to see the bureaucratic soul of the Minister leap with joy when he sees the implication of Deputy Norton's amendment. Section 3 of this Bill does purport to define industrial work.  It does <Col N="1404" /> set out certain things which it declares are industrial work, and it says there are lots of other things which are industrial work.  That is what we propose to deal with here.  Deputy Norton proposes to take from the law courts the function of declaring what is, or what is not, industrial work and to transfer it to the Minister.  At first the Minister does not see that.  But suddenly he sees it, and he says: &ldquo;This transfers the whole functions from the court to me and my officials,&rdquo; and immediately he sees something attractive in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider any proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  That proposal is certain to receive a warm welcome in Lord Edward Street.  Anything that transfers the functions of this House or the Oireachtas to Lord Edward Street is welcome to them.  I suggest now to Deputy Norton that he ought to withdraw this amendment.  As the Bill stands he can go to the courts and argue there that a certain occupation is an industrial occupation, and if the courts so decide it comes under Section 3 of the Bill and by virtue of that decision the whole Bill is applied to it.  If, on the other hand, he gets this amendment inserted the courts are not going to look at the text of the debates in this House.  The courts will say: &ldquo;You have in Section 3 a list of what industrial work is.&rdquo;  But if you have later in the Bill a provision saying that where necessary the Minister may declare any other form of work to be industrial work, the court will say it was clearly the intention of the Legislature to limit this, and the limitation is set out in a later section.  That is what the courts will say if Deputy Norton's amendment is accepted.  If it is not accepted the courts will say: &ldquo;Here is the section that the industrial work does not include agricultural, commercial and domestic work and mining, and it does include the following things.&rdquo;  That is in no way exclusive of anything which is not specifically named in the Preamble.  The only things specifically excluded are agriculture, <Col N="1405" /> commercial and domestic work and mining.  Deputy Norton will find himself entitled by the decision of the courts to add to the categories A to M which at present stand in the section.  My suggestion to the Deputy is that his amendment is calculated to defeat the object he has in view.  He should withdraw the amendment and rest assured that he can argue his case about the carter drawing metal or sand from a quarry with a far better prospect of success before a judge than he can before the officials of the Department, into whose minds entirely extraneous considerations will enter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> If he is satisfied that the amount of any form of industrial work which is required to be done for the purpose of carrying on an industrial undertaking is at any time abnormally increased...</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree on consideration that Section 22 deals with a specified form of industrial work.  In other words, let us say the Minister decides to exclude rainwater goods; they can be dealt with under Section 22, and the regulations so made are applicable to that form of industrial undertaking.  But suppose a particular firm said it had an order for the manufacture of rainwater goods for China, a particular regulation will have to be made under Section 23 to deal with that case, because the other firms in the trade will not desire the exclusion regulations referred to in Section 22 made on their behalf.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister will not, by means of the power which he has under Section 22, issue permits every fortnight to a particular firm or firms, in order to take them outside the scope of this Bill.  While the eight weeks' period suggested by me is arbitrary and has no scientific or any other basis, I should like, nevertheless, to ensure that a permit of this kind should not be issued in such a way as to enable the Minister by issuing a permit for one fortnight, to issue another permit for another fortnight, and in that way exhaust the whole calendar.</P>

If the conditions which were abnormal in the first fortnight continued for a year, the abnormal conditions would become normal, in which case the Minister's power to give a permit would disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that in any emergency provision of this kind&mdash; because that is what it is&mdash;you cannot impose any definite restriction upon the use of it.  You have really to rely upon the judgment of the people who are going to exercise the power and their general policy in respect to it.  Circumstances may arise in which a particular restriction would be very onerous, no matter whether the restriction was for eight weeks, or eight months, or eight days.  There may be particular circumstances which would make that particular restriction a very serious burden upon an individual. Therefore, I suggest that in any section of this type it is necessary to define the circumstances under which the power can be used, and then leave a sort of general discretion for the exercise of it.</P>

      <P>This is only a token fortnight perhaps.  The amendment means that under this section, once that certificate has been issued, the workers concerned in that industrial undertaking, are excluded from the scope of this part of the Act.  Therefore, the Minister will appreciate the strong reasons that exist for making the permit to cover as short a period as possible.  I do not want to press the period of eight weeks because it is not a scientific or an equitable basis but I would like to ensure that the Minister could not issue permits, under the section, for 52 weeks.  I think the Minister would find that advantageous if it was there.</P>

We fix the hours of work permitted by that Washington Hours Convention as the maximum hours for occupations under this Bill.  I would not propose, in any circumstances, to modify this section. If we go below the hours of work fixed by the Washington Convention for any industrial occupation, we ought only do so after consultation with the persons interested on both sides, whether employers or employees, in accordance with the terms of Section 44.  That is the general scheme of the Bill, and to accept this or any other of these particular amendments by Deputy Norton would be contrary to the general purposes of the Bill.  That purpose is to fix the hours in accordance with the Washington Hours Convention, and to deal with the matter of shorter hours by Special Order under Section 44.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Other countries have travelled far in this matter.  The Minister can get information from his own Department in connection with these things.  If he does not I will give him some.  The Washington Convention, which was adopted in 1919, took note of the industrial conditions then existing. <Col N="1413" /> The industrial conditions then existing were such that many workers in many cases worked 56 and 72 hours a week. The Washington Convention was thought to be, in the circumstances then existing, a contribution to the reduction to the hours of workers in industrial employment.  And in the circumstances the 1919 Washington Hours Convention was certainly an advance. We did not have that development in industrial technique, rationalisation or mechanisation, that we have now. Looking at the position to-day, we can approach it from the standpoint of what the world was like in 1919.  We cannot shut out completely from our minds the technical, mechanical and scientific progress that has taken place in the intervening years.  If 48 hours was the maximum week for 1919, then, having regard to the enormous scientific and mechanical progress, and having regard to the enormous extent of the unemployment problem to-day, as compared with 1919, the maximum working week at the time of the Washington Convention in 1919 was justified, but not now.  The Minister says he does not propose to amend the Bill in such a way as to meet the amendments moved to this section, and he prefers to rely upon the powers he has under Section 44.  The hours suggested in Section 26 in respect to industrial employment do not represent any pioneering effort by the Minister at all. Does the Minister accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 26 that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has done under Section 26 is to give a kind of legal sanction to what has been done years ago by the trade union movement. If the trade union movement had not been able to reduce hours to the limits at which they are to-day, and if the hours were higher than they are to-day, we would find the Minister introducing a Bill to legalise the hours of work at the instance of the unions. The Minister is no pioneer: he has done no blazing of the trail; he has simply walked on the velvet road. There is not only a good road but there is a good footpath.</P>

      <P>No one wants to travel over that road.  The Minister is only giving legal sanction to what has already been done by the trade unions. So far as this particular section is concerned, it is no benefit to the workers whatever.  Perhaps one or two industries may be affected beneficially by this section, but if they are, I do not know of them.  Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to tell us what industries will be beneficially affected by the operation of this section.  I think the maximum hours suggested in the section are altogether too long for shift work.  I think the problem to-day is not a problem of extending the hours of work or of maintaining the existing hours.  The problem to-day is different to the problem confronting those who made the Washington Convention in 1919.  The problem is to organise the leisure of the people and share the work available.  If there was scarcity of labour in this country, I could understand the Minister making a case against the amendment, but in face of the fact that we have 131,000 registered as unemployed, and that there are plenty of people available to do the additional work in industry and elsewhere, I think an amendment of this kind is calculated to help towards absorbing some of those people in industry.  I would press the Minister to accept this amendment and thus, in any case let some slight shadow of the reflection of a pioneer descend upon him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall do our pioneering by using the powers which the Bill confers upon us.  I could not accept this amendment.  Neither do I think it desirable under any circumstances to regard a movement to reduce the hours of work as a scheme for sharing work.  I do not think Deputy Norton fully realised the implications of that phrase when he used it.  It is one which has been used in Geneva within the last few weeks, and it has been pointed out that to share the hours of work would mean a reduction of individual earnings.  A sharing of the work has generally the meaning that there must be a sharing of the <Col N="1415" /> wage fund as well as of the work, and the Deputy knows we are opposed to that.  We would oppose any reduction of hours which would mean a reduction in individual earnings.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister should react to this proposal by giving expression to the same ideas as the British Minister for Labour disseminated in Geneva in dealing with the ratification of the Convention in respect to a maximum of 48 hours per week.  His whole attitude towards the ratification of the Convention was a fear that the wages of workers would be reduced.  In this Bill we specifically provide that there will be no reduction in wages.  This amendment is moved in the clear knowledge that that reaction is not possible under this Bill, and as a matter of fact, as the Minister knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are specifically providing that there will be no reduction of wages under the Bill.  We need not, therefore, fear this amendment from the standpoint of its effects on the wages of workers.

He can deal with the circumstances of each industry separately without seeking to impose certain maximum limits for work like this.

Having regard to the extent of the unemployment problem, I believe this amendment would help towards absorbing a large number of the workers at present unemployed.  I do not believe that a reduction of working hours will solve the unemployment problem but I believe that a reduction of working hours is necessary.

      <P>(4) Sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by subsequent legislation shall be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;or serving a term of apprenticeship under indenture&rdquo; were inserted therein after the word &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; where it now occurs in that sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time parents who are in the fortunate position of being able to send their children to the university are granted exemptions.  The object of this amendment is to secure that the same privilege should be extended <Col N="1418" /> to parents who are not so fortunately circumstanced and who have their children apprenticed in a profession of one kind or another.  High fees have to be paid in respect of those children, and in many instances technical equipment for them is very expensive.  The cost of their maintenance, during their apprenticeship period, falls as heavily on their parents as the cost of maintenance on parents who are able to send their children to the university. It is only fair, I think, that when an exemption is given in one case it should be given in the other.  It is particularly desirable that the exemption that I am seeking should be conceded in view of the fact that our hope is to equip our young people to take up technical positions in many of the new industries recently established.  A number of the positions in those new industries are at present filled by foreigners.  Our hope ought to be to have them filled by our own people.  I urge that as a strong reason on the Minister for Finance why he should grant the exemption that I am seeking for the parents of children serving a term of apprenticeship under indenture.</P>

      <P>I regret that at such short notice for which the Deputy, possibly, is not responsible, I am unable to give any hope that the amendment can be accepted.  The matter is not quite so simple as it would appear.  If we were to accept the principle involved then, no doubt, we would be driven to give further concessions.  The amount that the Exchequer might lose in respect of this particular amendment might not be very large but, nevertheless, the repercussions of it might be extensive and might involve us in considerable loss.  In any event, it seems to me that the position is this: that either those people who do send their children to be apprenticed to one occupation or another are in a position to pay income tax and are, therefore, assessed for income tax, or else they are not assessable for it.  I do not know that, from the point of view of the wage-earning classes generally, the exemption would be very effective, because there are comparatively few of them <Col N="1419" /> who, I think, would come within the limits of income tax assessment.  The main objection to the proposal at this stage is that we have not had time to consider it and, therefore, I could not undertake to do anything in regard to it in this year's Finance Bill.  I will, however, have the matter looked into to see what exactly it would involve, and come to a decision when I have ascertained what the facts are.</P>

They are a most deserving class of citizen.  They spend large sums of money in educating their children for professions&mdash;doctors, engineers and even lawyers.

I think the Minister will admit that he was extremely vague in what he said.  He did not tell the House what other classes he had in mind which, he feared, might seek concessions if he were to grant this particular one.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Alton's speech is a pointer as to what my fears are: that the granting of an exemption of this kind would not be confined to the wage-earning classes who apprentice their children in some particular occupation, and that an attempt would be made to extend the principle to those whose children are preparing for the learned professions.  It might be urged then that the exemption now proposed was not based on the inability of the <Col N="1420" /> parent to earn such a sufficient income as would allow him to pay income tax during the period he was maintaining his children but on the hypothesis that during the period of apprenticeship they were being educated.  As I have said, I am not able to do anything about it this year.  I will have the matter looked into to see what are the possible extensions of this concession, and what the probable cost to the Exchequer would be.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the foregoing sub-section and of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1934, any house or buildings used or occupied by a person for the purpose of farming or working lands shall be deemed to be a farm house or a farm building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to relieve a number of people from a hardship under which they suffer at present.  There are a number of farmers in the country who have very big houses.  In most cases they are old houses and costly to maintain.  No one seems to be able to give a definition of what a farmer's house is, and as a result there is a good deal of trouble so far as the payment of income tax is concerned.  Some of those old houses, which are used solely by farmers, are not assessed as farmers' houses at all.  I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the amendment. The law, as it stands, is causing great hardship to a number of people who are in occupation of those old <Col N="1421" /> houses which are used as farmers' houses.  The valuations put on them in old times were very high.  The trouble is that they are not assessed as farmers' houses.</P>

      <P>The interpretation put on a farmhouse by the Revenue Commissioners is a house constructed for, and used by, a farmer, a farmer being a person who makes his living by farming.  There is no difficulty as to what a farmhouse is understood to mean.  There are a number of cases where houses are used not merely for the purpose of providing a residence for a farmer but of providing a residence for, say, a country shopkeeper, a country doctor or a country gentleman. These, of course, are not regarded by the Department as farmhouses.  If there were any attempt to define a &ldquo;farmhouse,&rdquo; the definition would have to be so very strictly drawn that a number of border-line cases which, at the present time, get the benefit of the concession would possibly be ruled out. If it is the desire of the Deputy to safeguard cases of that kind, I think he is going on the wrong lines when he asks me to define &ldquo;farmhouse.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to the Minister's objection.  A number of houses were brought to my notice which were, undoubtedly, used as farmhouses but which were not regarded as such for the purpose of this provision.  There was a time when these houses were used merely as residences. I do not know whether or not glebe houses would come under that head.  There is really no difference between A., who lives in a farmhouse and B., who lives in a house which 50 years ago was of a different type but which is now used for the purposes of a farm.  That is quite as much a farmer's house as is the house of A. <Col N="1422" /> The Minister says that he cannot do what we ask.</P>

      <P>I can do it.  It would not be impossible to define &ldquo;farmhouse,&rdquo; but that it would be beneficial to the people whom Deputy Fagan has in mind is another question.  At the moment the word &ldquo;farmhouse&rdquo; connotes a certain type of dwelling.  That word has been used since 1894, and the Special Commissioners are the people who determine what a farmhouse is, having regard to the facts before them. As, in general, they are liberal to the view of the taxpayer, they interpret that provision with a certain amount of generosity.  If the word is to be defined, the definition will have to be such as will protect the revenue against all possible doubt, and these border-line cases, which at present get the benefit of the concession, will, undoubtedly be ruled out.</P>

      <P>What strikes me about the Minister's refusal to accept this amendment is that this increased taxation is going to fall on people who are actually engaged in farming&mdash;the people who, under another Act of this year, are being deprived of £100,000, given last year in relief of rates on agricultural land.  I suggested to the Minister, when this fact disclosed itself, that the reduction of this £100,000 would bring to the farming population the particular kind of tax that has been brought to townspeople. There was a suggestion that the farmers were going to escape this particular type of increased taxation, but I urged that they were not, as the agricultural grant was being reduced. The Minister indicates by his refusal to accept a definition along the lines of Deputy Fagan's amendment that there are farms on which this particular taxation is likely to fall in its total weight.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fagan is not interested in people who do not make their living by farming.  He is interested only in the farming community. If the amendment is so drawn that it brings in a class for which Deputy Fagan does not pretend to speak, he will have no objection to the Minister amending it on Report Stage so as to omit that particular class.  There was a point in dispute, so far as the people for whom Deputy Fagan speaks are concerned, as to whether, by reason of the so-called reduction in land annuities, they were to be allowed the whole of the eleven-thirteenths of the former rents in respect of income tax.  If that case is decided against them, they will have an addition to meet.  So far as line-ball cases are concerned, it is for this House to lay down the law and not for the Special Commissioners.  If the House says that the Special Commissioners are to discover what we meant by the use of the word &ldquo;farmhouse,&rdquo;<Col N="1424" /> we are losing any control we had over legislation.  The Minister is not in a position to define &ldquo;farmhouse.&rdquo;  He falls back on the interpretation of the Special Commissioners.  That is a ridiculous position for the Minister to occupy.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not, of himself, able to say what our legislation lays down precisely.  Let us assume that a farmer has a house which is not habitable.  There is a big house for sale in the neighbourhood. If a farmer buys that house, to be utilised by him as a farmhouse instead of his former tumbledown house, he has to undergo trial by the Special Commissioners as to whether or not he is to get this concession.  According to the Minister, he will not get it, although the house occupied by him is used exclusively for farming purposes. The position with regard to that is that there is waste and a loss.  At the present time the farming community is not in the position to bear any of the extra cost.  If the intention is to exclude houses occupied by farmers, used exclusively in connection with their business, then it should not be for the Special Commissioners to decide what this House should decide to exclude by an Act.  If the amendment of Deputy Fagan is too elaborate, then the Minister can amend it.</P>

      <P>I have already pointed out that, as far as the law is concerned, it is quite clear that farmhouses are exempt, and that it is not necessary to define &ldquo;farmhouses&rdquo; further than that.  If the Deputy wants to put in this amendment, in order to get the ideal position he seeks, we should have to define every word in it. &ldquo;Farmhouse&rdquo; is a well understood entity, and conveys the real idea to the minds of the Special Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners.  As always in the case of a definition, a question of fact will have to be determined, whether a certain hereditament does or does not fit inside that definition.  The definition is there already.  The only thing for the <Col N="1425" /> Special Commissioners to determine is the question of excluding property from the limits of the definition, having determined whether it does or does not fit in the connotation of the word &ldquo;farmhouse&rdquo;.  There is nothing more than that.  The law has been there for 41 years.  The only question is that Deputy Fagan wants it to include something else, a residence which happens to have a farm attached, the same as park land or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the Minister's objection to the amendment.  A big house that was a residence 50 years ago was not regarded as a farmhouse.  The economic conditions of the country have so changed that that house is now used by a farmer for farming purposes exclusively.  Has it ceased to be regarded as a residence, or is it treated as a farmhouse?  It is quite possible, even if it is used exclusively for farming, that a person with the Finance Acts before him might feel compelled to interpret them as referring to a residence.  Leaving aside the question of residence, I know of glebe houses that are now farmhouses, but that are treated for purposes of valuation, as glebe houses.  The Revenue Commissioners might feel bound to treat such places as residences, even though they are used exclusively for farming purposes.  I do not think there is any difference between us on this question, and that <Col N="1426" /> the Minister does not wish that any houses exclusively used for farming should be taxed in any other way. The amendment is merely intended to make that intention clear.  If a few words could be added to the amendment, to safeguard the Minister from any dangers that he fears, I suggest that he should put them in now or on the Report Stage.  This is not a question of getting a new definition of farming, but one of taking the precautions that the Legislature is bound to take, if it believes that there is any danger of injustice being done.  The Legislature should take precautions that residences or glebe houses now used for ordinary farm purposes shall be so regarded by those whose business it is to interpret these Acts.  We must make our position in the matter clear.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (5), page 4, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an inspector of taxes or such other officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint in that behalf is of opinion that the annual value with reference to which an assessment of tax is made on any tenement or rateable heriditament in pursuance of sub-section (1) of this section exceeds the annual rent at which such tenement or rateable heriditament is worth to be let from year to year, he may, notwithstanding that there has been no appeal under Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1929 (No. 32 of 1929), against such <Col N="1427" /> assessment and notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (6) of the said Section 5, at any time before the end of the year of assessment grant relief by reducing such assessment and charging the tax on the amount on which it would in his opinion, have been charged if it had been assessed with reference to the said annual rent instead of the said annual value, and the said assessment as so reduced shall be final and conclusive for all purposes.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to enable inspectors of taxes to give relief, where the increased assessment exceeds the annual rent at which the property is let from year to year. Hitherto that relief could only be given if it was proved to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners or the Circuit Judge on appeal.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that taxpayers can secure relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the increase in the valuation to five-fourths.  That is a most undesirable form of tax. Even if it stands this way for this year it will probably lead local authorities to make representations that the balance between the Central Government and themselves has been upset. There is another aspect of that to which the Minister did not give sufficient attention.  If there is one problem that requires attention it is housing.  Housing for the working classes is proceeding as fast as the resources at the command of the country permit.  That class of <Col N="1428" /> investors who purchase their own houses, and who are hit under this section, are the very class that the Government should be most anxious to encourage.</P>
      <P>A return was issued a few days ago giving the housing work in each of the counties in the Free State, and in a table issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health there is given the number of houses constructed by persons under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1932-34. Under the heading, &ldquo;New Houses Completed,&rdquo; 12,000 is the figure given, and for houses erected by private persons and public utility services, the figure given is 9,000.  That shows the enormous proportion of houses that are being built for the small class of persons who are especially hardly hit under this section.  I suggest to the Minister that on every house put up for the working classes there is a loss which has to be paid off in one form or another.  Now, where a house is put up for a private individual, no such loss is entailed.  Even here in the City of Dublin, where there is a Corporation Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, there are really only financial provisions to assist those persons to own their own houses.  If those houses were not put up, a great many more houses would be required to be put up by the local authorities, and I suggest that it is penalising the small and thrifty class of investor whom the Government should be most anxious to encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it was last year that the allowance of one-sixth towards repairs was done away with, and now you have the Schedule A raised to five-fourths.  This is a most undesirable form of discrimination against an investor who has come to the assistance of the State in order to help them to solve the housing problem.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that this form of special legislation against the owners of their own houses is most undesirable and that it will lead, probably, to a certain amount of curtailment of this class of purchasing power by private individuals in the <Col N="1429" /> future.  I believe that, in the long run, it will defeat the object which the Government had in view, namely, the encouragement of the building of as many houses as possible.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this tax which it is proposed to put on under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, Sir, an amendment, standing in my name, was withdrawn for redrafting because, I understand, permission was given to reintroduce it on Report Stage.  The object of my amendment was to avoid a flat increase of the valuation by 20 per cent. because of the obvious absence of equity in such a proposal. If it is fair to increase the valuation of a house, which was valued 30 years ago, before the war, by 20 per cent., it is obviously unfair to increase in the same way the value of a house that was valued 12 months ago.  My suggestion to the Minister is that he ought to try to arrive at some scheme which would be analogous to the proposals contained in the Rent Restrictions Act, where it was laid down that the rent payable in respect of any tenement or heriditament on a certain day should not be increased except by a statutory percentage.  The critical date was a date prior to the beginning of the great war.  I think it was the 4th August, 1914, but I am not certain as to the date and, for that reason, I should prefer to leave it over till the Report Stage in order to establish an exact analogy between my proposal and the rent restrictions legislation. Some workable case may be made for the increase of valuations which have become out-of-date, but, in my submission, no case can be made for the equity of increasing the valuation of all houses by the same percentage without any regard to the time when the valuation was made.  I suggest that the Minister ought to withdraw this or, at least, that he should indicate his intention of accepting the principle contained in that amendment and introducing an amendment of his own on those lines on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputies who have spoken.  I think <Col N="1430" /> that this proposal is most unfair to those who happen to own property.  In my opinion, it is most undesirable and it is very short-sighted on the part of the Government.  This is a proposal which, not alone proposes to tax the income of a property owner, but strikes a direct blow at the capital of the house owner.  Everyone who has bought a house up to the present has paid a certain sum for it, estimated upon what the cost of the house is going to be to him in upkeep and in the payment of rates and taxes; and, to give an example, for every house on which you put, by this means, an extra £5 a year, it will mean that that house will become to its owner worth the capitalised value of that £5 a year less when he comes to sell the house, because the new purchaser will only be prepared to give such a price as he thinks value under the new conditions. I think it is inequitable to follow such a course and to impose this additional cost on the property owner at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the proposal of the Government is based, as the Minister himself said, on a fear that property requires a fresh valuation, and the only reason that can be put forward for that is that property, on the whole, is unequally valued: that some houses are valued at an unduly low figure as compared with others.  If that is the case: if that is the foundation of the Government's proposal, I think it is manifestly only making things worse to propose putting a proportionate increase in the tax to which each property owner is liable.  As Deputy Dockrell has pointed out, the ideas of the Government ought to be based on entirely different lines of thought. They ought to be trying to secure that the individual will become the owner of his house; but every move of this kind that they make, tending to make the burden of being a house owner greater, will tend to act against the wish of a person to become the owner of his own house.  Furthermore, those people in this country who happen to have money to invest are in a difficulty owing to such investments not being safe or suitable up to the present, or not being what we might call trustee securities sufficient in magnitude to take the money which is in the country <Col N="1431" /> ready for investment.  Therefore, those who, as trustees, are looking for proper investments, are very largely obliged in the nature of things to go outside the country for that purpose, and that class includes many private owners of funds.  The Government, in my opinion, ought to adapt their policy so as to make it more desirable for such people to keep their money in the country, rather than to invest it outside.  Every action of this kind which is a direct blow at the owner of property or land in the country tends exactly in the opposite direction.  Therefore, I agree very strongly with Deputy Dockrell in saying that this proposal is an undesirable one.  I think, as Deputy Dillon said, it is a manifestly unfair one, and in view of the Government's professed intention of bringing in at a later date some revaluation scheme, I think it is one that certainly ought to be postponed until they have had time to carry through that revaluation in a proper way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious, Sir, that the Government was in a hurry; it could not wait; and, therefore, it determined to take a step that must undoubtedly work out unsatisfactorily in a number of cases.  We gathered from the Minister, and from pronouncements of various others on behalf of the Government, that there is going to be a revaluation of the property in the Irish Free State.  That might have two grounds; first, that the property is too lowly valued at present; secondly, that it is unequally valued. Supposing it is merely too lowly valued, what is the inconvenience?  That could be got over by increasing the rates or the taxes.  The mere lowness of the valuation does not justify the expense of a revaluation.  We must assume that if the Government is going to undertake such a serious and costly operation as the revaluation of property in this country it has reasonable grounds for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think such conduct on the part of the Government can be fully justified only by the second reason, namely that, owing to the length of time which has elapsed since there has been any systematic and complete valuation <Col N="1432" /> of the country, all sorts of anomalies and inequalities have crept in.  It seems to me that that is the only real justification if the Government is determined to press forward this scheme of revaluation.  The idea of inequality or inequity in the present values attributed to property is the real basis of a revaluation.  It may be &mdash;and it probably is&mdash;that there are all sorts of inequalities.  It may be that, owing to the fact that the valuation of property has extended over a number of years, even though an attempt is made to keep the basis or the standards the same, it cannot be done, with the result that you may have two properties, both of equal value in the ordinary sense of the term, but one rated much more highly than the other.  If there are in existence many abuses of that kind which have grown up in the course of years, that may be a good reason for the idea of revaluation.</P>
    <P>What are you doing under this particular section?  As Professor Thrift rightly pointed out, you are increasing the injustices as between man and man.  In the case of two people whose property is of the same value, but one being rated more highly than the other, what you propose in this particular instance is to increase the injustice by making the difference all the greater.  If I did not feel, as I do, that the real ground for revaluation is the existence of those anomalies, there might be some case to be made for this idea of revaluation before there is any valuation, because that is what it comes to; we are told that there is to be a revaluation of the country, but the Minister cannot wait for that.  The Government is too hard up for money and it is determined to increase the injustices that already exist.  That is what it is going to do. If there are grounds for complaint at present owing to the unfair way in which different properties are valued, those grounds for complaint are going to be increased.  The injustices, instead of being diminished, will be increased.  Again we have much the same example of the method of looking at things which was displayed <Col N="1433" /> when we were discussing Deputy Fagan's amendment&mdash;leaving the idea of equal handed justice between man and man out of account.  That seems to me one of the principal arguments which can be brought against this section. Another has been mentioned during the Budget debate, on previous stages of this Bill, and by Deputy Dockrell and Professor Thrift to-day. Again, it is only an example of what the Government is continually doing. One Minister is marching one way while another is marching the other way.  The Minister for Local Government is strongly advocating a policy of housing, but the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce come down to this House and try to throw every possible obstacle, by means of taxation of various kinds, in the path of the Minister for Local Government in regard to his housing policy.  There is no doubt that the tendency of a section of this kind would be to discourage housing.  Whether a person has money to buy a house or whether he has to pay somebody else for it, it is the person living in the house who must ultimately pay.  Therefore, it will hit everybody, and is bound to influence people in precisely the opposite direction in that to which the Government professes to be so eager to travel, namely in the direction of housing.</P>
    <P>We have these two reasons then.  The fact is that it increases the existing injustice whereas the aim or the idea of revaluation should be to do away with injustice.  The Minister, in his Finance Bill and, more or less in his Budget speech, indicated that he could not wait until that was done.  But he should have waited.  If he had any purpose in mind other than the raising of money and the raising of money independent of any consideration of the justice of the method by which it was raised, he should have waited.  It is not forestalling, as the Minister, if my memory serves me correctly, tried to imply.  The scheme of revaluation does make the present conditions worse.  Any decent scheme of revaluation should be a remedy, but in <Col N="1434" /> this connection this is not so.  It is the very opposite.  It increases the abuse.</P>
    <P>As I am on my feet I think I am right in suggesting, in this particular direction, that the Minister estimated at £60,000 the amount that he was going to get out of this revaluation. Perhaps he would tell us the basis on which he arrived at that estimate.  It is a matter, as properties now stand, that ought to be susceptible of being estimated.  It ought to be susceptible of fairly exact computation.  Possibly the Minister would be good enough to put the grounds on which the estimate was arrived at before the House.  It is mainly because of the two reasons I have given that I am opposed to the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is one of those who, along with a number of his supporters, occasionally referred to the former over-taxation of this country. I wonder if he is aware of the fact that the income tax and the excise duty on whiskey were the two principal items in that connection.  The position the Minister has taken up now has justified that over-taxation.  Because he is increasing the income tax on the basis of the assessment in operation during the British period.  It is said that one of the causes for this new imposition this year&mdash;which really means to increase the charge which was in operation two years ago by 50 per cent.&mdash;is that it is so long since a revaluation took place in this country that most of the property in the State is undervalued.  The old City of Dublin was revalued in 1914, only 20 years ago.  Even the British Government did not then charge the income tax on the new valuation at once&mdash;if my recollection is correct.  I venture to say that the old City of Dublin, as it then was, comprised possibly a quarter of the entire country as far as house property was concerned.  The city was revalued in 1914, and any new buildings added since have been valued up to date.  I do not know that the Minister is aware that in those revaluations there is practically no comparison between the new valuation and the old.  I can give at least one particular case in which a house having been <Col N="1435" /> rebuilt somewhere early in the century was revalued about 1903 or 1904.  The old valuation was put at £50 and on appeal it was reduced to £40.  Subsequently, when the revaluation took place it was again put up to £50.  That £50 under the one-sixth arrangement would have been liable for income tax at a shade under £42.  Under the Minister's present proposal it will be taxed up to £62 10s. because there is added a fourth on to the valuation.  So that in that particular instance, at any rate, the idea of revaluation does not hold.  The house was valued at £40 in 1903.  Under the revaluation of the City of Dublin it was increased to £50. That £50 was its full value.  If revaluation took place to-morrow there would not be any increase in its valuation. On the basis of the Minister's equity plea the income tax charge in respect of that house is £62 10s. now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of equity we have to examine this measure in the light of circumstances.  The Minister wanted £60,000 and he taxes tea, sugar, tobacco, everything that was available.  On the last official Estimate of the Revenue Commissioners he said: &ldquo;How can you give me £60,000 more?&rdquo;  The answer was &ldquo;You took off that one-sixth some time ago; if you increase that by one-fourth it will give you the exact sum you require.&rdquo;  I want to say that if that system of legislation is going to be pursued you are going to stop any enterprise in this country.  There has been scarcely any more useful citizen in this State for a long period of years than the person who built houses.  It is quite true that on many occasions he has been held up to public odium.  House building was up to the time of the war a profitable and safe investment.  There were companies which were interested in it. Since then, they have practically ceased operations and the result is that the bulk of the cost and the bulk of the need for providing the money has fallen upon the State and upon the local authorities.  There are limitations to the borrowing of either the State or the local authorities.  It <Col N="1436" /> was certainly satisfactory to know that those persons who put their money into house property continued in their operations and that it was regarded as a safe investment and so on. Directly this Bill passes it will become clear to those people that they will not know from day to day in what respect the taxation Acts are going to fall upon them.  Then that source for the provision of houses is going to dry up.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is the thrifty class who will be mulcted in connection with this particular tax. These are people who had balanced their accounts very carefully before they purchased a house.  They are now faced with this extra imposition. With no other plea than that revaluation of the property of the State must take place within the next couple of years, they are being faced with this. Is it the Minister's intention that he is still responsible, after the valuation has taken place for reducing these charges or alternately, is he aware that the revaluation of the City of Dublin amounted to very little more than an addition of £200,000, if so much, on a valuation of £1,000,000? That is one-sixth.  The Minister has taken away one-sixth from the allowances and added a quarter.  The Minister has been estimating during the last couple of years that house property was not sufficiently assessed for income tax and that he ought to add on 50 per cent. to it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other anomaly and that is that you have old houses.  A great extension of building has taken place within the last 12 years; that extension has been accompanied by an increased valuation on the houses.  I know it myself.  I was a member of the Dublin Corporation.  Up to 1914, the Corporation had scarcely a single house constructed with a valuation of over £8.  The houses that were constructed in 1918, 1919 and 1920 had a valuation of £11 10s. put upon them. That was not because of the increased accommodation but because of the increased cost of building.  All these new houses had their valuations <Col N="1437" /> increased.  The Minister will tell us that he has got to get this £60,000 and that if he is not to get it from house property he must get it somewhere else.  In considering how taxation should be imposed and upon whom it should fall, particular advertence ought plainly to be made to the dangers that will arise from the new impositions.</P>
    <P>I would say that the principal danger in this connection is that people will no longer have an interest in house property.  Alternatively if they do, it is a new class of house-property owner that one will get&mdash;one that will pay for the property that is going to be acquired a lower sum than they would pay if it were not for this particular imposition.  It falls unevenly and unfairly.  It is practically a headline to other people in the country that they are going to be saddled according as the Minister requires money.</P>
    <P>No social services would be hurt if this tax were not put on.  If the Minister wants to know where to save money, he has two services in the State on which it is proposed to spend this year as compared with the estimates prepared for 1932, £500,000 extra, and these are the Army and the Guards.  No interruption whatever of any social service will be necessary in order to do this.  It may be&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;that this particular imposition will cost the State far more than what is going to be levied upon the people in question.</P>

      <P>I wish a miracle could occur but I do not think it will. I wish the Minister would see the light as he did in 1929 when he expressed sympathy for the ordinary citizen and for the struggling taxpayer.  I am afraid he is in the clutch of circumstance, or rather his Department is. For a long time I have known that a tax of this kind was one of the dearest ideas they had&mdash;one of the contributions that they would like to make to the happiness of the ordinary citizen. It came up before several times.  Of course the tax this year is only a sequel to what occurred last year.  Last year the small concession of one-sixth which <Col N="1438" /> was made to the owner-occupier was withdrawn.  Reasons were given.  It contributed very much to facilitate administration.  It was very hard to make this little subtraction.  That was one of the reasons given to us.  This year the account is going to be very difficult.  It will be very hard to add this one-fourth, but they are not afraid of that.  They are simply going to cut a little nearer the bone in shearing the unfortunate tax sheep.  I know it is useless to protest.</P>
      <P>The social and legal undesirability of imposing a tax of this sort has been pointed out clearly and eloquently by previous speakers.  If there is one idea which we should encourage in this country, it is that every man should own his house.  Thrift ought to be encouraged in every way.  But this is a penalty on thrift.  Indirectly, I can see many undesirable and serious consequences arising from this particular tax.  The Department of Finance is taking upon itself another function&mdash; the function of a valuation officer&mdash;and is proceeding to put on a valuation which, as has been pointed out, is obviously unjust&mdash;a valuation on a flat-rate upon houses which have been valued at different times and from different standpoints.  One of the consequences that arose from the action of the Minister last year is going to appear in an aggravated form this year.  The ordinary humble occupier-owner has still to think of keeping his house in some kind of repair.  He will find it very difficult to do that.  This increase, which I am sure the Minister will point out is a trifling increase, will certainly interfere with the question of repairs and upkeep and directly lead to unemployment.  I know of two instances in which the action of the Minister last year in withdrawing the one-sixth allowance made occupier-owners postpone their repairs.  Repairs should be carried out every three years or every five years, if it is possible to carry them out.  I ask the Minister to look at that aspect of that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one reason why the allowance of one-sixth, so far from being withdrawn, ought to have been increased&mdash;the cost of repairs and upkeep under modern conditions has <Col N="1439" /> materially increased.  I do not think the Minister has considered that, but it is a point that should be considered. However, I think it is useless to speak on this matter.  The Minister, who saw the light in 1929, has lost it.  I am afraid he is proceeding to salt the seeming rich in this country&mdash;the unfortunate man who happens to have saved enough money to own his own house or who, perhaps, in many cases, has not paid for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was always something of a house-wrecker. In his first Budget, I remember, he started with an attack upon house property.  I do not know if the House remembers the picturesque phrase he used.  The first little attempt upon the Schedule with regard to house property was going to bring in a very small amount of money but, like the mustard seed, it was going to grow into a great tree, until some other Minister, more fortunate than he, could catch the glittering prizes as they fall.  We do not know what that little seed grew to.  We do know that there has been a fair amount of digging at the roots since, a fair amount to prune and transplant from it.  Last year we got a further addition to what the Minister did the first year.  Now we have the third step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot get away from the calculation made, mathematically accurate, that as a result of his operations, the amount that a person will pay in respect of house property in the coming year will represent an increase of 50 per cent. on what he was paying two years ago.  That is done against house property.  The phrase was used about soaking the rich who have come across from other countries.  We have been given to understand that this is a Christian community which was going to be better christianised under Fianna Fáil auspices by the better distribution of property, and, particularly, that the settling of people into the possession of their own houses was a laudable object.  And the way these people are <Col N="1440" /> being rewarded for getting their stake in that way in the country and for getting possession of a house, is that they will have to pay on a valuation which has been increased by what, in fact, amounts to 50 per cent.  Further, the point is to be noticed which has been made previously, but which I want to stress, namely, that this, although introduced in context in regard to anomalies in valuation, really does nothing except to magnify the anomalies.  There are anomalies in regard to valuation of property, and different types of houses, in any one of the towns in the country.  The houses that will be hit the hardest are those recently built and subject to modern ideas of valuation, charged in a better way from the angle of the Finance Department, and for these we are to have this added percentage figure.</P>
    <P>The whole Budget shows that the Ministry are definitely upon their uppers, as far as money is concerned. They are taxing every kind of article relating to the necessaries of life, and this matter of house property is being taxed in that category.  Housing has been segregated from every other matter, mostly since the war, in two ways.  Firstly, it is a particular type of work from which, in the main, or certainly more than any other matter, private enterprise has been ousted. That occurred because of the fact that during the war period people were taken away from building houses and put to other things more urgent and necessary at the time; and, by reason of that, there had to be legislation for the restriction of rents and again, by reason of that, private enterprise was given its marching orders.  The State stepped in and in most countries since that period has been engaged in building houses.  Now that this taxing process is going on it will bring an increase in house building to an end. This particular stoppage will hit the working classes in this country, because the figures show that the only real increase in employment has been in house building.  We had a statement that 21,000 persons were put in permanent employment in 1934, and the figures show that only 2,000 of these <Col N="1441" /> were put into industrial employment since 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very pleasant to the Minister, but it is incidental to this whole matter of taxation.  This tax is going to shut down the only real avenue open to other employment in the country for the last three years.  The figures submitted as to the increase in employment show that only about 2,000 could be accounted for in industrial occupations. Despite the fact that the only real increase has occurred in the building industry, the Minister has now decided to tax a particular type of construction which is giving most employment.  The Minister will wind up by telling us he must get money.  But the Minister will remember that the Fianna Fáil Party before they came into power, in their famous plan, promised £2,000,000 economies which they declared to be easily available after an examination of the Estimates, and that only in regard to a particular number of items; and <Col N="1442" /> these economies were to be effected with a promise that no hardship was to be caused to any person.  Supposing we were given these £2,000,000 in economies which we were assured would be given, it would far more than pay for those taxes on house property, in addition to the other taxes that have been put on food-stuffs.  I gather that the actual amount to be got from this tax is only £60,000.  Five good mineral concessions, properly worked, would bring the Minister in all he wants.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to provide that taxation will not be imposed upon sugar under the provisions of this Bill.  I think it is hardly necessary to state at length the case which can be made against the imposition of taxation upon sugar.  The matter has already been exhaustively discussed on the Financial Resolutions and on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I think I could crystallise the case by saying that the object of the amendment is to ensure that the community generally, and particularly the poorer sections of it, will not be muleted by the taxation which is imposed under this section of the Bill. A tax upon food-stuffs has always been regarded as an objectionable form of taxation because it is a form of taxation calculated to press most heavily on the poorer sections of the community.  It has rightly been the object of democratic Governments in all countries to exempt the people's food-stuffs from the burden of taxation imposed for the purpose of balancing State Budgets.  I think the Minister for Finance, in other days and at other times, appreciated that the imposition of a tax upon food-stuffs was objectionable.  I think that he will be found on record as one who, at one time at all events, expressed the same view that I am expressing on this amendment.  Last year we had the Minister recognising the undesirability of taxing food-stuffs by abolishing the tax upon tea. But this year we find him in this Finance Bill going back not merely to tax tea, but to tax sugar as well.  I say to the Minister that the imposition of this tax will press heaviest on the poorest section of the community.  Per head of the population, they use sugar to a greater extent than the wealthier <Col N="1445" /> classes.  The tax on sugar will also have the effect of making still dearer the price of jam and other forms of sweet confectionery which are sometimes the occasionally procured luxuries of poor people.  The amount which will be raised by the Minister under this form of taxation will not be very considerable in the Budget of the State, but it will represent a considerable exaction from the poor. In existing circumstances, with so much unemployment and with wage standards in many cases being reduced, particularly in the agricultural industry, I think this is a most unfavourable time to contemplate the imposition of taxes on the foodstuffs of the poor.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have been able to find his revenue elsewhere.  I still believe that the Minister could find the revenue elsewhere and that there was no need to have resort to this objectionable and, in my view, undesirable taxation on such a staple article of diet as sugar.  I do not know whether it is too much to expect the Minister, at this stage, to recast that portion of his Budget.  In any case, in asking him to do so I am only asking him to do what, in other days, he himself asked other Ministers for Finance to do.  To that extent my plea to-day has the well-merited theoretical support of the Minister. I think that the imposition of this tax is quite unjustified and unnecessary. It is completely out of harmony with the whole philosophy of the Minister's argument on the 1934 Budget.  We had, in 1932, a declaration from the President of the Executive Council that if he had to impose burdens they would be heaviest on the backs most capable of bearing them, and lightest on the backs least capable of bearing them.  But, in this Budget and in this particular section, in the main it is the backs of the poor people which have been selected to bear these taxes.  That is an obviously unfair form of taxation because it presses heaviest on the most needy section of the community and lightest on the section most capable of bearing a burden of this kind.</P>

      <P>We are also opposing his tax very strongly, in the first place, because it is a tax, and in the second place because nothing seems to be done with the money paid by the people.  In this particular way money is paid in additional taxation by the people, but so far as one can find out it does not produce any good to the country.  In February, 1934, there was a Customs duty of 11/8 per cwt. on sugar.  There is going to be a Customs duty of 21/- per cwt. on sugar if the Minister succeeds in getting his proposals in the Finance Bill through the House.  In February, 1934, the Minister put on an additional Customs duty of 4/8, bringing the Customs duty up to 16/4. But he was not satisfied with that because before the year was out&mdash;in October, 1934&mdash;he put on an additional Customs duty of 2/4 and an Excise duty of 2/4.  On the 16th May this year he put on a Customs duty and an Excise duty of another 2/4, so that he is raising by means of additional taxation on sugar&mdash;in what the people of the country are going to have to pay over shop counters&mdash;the sum of £980,000.  The consumption of sugar is in or about 105,000 tons. The Minister has added 9/4 by way of additional taxation since February, 1934.  That means that the additional sum which people are forced to pay over the shop counter for sugar, by reason of taxation alone, is £980,000.  We ought to know where that money is going.  The President addressed himself to the position with regard to sugar when speaking in Galway on the 17th June.  He is reported in the daily Press to have said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The position of the sugar industry at the time was that they were importing 100,000 tons a year. Thanks to the establishment of the sugar beet factories they now were in a position to produce, if not the whole of their supplies, at least four-fifths of them.  This year there were 30,000 growers of beet in the country sowing between them 50,000 and 60,000 acres, and the farmers had a guaranteed price for <Col N="1447" /> the product.  He hoped that they would need another beet factory soon, and he thought they would. The benefit of this to the country would be realised when they remembered that £1,000,000 was paid to the farmers for beet this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has imposed on the purchasers of sugar since February, 1934, an additional £980,000.  The President says that at least £1,000,000 was paid to the farmers for beet this year. In the case of a subsidised crop, where moneys are said to be paid to the farmers, we surely ought to see an increase in the amount of agricultural labour employed.  The amount of the subsidy in respect of beet is paid largely by those who purchase sugar over the shop counter. Up to the present the Minister has been subsidising wheat directly.  If there was never a subsidy for wheat, there is at all events an enormous subsidy in respect of beet, and surely, in return for that subsidy, we ought to see greatly increased permanent employment for agricultural labourers. The President says that the farmers are being subsidised to the extent of £1,000,000, but that does not show itself in increased employment for agricultural labourers on the land. The acreage for beet between 1931 and 1934 in the Province of Leinster increased by 25,813 acres, the total of the subsidised crop for the whole country being 40,569 acres.  Therefore more than 50 per cent. of the total of the subsidised crop was grown in the Province of Leinster.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the effect of the amendment is clearly appreciated.  As Deputy Mulcahy seemed to grasp in the concluding portion of his remarks, it would have the effect of relieving Irish manufactured sugar of Excise duty, but I do not think it would have the effect&mdash;which is probably what Deputy Norton is seeking&mdash;of reducing the price of sugar to the consumer.  If what the Opposition tell us be true, that would probably be determined by the price at which imported sugar was being sold. This amendment would not have the <Col N="1450" /> effect of increasing the amount the beet grower would get for his product, or in redistributing the increased profits amongst those immediately concerned in the industry&mdash;the growers and the factory operatives.  The effect would be to increase the possible profits of the Beet Sugar Company and, in that way, allow the Minister for Finance to get indirectly a greatly increased dividend from his shares in the company.  From the point of view of reducing the price of sugar, the amendment would not be desirable.  We have it on record that the Opposition, through Deputy Mulcahy, are prepared to support this proposition.  We, on the contrary, are not accepting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks made by the mover of the amendment have application really to the section. We are supporting the amendment because we believe if it was carried it would be impossible to stand by the section as a whole.  We strongly object to a section of the Finance Bill that proposes to increase the tax on sugar. Deputy Norton's real purpose in moving his amendment was to defeat the section.  He professed to find some back-sliding on the part of the Minister and the President.  Although not within the last couple of years, I am afraid, there were profuse professions when the President and the Minister first came into office.  But their professions soon went by the board.  If we are still to believe the things that were said at that time, Deputy Norton must realise that within the past couple of years they have completely abandoned most of these professions. There was a time&mdash;I am not referring to pre-Ministerial days&mdash;when the present Minister for Finance looked upon this particular tax on sugar as being particularly harsh.  It was, I believe, a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax and, at the time the softhearted Minister&mdash;I am now referring to the heart of the Minister for Finance &mdash;could not impose this hard tax on the people.  Since then he has developed.  Within the last couple of years we have seen not one but a couple of increases in the tax, with corresponding increases in the price of sugar.  Unlike Deputy Norton I did not look upon that as something not completely in keeping with the whole development of Government policy, or with the carrying out of their professions, but the actual way in which they have developed their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing strange in the fact that they should come to this House one year after another to ask for increased taxation on such a necessary article of food, especially to the younger portion of the population, as sugar.  The professions that they made <Col N="1452" /> at the beginning are now scattered to the winds.  Deputy Norton and the House must know that they now proceed to tax the people's food with as much joy as the Minister, in his first Budget showed in robbing what he at that time called hen roosts.  He has robbed these sufficiently, according to himself, and there is nothing left now. Therefore, in comes a harsher tax. Within the last couple of months we have seen this House, under the inspiration of the Minister and his colleagues, taxing all the necessaries of life.  We have just passed an increased tax on building.  We are now in the process of putting a permanent and an increasing tax year after year on the bread of the people.  Is it strange, therefore, that sugar should not escape? The Deputy was quite right in pointing out the incidence of this tax. Everyone knows that certain articles, sugar, bread and tea are only part of the general policy.  This tax is to raise money, but it does not at all mean that the effects are going to fall fairly over the bulk of the population immediately.</P>
    <P>There was a time when that was axiomatic with the Minister.  Now, he has certainly gone away from that particular standpoint, and he proposes to raise immense sums now by taxing the food of the people&mdash;by the bread tax and now by the sugar tax.  You cannot consider one of this things without bearing in mind, when we are asked to consent to an increase of the tax on sugar&mdash;an article so necessary for the people and especially for the younger portion of the population and the poorer sections of the community&mdash;that the House is engaged in passing a Bill at the present moment that proposes to put a very considerable tax on the people's bread and a tax that will increase year by year.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, what social services has the Minister offered this year that can compensate, or that can attempt even to pretend to compensate, for what he is doing in the way of the burdens he is putting, not on the poor alone, but on the destitute?  They must pay as <Col N="1453" /> well as everybody else.  They must pay this tax on sugar and on food of all kinds.  It is up against that situation that the Minister has brought us. According to his own confession, he has exhausted other sources of revenue.  The employing portion of the population might be expected to pay in the first instance at least, but now he is down to taxing the very necessities of life.  I should say that we have an excellent opportunity in this particular section of telling the Minister that the House does not want a continuation of that particular policy.  If the Minister thinks that the arguments against this tax were like those against the tax on housing, and that he will not reply, then there is no use in asking him questions; but if he does think that, for the moment, it is good tactics to reply, and not to adopt the extraordinary attitude he took up on a previous amendment, I should like him to tell us what he expects to raise both by the Customs duty and by the Excise duty; what increased amount he expects to raise, first, by the full duty and, secondly, what is the increased amount he expects to raise.  The latest estimate is what I want.  The Government Estimates on most of these things vary considerably.  I am sorry I did not get the estimate on housing, because, on that, there was a certain difficulty in accepting the Minister's figure.  Perhaps, however, he may be on more solid ground here and may reply.  However, the real gravamen of the charge that we have to make against the proposal is that the Minister and his colleagues have now taken the most necessary articles in life and taxed them, and that it is not £100,000 or £200,000 that he expects to get out of these taxes altogether, but that ultimately he expects to get some millions out of these taxes on sugar, tea, bread, and so on.  It is a far cry indeed from those days to which Deputy Norton referred when they were still enunciating principles as to who should bear the burden of taxation, and when they were talking of suiting taxation to the backs of those who were able to bear it.  I admit that it is a far cry from now to then.</P>

      <P>I understood that the Minister's point was that this is a purely taxation matter, and that he wanted to stop me merely because I raised, as briefly as I could, the position with regard to employment arising out of the beet industry.  My point in referring to that is that the case that the Government and their followers throughout the country make, in order to induce the people to accept this terrible burden of taxation, is that it is all providing employment, and that such taxation would not be necessary but for the tremendous employment that is being provided by the policy that the Government is pursuing. They apply that argument particularly to the position in regard to sugar, and say that the necessity for imposing the Customs duty on sugar is to protect the greatly increased employment that is being given throughout the country, particularly in the agricultural districts, where the sugar beet industry is being developed.  I simply point out that in Leinster, where more than 50 per cent. of the total increase in beet between 1931 and 1934 has taken place, that is an increase to the extent of 28,813 acres where only 4,606 were grown in 1931&mdash; and in provinces in which 50 per cent. of the subsidised wheat is also grown&mdash; there has been a fall in the province of Leinster in the total number of agricultural labourers under 18 years of age permanently employed.</P>

      <P>There is a decrease of 158 in the number of agricultural labourers over 18 years of age.  There has been an increase in the number temporarily employed, as figured out in June this year, of 2,786.  But here we have the people burdened by taxation imposed on them since February, 1934, to the extent of £980,000.  They have been induced to struggle along under that on the grounds that very greatly increased employment is being given throughout the country as a result, and that if they only wait the increased population which is growing up in the country in this happy way, with satisfactory incomes, is going to so firmly establish them in the work that they are in, if they are in work, that it will be quite easy for them to continue to pay this taxation; whereas the fact is that wages are less in the province of Leinster by 3/- per week for permanently employed agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, as I said, the case that is made for this great increase in the taxation on sugar is that it is safeguarding an industry in this country which is greatly increasing the amount of employment in it.  Let the Minister shake his head here, and I will accept his shaking of the head here, but let him give the same shake of the head when he goes and talks to the unfortunate people in the country who are concerned for their agricultural industry, and concerned with the tax-paying capacity of the <Col N="1457" /> people.  When he talks to his constituents let him say: &ldquo;This is purely a matter of taxation.  I am asking you to take this burden on your shoulders because we want money to carry on.&rdquo; If the Minister has a case to make that would cut out discussion of the position of the beet industry in this country, and the employment given, I should like to hear that case.</P>

I want the Minister to consider that as a result of the increase imposed under this section, leaving out the other increases which have been imposed on sugar, the price per lb. charged in many towns&mdash;as far as I know in most towns and villages throughout the country&mdash;is now 4d. per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy send us some examples of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to get them.  A number of people have written to me to that effect, and I understand that that is so.  I should like if the Minister would give some declaration on that matter which would safeguard the consumers, because it is sufficient that they should be compelled to pay an increased price without having to pay over and above that increased price.  There is another aspect of the matter to which I want to draw the attention of the House. <Col N="1458" /> This increase, like the increase on tea, leans particularly heavily upon those who are compelled to buy in very small quantities.  It is all right for the person who can buy a half stone or a stone at the one time; it perhaps does not lean so heavily upon them, but people are being made to pay over and above the additional tax which the Minister is imposing this year.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it, but there are thousands of people in this country who are compelled to buy in such small quantities that this additional tax is far greater on them than what is set out in the Bill.  It seems to me that the Minister has a duty to see that the price of sugar&mdash;a commodity which, on the Minister's own admission, is a necessary&mdash;is not made prohibitive.  The Minister seems to be getting terribly uneasy.  Is there anything which the Minister would consider we are at liberty to discuss on this particular section?  In my opinion, the people are being charged over and above the imposition, and that is a point on which I should like the Minister to say something for the protection of the public.  Secondly, would the Minister tell us whether the necessary farthings are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I should like to say that I am opposing it because of its effects on the business community who have to make their living along the border.  Coming from Northern Ireland himself, the Minister knows that the price of sugar at the moment is very much lower in Northern Ireland than in the Free State.  Whilst there is only a ¼d. increase under the Finance Bill, the actual difference between the prices prevailing in Northern Ireland and here is a matter of from 3d. to 2d.  The best sugar can be bought in Northern Ireland at 2d. per lb., while you are charged from 7½d. to 8d. in the Free State for 2lb. of very inferior quality sugar.  I have here a sample of sugar delivered to large wholesalers in Dundalk.  They cannot return that sugar, but because it is not up to standard it is being returned to them by the people to whom they sold it.  The unfortunate wholesaler <Col N="1459" /> has to take it back, and he is at that loss.  It is not of a proper grade at all.  I do not wish to belittle any home industry, but, at the same time, considering the price that has got to be paid, the people should at least get an article that they can sell.  The inferior quality has a very injurious effect on business in the towns along the Border.  The increased price of sugar has a very injurious effect upon business in general done in these towns.  The people down in the South of Ireland do not seem to realise that. I think it should be the duty of the Minister and his Government to see to it that before they put on any taxes on any commodity, which would have the effect of making that particular commodity dearer than the price paid for the same commodity in Northern Ireland, they should take particular care and pay particular attention to all the facts before they impose such a taxation.  People in the South of Ireland have little idea that the effect of this tax could be so bad as it has been upon towns in the Free State along the Border.  The Minister knows that the Border is there.  It is only by crossing a little drain or ditch that thousands of people can go across the Border into Northern Ireland and get their supply of sugar at 11/- per cwt. less than the price at which the home-produced sugar is sold in the Free State.  Apart from everything else, that particular aspect of the situation should receive very careful consideration. So much has already been said on this sugar tax that I am not going to delay the House much longer, but I do seriously suggest that the time has come when some limit should be imposed on taxation.  Everybody knows that when the price of foodstuffs is raised there automatically follows that you will have a demand for increased wages from the workers who are organised in their trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organised workers can command an increased wage.  But there are thousands of others who are not organised; there are thousands of people who do not belong to any trade union, and the means and income of these people are being depleted every <Col N="1460" /> day.  They cannot get any increase. That is another aspect of the situation which should press for attention, not alone on the Government, but on all people of this country.  I do not see how this country can go on piling up taxation and raising the cost of living and expect, at the same time, that there will be employment for the people.  I would be glad to see the members of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Deputies and the Labour Party beginning to realise that aspect of the situation.  I wish they would realise facts that they seem incapable of realising to-day.  The mere act of having imposed this additional tax on sugar should be a warning to the Government as to what is going to happen as the years go on.  Then the Government and the people will, ultimately, have to do what they are unable to do at the present moment, and that is, to face facts.  As a representative of a constituency the principal town of which is situated near the Border, and which depends to a large extent upon Border trade, I say without hesitation that this increased tax on sugar is going to militate very much against the business people of that town and, of course, against the business people of every town along the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy always talks like the ghost in Hamlet, prophesying war and woe.  His words have as much substance in them as the ghost's words.  The Deputy says this was a terrible burden to impose on the people.  His colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, said a while ago that we are now taxing the very necessaries of life.  It is not the first time that sugar has been taxed in this State, and it is not the first time that other necessaries of life have been taxed either.  There have been taxes on tea, sugar, clothes, boots and so on, and these had to be paid formerly by everyone except possibly the people who had to run around nude as well as hungry, in the days when Deputy Mulcahy was in office.  Of course, we remember Deputy Cosgrave's classical farmer <Col N="1461" /> who, if he did not drink or smoke or wear boots or clothes, was free from taxes.  Like Tarzan, he could have gone among the branches of the trees in the Phoenix Park and, of course, he need not pay any taxes on the necessaries of life.  The only difference between the taxes that we are imposing on sugar and the tax that was imposed in Deputy Mulcahy's time was this, that whereas even with this extra farthing we are only to get something like £820,000 from the tax on sugar, in the halcyon days when Deputy Mulcahy was in office the Government was collecting £1,465,000 through the sugar tax, and sugar was as much a necessity of life then as to-day.</P>

Judging from the returns, they are spending more now and they are getting more value than they did in those days. There is nothing new or novel in this tax or in putting a tax on the necessaries of life now.  Deputy O'Sullivan was very vocal about this tax as a tax on the necessaries of life.  When the Opposition were in power they were collecting actually £2,500,000 from such necessaries as against the £1,300,000 that we are collecting.</P>

      <P>Before the imposition of this duty the price of sugar throughout the Free State was virtually the same as it was on the 2nd February, 1932.  The average price then was 3.37d. per lb. and the average price before the imposition of this duty was 3.43d.  There was a difference of .06d. per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Another thing is that it will be found that in many towns in the Twenty-Six Counties, the price of <Col N="1463" /> sugar, even with the additional farthing, is probably not greater than it was in February, 1932, because, for the first time, sugar is being distributed at a flat-rate all over the 30 distributing centres in the Saorstát.  People along the sea coasts formerly had a great advantage over people in the remote districts but now there is a flat-rate and that is because the price has been fixed by the company at a flat-rate in 30 distributing centres.  The price all-round has been levelled up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coburn had of course to get up here to disparage and decry the quality of the product which has been produced in the Irish factories.  The Deputy could have brought that to the attention of the Sugar Company.  If he wanted to raise it at all he could have raised it on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce and not on this Bill.  Or the Deputy could do what would be the most reasonable thing to do if he really wanted to ensure that a uniform product of good quality would be turned out by the sugar factories.  The Deputy could either have brought it to the attention of the company or to my attention or to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is equally interested in seeing that the product of this Irish enterprise will be worthy of the sacrifices that we are making in order to produce our own sugar requirements.</P>

Instead of advertising the fact in this House that he knew of one instance in which inferior sugar had been found, and instead of trying to give Irish sugar the general reputation of being of poor quality, he might have taken the trouble to have brought that to the attention of some responsible person elsewhere and given the company an opportunity to remedy that condition of affairs.  Instead of that, he has to advertise in this House, on the strength of one instance, the fact that he believes that Irish sugar is turned out of inferior quality.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked of the taxation on sugar and said that this was not the first time that a tax was put on sugar.  It is the first time that there was ever anything like £980,000 additional taxation put on sugar in the space of about 12 months.  The only thing that could be compared with the change in taxation was the change that was brought about <Col N="1465" /> in the year ended March, 1926, when the taxation on sugar was reduced by the then Government from £1,881,000 to £849,000.  The taxation on sugar was then reduced by, approximately, £1,040,000.  That was a shift down in the amount of money that the people had to pay for sugar.  What we are dealing with here is the fact of a shift up of something almost the same because the taxation on sugar was reduced from a figure of £1,800,000 odd to an average of £893,000 for the five or six years before the present Government came into office.  I suggest to the Minister that it was not £1,465,000 in the year 1931-32, but it was £1,371,000 between Excise and Customs.  The Minister should be a little more accurate.  The additional taxation was then put on in order to give special assistance to the farmers during that last year and to meet a definite budgetary situation. Nevertheless, the taxation on sugar was more than £500,000 lower than the Government had been raising in, say, the year ended March, 1924, or the year ended March, 1925.  They had been able to reduce the taxation by that amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not serve the Minister's purpose to go back prewar. It was possible during the previous Government's administration to reduce the tax on sugar by that amount, as well as the tax on tea by £400,000.  They had to increase it in the last year when special provision was required for the agricultural industry.  The Minister is now raising it this year to a figure that he says is £820,000 at the same time as he is putting back the £400,000 on tea.  The agricultural community are not getting much out of it.  They are getting less in relief of their rates than in the year the Minister speaks about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shakes his head when Deputies quote the price of sugar. Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us what should be the price for sugar?  I understand that sugar can be delivered at the port here at less than nine-tenths of a penny per <Col N="1466" /> lb.  Beyond the charge for handling it by the traders, the increase as between that and what the public pay for it is entirely due to taxation on the Minister's part.  If the Minister is saddling the people with such a heavy burden of taxation on this article, we certainly might hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce what ought to be the price to the people.</P>

The thing we are concerned with here is the price that the people should pay for the sugar.  As we understand it, the Ministerial head has been shaken in disapproval or disbelief of the figure quoted for sugar.

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has one view about the price of sugar and the Minister for Finance has another.  The Minister for Finance went so far as to justify the price to-day by saying it was not much greater than in 1932. Because the price was so much in 1932, it does not follow that but for the activities of the Government here the price would be much lower to-day. Of course it would.  The Minister did not attempt to justify this new imposition at all.  He lectured Deputy Coburn and myself as to how we ought to do our duty.  The Minister was very concerned about the qualities of the goods produced here, and he thought that Deputy Coburn should be ashamed to mention anything that might be detrimental to the sugar industry in this country.  I can stand lectures from many people, but when the Minister for Finance seeks to lecture people as to how they should perform their duties in this country, in order to help the sugar industry, we cannot forget that at one time he described the sugar industry as one of the white elephants. The Minister did his damnedest to bedevil not only the sugar industry, but other industries in this country.  The Minister has just made an observation that I did not catch.

      <P>I am at liberty to choose my own ground, subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, and I say that the various activities of the Minister, with regard to sugar, have had a great deal to do with the price, and it is because of these activities that people are being charged more for their sugar to-day.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not feel at all happy over this section.  We had the Minister's criticism of what Deputy Mulcahy said about the hardships of the poor.  I remember the Minister, when he was in Opposition, using very much stronger language in regard to the taxation on sugar than was used by Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy O'Sullivan.  When it suits him the Minister has great command of language.  I must say that the language used by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan was mild compared with some of the statements we had on former occasions from the Minister <Col N="1469" /> when he was on this side of the House. But whether he liked it or not, I say because of the activities of his Department, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in this section. Sugar is 1d. per lb. higher in the Free State than it is in the North of Ireland. We must get that into our minds.  I would like Deputy Corry, who is an active member of the Beet Growers' Association, to keep that in mind.  The Minister gave the warning that because of the drop in the Customs revenue from sugar the beet growers and those engaged in the industry would have to look out, and unless they were going to make a contribution there would be still lower prices.</P>

      <P>On this question of sugar, it seems to be fashionable nowadays to characterise a Deputy who criticises any commodity as an enemy, and indeed as a national traitor.  I thought I made it quite clear, in my opening statement, that I was not inclined to make little of any Irish industry.  I resent the taunt of the Minister that I took advantage of my position here to make little of Irish sugar.  I have gone out of my way to help the Minister for Industry and Commerce in starting industries that would give employment.  But, even though we have Irish industries, they are not above criticism.  If the Minister was in the position of the wholesalers to whom I have referred and he found that large numbers of bags were returned, and that he had to put up with the loss, he might have something to say.  The sugar factory people will not give them any relief, and I think it would be expecting too much patience to suggest that they should not be critical of such action.  With the increased price of sugar, that these merchants have to pay, when we consider the price and the profits made by the sugar manufacturing people, I think in common decency, they ought to put up with a certain amount of loss occasioned by inferior sugar sent out by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the other question I raised&mdash;the increased price&mdash;the Minister has not answered about the difference that prevails between the price in Northern Ireland and the price in the Free State.  The difference is from 1d. to 1½d. per lb. Does the Minister deny that you can buy sugar in Northern Ireland for 2d. per lb., 4d. for 2 lb., while it is a well-known fact that in the Free State 8d. has been charged for 2 lb. of sugar. Has it ever occurred to the Minister what that means to the people and the trading community who have the fortune or the misfortune to live in towns adjoining the Border.  These facts can be ascertained from people living in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  This is a very big and serious difference to merchants and business people living in these towns.  In view of the present state of affairs, it is up to the Government to safeguard the interests of those people living along the Border, the same as they are safeguarding the interests of people living in Cork and Kerry districts with regard to butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst I would not object to increased taxes in order to keep industry going, and thereby give employment, at the same time I am not prepared to pay an exorbitant price for any particular commodity.  I do seriously suggest that this tax on sugar is one which affects very adversely the business community along the border towns.  It also affects the poorest section of the community.  It is unnecessary to go into that, as it has been referred to before by Deputy O'Sullivan and others in this House. I suggest, as I have often suggested before, that the sooner members of Fianna Fáil realise that there will <Col N="1471" /> come an end to what the people of this country can pay by way of taxation&mdash; and it is only a matter of time&mdash;the better.  There is no use, as I have stated, in increasing wages if you are going to reduce them indirectly by increasing the cost of the necessities of life.  That is what it really amounts to. The Government have at the back of their minds the idea that wages are too high in this country, but they have not the moral courage to say so.  They think that they can reduce them indirectly and in a dishonest way by increasing the cost of the necessities of life.  This is not the best occasion, perhaps, to discuss that question, but I should like to have the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce at a round table conference to discuss the question.  There is really at the back of the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party the idea that wages are too high, that we cannot afford them, that we cannot reduce them openly, and we must therefore reduce them indirectly.</P>

      <P>At the same time it is a well-known fact that if the cost of living is increased, it is generally followed by a demand for increased wages.  There is no one in this House knows that better than members of the Executive Council.  However, An Ceann Comhairle says that I am out of order in discussing the matter.  These are really the facts of the situation as they exist at the moment.  I want to impress on the Minister the fact that the business section of the community living in towns along the Border are already sufficiently adversely affected as a result of the setting up of the Border without having their position <Col N="1472" /> worsened by taxation of this nature. There is no denying the fact&mdash;and the Minister has not answered my question in regard to it&mdash;that there is a vast difference prevailing between the price of sugar in the Free State and the price of the same commodity in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to refer very briefly to the Minister's attitude towards this tax previously.  Speaking in this House on the 11th May, 1932, as reported in column 1506 of the Official Debates, the Minister told us that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sugar has a very high food value and it is an absolute necessary of life.  A tax on sugar is a &lsquo;hard&rsquo; tax. It cannot be imposed without a corresponding increase in the cost of living.  It therefore falls heavily on the very poor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These words were, I am sure, very well weighed, because they appear in very nicely poised sentences.  Sugar has a very high food value; it is an absolute necessity of life; a tax on sugar is a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax, it cannot be imposed without increasing the cost of living. These phrases, to my mind, make relevant, as a passing remark, the point which Deputy Coburn was attempting to stress, that by increasing the cost of living you are indirectly reducing wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy surely realises the implication of his remark.  That point was already ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing a certain point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy now proceeds to maintain that it was in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it makes relevant the particular remark, as a passing reference, that it increases the cost of living.  The tax on sugar increases the cost of living.  Everybody can understand what that means.  The Minister himself has stated that a tax on sugar increases the cost of living, it is a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; tax, and that sugar is an absolute necessary of life.  The Minister in that year decided to remit <Col N="1473" /> the tax, or rather to reduce it by a certain amount.  He got the same amount by a tax on tea.  What were his gyrations afterwards?  He got more from tea than he had taken off from sugar the year after.  Then the next year the tax was taken off tea and this year it is put on.  We are faced now with the position in which both the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; tax, with their effects on the cost of living, are being re-enacted.  We are in the position in which, according to the Minister's statement, a sum of about £900,000 has been put upon the people in relation to the sugar tax since February 1934.  That is introduced into an economic situation in which taxes are also being put on other necessaries of life&mdash;bread, butter, tea and when, at the same time, other semi-luxuries, tobacco, picture houses and house property, are also being taxed. That is the context in which it has got to be discussed.  The tax on sugar would, perhaps, not be such a serious matter if there were reductions in the tax on these other things, or if we had not to face the increase in the price of sugar, a necessary of life, at a time when the cost of living is also being increased by taxes on tea, bread and butter and by other taxes of the tobacco, picture house and house-ownership type.  All these things impose a very heavy burden.</P>
      <P>Two further points have been introduced into this matter.  A question has been raised here by Deputy Morrissey as to the price charged for sugar by particular sugar beet factories in the country and he was asked whether he endeavoured to get that referred to the Prices Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's reply to the point.  Nobody with a grain of sense in his head would refer a complaint of that kind to the Prices Commission, and if anybody has responsibility for doing so, it is not primarily the Deputy's. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was brazen enough on one occasion to deny the assertion that there was smuggling of cattle across the Border.  Will he now have the effrontery to say that the figures quoted with regard to the price of sugar on the other side of the Border are incorrect?  Sugar can be got at nearly 1/6 a stone cheaper in the Six County area than it can be got here.  The same holds good with regard to butter and the other things that form the context of this tax.  Why is there a tax being put upon a commodity which the Minister previously described as a hard tax, which the President in 1931 described in most ferocious language, and about which the present Minister for Agriculture purported to give figures to prove that the increase in the cost of living through sugar alone was going to be <Col N="1475" /> doubled, so that there would be no advantage got from derating in that year.  In view of all that, why is this being done?  Simply because the Government are at their wits' end for taxation.  The ordinary sources of revenue are drying up.  The main sources of revenue are drying up. Why have the Government to go back and tax these things?  Deputy Corry gave me the reason some time ago. He said the reason for these taxes was because they were on the necessaries of life which people had to buy.  They might evade the payment of other taxes of the indirect type, but Deputy Corry was quite flamboyant about sugar.  In the case of a tax on sugar you could nail people.  People could not avoid consuming it, and that is what the Government have got to fall back upon&mdash;to tax the articles that cannot be evaded.  The position to-day is, as Deputy Corry phrased it, that the Government have to tax the things that the people have got to consume in order to sustain life.  All that throws a glaring searchlight on the rosy pictures painted here during the last one and a half years by the Government about the great productivity, prosperity, increased wealth, and all the rest.  In the end they are driven to the confession that they have now got to get down to the things that people must eat and to put taxes on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax will press very heavily on people this year because of the fact that sugar was never dearer in this country than it is at the moment.  In the period dealt with by Deputy McGilligan, sugar was at a comparatively low price compared to what it is now.  As has been pointed out, sugar is dearer here by 1¼d. or 1½d. per lb. than it is in the Six County area.  The Minister made the futile excuse that the Government are getting less out of this tax than they were getting two or three years ago.  Why?  Because, compared to the price at which sugar can be landed on the quays in Dublin, it is costing about £15 a ton more to manufacture sugar in the three factories <Col N="1476" /> here.  We have been told that 50,000 acres are laid down under beet. That is the great new orientation in our agricultural development: one-eighth of an acre for every farmer in the country or one acre divided amongst eight farmers.  If you line up eight farmers and give one of them a single acre of beet, the other seven are taxed for the production of that as well as the people in the cities and towns.  It is all very well to have experiments in the growing of beet and the manufacture of sugar, but surely this is not the time, when the price of sugar is at its highest, to put on this extra burden.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that £6 a ton was the economic price of sugar at the quays.  The position, therefore, is that the farmers are to pay an economic price for everything they have to purchase and are to receive an uneconomic price for what they have to sell.  The seven farmers I have referred to, who have not got even one acre of beet, must pay not merely an economic price, but above an economic price, for sugar, and they are to sell their cattle at an uneconomic price.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave seems to have some very peculiar ideas.  I wonder what was his line of thought when he was President of this State, and when, from 1925 to 1932, he had the farmers of 25 counties sweetening the County Carlow constituency for him.  He talked about eight farmers, and said that only one out of the eight was able to get one acre of beet to grow, but what about all the farmers in the 25 counties, in the period I have referred to, who were sweetening the Carlow constituency for him?  The extra acreage under beet this year is something like 42,000 acres.  That figure relates to the three factories.  A large amount of extra employment is going to be given because of that increased acreage.  It will provide, roughly, £1,000,000 extra for the farmers as well as extra employment for those on the land. The Deputy laughs at that.  Frankly, I confess that I did not understand <Col N="1477" /> what Deputy McGilligan said a moment ago.</P>

We, as farmers' representatives, do not complain when proposals are brought forward to raise money in order to set up new industries and to give employment, and hence, we see no reason why the Deputies opposite should get so noisy in connection with this proposal.  I can assure Deputy Morrissey, who is one of the representatives of a large beet-growing constituency&mdash;I do not know whether he grows any beet himself or not&mdash;that the representatives of the beet growers in that area are well able to look after their own business and need no assistance from him.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave sat idly by as a representative of a constituency for a number of years.  Deputy Cosgrave, as a representative of a constituency which had been particularly sweetened, as he says, at the expense of the other 25 counties, should be the last man to make any complaint because a few more counties are getting the sweets he denied them.</P>

      <P>One remarkable feature about Deputy Corry's speech was that he never once touched on the sugar tax, although that was the reason he rose to speak.  He did not tell us why it was necessary to put it on or what its economic effect is. The Deputy introduced instead this question of sugar beet.  I remember reading, with a great deal of interest, the comments made by Deputy Corry when the price for sugar beet to the producer was being fixed.  I think he said in very blustering fashion something about coolie wages and wound up by saying in a spectacular way that the producers were not going to accept a price which would leave them less than the price of a pint. Notwithstanding that declaration, the Deputy came up to Government Buildings and crawled out of that declaration, and he had not the price <Col N="1480" /> of a pint with him when he left.  His reputation has gone lower.  The Deputy talks now of the immense benefit of this crop to the farmers, but when he was discussing the matter as a member of a Beet Committee he talked of starvation wages and said there would be no profit to the producer. The &ldquo;loud music of the distant drum&rdquo; rings in his ears but, with all the tub-thumping, he did not carry out these promises to his friends.  At that time, he talked of coolie wages and said there would be starvation for the producer of beet. He did not need anybody to go around in motor cars then.  I do not know what means of locomotion he used, but he was going up and down the country agitating against the price that was being fixed for the growing of this crop.  Now, many months afterwards, he is probably entirely discarded and derided by the people who were foolish enough to believe in him then.  He talks now of the benefit brought to the farming community through the sugar beet scheme.  Let him address himself to what we are discussing&mdash;the tax on sugar.  On a recent occasion, he said that the taxes put on these things were imposed because they were substances which the people must eat.</P>

Sub-section (2) says that duty shall be imposed at the rate of any amount equal to 75 per cent. of the value of the article, but subsequent information, vouchsafed in some schedules circulated to the House, indicated that the duty, instead of being 75 per cent., is going to be 100 per cent.  Now, a tax of 100 per cent. &mdash;or with some kind of preference thrown, a preferential tax of 75 per cent.&mdash;is being put on all cutlery that is being brought into the country. Would the Minister tell us clearly what exactly is the amount of the tariff that is being put on this cutlery, why it could not have been put plainly into this section, and what he has in mind when he proposes that a tariff of that particular size should be put on cutlery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a duty of 15 per cent. imposed in 1932 as a revenue duty.  When the project of having a cutlery factory established in this country was first mooted, then, in order to discourage any tendency to undue importations that revenue duty was increased to 25 per cent. and cutlery was imported into the country subject to 25 per cent. duty which was paid.  When the flotation of the company took place and the construction of the factory was begun, it was obvious that there was some danger of large quantities of cutlery being brought into the country in <Col N="1487" /> anticipation of an increase in the duty or of the making of a quota order under the Control of Imports Acts, and, in order to prevent that, this duty of 75 per cent., with a 50 per cent. preferential rate, is being imposed. However, the duty of 25 per cent. imposed under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act has not been repealed and at the present time cutlery is being imported under licences which remit the duty imposed by the Finance Act; that is, the 75 per cent. with the 50 per cent. preferential rate, but the 25 per cent. imposed under the Emergency Act is still being collected.  That emergency duty will disappear when the factory at Droichead Nua comes into production, and the permanent duty will be 75 per cent. with the 50 per cent. preferential rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the duty is being imposed at that height is because there is reason to anticipate that certain forms of cutlery could be imported at very low prices.  In fact, it is known that Germany and other continental countries are subsidising the export of cutlery at the present time, and it was felt that a smaller rate of duty might prove ineffective and that dumping tactics might be resorted to in order to get cutlery products into this market.  It must be remembered by Deputies that cutlery products are not perishable and that they could be brought in and stored here in any quantity.  The industry is being established at Droichead Nua by a company which has been recently formed, and it is anticipated that there will be no difficulty experienced in producing cutlery there at practically the same prices as in Sheffield. No increase in prices is anticipated, but we could not take the risk of having a lower rate of duty which would interfere with the development of the industry even though the duty is not required because of any higher costs of production anticipated here. The industry is an important one and it is expected to give employment to about 200 persons in the town, of which the greater proportion will be men, but with some proportion of <Col N="1488" /> women.  The market available is valued at about £60,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>Oh, quite.  I agree that in respect of certain products manufactured here now there has been an increase in prices compared with the prices of the imported article, but we deliberately decided to establish these factories here knowing that that would be so because we expected that the results as a whole would be beneficial. In this case, having gone carefully into the matter with the promoters and other people interested in the project, we were satisfied that there was no reason of which we knew why prices should be higher here except, of course, in so far as there might be a higher standard of wages here than operates in Sheffield, or some factor of that kind.</P>

      <P>That is, you fear that there might be a flooding of <Col N="1489" /> this country by the importation of a large amount of cutlery, partly owing to the cost of production abroad, and partly owing, possibly, to the question of subsidising, but by means of the prohibition&mdash;prohibition acting through licence&mdash;and the 25 per cent., the Minister is able to cope with that situation.  Why could not the Minister cope with that situation once the factory is set up?  What is the necessity for raising it to 75 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that once the factory is in operation, in order to achieve the same purpose&mdash;that is to keep out dumped cutlery&mdash;he proposes to make permanent the 75 per cent. duty and possibly the 100 per cent. duty?  Why will not the same machinery that is operating now with the 25 per cent. duty, be equally effective when the factory is in operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not understand.  The 25 per cent. has been in operation for some time, and has been paid by importers, but it was not by itself sufficient to remove the danger of abnormal importations.  Therefore, another duty of 75 per cent. was imposed.  Both duties are now in operation, and a person trying to import cutlery without a licence would have to pay 100 per cent. but, in fact, on application such a person could get a licence which remits the 75 per cent. When production commences the position will be that the duty of 75 per cent., with a 50 per cent. preferential rate, will become payable, and there will be no licence.  Anybody can import subject to that duty, but the emergency duty will be repealed, and the policy of issuing licences will be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as stopping the issue of licences is concerned I have no objection to that, as the Minister knows.  But if you have this particular system, why is not the Minister continuing the licences?  He apparently has not the same objection to the system that I have, judging <Col N="1490" /> from the way it is being operated. Why this licence provision, plus 25 per cent. duty, cannot operate in the future as well as it is evidently operating now is not clear to me.  I cannot see why, once a factory is established, if he has an effective 25 per cent., plus a licensing system, he cannot do what he wants with that 25 per cent. without running the risk of raising it to 50 per cent.  It is inevitable that he will raise it to 50 per cent. if any of the foreign articles come in.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister get after that.  The amendment suggests that the tariff should not in fact be higher than 45 per cent., but to raise the tariff to the point to which the Minister is now raising it is simply to drive people into the position that they have to pay a higher price for their cutlery now.  Why it should be necessary to do that as a lead-up to a factory in connection with which we do not know when it will be established or in working order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not understand the real intention of the licence provision in connection with this 75 per cent.  As I understand the position, the 25 per cent. which has been imposed under the Emergency (Imposition of Duty) Order has been paid by everybody, and is going to continue to be paid.</P>

I do not understand the Minister's remarks when he suggests that people are not going to pay the additional 75 per cent. or the 50 per cent. preference, and I should like him to make clear in what circumstances that is going to be set aside.  I take it that it is in operation at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>Why on earth should this House be asked to put an additional 75 per cent., with a preferential rate of 50 per cent., on this particular class of cutlery, when it is a quota arrangement the Minister is looking for? The proceedings are very absurd, and I think they are very unreasonable.  I do not even think they are meant to be reasonable; there is a twist in the <Col N="1492" /> matter, and the twist can only mean that the people are going to pay more for their cutlery, and are in fact paying more at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when the company was formed, and the construction of the factory commenced, it was necessary to increase the duty.  The Deputy will at least concede that from the Government's point of view it was necessary to increase the duty in order to prevent abnormal quantities of cutlery being imported in anticipation of a higher duty later, or of a Quota Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the 25 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The 25 per cent. was in operation from last year.  The problem we were faced with at that time was that either we were to increase the 25 per cent. to 75 per cent. and then say to the importers: &ldquo;You will pay 75 per cent.,&rdquo; or &ldquo;we will give you a licence to import free of that duty.&rdquo;  The first alternative would have been unfair to the importers.  They would have to pay 75 per cent. for articles which were not available in this country.  The second alternative would have meant that cutlery would come in for those three or four months cheaper than it had come in for the past year; in other words, the 25 per cent. would also have to be remitted as well as the increase in the duty.  In order to avoid that situation arising, and maintain the 25 per cent. throughout the whole of the period until the factory would come into production, the emergency duty was left in operation, and this duty was imposed to discourage people from importing abnormal quantities.  This duty is not now being paid by anybody, because any importer can get a licence to import free of that duty for the time being. That is, as the Deputy has properly described it, a quota arrangement.  It is only a temporary arrangement, which will finish at the end of August, when this duty becomes effective and will be the only duty in operation.  There will be no restriction on people importing except the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered preferable to have that arrangement in force rather than <Col N="1493" /> a quota and restriction in respect of quantity.  There would be certain difficulties in operating a quota order in relation to cutlery.  Up to the present, quota orders have restricted imports by quantities.  A quota order permitted the importation of a certain quantity of goods, so many yards of cloth, so many tyres, or so many motor vehicles. It would be difficult to operate such a system in relation to cutlery.  You might possibly have a quota in respect of the value.  We have not done that, because there are difficulties in the way of doing it.  We prefer to have protection of this industry, not by a quota order, but by the imposition of a Customs duty, which will still permit people desiring to import certain types of cutlery, perhaps cutlery which may have a sentimental value for them, subject to the payment of the duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been moved by Deputy Mulcahy.  I would like to point out to him the wide door which he is opening if he persists with his amendment.  The Deputy seeks to delete the protection of 75 per cent., which is afforded in the section to cutlery produced here, and he desires to substitute for the 75 per cent., protection to the extent of 20 per cent.  He wants to delete completely the provision which establishes a minimum rate of 6d. on each article.  It has been decided to establish a cutlery factory here.  It will be located at Droichead Nua.  At present premises are being adapted for use as a factory and the adaptation will be completed about the end of this month.  The factory is likely to be in production about the end of August.  While efforts were being made to establish a factory here, it was found there was a large number of English and Continental travellers endeavouring to book orders in this country in advance of the establishment of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that position had been allowed to develop without restrictions being imposed by the Government, obviously it would be a long time before the Newbridge factory would be required to produce cutlery for the Irish <Col N="1494" /> market.  It was therefore not only necessary to impose a duty of this kind, to forestal dumping from the British and Continental markets, but it was particularly necessary to do so in respect of the imports from non-European sources.  A kind of cutlery has been dumped here from Japan and sold at a price that it is not possible for any Irish producer to compete against.  Some of the articles of cutlery imported from Japan could not be made and sold here, even if the workers here were to work for nothing.  It is obviously desirable that we should have some adequate protection against imports from Japan of a cheap type of cutlery made under diabolical labour conditions.  I think Deputy Mulcahy will hardly object if we protect Irish made cutlery against importations of that description.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will 75 per cent. be sufficient to stop that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very difficult to stop it, even by means of 75 per cent.; but I think you will get a considerable distance towards stopping it by the imposition of a minimum rate of 6d. on each article. Knives have been imported from Japan and sold here at 2/9 a dozen. It is impossible for any Irish worker, no matter what type of machinery is being used, to produce knives here at 2/9 a dozen.  It is with that type of competitor that this factory will be asked to compete.  It has also to be borne in mind that the German Government, in order to try to maintain their non-German markets, have been giving bounties on their exports; not only have they been giving these bounties, but they have been paying the complete import duty on German-exported goods.  Again, one can hardly say that competition from Germany, having regard to the present rates of wages here, is fair competition in relation to articles produced in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noteworthy that protection has been given in respect of commodities exported from countries where the rates of wages have been extremely low, notoriously low in the case of Japan, and where it was felt, because of these low rates, it would be impossible <Col N="1495" /> for an Irish factory, paying reasonable rates of wages, to compete with products from such countries. I think the intention is, as was explained by the Minister, that when the licensing provision ceases by reason of the fact that the Irish factory is in production, the normal rate will then be 75 per cent. for any cutlery imported, with the provision that there is a minimum rate of 6d. on each article.  I suggest Deputy Mulcahy ought not to move for the deletion of the rate of 6d. on each article because the only country that will benefit by his action, if it is approved, will be Japan, and every Japanese cutlery worker will be very pleased with the Deputy.  I do not know whether that would be any satisfaction to him.  He ought not to persist with his amendment, because it would be calculated not to help Irish workers, but rather to help industries in other countries where people are compelled to work at extremely low rates of wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Irish industry and Irish workers are being prejudiced in either their present or future positions by circumstances such as Deputy Norton speaks of, they will want to get a less wry-necked weapon to defend their interests than the section we have in this Finance Bill.  It is no use to talk about Japan and the terrible conditions there and the kind of damage that can be done to this industry by the importation of quantities of knives at 2/9 a dozen&mdash;they would be nearly as cheap as the shoes about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce boasts. This section, as it stands, is going to leave a 75 per cent. tariff on goods made in Sheffield.  I do not know whether the conditions in Sheffield are a disgrace to civilisation, or anything like that; I take it that they are better than the Japanese conditions and I have to take it that we would probably be fairly satisfied to have a well-established cutlery industry here giving stable employment and as good conditions to start with as the cutlery workers in Sheffield <Col N="1496" /> have.  I do not know, but I imagine if I was offered that I would accept right away.  As the section stands, the Minister has power to charge a 75 per cent. tariff on goods coming from Sheffield and 100 per cent. on goods coming from any other place.  If people are anxious to import cutlery he will say to them: &ldquo;If you do you will have to pay 50 per cent.&rdquo;; that is, that he is going to discriminate in the persons he will allow to import cutlery or parts of cutlery and is going to use the weapon of being able to say: &ldquo;You will have to pay this extra tariff if you import.&rdquo;  I object to that as a scheme. The proposal down here does not deal with that as a scheme, but it does suggest an amendment which leaves the tariff against Sheffield cutlery at 45 per cent., and if the Minister weighed the question of the tariff imposed by this, the tariff would be 25 per cent. against any place in respect of which there was not a preference. I think it is quite sufficient at the moment to leave it that the 45 per cent. tariff can obtain as a whole or in particular circumstances where the Minister is operating his licences. I should like to know whether the Minister has the intention of operating the licence purely to facilitate people who are setting up industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the tariff left at these figures, I think no complaint can be raised.  It is absurd to have 75 per cent. and 100 per cent. tariffs in our tariff legislation for whatever purpose. It is a bad habit and it does reflect in prices outside.  The costs falling on people outside in every direction are sufficiently high to make it necessary to avoid anything that would tend to increase them and, therefore, I am very definitely opposed to allowing the figures to stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that so far as Deputy Norton's reference to the amendment is concerned, his argument deals only with one <Col N="1497" /> portion of the amendment.  He does not at all deal with the increased cost of what I might call cutlery produced under ordinary conditions.  To segregate the two portions of the section, one portion of the section is definitely aimed at the exclusion of extra cheap articles.  We may argue whether cheap articles ought to be excluded because they are cheap and whether the suggestion that the consumer at the moment in this country can never have a word said for him, that he has no voice in the matter, that it is no advantage to him and to the tens of thousands of other consumers in this country, who buy knives, to get them cheap&mdash;you may object to getting them cheap, but it is an advantage and it cannot be brushed aside as if it did not exist.  Suppose, however, that you have that insuperable objection. People seem to know a lot about labouring conditions in other countries, ever so much more than they know of labour conditions in their own country, but I often am doubtful when I hear pictures painted of labouring conditions in other countries, because I have heard pictures painted of labour conditions in other countries, and the people in those countries paint very much the same picture of labour conditions here.  I have heard them do it, but leave that aside.  That, at all events, can be covered by the sixpence per article tax. But there is what I gather from the Minister is going to be a permanent thing once the factory is set up.  The <Col N="1498" /> 75 per cent. will be a permanent tax once the factory is set up.  It is not a mere passing thing; it is to be permanent, and there is that increased price year after year and day after day of everything consumed in this country.</P>

      <P>Before you put Section 16, there is one point that I gathered from the Minister in answer to some questions by Deputy Mulcahy and myself.  The Minister said that there will be nothing in the section that will induce to an increase in price, and I gathered from the low remark made by the Deputy&mdash;I mean low in sound&mdash; that the prices were already going down.  Is that so?</P>

      <P>(1) There shall be charged, levied, and paid on every of the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 16th day of May, 1935, a duty of customs at the rate hereinafter mentioned in respect of such article, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  articles which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are assemblies of parts of clocks (excluding articles mentioned in the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section, and also excluding parts assembled by pressing and <Col N="1501" /> clock-cases and parts thereof)&mdash;a sum equal to seventy-five per cent. of the value of the article.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete the word &ldquo;seventy-five,&rdquo; where it occurs in each of the lines: 9, 17, 22 and 25.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is pursuing the same principle of this section as he was pursuing on Section 16.  At any rate Section 17 purports to impose on clocks and on clock movements a tariff of 75 per cent. of the value of the article and not less than 2/-, and on clock cases 75 per cent. of the value of the article and not less than 5/-.  Will the Minister tell us why our people should be required to pay 75 per cent. more than the prices they have been paying hitherto for clocks and other articles of that kind, and why, in certain cases, even that 75 per cent. is not enough?  The minimum tariff of 2/- must be paid, and in certain other cases the minimum tariff of not less than 5/- must be paid. It seems an extraordinarily high tariff to impose, and it seems to be a tariff entirely for revenue purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a revenue tariff on clocks and component parts of clocks since before the Free State was established.  There were the McKenna duties of 33? per cent. in operation before this State was established. So far as this State is concerned, what is being done now is that a higher rate of duty is imposed upon complete clocks and the duty is being taken off component parts for the purpose of encouraging people to assemble clocks here.  In fact, one firm has <Col N="1502" /> already made arrangements to do that. The net result will be that clocks assembled here will be available without any duty instead of paying a duty of 33? per cent.  The industry of assembling clocks which it is hoped to establish and the later assembling of watches is not unimportant.  I do not say it will be a major industry, but it will give employment of a particularly useful type.  The net effect of the changes will be a reduction in revenue in comparison with the position when an independent duty operated, that is in previous years before this State was established.</P>

      <P>The Minister, at any rate, cannot produce any argument to indicate that the cost of clocks is not going to be raised to the full margin of this tariff.  It has already happened that the 2/- is being put on the smallest clock sold at present.  So that where the Minister is charging these rates at present he cannot tell us in connection with this section that the difference does not operate as it operated in connection with No. 16, because I have come up against at least two cases in which persons purchasing small clocks have been told <Col N="1503" /> that there is an increased duty of 2/- on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is wise in pressing this.  We may reach a point at which we may have more factories than the trade here would justify, a point which they seemed to have already reached in America.  It is just as bad to have Irish money invested in factories which can never yield a return as never to have started them at all, because that will limit expansion in other directions.  In this case is the Minister satisfied that the firms are competent to deal with the work? This is new work, I presume.  It is work to which they have not been accustomed and I think it would have been better if a bounty had been given, or some assistance of that sort, in the first instance.  In that case it would be possible to avoid the dissatisfaction that will be created by the sale of goods that are unsatisfactory.  After all, it must not be very difficult to make a clock that will keep some sort of time, but to make a clock that will keep proper time and that will have a presentable appearance is a different proposition.  In this case the wastage that will arise from the hasty establishment of industries and the fact that sufficient attention has not been paid to technique, will some time or other provoke public opinion against <Col N="1508" /> tariffs.  That is one result that I fear because of the hasty measures taken by the Minister.  There is also the danger that people will get into this business, make a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; in it and then get out of it.  The fact that we had clock manufacturers in this country at one time is indisputable. We have also had hat manufacturers and others.  In a matter of this kind, it is vital that the production of these factories should be of a sufficiently high standard to hold the market.</P>

      <P>The intention of the amendment was to confine the duty to the lower priced teas, but I shall not go into that now.  This is the section which imposes a duty of 4d. per lb. on tea.  Members of the Party opposite seem to be somewhat confused about this whole question of the tea duty, even some of the Ministers.  Recently we had the Minister for Local Government and Public Health announcing that when the Fianna Fáil Party assumed office they found a duty on tea.  Notwithstanding the fact that that was denied at the time the Minister for Local Government and Public Health made that speech, we had it repeated afterwards by another member of the Party.  The fact, of course, is that there was no duty on tea when the present Government assumed office. The Minister himself, on one occasion, described tea as a luxury.  I do not know whether he still holds that view, or whether he is going to give that reason this year for imposing this duty.  Of course, it is known to most people in this country, probably to everyone except the Minister himself, that tea is not a luxury and that as far as poor people are concerned it is an absolute necessity.  Unfortunately, it forms part of nearly every meal which is partaken of by the poor people.  For <Col N="1510" /> that reason it hits them in an exceptionally hard way.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which I would draw the attention of the House.  Up to about two years ago if a duty of 4d. or 6d. per lb. were imposed on tea, the very poor people, those on the point of destitution, could, in a way, get over that by purchasing cheaper tea.  About two years ago, however, the tea planters came to an agreement restricting the output of the cheaper teas by about 25 per cent. Prior to their reaching that agreement it was possible for retailers to purchase tea at prices as low as 10d. or 1/- per lb.  That tea was retailed at 1/2 or 1/4 Therefore, if a person had been buying tea at 1/6 per lb., and if a duty of 4d. were imposed on that, he could adjust his expenditure by falling back on the cheaper quality of tea.  That is not the position to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the wholesale prices are at the moment, but up to quite recently I think that the wholesale price of the cheapest tea on the market was about 1/4 per lb.  In other words, it is about 6d. per lb. dearer than it had been.  It will, therefore, be seen that, so far as those who are compelled to purchase the very low quality of teas are concerned, they will have to meet the full burden of this 4d. per lb.  A person, however, who was able to pay 3/- per lb. for tea can meet the situation by buying tea at 2/8, or a person who was in the habit of buying tea at 2/8 can now buy tea sold at 2/4, but the poor people who are compelled by circumstances to purchase only the poorest quality of tea will have to bear the full duty of 4d. per lb. That is a heavy imposition.  In the case of these very poor people to whom I am referring, it will mean much more than 4d. per lb. because, unfortunately very many of these people have to buy tea in very small quantities.  It is not uncommon for poor people living in slums and tenements to buy tea in such small quantities as a couple of ounces at a time.  Because of that they pay proportionately more for tea than people who are able to buy a pound or a half-pound at a time.  Taken by itself, this tax on tea is a very serious imposition, but when taken in conjunction <Col N="1511" /> with all the other increases in the necessaries of life imposed by this Finance Bill then, as I said on a former occasion, it amounts to a substantial reduction in the wages of workers.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Hugo Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, telling us on an earlier stage of the Bill that everyone in this country drank tea: that the drinking of tea was not confined to the poor.  The Parliamentary Secretary overlooked the fact that persons in receipt of fairly decent wages or salary are able to enjoy a greater variety of food than the very poor.  They do not use as much tea as the poor.  It is because people are poor that they are compelled, so to speak, to drink so much tea.  It is silly to suggest that an extra charge of 4d. in the lb. on tea will mean as much to a person in the position of the Parliamentary Secretary as it will to the unfortunate poor person trying to exist on home assistance or on unemployment assistance.  Those who are in touch with poor people know that if they are able to have three meals a day, their principal diet at each consists of tea and bread.  As people say in the country, the tea-pot is never off the hob.  Therefore, they consume a great deal more tea than people more fortunately circumstanced, and this tax for that reason is going to press more heavily on them.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies in all parts of the House will make it clear to the Minister that they are opposed to this tax on tea.  The country is opposed to it.  It is an unpopular tax, and if the Minister does not already know that, he ought to know it.  As I cannot move the amendment on this stage, I propose doing so on Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the Minister for Finance has a very strong objection to tea drinking. He informed us in one of his Budget speeches that a tax on tea did not matter: that tea was not a necessity at all, and that it was a thing that people could do without.  Tea, he said, was simply a beverage.  The Minister endeavoured in that somewhat heavy jocose style of his to brush aside the <Col N="1512" /> whole question of the heavy impost which a tax on tea means to the poorest members of the community. Those of us who live in the country and know the habits of life of the people are well aware that a great number of people rely on tea as a great stimulant to keep them going. We all know that ordinary working girls, especially in the cities, take tea a great number of times each day.  Tea and bread are really the main sources from which they derive support for their bodies, and the cost of tea and bread is being increased.  The Minister is quite regardless of all that. He seems to think that a tax on tea, combined with the other taxes in the Budget all of which must of necessity hit the very poorest classes in the community, is one that can be lightly imposed.  That is the attitude he seems to take up in respect of all these food taxes.  Anyone who knows the conditions in rural Ireland, especially of the small farmers of the West&mdash;the conditions to which they have been reduced by the economic policy which the Government have put in force&mdash;is well aware of the privations they are suffering at the moment, and must be satisfied that these taxes on the necessaries of life are a cruel and an unjust imposition.  After all, what is a just tax and what is an unjust tax?  A just tax is a tax which places a burden upon backs that are able to bear it, as far as that object can possibly be achieved.  An unjust tax is a tax which places a burden upon backs which are too weak to bear that burden.  The Minister and his colleagues, by these food taxes, are placing a terrible burden on backs already weakened by the policy which the Government have adopted.  The Government have taken away their means of livelihood, their sole source of income, from a very large number of persons in this country&mdash;from the small farmers and agricultural labourers and from the working class people in the towns.  The case for the latter has already been put forward in the House.  My object is to stress the burden which these food taxes will place on people whose condition I am familiar with, people living in my own <Col N="1513" /> constituency.  A great number of them are finding it impossible to make ends meet at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, with money which comes to them from England.  Here is an argument which I hope the Minister will take to heart because I submit it is a direct answer to his interjection.  It is this: that the people who are paying their rates and their annuities, who are stinting themselves in order that they may do so, are the people upon whom the Minister's taxes are going to press with extra weight.  People who could afford to pay their rates and their annuities, and who are not doing so, can laugh at the Minister's taxes.  They have got the money in their pockets and can afford to pay the extra taxes imposed by the Minister upon the necessaries of life, but the people who stint themselves in order that they may be able to pay their rates and their annuities, are the people upon whom the Minister's extra imposts press with a double weight.  The Minister should recognise that fact.  He should consider the position of the people who have lost their sole means of getting ready money for what they have to sell, whose market for the sale of their livestock has been taken away, and whose market for eggs has been reduced to such an extent that it is now of very little value to them.  They have been compelled to reduce the number of hens which they usually kept, a very important thing for the small holders in my constituency.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question to-day relative to a certain notice which was served on Mr. Patrick Scahill, Corveagh Lr., Aughagower, Westport, County Mayo.  It is a very interesting notice and I shall read it to the House.  It is headed &ldquo;Land Purchase (Ireland) Acts.&rdquo;<Col N="1514" /> Then in very large print &ldquo;Notice of Sale of Holding&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Lands at Corveagh Lr., Collection No. 15407; amount of instalments due, £4 2s. 10d.; costs 7/-; total £4 9s. 10d.  Take notice that unless the above sum of £4 9s. 10d. due to the Irish Land Commission out of the above holding is paid within 10 days from the date hereof, I am directed to put the holding up forthwith for sale by public auction, and, in the event of the sale not realising the amount of arrears and costs then due the Commission, I will take up possession of the holding. Dated this 17th day of June, 1935.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then in print comes the name of W. J. O'Reilly, Solicitor to the Irish Land Commission, 21, Upper Merrion Street, Dublin.  I asked the Minister, on whose behalf the Parliamentary Secretary replied, to-day (1) if that notice purporting to come from the solicitor to the Land Commission did, in fact, come from him.  I am very doubtful about it.  As I shall demonstrate in a moment, powers are being claimed on behalf of the Land Commission which the law does not confer on the Land Commission.  Knowing that, I asked if this document did, in fact, emanate from the solicitor to the Land Commission.  In the very unsatisfactory reply which the Parliamentary Secretary gave, he dodged that issue.  His reply was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A printed notice containing the particulars mentioned in the Deputy's question was issued from the offices of the Land Commission in pursuance of the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked him definitely if it came from the solicitor or if it was with the authority of the solicitor this extraordinary document was served on Mr. Scahill.  He failed to give a definite reply to a definite and specific question. The only conclusion I can draw from the Parliamentary Secretary's evasion is that the solicitor to the Land Commission did not draw up that document and was not responsible for it. I should like to get a clear reply from <Col N="1515" /> the Parliamentary Secretary on that question.  I do not believe he dodged that plain question unless there was some reason for doing so.  To the question as to the power under which the solicitor purported to act, the Parliamentary Secretary replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I refer the Deputy to Section 18 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1887, and Sections 32, 33 and 37 of the Land Act, 1927.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not one of these sections empowers the Land Commission to issue a notice of this nature.  Section 19 of the Land Act, 1887, confers upon the Land Commission the powers of sale contained in Sections 19, 21 and 22 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881.  It gives these powers and no others.  There is no power in the crucial section of the Conveyancing Act of 1881&mdash;Section 19&mdash; to put up for sale subject to any reserve.  Here there is clearly a sale subject to a reserve.  If the sale does not reach the amount of the arrears and costs, then due the Commission, &ldquo;I will take up possession of the holding.&rdquo; How the solicitor is going to do that, if somebody has made a bid less than the arrears and costs, I do not know.  That, however, is the threat contained in the notice.  There is no power under the Conveyancing Act to sell subject to any reserve.  The Land Commission can bid at the auction.  If they do not bid, they have no power to put on any reserve.  The holding must go to the highest bidder.  For some extraordinary reason the Parliamentary Secretary refers me to two very irrelevant sections of the Land Act of 1927&mdash;Sections 32 and 33.  Section 32, as the Parliamentary Secretary ought to know, gives only power to the Land Commission to sell by private contract.  What has that to do with sale by public auction, as here? So far as Section 33 is relevant, it makes this notice completely and entirely bad because it says there shall be no notice of any kind by private treaty or public auction until the advertisement has been issued. Nothing of the kind has been done here and these two sections are not in the slightest way relevant.  Section 34 <Col N="1516" /> gives no power to the solicitor to put up a holding for sale and, if the amount of arrears and costs is not realised, to enter into possession.  Under Section 34, if the Land Commission put up a holding for sale and there is no bidding at the auction, they have power to go to the Judicial Commissioner and ask him to make an order giving them possession.  The section is clear and specific.  The Commissioner may make such an order.  It is left entirely in his discretion and there is no power in the solicitor to the Land Commission, of his own volition, without a court order, to walk in and take possession.</P>
    <P>The very section upon which the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply relies shows that here an attempt is being made to extort money&mdash;and I use the word extort deliberately&mdash;from an annuitant, by threats that the Land Commission will do things, according to the solicitor's letter, that there is no power in law to do.  I thought that the great law-breaking Department in this State was the Department of Justice, but I now think the Land Commission has been law breaking, and encouraging law breaking, and is going to run the Department of Justice a very good second.  Possibly with a little help they may exceed it.  Here the Land Commission sends an unfortunate ignorant man, who cannot be expected to know any law, a terrifying notice, intimating that they will do things they have no power to do.  I want to know, and I am sure the House and the country want to know, if documents similar to the one that was sent out in this case are to be regarded as so much waste paper, or is it the intention and the policy of the Land Commission to act as this document threatens?  Is it the policy of the Land Commission when a man owes an instalment of £4 2s. 10d.&mdash;as a matter of fact I am told, if my information is correct, that the instalment should be £3 2s. 10d.&mdash;that a man and his family are to be put on the roadside, and a holding that may be worth a large sum of money taken away or seized?  Is that the policy of this Administration? Let us know one way or the other.  Let us have no dodging.  Let us not have <Col N="1517" /> the indefinite reply that was given at question time to-day.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary say if it is the policy of the Land Commission to evict everyone who owes a certain gale of the annuity.  If that is the policy let the Parliamentary Secretary get up and say so.  If that is not the policy let the Parliamentary Secretary explain why documents threatening to take that course are being sent out to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister recognises the consternation there must be in a country house when a notice of the kind is received.  Remember the position of the family living in the little home, and that has nothing else but what can be made out of the holding.  Some may have relatives in England to assist them to keep going.  A great many of these people have nothing to depend upon but the home and the piece of land attached to it.  If they fall into arrears in the payment of the annuity are they to be terrorised by being informed that they are going to be evicted?  What can be the feelings of persons who receive notices to the effect that they are to be evicted?  Are these notices so much waste paper or is this being done merely to terrorise people, to render them miserable and unhappy, and to destroy all peace and contentment in the unfortunate households into which such terrible documents go?  Is it the real intention of the Department, of the Minister, and of the Parliamentary Secretary to evict, wherever there is a single gale of the annuity due?</P>
    <P>One other matter arises on this answer.  In his reply the Parliamentary Secretary stated: &ldquo;In carrying out their statutory duties as regards the recovery of arrears of annuities the Land Commission consider the circumstances of each defaulter.&rdquo;  Is that true?  Do they?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean what he says in the answer?  If he does, there is a strange difference of opinion between the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Lands.  The Parliamentary Secretary will discover that, in a speech made by the Minister for Lands on the Land Commission Estimate in <Col N="1518" /> 1934, which appears in the Parliamentary Debates, Volume 53, column 1157, the Minister stated that the Land Commission did not make any inquiries as to the circumstances of persons before they took steps to collect the annuities.  He gave as a reason&mdash;and it may be a correct reason&mdash;that it would be utterly impossible for the Land Commission to do so.  He said that 52,508 notices had been sent out, and that it would be impossible to inquire into these 52,508 cases.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply states: &ldquo;The Land Commission consider the circumstances of each defaulter.&rdquo;  I do not know how many there are in arrear this year.  I am sure the number is in excess of last year. Let us take the figure of 52,508 for last year.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply stated: &ldquo;In carrying out their statutory duties as regards the recovery of arrears of annuities the Land Commission consider the circumstances of each defaulter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that in 52,508 cases the Land Commission considered the circumstances of every defaulter, the answer bears its own contradiction in the next paragraph, which states that since the issue of the printed notice Mr. Scahill has made an offer to the Land Commission to pay the arrears at the rate of 15/- per quarter.  Here is a man who gets a notice to pay £4 9s. 10d. within ten days or he will be ejected, and all he can do is to scrape together 15/- and to offer another 15/- per quarter.  That shows the financial position of this unfortunate man upon whom this ejectment notice has been served.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply states: &ldquo;This offer is at the moment under consideration.&rdquo;  It is not acceptable. The man finds himself in the position of not knowing whether the offer will be accepted or whether himself and his family will be thrown on the roadside. The position is vague and indefinite. How does the Parliamentary Secretary reconcile the two contradictory statements, that the Land Commission thoroughly investigate each case before they send out notices, and investigated the financial position <Col N="1519" /> of Mr. Scahill, and yet do not know whether they will take the offer of 15/- per quarter or not?  Why not?  Why are they not willing now to accept or to reject the offer?  The position is contradictory.  I should like to speak at greater length on this matter but I will confine myself to the ordinary rules and give the Parliamentary Secretary the usual ten minutes' reply. I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if this and similar documents represent the views of the Land Commission, and if it is not a lie but a truthful document, expressing the real opinion of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, then, for the peace and the well-being of this country, the sooner the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary change their tune the better.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that obtained in the Land Commission when the Deputy was a member of the previous Administration.  The powers under which that document was issued were given to the Land Commission in legislation enacted by the Government of which the Deputy was a member.  It is in accordance with these powers that that document was issued.  In reply to the Deputy, I would state that it is not the policy of the Land Commission to pursue a policy of evictions. We are as anxious to avoid evictions&mdash;we are at least as anxious as the Deputy to avoid them&mdash;but there is a statutory obligation on the Land Commission to collect these annuities, and I would remind the <Col N="1520" /> Deputy and the House that, in all cases of defaulters, their neighbours, the ratepayers of the county, are called upon to pay.</P>
      <P>With regard to the contradictory views which the Deputy alleges were expressed by the Minister and myself in connection with the consideration which is given to cases in which the Land Commission are charged with the collection of annuities, it would be utterly impossible, as the Minister pointed out, to consider each individual case in view of the enormous number of cases which the Land Commission have to deal with, but there is no difference of opinion as to the consideration which is given.  The Minister, I think, has announced that in all cases of hardship which are brought to the notice of the Land Commission each case gets individual consideration.  Obviously, it would be impossible for the Land Commission, before starting to proceed to collect, to consider every case.  That would be absolutely impossible.  Deputies should remember that there are upwards of 450,000 annuitants, I think, and if the Land Commission had first to investigate the case of each and every individual, before proceeding to collect, that investigation would take them much longer than the time at their disposal and probably longer than each half-yearly period.</P>
      <P>In this particular case of this great hardship, no payment had been made for a considerable period and, having in view the responsibility of the Land Commission to collect the annuities and thus prevent that man's neighbours from having to pay, they have to resort to the powers which, within the period when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was in office, it was thought necessary to have in order to ensure the prompt payment of these annuities. The circumstances of every defaulter will be considered when brought to the notice of the Land Commission.</P>
