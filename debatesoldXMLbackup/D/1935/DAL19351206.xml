      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £200 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1936, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí an Ghailerí Náisiúnta, maraon le Deontas-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £200 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1936, for the Salaries and Expenses of the National Gallery including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The total original Estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31st of March, 1936, to pay the salaries and expenses of the National Gallery was £3,762.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head A of the Estimate provision was included for the continuance of the payment of a temporary and non-pensionable allowance of £200 a year to the Secretary of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for acting director of the Gallery.  That officer, however, resigned from the Civil Service as from the 28th of February last, and his successor in the post of director of the Gallery was appointed thereto on a salary of £500 a year.  The present holder of the post entered upon his duties on the 1st of October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision originally made in the Vote is not sufficient to meet the increased salary payable to the director. In addition provision is necessary for the payment to the Registrar of a gratuity in respect of the period 1st <Col N="2101" /> March to 30th September during which the directorship of the Gallery was vacant, and he was required to undertake the duties of the post.  The total sum now required is £200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points on which I would like to be clear.  I gather that the complete salary of the Director now is £500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in that salary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that that is a sufficient salary for that particular post?  I take it for granted that this Director is drawing no other salary from the Civil Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then £500 is his total salary.  I want to ask the Minister will the Director be able to deal in pictures himself?  That is a point that was not cleared up.  Will he be able to buy pictures and sell them at his own discretion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I think the salary is entirely inadequate for a position of this kind.  A salary of £500 a year is not adequate for a man dealing with such important matters.  I think there was a certain doubt when this matter was discussed before as to whether or not the Director would have a free hand.  Fixing the salary at that figure is not making the salary commensurate to the position that is being filled.  If a man is an excellent man in that particular position, I think he should be paid properly.  I know there are institutions in which the Director is allowed to deal with other matters, and I think it is a highly objectionable practice and should not be encouraged.  A person should not be tempted into doing that, and the only way of avoiding it is to see that an adequate salary is provided for the person who is in charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to some extent with the view expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan on this matter, but I feel there would be objections to the person occupying the post dealing in pictures. While I would oppose any suggestion in that direction, there is, however, another way in which the Director could augment his income, and that is that he may not be precluded from obtaining fees for his services as a valuer or appraiser.  I feel many members of the public would welcome the services of such an expert and have no objection to paying a fee for such service.  If an expression were given by the Minister that he might be allowed to augment his salary in other ways outside of purchasing pictures for himself, it might be to the good.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy, evidently, has not taken a serious view of the matter.  If he had a conversation with some of his colleagues he might be inclined to alter his opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we resort to such devices as that suggested? Do we really wish to tell the world that this country does not consider art of sufficient importance to pay an adequate salary to the Director?  I cannot understand why we, who are supposed to be trying to revive civilisation here, should not be willing to pay £1,000 a year to a person holding such an important post as this.  I think the change in salary should have been made before Dr. Bodkin left.  I know nothing about Dr. Bodkin's successor. Possibly, he is equally competent to hold the post, or, possibly, he is not. But the time has certainly come when the State should pay this particular official a proper salary and not cause him to look around for extra work in order to give himself an income that will be adequate for his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, with regard to what has been said by Deputy MacDermot, I do not agree that the suggestion I made was resorting to any underhand action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2103" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;resort&rdquo; could be interpreted in that sense.  There are many people who would like to have some authority, an independent authority, with no personal interest, to advise them.  If that was not done by means of a charge you would have every Tom, Dick and Harry taking up this man's time.  If a person seriously considered he or she wanted expert advice, that person would have no objection to look for that advice from a competent expert.  It is done by professors in universities and experts in other branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking against the Deputy's suggestion, but the notion that it should be a substitute for the State paying a proper salary to this official.  I do not think that would be right.  Whatever he may be allowed to do, he should not be allowed to go dealing in pictures, and I am sure we are all agreed on that.  The State should pay him a salary that is in proportion to his talents and in proportion to the importance to be attached to art in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit that the Minister has made a very great mistake in not ventilating this general question of remuneration before Dr. Bodkin's successor was appointed?  We are now face to face with a rather awkward situation.  The position of Director of the National Gallery was advertised and applications sought for it on the basis of the very inadequate salary.  Having secured applications on that basis and chosen the best man, we are now faced with the question of altering the basis of remuneration.  Had we done that before we might have attracted applicants from Europe and the United States of America and had a very much wider choice.  Possibly, it will turn out that we have got the very best man, but I think it is a very unfortunate thing that the permanent basis of employment was not determined before we sought applications. That cannot be remedied now, but <Col N="2104" /> there is unanswerable force in the representations made to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not quarrel with Deputy Briscoe's suggestion that the Director of the National Gallery should be allowed to do work in the nature of the valuation and appraisement of pictures, but I do not think Oireachtas Eireann should take that into consideration when fixing his remuneration. There is no more poisonous principle from the plumber to the Prime Minister than to pay a man an inadequate salary on the ground that he can pick up odd jobs as well. The obligation devolves on the employer, whether the Government or the smallest employer in the State, to pay a man a fair wage, a wage commensurate with his work and skill.  It devolves on us to pay the Director of the National Gallery the salary that he is worth and we are not entitled to take into consideration wind-falls such as have been suggested.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister he should take this matter into consideration, and if he comes back with a proposal for a reasonable increase, say to put the Directorship of the National Gallery on the same footing as the Directorship of the National Library, he would receive unanimous support. I think it is inexpedient to be naming round figures, but I imagine the House will generally agree that the position of the Director of the National Gallery is closely analogous to that of the Director of the National Library or the Director of the National Museum.  If a common financial status could be found for these three gentlemen, I suggest the House would endorse the Minister in any action he may find it necessary to take in order to implement that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probable that this is not the time to refer to the former holder of the office, but certainly I cannot allow the occasion to pass without at least expressing very deep regret that the office which was held by Dr. Bodkin was vacated by him.  He was a national institution in this State, and he was of immense value to the Gallery during his term of office and even before he accepted the office.  The point made by Deputy <Col N="2105" /> Dillon is a point to which I was going to refer, that is, that this Vote ought to have been introduced before the individual was appointed, so that the House would be able to express its views as to what exactly was expected in the nature of the duties the new Director would perform.  The Minister, if I recollect correctly, stated on a previous occasion when this Vote was before the House that, although the salary proposed would be small, the person who would be appointed would be in a position to supplement his income.  To-day he gave us quite a different interpretation of his view of the duties of this office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I do not quite agree if Deputy Cosgrave suggests that I stated at some time that the Director would have power to deal in pictures.  I do not think I made any statement in the Dáil one way or the other, but it was generally recognised in the past that the Director&mdash;and, as a matter of fact, it was suggested that that was the chief argument against the salary of £500&mdash;would be compelled to go into some private business.  But the actual terms of appointment and the actual control of the Director in his duties rest, as Deputy Cosgrave knows, with the Board of the Gallery, and I have no function really with regard to his duties, although I have in regard to the amount of his salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  My recollection is that I read in the newspaper account of the discussion that took place here, on the Vote for the National Gallery, that the Minister said that the man appointed to the office would have to try and supplement his income.  No other interpretation could be placed upon that except that by reason of the office, and the opportunities afforded him, he would be in a position to deal in pictures. Assuming for the moment that he is supposed not to, and that he agrees not to, this is a small salary to be paid to the occupant of that office.  A man may not be allowed to deal in pictures, but at the same time he could stock his home, and at the end of 20 years might have something to sell, but, nevertheless, <Col N="2106" /> you could not include him in the list of dealers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>On a salary of £500 a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard of people with salaries of £500 a year buying pictures.  I mention the case of one man, the most outstanding personality as a judge of pictures, starting with a salary of much less than £500 a year, and winding up with an estate which, but for his benefactions, would have far exceeded a quarter of a million of money&mdash;that was the late Sir Hugh Lane.</P>
      <P>This is a very important office.  It is little short of a national calamity that we lost Dr. Bodkin.  Everyone wishes the new Director well.  It may be that if the salary was increased the previous Director would have kept on his position. But the difficulty the Minister is in now, and I hope he will realise it, is that if the office be worth more than £500, the Minister will know that the Civil Service is not the best place to put an appraisement of value on such an office.  Everyone knows the mass of files and correspondence that can be sent from one Department to another, pointing how this man, with his existing salary of £500 a year, should be kept at that figure.  They are not in a position, at any time, to evaluate the services of a man in this post.  The statement is put forward by the Minister that this office is held under a board.  It is not impossible for the Minister to get into communication with the board.  If it is going to supply an official and pay a salary, the board will be willing, in some way, to find accommodation, and to have a common policy with regard to a place like the National Gallery.  I should like the Minister to open up that with the board, as he is afforded an opportunity now under this new dispensation.  The question is of some importance to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have legations in various parts of the world, and we have many public institutions here which might well be adorned with some of the pictures at present housed in the cellars of the National Gallery.  A short time ago, while in Rome, I saw one picture in our <Col N="2107" /> legation there.  Rome is the centre of civilisation and, it is not only a pity, but a national humiliation, to think that every other institution in that city&mdash;I suppose, though I have not been in them&mdash;is pretty well adorned in respect of pictures from their native land.  What the Minister said, and which will be found in the Dáil Official Reports of the 4th April, 1935, column 2036, was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the past, men with very special knowledge of art, men who accumulated large fortunes by reason of their knowledge of the market value of pictures, held this post, and were glad to hold it because of the prestige and the honour that the title of Director of the National Gallery of Ireland carried with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious from that statement that the Minister had in mind that if, at any rate, the income could not be supplemented, one could add to one's possessions.  I do not think that is a policy we ought to stand over here. We should be in a position to command the very best expert knowledge and advantage, and to absorb the whole of it for the benefit of the city. I am not to be taken as saying that, at the same time, a man should not be permitted to furnish his house with pictures at all.  If he tried to take advantage of that, it is another thing. One can distinguish between the normal adornment of a house and the feeling of pleasure gained therefrom, and advantage to oneself.  It is unfortunate that the position was filled before some better understanding of the duty, and some explanation from the Minister with regard to the duties of the office, were not given to the House.  My own view is that a salary of £500 a year is not enough. It is neither fair to the individual nor to the office.  I said it is my opinion that the Civil Service is not the best institution to make a valuation of the services that would be rendered by a person in this office.  In conclusion, I say that we wish the new Director well in his office, and we hope he will be as successful as his predecessor in keeping and building up a Gallery of which every person in this city has just reason to be proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to gather that I am not making any point against him.  On the contrary, I am rather anxious to help him; but I am afraid he is falling between two stools.  A salary that would be adequate for a person who would be allowed to deal would be lower, and, on the other hand, a salary that would be adequate for a person who would not be allowed to deal would be higher than the £500. I am sorry that the Minister for Finance has been allowed to strike a balance.  I am sorry that the Minister for Education seems to have taken his inspiration from the Minister for Finance; I agree with Deputy Briscoe that he should get fees for valuation.  In past times, in connection with galleries of various types, we had two types of men.  We had the men who got smaller salaries and who could act as dealers&mdash;and there are plenty of these all over Europe.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, you had the non-dealer type, who was an expert devoted to the subject, with an interest in the subject for itself, and primary director.  Now, you had these two types rather clearly marked out.  I have seen instances of both types.  It seems to me that, in fixing the salary, the Department of Finance did not allow the Minister for Education to make up his mind as to what type he wanted, and I suggest that there should be a revision of it.  A man is either capable of filling this post or he is not capable of filling it.  I have heard of Dr. Furlong, and he is capable of filling the post, and filling it adequately.  Everything points in that direction and I think, that being so, he ought to get an adequate salary for doing it.  There should be no temptation to any man to put himself into the position of gradually ceasing to be head of that Gallery.</P>

      <P>The Minister, seeming to shelter somewhat behind the Governors of the National Gallery, told us that the Director was appointed by the Governors of the National Gallery.

      <P>I think it is important that we should understand what view the Governors of the National Gallery hold on this question of remuneration, particularly as it bears on another matter that has been brought up here&mdash;the power or otherwise to deal in pictures.  The Minister has not quite satisfied the House that he has given any clear consideration or come to any clear conclusion as to whether the Director can traffic in pictures at the present moment.  We have been told that the post has been held by men in the past who accumulated large fortunes at that work. There is another matter I should like to mention.  When referring to the matter in April last, on the original Estimate, the question arose of the possibility of teaching work being associated with the directorship, and the Minister mentioned that, if the universities required teaching work done, it might be possible to make an arrangement by which there would be association of teaching with the directorship.  I should like to know if the Minister has discussed that question with the universities or with the Governors of the National Gallery, and whether he has arrived at any conclusion in connection with the matter; and, if so, whether he proposes to pursue the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this discussion, one or two statements were made which I think deserve some attention.  Deputy Cosgrave said, if I am not mistaken, that pictures were stowed away in the cellars of the National Gallery, and Deputy MacDermot referred to the lack of appreciation of art in this country. On a former occasion here, I made a suggestion that some effort should be <Col N="2110" /> made to bring art to the people.  If it is true that these pictures are stowed away in the cellars and if, on the other hand, there is a lack of appreciation of art, are the people to be blamed?  The people who come to Dublin from time to time from the country, as a rule, do not have very much time to visit the National Gallery.  My suggestion was that some effort should be made for the loan of these pictures to the larger centres of population, such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and so on, and that lecturers should accompany the pictures and give instruction on them and in that way endeavour to awaken in the people an appreciation of these artistic treasures.  After all, it is very hard to blame the Irish people for lack of appreciation of art.  They have been too busy for centuries endeavouring to make a living in this country without devoting very much attention to matters artistic.  As a rule, interest in art matters arises chiefly amongst the people who have leisure and means and who can afford to travel through the Continent and view the magnificent exhibitions of pictures in the foreign art galleries, but it is very hard to blame the Irish people for the lack of appreciation of art.  Personally, I hold that, if the people got an opportunity of seeing these pictures, an appreciation of art could be awakened in them.</P>

      <P>I should like, at the outset, to disclaim being an art critic or anything in that way.  I do not think, however, that the way this debate seems to be more or less terminating is fair to anybody.  I should like the Minister, in replying, to consider very carefully what the exact terms are going to be on which the Director is appointed or what salary is fixed for his remuneration.  I take it that he is a first-class judge of pictures and, assuming that to be the case, I take it that it has been more or less tacitly accepted that he should not be allowed to traffic in pictures.  A situation in which he bought the right pictures for his own account and the wrong pictures for the National Gallery would lead, I take it, to a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.  There seems to be a point beyond that, however, <Col N="2111" /> that requires to be cleared up. Deputy Briscoe suggested that of course there could be no harm in the Director getting fees from independent persons for making a valuation.  While that, theoretically, might be possible, I would like to suggest that between making a valuation and actually purchasing a picture is a very short step. I should like to put a hypothetical case before the Minister.  Supposing some individual suggested to the Director that he would like the Director's opinion on a picture which had been discovered in some part of the country. Now, if the Director went down to look at that picture for a private individual, I cannot imagine that there would not be some discussion between the Director and the people whom he met as to the market value of the picture, and from that to striking a bargain on behalf of the person who had employed him to make the valuation, or more or less merely leaving it for the person who had employed the Director to clinch the bargain, would be a very short step.  I do not think the Minister is treating the Director quite fairly unless that is absolutely understood.  A person cannot serve two masters, and, while I admit that there might be something in what Deputy Briscoe says from the purely theoretical point of view, I hold that that could slip, by a very easy process, into what might become a practice that none of us would stand over, and that in time this country would come to regret that they had not employed the Director absolutely for their service, and that his knowledge was only at their disposal.  I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would clear up that point.  It is a commercial point and one that probably the people who will be associated with the Director would wish that there could be no misunderstanding about; that is, as to whether the Director was left in the position of not knowing at times which master he was to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one word more.  I think it is rather a pity that Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Cosgrave have raised some of the difficulties that they have raised.  It seems to me that, <Col N="2112" /> while it is always possible for a man to evade any regulation that we may make in connection with dealing in pictures, it would be quite possible in practice to secure, simply by means of an honourable undertaking, that the Director of the National Gallery would not trade in pictures on his own account.  The step between taking a fee for valuation and actually dealing does not seem to me such a short step as Deputy Dockrell supposes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has said that a man while refraining from dealing in pictures might lay in a large stock in his own house, and sell them in 20 years' time, and he cited the case of Sir Hugh Lane to show that that could be done on such a small salary as £500 a year. As a matter of fact, I cannot think that Sir Hugh Lane could have accumulated a fortune, such as he did, were it not for the fact that at the beginning, when he was living on a very low salary, he turned over pictures quickly.  He bought them and sold them again, but he certainly could not get rich on a small salary by accumulating pictures in his own house which were to be tied up for 20 years.  It does not seem to me that that is a danger that we need really bother our heads about.  If a man with a salary of £500, or even £1,000, a year buys pictures for himself, there is nothing that we should take exception to in that.  But, I think the Minister should tell us before this debate concludes whether he accepts what seems to be generally accepted in the House: that is the broad general principle that the Director of the National Gallery in this country should be requested to refrain from actual picture-dealing on his own account.</P>

      <P>A great deal of the discussion has turned on the question as to whether the Director of the National Gallery is entitled to deal in pictures.  It had been the custom in the past, as Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, for Directors of the National Gallery to deal in pictures.  I have already stated that the members of the Board of the National Gallery are the people who have laid down the conditions for appointment.  I doubt whether there is any limitation, but I shall inquire into the matter. I cannot at the moment say absolutely and definitely what restrictions, if any, are laid upon the Director.  I take it that there are no restrictions, but I propose to make a further statement on the matter as soon as I am able to get into communication with the Board of the National Gallery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell has raised some very troublesome questions, but I think Deputy MacDermot hit the nail on the head when he said that in this matter, and indeed in any other matter in which persons of high technical competence are employed, you have to rely on their sense of duty and sense of honour to carry out strictly the obligations that are laid <Col N="2114" /> on them, and to fulfil the conditions of their appointment.  If we are going to have the position that in a case of this kind we shall have to lay down the conditions as to what the gentleman who holds the position of Director of the National Gallery may do in his private and personal capacity in regard to the purchase of pictures, I think that would be an extremely difficult thing to do.  Meetings of the Board of the National Gallery are held regularly. These meetings are attended by the Director who is in close touch with the board.  He makes reports to the board, and I can only take it that there is a system in operation by which there is an understanding between the board and Director on these matters.  As I have said, when I have the opportunity of making further inquiries I shall make a statement to the House as to what exactly the position is.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that we are often led to believe that merely by spending money on matters pertaining to art we are improving the situation and improving the public taste, but I think Deputies will realise that what Deputy Goulding has said carries a lot of weight: that our country not being a wealthy country&mdash;being, as it is, a poor country&mdash;that up to very recently it has not had opportunities for developing national schools of art and so on, and, therefore, is in a different position from countries with a long tradition in these matters and old-established institutions.  In some of those countries you have extremely wealthy benefactors of art.  In the English newspapers, on almost any day you may see that very large sums of money are given by way of legacies for educational and art purposes.</P>
    <P>In this country it is only very rarely, I think, that we get even small benefactions for educational purposes.  In order to make up for our lack of worldly goods we have to try, through our educational system, to make up for that by cultivating a taste in art. There are certain schools of art in the country.  There are two galleries here in Dublin.  If the public are not taking full advantage of the facilities that are offered to them, I do not think that <Col N="2115" /> the Government or the Director of the National Gallery, or anybody responsible administratively, can be blamed. The fact is that the National Gallery is not being supported.  People do not visit it.  Suppose, for instance, we were to take a toll of the members of the Oireachtas who pay a visit to the National Gallery even once a year, it would probably be found that there are not more than half a dozen members who do that.  If we do not give the example ourselves in visiting the galleries that we have, how are we going to get other people to visit them and encourage an interest in the art? We cannot blame the public if that be our own attitude to the National Gallery. We, ourselves, should give the lead in this matter.  I hope this discussion will do something to awaken greater interest in art matters.  The Government is anxious that the National Gallery should be made as attractive as possible, and that the public should be induced to go there. It is difficult to see what steps we can take.  It is a free institution, and a staff is provided to help the public to appreciate the treasures that lie there. Certain steps have been taken in Great Britain, for example, in regard to lighting and advertising.  I understand even a small group of working people visiting the British National Gallery are entitled to have a guide to show them around.  We have not the financial resources here to enable us to maintain the huge staff that the English and other galleries can maintain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there even one guide for the time being in the Irish Gallery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy will recognise that before even one guide is appointed it would be necessary to see if he was required. Deputies who have not visited the Gallery, and whose interest in art is confined to debates on this subject, may laugh, but the point is that the public has not supported the Gallery. Any demands made by the board for additional facilities to enable the Gallery to be made more attractive, and to bring people there, will <Col N="2116" /> certainly receive the consideration of the Government.  Whether the Director was paid £2,000, £1,000 or £500, I fail to see how the question of his salary affects the matter.  It depends entirely on the personality of the Director.  The salary was not raised; the salary of, say, £1,000 for a whole-time Director was not fixed during Dr. Bodkin's term of office. Deputies on the opposite benches went into the question in exactly the same way as we have gone into it.  They did not create a whole-time post at that salary.  They gave the post to Dr. Bodkin, who had another position at £1,000, and he got £200 extra for carrying out the duties of Director. Now we are told that the salary should be £1,000.  At the time Dr. Bodkin was appointed, if the gentlemen opposite have the interest in art that they profess, why did they not take the obvious step?  I know that they were deeply interested in Dr. Bodkin and that they thought highly of him, and I am rather surprised now when they say what a great loss he was to the country when he left, that they did not take steps to rectify the situation. The position we were faced with was that Dr. Bodkin found a position abroad and decided to leave the country.  I suppose he thought his opportunities for advancement would be better there.  We were not able to keep Dr. Bodkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We went into the question very closely, and we were not prepared, in the case of his successor, to give a greatly increased salary which up to the present was not demanded.  The fact is that while the position is undoubtedly one of great importance, on account of the great value of these pictures, it is not perhaps as hard on the holder as the directorship of the National Library or the National Museum.  I am not going to institute comparisons between these posts.  I simply want to say that there is a difference, and that it has always been recognised that the directorship of the National Library for example is a whole-time post.  There seems to have been a belief up to the present that the directorship of the National Gallery was a part-time post.  The <Col N="2117" /> duties were successfully carried out, up to the time Dr. Bodkin left the position, by part-time directors.  It is now claimed that a whole-time Director at a greatly increased salary should be appointed.  I do not say that the present holder should not have got a higher salary.  The higher salary would not improve matters if we did not succeed in getting a good man with very wide continental experience and with high qualifications.  If we had not succeeded in getting such a man at the salary offered, Deputies on the opposite benches might have been able to say with some justice that the salary was not sufficiently attractive.  But we have got Dr. Furlong, who, I believe, will carry out the duties satisfactorily. He had a good deal of experience abroad and he will do what he can to make the Gallery as attractive as possible to the public.  I told him he would have the support of the Government in any scheme that may be put forward to improve the Gallery.  Any such scheme will receive earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>Seeing that a salary of £500 has been attached to the position at all times, it would be extraordinary if we should depart from it, without seeing how the appointment of the new Director is going to work out, and whether the board, as suggested, are going to put forward any schemes for the general improvement of the Gallery. Undoubtedly the amount of money given for the Gallery is inadequate. There is £1,000 a year for the purchase of pictures.  That has been the position since the Free State came into being.  It has not been the policy to buy modern pictures but to try to get Italian masters, and so on.  The work of getting modern pictures of the French school has been left largely to the smaller gallery in Parnell Square. These are matters that the board can go into.  While I can meet the board and make suggestions, as Deputy Cosgrave suggested, I cannot take, I fear, any other measures in these matters. I told the members of the board that if they had any schemes to improve the position generally these will have sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> As regards a teaching post, the Education Office believes very strongly that the teaching of art proper cannot be associated with the position of Director of the Gallery.  They believe that lecturing, perhaps, might be, but they are very doubtful if public lectures, if they are a series of art lectures by the Director of the Gallery, will do very much to awaken greater interest in art and in the institution. I suggested to the board's representatives when I met them that perhaps some arrangement might be made whereby the Director would be associated with one of the universities as a lecturer in art.  Nothing has come of that suggestion.  It was made, and if any such arrangement could be made it would be better, I think, than having a whole-time Director, whose sole duty would be in the Gallery, and in connection with the Gallery.  It would be much better, I think, if the Director had a teaching position in association with the universities. With regard to the pictures in the cellars, the present Director of the Gallery informs me that at the Titian Exhibition in Venice recently, which was held in a splendid palace, there was only one picture in each room. The modern tendency is to have only a small number of pictures in each room; not to have many pictures hanging together, so that each picture can be viewed individually without intrusion.  That is the tendency in the English and other galleries&mdash;to reduce the number of pictures on exhibition&mdash; and perhaps to change them from time to time, by giving an exhibition now of French pictures, and again an exhibition of some other school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The tendency is to reduce the number of pictures hanging in a gallery.  If local bodies throughout the country can assure the board that they will take responsibility and will take the necessary precautions, and if the board have sufficient confidence in them to lend them pictures temporarily, I am sure something could be done.  I know that it has been done <Col N="2119" /> in the case of Cork where there is a very good spirit in this matter.  With regard to other centres, so far as I know the question has never been tackled.  If anything is to be done in provincial centres the people there will have to stir themselves, form committees and put forward definite proposals. If the board is satisfied that the pictures will be quite safe and that any such scheme will be advantageous, I am sure there is no reason why it would not be considered.  I do not think I need say anything further.  I cannot agree that this matter of the salary should have been put before the Dáil before Dr. Furlong was appointed. The whole matter has been under consideration for very many years.  A suitable and proper applicant has been got for the post at the proper salary, and that is sufficient proof at any rate that we can get a Director at that salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points on which I confess I am not quite clear.  The Minister stated that he had got a satisfactory Director on the terms offered.  We do not know what the terms offered were, and that is the point I started with.  I think Deputies on both sides of the House were in agreement that there should not be dealing in pictures on the part of the Director.  I can well understand a man taking a salary of £200 a year, if he is allowed to deal in pictures, if that is one of the matters <Col N="2120" /> open to him to do.  Was it or was it not?  Surely that is quite as relevant, when we are discussing the terms of this office, as the actual amount of the salary.  We do not know that and, therefore, we do not know the terms on which Dr. Furlong was appointed. I, therefore, suggest to the Minister that if he finds there was anything in the terms on which Dr. Furlong was appointed, it be looked into, and, if necessary, a new arrangement come to &mdash;that the salary be increased and he be prevented from dealing in pictures.</P>
      <P>It is quite sufficient, and here I am in agreement with Deputy MacDermot, if there is an honourable undertaking on his part.  No matter what salary you pay any man in any position, Civil Service or otherwise, if he is dishonest and wants to break his agreement, he can undoubtedly make money on the sly.  I am quite satisfied that if it is one of the conditions of Dr. Furlong's appointment that he shall not deal in pictures, neither directly nor indirectly will he do so.  That is quite clear.  But if a prohibition from dealing in pictures was not one of the terms of his appointment, I think the Minister, when discussing this matter with the Governors of the National Gallery, should take up that point, and if there is such liberty to the new Director, that he be asked to give up that liberty in exchange for an adequate salary.  There is another point.  Is this a whole-time appointment or not? Perhaps the Minister could answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What else does he do or what else is he expected to do?  How else is he expected to supplement his income?  In the case of Dr. Bodkin, the Minister will agree that the position was different.  He got from the State a salary between two appointments and there was not the same reason why he, who was getting a double salary from the State, should be put on a level with a man who has merely this to live on, so far as we can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am mainly interested in is that if this is the man's sole salary, if he has no other means of livelihood, I do not see how you will avoid dealing in pictures, especially if it is any portion of his terms of appointment.  That is the point I raised in the beginning and it is the point I raise now.  I know that Dr. Bodkin's position was no sinecure, but how does the Minister intend that this half-time appointee will supplement his income?  Is it intended to offer him another position in the Civil Service?  Apparently not.  I am sorry the Minister took the position he took with regard to the guides.  I think that, as the suggestion has been put to the Minister, he should consider it with the Governors.  If there were guides there, it might be possible to stimulate interest on the part of the public, although not immediately, I admit.</P>

He was asked what was the recommendation of the Government with regard to this matter and he gave portion of the answer but not the whole of it.  That was an oversight on his part.

Yesterday Deputy Dillon gave intimation of his intention to raise <Col N="2123" /> certain matters in connection with the Order imposing a duty upon cotton thread which was made for the purpose of protecting the factory at Westport of the Irish Sewing Cotton Company.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has been informed by the Ceann Comhairle that, on the Fifth Stage of a Bill, discussion is confined to what is in the Bill and may not extend to matters which Deputies might desire to see in the Bill; secondly, that the Order dealing with thread covered by this Bill is Order No. 76, and, finally, that the Order imposing the Excise duty is Order No. 70, which is not covered by this measure, and, therefore, may not be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a submission on a point of order?  This confirming Bill is of a character unlike any other Bill that comes before this House.  By the original Imposition of Duties (Orders) Act, the Minister took power to impose, by order of the Executive Council a Customs or Excise duty.  These orders have eight months currency of their own quality and, if they are to be continued, must then come before Oireachtas Eireann for confirmation. When that Act was going through the House, that provision was pointed out by the Minister for Finance as a guarantee that no Executive act would be done which would not come up for review by Oireachtas Eireann and that, therefore, there was no necessity to lay these Orders on the Table under the 21-days rule.  According to the Minister, they would have only eight months currency and must come up for discussion and confirmation by the Oireachtas.  Order No. 70 was made by the Executive Council and duties were levied under it.  Three months after it was made, an omnibus confirmation Bill in respect of all outstanding Orders was introduced to this House and this Order No. 70 was the only one not included in the Bill.  Unless you, Sir, permit us to discuss its absence from the Bill and to question the Minister as to his reasons for omitting this Order from the Bill, a situation will be created <Col N="2124" /> in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance can levy a fine on any individual citizen and absolutely forbid the Oireachtas to discuss it.  The only occasion on which we can discuss it is on the occasion of a confirming Bill. Only you permitted us to challenge the Minister upon its absence, we would never have known what became of that Order, what was done under it or why he imposed it.  It was only because you permitted us under this Bill to inquire as to the absence of any reference to Order No. 70 that we were enabled to unearth what, in my opinion, was a grave public scandal.  Unless you permit us to discuss these matters on a Bill of this character, other public scandals of that kind can take place and the lips of Deputies will be sealed.</P>

It is well-established procedure that discussion on the Fifth Stage of a Bill is limited to what is in the Bill. The Deputy admits that an opportunity has already been afforded for raising this matter.  The Chair had doubts of its relevancy on that occasion.  Opportunities could be found by express motion or in discussing the Estimates of the Minister concerned, for raising the matter.  It may not be raised now.</P>

I have already objected, and I strongly object now, to the passing of this Bill.  I object as much on account of what is in the Bill as on account of what is not in it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of referring to Order 70.  Deputy Dillon has frequently referred to this matter on all sorts of appropriate and inappropriate occasions and, so far as I have been able to gather the sense of his remarks, he, apparently, objects to the Government having facilitated the Irish Sewing Cotton Company in the establishment of a factory at Westport because he thinks we should, instead, have facilitated Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats to establish a factory at Dublin. That point of view is so extraordinary that I should probably not be justified in wasting the time of the House in refuting it, but I am prompted to speak <Col N="2126" /> on this occasion because the firm of J. &amp; P. Coats have circulated to a number of people in this country a circular containing a number of extraordinary statements with which I think it is desirable to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desire of the Government that cotton thread should be manufactured in the Saorstát was expressed in many ways prior to 1934, and was, I think, well known to all interested parties. As a result of that expressed desire, my Department was approached in July, 1934, by certain prominent people in the town of Westport who had considered the question of establishing there a cotton thread factory and who had succeeded in interesting in their plans a firm called British Thread Mills, Ltd.&mdash;a very eminent and highly respectable firm at present manufacturing thread in Great Britain.  The representatives from Westport, accompanied by representatives of that company, put forward proposals for the establishment at Westport of a factory for the production of cotton thread. These proposals were the subject of negotiation between the representatives of my Department and the promoters of the enterprise in that month, as a result of which a scheme emerged for the establishment of the industry which, in our opinion, was quite satisfactory and which had many attractive features, the most attractive feature being that the factory was to be located at Westport.  We approved of that scheme and we gave an undertaking to the group who put it forward that, if they formed a company for that purpose, a certain measure of protection would be afforded and other reasonable facilities granted.  One of the major problems which obviously arose out of that scheme was this: because it had been decided in accordance with the expressed desire of the Government that the factory should be located at Westport, the firm there would obviously be placed at a considerable disadvantage if some other firm were subsequently allowed to engage in the same class of business at Dublin or some other similar centre. Because we desired to see that factory at Westport, and to afford employment in that part of the country, we not merely approved of the scheme as <Col N="2127" /> an industrial proposition, but we furthermore proposed to make sewing cotton a reserved commodity, so that the Government would have power to restrict the number of firms who might engage in the business, and particularly to ensure that the manufacture of sewing cotton would not be undertaken at Dublin, or some centre at which the competing firm would have obvious advantages over the pioneers of the industry located at Westport. For the purpose of protecting the industry, an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 40 per cent. on thread was imposed in September, 1934.  As, however, thread was not at that time being produced, licences for its importation were issued freely.</P>
    <P>After those negotiations had been concluded, but before the imposition of the duty had been effected, my Department was approached for the first time by a representative of Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats.  The chief director of that firm came to the Department merely for the purpose of inquiring as to the foundation for the rumours which had reached him that the manufacture of cotton sewing thread was to be undertaken in the Saorstát.  There was no proposal put forward by him or on behalf of his company at that time that they should engage in that industry, but, having got information that the manufacture of thread was likely to be embarked upon, that firm, on their own admission, proceeded to bring as rapidly as they could large quantities of thread into this country.  There was no legal objection to their doing that; it has happened before, and will no doubt happen again, but there was this peculiarity about the transaction in which that firm engaged, that the thread which they brought in was not offered for sale, and it has not been sold yet. It is still in store in Dublin, and when the duty was imposed in September, 1934, by a particular device&mdash;the device of consigning thread as ply yarns and not as thread&mdash;a further large quantity of thread was imported by that firm, and again stored in Dublin, until the inadequacy of the definition in the original Order was made good in the Finance Act of 1935 by the imposition of a similar duty on ply yarns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> Deputy Dillon stated here that Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats were willing to undertake the manufacture of thread in the Saorstát.  I want to discuss that statement from two angles. Firstly, I want to say that there was no proposal from that firm to undertake the manufacture of thread here until the Irish Sewing Cotton Company had been formed, and the erection of the factory at Westport had been commenced.  The Irish Sewing Cotton Company was incorporated on 2nd November, 1934.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On 18th October, 1934, we received the first written communication from Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats &mdash;a letter which contained the suggestion that the firm might be interested in the manufacture of thread here, but in which it was stated that they were not in a position to put forward any proposition to that effect, and indicated that they did not know whether the manufacture of thread here would be an economic proposition.  There was no further approach from the firm until the proposal to make sewing cotton a reserved commodity had been published, and objections to that proposal invited.  An objection was received from Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats, and later, on the 13th October, 1935, the firm applied for a licence to manufacture sewing cotton here&mdash;an application which was refused.  It is true that the Irish Linen Thread Company, a firm which is engaged in the production of linen thread at Dublin, in putting forward an objection to the Reserve Commodity Order proposal, stated that they had been in consultation for some time with Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who they stated were, subject to the completion of their inquiries, prepared to collaborate with them in the making of sewing cotton in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Minister get that communication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13th June, 1935, after the factory at Westport had been <Col N="2129" /> built, after the duty had been in operation for eight months, and after the Irish Sewing Cotton Company had undertaken all the capital expenditure involved in the erection of the factory at Westport.  That letter did not contain any firm proposal to undertake the manufacture of thread here.  I informed that company then that they would be much better employed completing the undertakings they had given with respect to the production of linen thread, rather than in considering possible extensions of their activities, and that is still the case.  Those statements of mine, which give the facts, deal with one aspect of Deputy Dillon's statement, but the other aspect has still to be dealt with, and it is the most inexplicable aspect of all.  Why should we give a preference to the firm of Messrs. J. &amp; P. Coats for the manufacture of thread in Dublin, rather than to the Irish Sewing Cotton Company for the manufacture of thread in Westport?  Deputy Dillon's contention is that we should have given them a preference, and I know of no reason why that suggestion should be entertained. The firm which is engaged in this business at Westport is a firm which has behind it first-class technical knowledge.  The company is associated with a British company of very high reputation.  It is manufacturing that thread on a scheme of production which is quite satisfactory to us, but particularly it is manufacturing it at Westport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is not manufacturing one inch of thread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will be allowed to speak without those interruptions from Deputy Dillon.  It is manufacturing that thread at Westport on that scheme of production of which we have approved, and, in my opinion, it is much more desirable that that industry should be located there than that it should be located at Dublin. I know that Deputy Dillon is proposing to make some point that the firm is not yet doing all the processes of manufacturing. That is so.  It was never proposed to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it should immediately undertake all the processes of manufacture.  As I have said, a definite scheme of production was discussed and agreed with the firm, under which additional processes would be undertaken at various stages, spread over a period of time.  So far as I am aware, that scheme of production has been adhered to by the firm.  There is another consideration, however, which it is necessary to bear in mind in this connection; even if we would have been justified in telling the firm which had come first with its thread proposition, and which had formed a company and built a factory, that, because subsequently we had got another proposal from another firm, they were to be wiped out and the other firm encouraged to proceed, we would have good grounds for not doing so because we distrusted the bona fides of the second firm.  That distrust arose out of the fact that the firm had engaged in this device of bringing in large stocks of thread, which stocks are still in store in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have said here before, that if anybody tries to purchase that thread they cannot do it.  That thread was not brought in in the ordinary course of commercial business.  It was not brought in for the purpose, as the firm contend in their circular, of ensuring that their customers would be facilitated by having stocks available for them after the duty was imposed, because the stocks were not available. When, after the duty was imposed, customers went to purchase some of the stocks, they were refused supplies from these stocks and told to apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce for licence to import additional supplies.  The menace to the Irish industry at Westport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, customers were refused and are still being refused any opportunity of purchasing these stocks.  The menace which the existence of these stocks in Dublin constituted to the factory at Westport is something which we endeavoured to deal with by another method which is not in order to discuss now, and I do not propose to discuss it.  I refer to it merely to indicate that it gave us good grounds for distrusting the <i>bona fides</i> of the firm which pretended to be interested in the possibility of engaging in this industry here although they had put up no proposals to do so, and although they had shown no interest in the matter, until the scheme for the production of these goods had in fact been approved and was being acted upon. The business is not of very great importance.  Its importance arises from the fact that it is necessary to indicate clearly to all parties, who might have similar ideas in relation to future industrial propositions, that the Government's aim to secure industrial development here will not be allowed to be defeated by any combine, such as this Coats combine, using its resources for the purpose of destroying the market which an Irish factory might regard as its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the issue of licences for the importation of cotton thread.  I stated that, when the duty was first imposed licences were freely issued, and continued to be issued, except during the short period in which we attempted to compel this company to disgorge its stocks without success.  They are still being issued.  At the present time, as I explained to the Dáil before, licences are being issued direct to manufacturers requiring thread for manufacturing purposes.  We were issuing licences similarly to retailers, but we were approached by the Drapers' Chamber of Trade which urged on us the advisability, in their interests, of issuing licences for the importation of thread for the retail trade only to the Westport company. I indicated that there were objections to that device from our point of view but, on the strong representations of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade we <Col N="2132" /> adopted that scheme temporarily. They have stated that it is working very satisfactorily from their point of view, but there are reasons which may make it necessary for us, from our point of view, to drop it again.</P>
    <P>There was for a long time no complaint received from any responsible quarter concerning the operation of this Customs duty or the manner in which the licence provision was being applied.  Some complaints have been received recently and a conference between the parties concerned and representatives of the manufacturing company is being arranged.  These complaints relate more to matters of price than to other matters.  So far as the price is concerned, the company at Westport is operating under a licence, one of the conditions of which is that the price charged ex-factory at Westport will not exceed, quality for quality, and in like conditions of sale, the price charged for thread produced by the British Thread Mills at Leicester.  That is a condition of the licence of the company at Westport, and if that condition is not observed the whole licence can be revoked.  It has not, however, yet been demonstrated that that condition has been broken, but if it is broken I agree that there is a new situation.  Up to the present, however, apart from the few complaints to which I have referred, the only evidence we have had is that supplied by the Chamber of Trade who testified that the price at which thread was being supplied from Westport did not exceed the price charged by Coats for similar thread and that, in many respects, the quality was better.</P>
    <P>This matter has got an undue amount of publicity mainly because of the rather stupid allegations which Deputy Dillon thought fit to make.  I have given the facts now because I know he has not got the facts already from any responsible quarter.  I have given him facts now which he is learning for the first time and which will perhaps induce him to admit that there is no foundation whatever for the allegations he made, and that, on grounds of policy, on the grounds of establishing at Westport, rather than in Dublin, a <Col N="2133" /> factory for the manufacture of thread, on the grounds of dealing with the very reputable firm which put up that proposal and which had backed that proposal with their capital, rather than with another firm which came along subsequently and reluctantly, I think the Government can justify itself beyond question.  I move that the Bill do now pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This proceeding, Sir, is a seedy transaction, a transaction which reflects unfavourably on the Government and on the Minister responsible for it.  Fortunately, we have been able to drag it into the light of day, and the castigation which the Minister has received will, I hope, secure the State against a repetition of underhand activities of this kind in future.  The Minister ought to have been warned when he was at last dragged into the light of day, but he has proceeded to mend his hand. As reported in column 1617 of the Official Report of the Debates, I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has stated that J. &amp; P. Coats were proposing to paralyse the Irish industry and that they sought to prevent its development&mdash;that is the allegation&mdash;and in order to prevent it they imported these huge quantities of thread.  Far from that being true, they had an option on a premises in Dublin where they offered to spin, dye and reel thread&mdash;an Irish company which would be controlled by Irish nationals on the board of which there would be a majority of Irish nationals.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: To whom did they offer it?</P>

      <P>I took down the Minister's words to-day.  In July, 1934, Westport approached him.  In October, 1934, Messrs. J. and P. Coats approached him.</P>

      <P>These words are clearly meant to convey to Deputies that Messrs. Coats never opened the question with the Minister until the factory at Westport had been constructed, and then, with nothing in their minds but to sabotage that industry and destroy it, they opened negotiations.  That is what the Minister said on 28th November.  Now he is warned that he is being dragged out of the rat hole, and here is what he says on 6th December:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" />&ldquo;Messrs. Coats came to me in October, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish Sewing Cotton Thread Company was not incorporated until November, 1934; not a brick had been laid upon a brick in Westport; no company was incorporated.  The group which had approached him on behalf of Westport had no legal existence at the time Messrs. Coats first approached him.  That is the exact reversal of what the Minister said in this House on November 28th, when he thought I did not know the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the Minister had no good ground for penalising Messrs. Coats on the allegation that they sought to sabotage or destroy an Irish industry or that they sought to upset any policy decided upon by the legitimately-elected Government of the country.  Far from that being true, when Messrs. Coats discovered that it was the policy of the Government to manufacture thread in this country they came to the Government and said: &ldquo;We have been dealing in thread for 70 years in Ireland; 10,000 of our shareholders are citizens of Saorstát Eireann; every distributor of thread and every manufacturer who uses thread in Saorstát Eireann is a customer of ours; we have had trade relations with everyone of them since they started; we are anxious to maintain that business connection and we are prepared to come to Ireland, set up a factory, twist, dye and manufacture thread...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Minister will allow me to finish the sentence I will tell him: &ldquo;We are prepared to twist, dye, manufacture, reel and distribute thread.&rdquo;  The Minister's reply was: &ldquo;No, we will not let you manufacture any thread in this country, because we have made it a reserved commodity for Westport, where thread is going to be manufactured.&rdquo;  I want this House to understand that not one yard, one foot, or one inch of thread has been manufactured in Westport to this day.  Every yard of thread sold in this country at present is being manufactured in Great Britain, brought in under licence by the Westport Thread Company and put on reels in Westport.  That is the only manufacturing process being carried on there, save, perhaps, that I think a little dyeing of thread may be done.  There is no manufacture of thread, good, bad or indifferent, going on at Westport at present.  I doubt if they even make the wooden reels on which the thread is put, but that I cannot vouch for. Messrs. Coats had a long business connection with this country and never did anything deserving of any censure or attack by the Government of the country.  Messrs. Coats were associated in their approach to the Government with a body of businessmen whom the Government ought to think very highly of; some of the foremost men in Irish Industry at present. They were prepared to do all the operations of thread spinning in this country if given the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You say Messrs. Coats proposed to establish the industry here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say they first approached the Minister and showed an interest in the manufacture of thread in this country which the Minister denied the existence of at column 1618 of the Official Report of November 28th.  In justification of the Minister's attitude towards this firm, he alleged that they had accumulated in this country an enormous stock of thread, which he foresaw was going to be used for the purpose of crippling the Westport industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts?  This thread was imported into this country prior to the 31st July, 1935.  At the present time, four months after that thread was imported, the Minister is issuing licences freely for the importation of cotton thread because the Westport Company cannot produce the supply of thread that is required.  The Minister says that Coats have £30,000 of thread in a store here.  I do not know how much they have, but I know that since July last there has been used in this country £60,000 to £70,000 worth of thread.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that that amount of <Col N="2139" /> thread has been imported since July last.  At the present moment thread is passing into use in this country which has been brought in free of duty just the same as the thread of J. and P. Coats.</P>
    <P>The Minister advanced another justification for his spleen against this firm.  He says they brought in the thread by a subterfuge.  Anyone listening to the Minister would imagine that they brought in the thread and declared it as something which it was not.  The truth is that they brought a parcel of merchandise to the Custom House at the North Wall.  From that parcel they extracted a sample and sent it to the State analyst and said: &ldquo;Here is a sample of merchandise that we have in the Custom House; please examine it; refer to the schedule of dutiable goods and see whether this is dutiable or not.&rdquo;  The State analyst analysed the sample and returned a certificate that the product was not dutiable and it was then imported into the country. The Minister says that was a dark conspiracy. I say that J. and P. Coats could not have paid duty on that thread and the Revenue Commissioners could not have collected on it.  It was not liable to duty.  The Minister may have said: &ldquo;I meant to make it liable to duty but I forgot.&rdquo;  If the Minister forgot or if he was so incompetent that he was not able to make it liable to duty how could any importer pay the duty which the law did not require him to pay?</P>
    <P>If you want to make a Grant-in-Aid to this country you must make it through the Minister for Finance.  The Board of Revenue Commissioners have no statutory power to accept gifts, and if J. and P. Coats wanted to make a grant-in-aid to the Revenue Commissioners no method was open to them except to go and ask the Minister for Finance would he accept from them a certain sum of money towards the national debt.  Then they would have to get an acknowledgment from the Minister for Finance that he gratefully accepted from an anonymous donor this grant-in-aid.  That was the only way in which J. and P. Coats <Col N="2140" /> could pay the duty which the Minister says they were allowed to escape by a subterfuge.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister proceeded to deal with the matter of the Westport company. There is no particular case to be made against Westport that could not be made against any factory. Westport is not perfect.  All that Westport is undertaking to do is to put the thread on reels.  That is all they are doing now and they are not doing it very well.  It does not make very much difference, so long as the thread is put on the reels at all, whether it is put on neatly or untidily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sick and tired of hearing that phrase from the Minister, but when I rub his nose in the mud we get the facts.  The Minister told me last week that I was entirely misinformed. This morning, on this Bill, he admits that it was he who was misinformed&mdash;that he was quite wrong in what he said last week.  However, the Minister will have an opportunity when winding up the debate of saying what he wants to say.  The Westport company are putting the thread on the reels all right and there is no complaint in that respect.  But it is ludicrous to say that the prices charged by the Westport company are as low as the Paisley prices.  I do not know what the prices at Leicester are but I know that the English Cotton Thread Company never sold any thread in this country.  They may have sold an infinitesimal quantity of thread but they were always looked upon as a second-rate firm compared with Coats or Clarkes, the two leading cotton manufacturers in England.  This is a firm with a tiny output of restricted trade and it has always been second-grade.  They are at present&mdash;and if the Minister takes the <Col N="2141" /> slightest trouble to find out the facts he will find that this is so&mdash;about 3d. per gross dearer for ordinary sewing cotton than Coats of Paisley.  I am informed by manufacturers that their prices are very substantially higher even, but of that fact I have no personal knowledge.  But if there is a condition in their licence that, quality for quality, their prices are identical with those obtaining ex-factory at Paisley, they are not carrying out the terms of their licence.  They are getting more money and charging a higher price than Paisley.</P>
      <P>If the Drapers' Chamber of Trade have said that their prices were no dearer than Coats' prices then the Drapers' Chamber of Trade is out of its mind, because from any invoice they can find the facts.  The Drapers' Chamber of Trade represent a certain body of traders, but there is a very large body of traders in this country who are not represented by the Drapers' Chamber of Trade.  I am amazed to hear that the Drapers' Chamber of Trade asked the Minister to allow imports of thread by licence only to the Westport factory.  I regard that as a most unjust arrangement. I submit that if licences are to be issued for the free importation of thread, these licences ought to be obtainable by anybody who in the past was engaged in the importation of thread.  To force people to buy from one individual is most unfair and inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, Sir, I have made it pretty clear that this transaction is an extremely disreputable one.  It was a transaction into which the light ought be let and which should then cease. I can only express the hope that in the future similar transactions will not take place.  I submit to the Minister that it has been a very good thing that these machinations should have been exposed to the light of day.  I submit to the Minister that a great many people in the commercial life of this country take the view that the whole licensing system which is sought to be implemented by this Bill is of the same seedy character as this transaction.  Merchants are agreed <Col N="2142" /> that these questionable and undesirable elements in the licensing system can be removed by full publicity being thrown on them.  No honest merchant who is conducting his business straightforwardly can object to the particulars of any licence which he gets for the free importation of goods being made public even though only to a restricted public.  I, therefore, urge upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce to open a register in which every licence to import goods free of duty shall be entered with the full particulars set out.  If any merchant comes to him and says &ldquo;I want a licence to import something free of duty, but I do not want it published in the register,&rdquo; the Minister will have the support of every side of this House if he says to such an applicant: &ldquo;Then you will have to do without your licence; the thing will have to be open and above board or it will not take place at all.&rdquo;  A very great evil can be abated if the Minister will adopt this course.  Inevitably the most undesirable developments are going to come about unless he does adopt this course.  For the sake of the country as a whole, and for the sake of the Government, I urge on him most strongly to put an end to the public unrest and the deep-rooted conviction in the minds of many businessmen that the existing licensing system is highly undesirable and is demoralising the public life of the country. By opening a register on the lines which I suggest it will put an end to it.  It involves the Government in no liability and involves no straightforward businessman in any disadvantage. It will tend to cleanse and purify something that threatens to become a most malodorous scandal in the public life of the country.  I leave the general issue to those who will come after me, but I am really glad to have this opportunity of vindicating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The larger part of the stock now held on our behalf in Dublin was imported prior to the imposition of the duty, and the balance after specimens had been submitted to the State analyst and passed as free of duty.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister I have a responsible body of traders who are of the opinion that as long as the present system continues the Minister will not be able to allay unrest.  It was a responsible trader in this city who, a short time ago, approached me on this subject and put forward the suggestion that the only way to allay the unrest that prevails amongst traders is to have a register such as has been suggested by Deputy Dillon.  I can assure the Minister that the suggestion of a register did come from a responsible trader.  Other traders may object to it on the grounds of publicity, but, as we are committed to a licensing system, it must be for the Minister a choice between two evils.  I think the present system inevitably will lead, must lead, to a tendency towards abuse and you must correct that as well as you can.  I can understand why there should be an objection on the part of some traders to publicity, but you will have to choose between the greater and the lesser evil.  It was a very responsible trader in this city who approached me and suggested there should be a register available for traders to see on the payment of a fee.  I ask the House to consider whether it is not time that this particular method of dealing with duties should be scrapped.</P>

I am suggesting, as a reason for the Dáil not passing the Fifth Stage of this Bill, that the time has come, as a result of the experience they have had of the operation of the Act of 1932, for some of the promises then made in order to induce the House to pass it, to be redeemed.  This Act was brought in for one particular purpose and in a particular atmosphere.  It is not being used for that purpose.  The House was induced to pass the Act to meet a certain situation, but it is not being used to deal with that situation.</P>
      <P>We had last night the performance of the Minister for Finance, giving a number of quotations that were quite irrelevant.  We had the statements of Ministers given in approval of what the law was.  I put it to the House that when the Government induced the Dáil to pass an Act for a certain purpose, when they induced the House to pass it on the grounds of certain arguments, and now when this Act is being used for quite another purpose, then the House should not pass the Fifth Stage of this Bill which is based on that Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon used a number of adjectives&mdash;&ldquo;malodorous,&rdquo;&ldquo;scandalous,&rdquo;&ldquo;corrupt,&rdquo; and so-forth. That was according to his usual tactics.  Whenever he has a bad case he increases the number of his adjectives.  Whenever he has a case to argue he uses few adjectives.  We are learning, from long experience, that the more adjectives he uses the clearer it is that he has no case to put forward.  But there is something &ldquo;malodorous&rdquo;&mdash;that is one of his adjectives&mdash;about this matter.  It is, I think, a shocking state of affairs that we should have a Deputy who is a leader of one of the responsible Parties in this House, using his position here in order to slander an Irish industry, and to endeavour to prevent the development of that industry, and doing so on a brief supplied to him by a British combine whose main purpose, in this matter, is to prevent that Irish industry developing.  Most of Deputy Dillon's statements of fact were wrong.  I gave, as fully as time permitted, a history of the circumstances that led up to the present position, in my opening statement.  Deputy Dillon <Col N="2148" /> chooses to ignore what I said, and started with a misconception or misrepresentation of the facts.  He has no authority whatever from any of the parties concerned, except Coats, for any of the allegations he has made.  I am still at a loss to understand what is his purpose, if he has any purpose, if not to sabotage the Westport industry.</P>
      <P>What is the attitude of the Party opposite on this question as to whether the industry should be located at Westport or Dublin?  Even if Coats were first in the field, and came on with a detailed proposition, which they never produced, even if they were otherwise not under suspicion in my Department, we would, nevertheless, be justified in rejecting them, and accepting the proposition of the Irish Sewing-Cotton Company because they were prepared to locate their factory in Westport.  But that was not the position.  Messrs. Coats were not the first in the field.  They have not, up to this, put up a proposal, or a detailed proposition, for the establishment of a factory here.  The negotiations with the Westport group took place in July, 1934; the duty was imposed in September, 1934, and, in October, 1934, because of that duty in operation, Messrs. Coats wrote to the Department. In that letter they stated they were not in a position to put up a proposition, and they only asked for certain information to investigate the matter. We heard nothing further from them until June, 1935, when they wrote their objection to the making of sewing cotton a reserved commodity.  Even then they put forward no proposition for the establishment of the industry here.  They merely showed their willingness to investigate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meantime the Westport company was formed and was acquired; its factory was built, and workers were sent to England to be trained.  The Irish Linen Thread Company did not put forward any proposal for the establishment of this industry.  They indicated that they had been considering the extension of their activities to cover cotton thread.  They stated not in the form of a proposition to the Department, but in the form of a <Col N="2149" /> memorandum, their objection to the reserve commodity.  They submitted it to the Secretary of the Executive Council and stated that they had been for some months in touch with Messrs. Coats, who were, subject to the completion of their inquiry, prepared to collaborate with them, in the matter of providing technical assistance, if the Linen Thread Company should decide to proceed with the extension of their activities.  But even in that memorandum they indicated that they had not come to a firm conclusion as to whether it would be an economic proposition for them or not.</P>
    <P>We were to shut down the factory at Westport, to call back from England the workers who were sent to be trained there, to liquidate this company formed to establish a factory at Westport, in order that we might get the possible extension of a Dublin factory by a company formed for another purpose&mdash;and which had not completed that purpose&mdash; in collaboration with Messrs. Coats.  I think the whole thing is ridiculous, and the effort to give it substance by adding malodorous adjectives is merely typical of Deputy Dillon and does not improve his case in any way.</P>
    <P>So far as the factory at Westport is concerned, it was established with the clear recognition of the fact that time was necessary in order to train workers, and that it would not be possible for them to go into the whole process of manufacture at the start. Workers were sent to England to be trained.  On that basis the business was commenced in the factory, and other workers were sent to undergo training in Great Britain.  In accordance with plan, the approved process in the factory was extended and approach is made to a point in which complete manufacture will be undertaken.  There are some 50 workers now employed there, and to suggest that they are employed in merely putting imported thread upon reels is nonsense.  Deputy Dillon made the statement without the slightest justification.  Even Messrs. Coats in their circular&mdash;the brief from which Deputy Dillon spoke&mdash;did not make that allegation.  I am quite certain <Col N="2150" /> that he made no inquiries from any source&mdash;either from the Westport factory, from the central agency in Dublin, whose interests he is so concerned about, from the Irish Thread Company, to which he referred, or from any other source, before he made that statement.  That statement was the product of his own mind, and he made it with no other intention except to damage and do as much harm as he could to the factory in Westport, in the apparent belief that, in some way, in damaging that concern he would be helping the interests of his own Party. I am sure that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney does not agree with him.</P>
    <P>All this talk about dragging me into the light of day, and all the rest of it, is merely typical of Deputy Dillon's technique in covering up a bad case.  There was at no time any hesitation on my part to give all the facts in the matter to the Dáil.  On every occasion it was raised here&mdash; even when it was out of order&mdash;I gave these facts, and the facts have been consistent throughout.  The attempt to contend that there is any difference between what I stated to-day and what I stated on an earlier occasion, is quite fruitless.  Messrs. Coats made no proposal at any time to the Department to establish a factory for the manufacture of cotton thread here. They indicated, after the duty had been imposed, after the negotiations with the Westport factory had been completed, an interest in the matter, but stated definitely that they were not putting up a proposition.  They indicated an intention of doing so in June of 1935 after the Westport factory had been built.</P>

      <P>I stated here, when the Reserve Commodities Order was being discussed, the reason why we were going to refuse any such application <Col N="2151" /> for a licence: Because this factory is being established in Westport and because we want to keep it there and not allow it to be transferred up to Dublin.  I think that is a perfectly good reason for refusing a licence to any company to establish a competing factory here in the Capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more that I want to say in the matter.  I hope we will have fewer attempts on the part of Deputies opposite to make these vague allegations of corrupt practices and abuses unsupported by any evidence. Deputy O'Sullivan stated that there were abuses in the matter of issuing licences for the importation of dutiable goods.  I want evidence of these abuses, or the assertion that <Col N="2152" /> they exist, supported by some responsible body of traders in this country. I agree, as I have said before, that individual traders will complain that they did not get a licence when they thought they should have got it, or individual traders will complain that they did not receive sufficient licence for the quantities they wanted.  These complaints are inevitable, but they are no proof or evidence of abuse, and it is abuses that are alleged to exist.  I want these allegations withdrawn altogether, or else that they should be supported by evidence of some kind.  If, in fact, the allegation is repeated here, I may be compelled to give Deputies opposite an opportunity of producing the evidence, if any, upon which they base the contention.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Department of Agriculture should run several farms in each county under the direction and supervision of its agricultural instructors, independent of all other activities, on which decent wages would be paid, accounts kept and audited, balance sheets published with appropriate explanations of costings, profits, etc., for the purpose of demonstrating to farmers in a practical way how to make their industry pay.&mdash;(Deputies Patrick McGovern and T.J. O'Donovan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We had Deputies during the morning picturing the ruin of the farmers of the country, the bankruptcy of the country, and all the rest of it.  Some of them, particularly Deputy Dillon, were very hard at work endeavouring to prove the prosperity of the farmers by proposing to increase one official's salary from £500 to £1,000 a year, on the plea that a man cannot live in this country on £500 a year, and in order to do so must, apparently, get £1,000 a year.  The farmers, according to those Deputies, are so prosperous that they can afford to double his salary. It is rather a change from all that to come back to Deputy McGovern's motion.  I had an opportunity yesterday of reading the speech that the Deputy made when proposing this motion to the House.  I came across this amazing statement in his speech:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been living in a district for 25 years and an agricultural instructor was only once invited to lecture since I went there, and I was responsible for having him invited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern has been a farmer living, apparently, on some kind of a farm for 25 years, and during all that time an agricultural instructor was invited only once to that district, and the invitation to the instructor came from the Deputy himself.  I understand that Deputy McGovern is living in a district in which there are two instructors, one supplied by the county committee of agriculture, and the other is supplied under the old Congested Districts Board, a man who operates in three parishes in that district.  During the whole of that period, they never troubled to get the free advice which these two men could give.  These two instructors are definitely supplied to give free advice to Deputy McGovern and to the other people who live there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can believe all that I hear, the Deputy could not even grow spuds because he would set them upside down.  The Deputy, on a previous occasion in this House when the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture was before us, attacked the county instructor, and, I understand, when he returned to his district he had to apologise to the instructor and to the county committee of agriculture for the attack that he made here.  The point that I want to make on this motion is this: that the county committee of agriculture will, on application from any district, supply demonstration plots, whether these be for the growing of wheat, beet, mangolds, or any other agricultural product.  I believe it would be useful if Deputy McGovern applied to have a demonstration plot on his farm to show him how potatoes should be grown.  The county committee of <Col N="2155" /> agriculture, on application being made, also arranges to give demonstrations free on the feeding of pigs in the farmer's own yard.  In spite of all that, Deputy McGovern wants to have these agricultural instructors taken away from the work that they are doing at present and put into farms.  I have not observed that any of the Deputies opposite have, so far, offered their farms to be used as demonstration farms so as to have farming carried out according to their ideas.  I put forward one suggestion when I spoke on this motion previously, by which backward Deputies and their followers could be shown how to farm without taking the services of the county instructors from go-ahead farmers who availed of their instruction, not once in 25 years, as Deputy McGovern admitted, but every year and every month.  On that occasion I suggested that these Deputies should be apprenticed to farmers like myself, who would take their training in hand.  I hoped yesterday to have a communication from Deputy Dillon, volunteering to go down to a modern farm in County Cork, seeing that I gave him a guarantee that I would turn him out, after five years, at least as a passable agricultural labourer.  Unfortunately, the Deputy has not shown an inclination to avail of that proposal.  Instead, he comes in here and, in the usual extravagant terms that he uses about the Minister for Agriculture, lets his brain-box wheel around like the reel of thread that he spent the last hour telling us about, going round and round in many different directions.  The Deputy's speech on the last occasion led us into the belief that he was in a maze and could not get out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that any Deputy on the opposite benches who requires to have a demonstration on his farm of any particular crop can arrange for it without any trouble, by communicating with the county committee of agriculture, which would place an instructor at his disposal for that purpose.  If Deputies are not satisfied with that, my offer is still open.  I met many Deputies on this side of the House yesterday who offered to take in these apprentices and to teach them how to <Col N="2156" /> farm successfully.  Deputy Gibbons offers to take one on his farm.  It is the same all round.  Of course, these Deputies pointed out&mdash;and I think they are correct&mdash;that those who speak so fluently about farming here would not be worth their board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy O'Leary that I made no such insinuation. There is an alternative to the suggestion that I put forward, and that is, if any of these people are prepared to hand over their land and to take in capable young men, the sons of small farmers who are able and willing to teach them, I am sure the owners will not object to paying them a decent living wage.  These men will take on the farms for five years and will return them in good heart.  They are not dreaming about Columcille, but are prepared to work and to take advantage of the services of the county instructors&mdash;not like Deputy McGovern to bring them in once in 25 years. That was the Deputy's admission.  It is no wonder that the farmers in the <Col N="2157" /> Deputy's district know little about farming if he can be taken as an example of what the others do.  I hope he is not.  Deputy McGovern's outlook becomes more hopeless every day. It speaks badly for his intelligence when he put down such a motion. Deputies opposite have made no bones about this question.  On Deputy Belton's admission these demonstration farms when under the control of the late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, were losing on an average £4,000 yearly.  According to these Deputies, the farmers are ruined and can make no money from land.  Yet this is the time Deputy McGovern comes along with an idiotic motion asking to have several demonstration farms set up in every county.  I do not suppose it would satisfy the Deputy if eight demonstration farms were set up.  He would never admit that the present Minister for Agriculture could run them as economically or as successfully as his predecessor.  The loss of £4,000 on the other farms had to be borne by the farmers.  Deputy McGovern comes along and seriously asks the House to set up these farms.  In my view he is wasting the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy started out by explaining that he would tell the instructors what was to be grown on the farms and how they were to be worked. Apparently the instructors would not be allowed, even if the Minister was foolish enough to give way to the proposal, to proceed in their own way. Deputy McGovern and his friends could come along and say: &ldquo;You must not do anything on this farm except what I tell you.  You must not put any stock on it except three-year-old bullocks, and you are to show how these bullocks can be made to pay.&rdquo;  The instructors were to be allowed to grow only a percentage of crops.  Even if demonstration farms were set up, it was not the instructors who were to farm them but Deputy McGovern and other Deputies of the same opinion, who cannot make a success of their farms.  Any unfortunate instructor put on one of these farms for four or five years was to be under the control of Deputy McGovern and his friends.  We know the kind of farm it would be at <Col N="2158" /> the end of the five years, and we know the kind of instruction that would be given.  Could there be anything more ridiculous than that kind of farming? The proposal is useless and nonsensical and I am very much afraid of my offer to send capable young men to particular farms in Deputy McGovern's county to show them how to farm.</P>

When those men would want to get up in the morning to milk the cows and to start work, Deputy McGovern would say: &ldquo;We never milk the cows here before 12 o'clock; it is early enough to get up when the sun shines in and wakes you.&rdquo;  These fellows would come back to us worse than Deputy McGovern, and I am afraid that would be no remedy.  I would, however, seriously suggest, as the only remedy for putting an end to the humbug that has been going on here, and the trash that has been going on here, that those Deputies should be apprenticed out to good farmers like me who would teach them how to work and to farm.  I can assure them that after a period they will work all right.</P>

      <P>We appreciate ignorance when we see it.  I appreciate also the heat and hatred which any idea of work instils into some Deputies.  They get very sore when they hear any suggestion made that they should work, even on farms. We hear Deputy Dillon, with all his sanctimonious expression of beautiful adjectives, in the use of which he is a master, talking about the Minister for Agriculture, the miserable Minister for Agriculture and all the rest of it.  So far as I can gather, the Deputy does all his farming in a flower box in a certain window in the city.  He regards himself as an authority on farming as on everything under the sun.  He is an authority on maize meal, on corrugated iron and corrugated buckets and I do not know how many other things.  I suggest that the Deputy instead of being a jack of all trades and master of none would be very well advised to accept my suggestion and come down with me and learn one trade first.  I can assure him that, after his five years term with me, he would be able to speak in this House with some authority on farming and how to manage farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to other Deputies here.  They not alone refused definitely to carry out any of the new agricultural policy that was proposed, but <Col N="2160" /> they initiated a campaign throughout the country to prevent others carrying it out.  We have one instance of it here as put forward by Deputy Belton. I can understand Deputies having an objection to wheat, which Deputy Belton assures us reduces the fertility of the soil, but the very same Deputies come along and object to beet.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In Germany, the value of the land went up in the areas where beet had been cultivated for years, not because of the money return that could be got out of the land there, but because of the improved condition of the land itself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still, down in my county, we had an organisation&mdash;I will not call it a <Col N="2161" /> farmers' organisation; I do not know what it did call itself at that period&mdash; travelling around from house to house, after men who were endeavouring to get a beet acreage, collecting contract forms from the farmers and burning them, and warning farmers that if they grew beet it would ruin them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I brought it in is that Deputy McGovern, in his statement here, commenced by telling the agricultural instructors on these demonstration farms what they were to grow there.  They were going to be allowed to grow only 5 per cent. of wheat and so on, and I am demonstrating that agricultural instructors could not possibly work a demonstration farm under those conditions.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that there are two alternatives to this motion.  I should be anxious to get Deputy McGovern or Deputy Dillon into the apprenticeship scheme.  I think that would be the better scheme and Deputy Dillon, after four or five years on a good tillage farm in County Cork, would learn to get up early and work and would have an entirely changed view on every subject when he would come into this House.  I cannot imagine Deputy Dillon, a hard worker on a farm, coming in here and occupying two hours in demanding an increase of salary of from £500 to £1,000 per year for some gentleman in the School of <Col N="2162" /> Art.  I cannot imagine a Deputy Dillon who had been down working on beet and wheat on my farm coming up and advocating that.  If Deputy Belton can visualise Deputy Dillon out milking the cows in the morning and working hard every day and, after that experience for five or six years, with the profits that would be gained from that class of work, coming in and seriously advocating a 100 per cent. increase in salary, he can do more than I can.  I believe the experience he would gain as an apprentice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sticking as closely as possible to it.  It is very hard to stick to such a motion.  The Ceann Comhairle will realise that.  This motion would curtail the activities of instructors whose services the ratepayers are entitled to have.  If I were to send down for one of these instructors, it would be very little satisfaction to me to learn that he was with some leather-headed farmer working a farm which the farmer himself did not know how to work.  The demonstrations which these agricultural instructors could give are already fully given on the demonstration plots.  Their advice is available there at any time.  In view of the enormous cost of this proposal and in view of what I consider more&mdash; the curtailment of the activities of the agricultural instructors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was the interest he took in his fellow-farmers around him, although he was, apparently, a leading man in the district.</P>

This motion should never have been brought in.  If Deputies on the opposite side had any sense of responsibility, they would not bring in a motion of this description.  No Deputy with a sense of responsibility who read the motion would sign it.  Yet we have Deputies, like Deputy Dillon, getting up and supporting it.  I cannot imagine what their reason was for putting down this motion.  I notice that explanations of costings are to be given.  An agricultural instructor working on one of these demonstration farms would, when he would get up in the morning, have Deputy McGovern coming down and warning him that he must only grow <Col N="2164" /> one acre of wheat, that he is not allowed to grow any more.  I shall quote Deputy McGovern:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this country we have 12,000,000 acres of arable land and 600,000 acres of wheat will supply all our needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern never heard of such a thing as rotation of crops.  It is not practised in the district where they have not seen an agricultural instructor, according to himself, for 25 years.  He started by telling us that the Department expert would be entitled to grow wheat for the purpose of giving demonstrations, but these model farms, he says, must be confined to the production of certain classes of agricultural commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter.  The Deputies who rush into this House when something funny is on&mdash;something that is not serious&mdash;are absent just now.  If there is any substance whatever in the Minister's claim that his policy is the best policy for the farmers and the workers&mdash;for the farmers, from the point of view of the profit to be derived from farming, and for the workers from the point of view of the amount of employment given&mdash;then surely the suggestion offered to him is the best possible way to prove it.  I certainly should like to see the idea expressed in Deputy McGovern's motion put into practice. I dare say that it might have to be modified, but there is no joke whatsoever in it, and if the Minister is satisfied with the idea he can quite easily and readily find means to put it into operation.  We may be met with the retort that the functions of the Department are purely instructional. That might be so at ordinary times.  I am as ready as any Deputy in this House to admit that much of the demonstration given by the Department of Agriculture in the past and <Col N="2167" /> even at the present, is useful and will always be useful, but we are passing through a period just now when farmers generally are faced with circumstances which they never expected to meet.  It certainly is a time at which they need something more than eloquent words or theories to prove to them the reality of much that is recommended to them from the Government Benches.  I do not say there should be as many demonstration farms as some Deputies suggest, but there might be a few farms set up in this country to demonstrate the policy of the Government, apart from the theory of their policy, and to demonstrate to the ordinary farmer that there is really something in the policy advocated by the Minister for Agriculture and the Government at the present time.</P>
      <P>I do not want to embark on an argument as to the relative merits of beet or wheat or any other item about which we sometimes argue here.  I want to confine myself as closely as I can to the idea set out in the resolution, the idea of a farm worked as an average, good farm should be worked, with accounts kept and everything else arranged so that the public would have easily proved to them what was the eventual profit or loss on that farm.  Something like that is needed if there is going to be any faith amongst the people as to the future prospects of agriculture in this country if the present methods recommended by the Minister and his Government are followed.  I should like to see a farm set up in this country on which was omitted much of the demonstration that is ordinarily given by the Department of Agriculture, and which, though good in its way, is not practical generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle for referring to some of the things that happened here the other day when Deputies spoke about the Dublin Show.  I do not want to go into that argument, but I do say that demonstrations such as the Department of Agriculture has given at various places as to the production <Col N="2168" /> of what you might call thoroughbred stock, or stock which, while not thoroughbred, would be of a very excellent type and which are produced at an excessive cost, are not demonstrations that should be put before farmers at the present time. I should like to see a farm set up and conducted with particular attention to those items which could be most economically produced and which would hold out the greatest prospect of profit for the farmer&mdash; above all, such items as could be produced without a subsidy or, as we must have subsidies at the present moment, with the least amount of subsidy.  I should like to see demonstrated the production of items which could be profitably produced without any subsidy in future. I should like, for instance, to see a dairy farm set up.  I do not say that it should be exclusively confined to dairying.  The farm that I visualise would be a combined dairying and tillage farm on which various items of agricultural production could be turned out.  It should be demonstrated clearly on that farm what profit the various forms of farming would produce and also the amount of employment they would afford.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see a dairy farm such as Deputy Corry and some other Deputies here recommended.  I know that in the past there were Government farms which were conducted at a loss, but they were never meant to be conducted at a profit.  They were purely educational, and while they might be valuable enough in their way, they would be utterly useless at a time like this.  The farm which Deputy O'Donovan, Deputy McGovern and other Deputies contemplate is a farm run economically.  We quite realise that to run a farm economically it could not be run on the lines on which the old Government farms were run.  I should like to see a dairy farm run with stock purchased in the open market, in the same way as the ordinary farmer has to purchase his stock, not stock purchased at the Dublin Show at prices which the ordinary farmer could not afford to pay.  I should like to see it stocked with cattle purchased at a reasonable price which the ordinary <Col N="2169" /> farmer could pay.  The farm should be run on the same lines as those on which the ordinary farmer would run it&mdash;on better lines, if the Minister thinks that the better lines would pay the farmer better.  Until the Minister is assured that these better lines would yield a better profit, I think the farm should be conducted in the same manner as the ordinary dairy farmer conducts his business.</P>
    <P>The Minister might furnish instructions, for instance, as to the rearing of calves, not again on the extremely expensive system on which they were produced on some of the demonstration farms.  Every farmer knows that he can produce a five or six months old calf, an excellent beast, weighing so much, but when you tot up the <i>et ceteras</i> and the expenses, you find that the beast could not be produced except at a loss.  Deputy Corry talked a good deal about demonstration farms, but they are of no value because they have never proved to be economical or never will, to my mind.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for me to answer the Deputy except to point out that in the production of some items they would be useful.  The demonstration farms showed the best method of sowing a crop, and harvesting it.  They were instructive in that way, but they would have been more valuable if the cost of producing crops in that manner were shown.  While they were of some value, I do not say they were very valuable.  I should like, for instance, to see the rearing of calves demonstrated in such a way that it could be proved economical&mdash;some demonstratration given as to the best time for marketing calves and whether it is more profitable to keep them until they are six months old, 12 months old, or 15 months old.  Again, on the question of the cost of milking, it would be valuable for the ordinary farmer if a demonstration could be given and if the suggestion put forward by the Minister some time ago, that a worker <Col N="2170" /> could milk 15 or 20 calves per day, were tested.</P>

      <P>A man in County Dublin milks 16 cows and feeds them as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Deputy Belton will demonstrate to some of our southern farmers how it is done, because we cannot get them to do it. One of our ordinary workers milks nine or ten cows, and that is assumed to be good average milking.  Possibly conditions differ in County Dublin.  I know that a milker, if his muscles stood the continuous strain, could possibly milk forty cows, but unfortunately under the conditions prevailing to-day milkers cannot afford to spend so much time at milking and get it into the creamery.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton ought to have some idea of the conditions in Limerick.  If he takes a walk in a rural district in Limerick on a summer's morning he will find more farmers working before the ordinary hours of work than in any other county.  When I say the ordinary hours of work I mean the hour at which work generally starts in other forms of activity.</P>

      <P>The ordinary worker in towns and rural districts does not start work any earlier than that.  If <Col N="2171" /> Deputy Belton or the Minister for Agriculture would take a walk in a rural district at 6 o'clock on a summer's morning he would see many men and women actively at work at that hour.</P>
