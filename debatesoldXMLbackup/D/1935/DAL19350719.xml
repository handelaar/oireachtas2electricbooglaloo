      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was giving a summary of this Bill, and I stated that there were three vital sections in it. The first is that which puts an end to the giving of free beef in this State; the second fixes a minimum price for beef, and the third deals with the control and putting in irons of the butchers.  I think this Bill could have been disposed of by introducing a Bill containing one section, whereby in the future beef would be supplied on vouchers on a contributory basis.  I was dealing last night with the fixing of the minimum price for beef, and I pointed out to the Minister that, in the drawing of this section, an attempt was made to make it watertight, but that, while it is watertight on one side, the other side of the sheet covering is absolutely open to allow those things which are prevented on the first side.  The Minister asked me why I would not help him to amend it.  I would very readily give him that help if I thought it would be effective, but I do not think that this section can be made workable, no matter in what form you draft it.  I think it is futile and silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I spoke last night, Deputy Haslett gave a practical illustration of what took place in his constituency at fairs, and it was an actual demonstration of the futility of drafting any section theoretically.  You cannot do it, and it is sheer waste of time trying to do so.  The Minister asks me to help him, but I told him that it was his job. I am, of course, partly responsible, but why does the Minister not apply to those gentlemen whom he is going to put on the Bench and give them £3,000 a year?  Where are they?  Are they <Col N="972" /> members of this House?  Surely they could do something, or is this Bill their production?  Is this their final sacrifice on behalf of their public?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not got a monopoly of all the knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this their supreme sacrifice for the Republic in order to get to the Supreme Court? This is the final act of true Republicans, whoever they are.  When I read Section 16 of this Bill, dealing with the control and putting in irons of butchers, I looked upon it as a device which the Minister had invented partially to solve the unemployment question.  When an inspector goes in and asks a butcher to take down a side of beef weighing 2½ or 3 cwts., which it is physically impossible for a butcher to do, what the butcher can do is to call in a half-a-dozen unemployed people from the street corner to take down the side of beef.  If they do not come in, they are reported to the labour exchange and struck off.  That would be a simple way of saving money. I wonder is that the device behind this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Butchers are to provide weighbridges. The small man who has gone into the business since the Act was introduced in the country, in one of these congested areas where there is enormous demand for this beef, in the belief that he will make a few pounds, has to put up all these accoutrements. He must put in a new and efficient weighbridge.  It must be accurate and he must spend anything from £5 to £15 or £20 in installing that weighbridge and, having done that, he is asked to supply beef at 4d. a lb.  When will he have made the price of the weighbridge selling beef at 4d. a lb?  This is done when the beast should be already weighed at the time of purchase or before.  There is supposed to be a minimum price of 22/- and we can take it that the animal is weighed at the time of purchase, or before or after, at the time the contract is made or the contract is made subject to weighing afterwards.  Why all this palaver and all this setting up of this machinery in a small butcher's shop &mdash; a man who <Col N="973" /> has one room somewhere for supplying free beef and who normally has not a properly equipped place at all and no room for erecting this machinery.</P>
    <P>I think that this part of the Bill is absolutely unworkable.  It is the last word in bureaucracy on the part of this Government.  The reason I particularly object to it is that I foresee that the small men who have gone into the business to supply congested areas where there is the greatest demand for this free beef will not be able to carry on business and will have to go out of business.  Is the provision with regard to canned beef put in with a view to meeting that?  Are the people not to get the best heifer and bullock beef at all but bully beef?  Who is to supply that to them?  If the butcher goes out of business, what machinery is to be established for that purpose?  Is the Minister going to open shops in congested areas to supply bully beef?  I do not know much about this bully beef, but it is generally supplied to armies and they say that it is very liable to give the troops skin disease. That will have the advantage of keeping the local doctor busy.  It is not even going to be the beef of first-class animals, but second and third-rate beef, and the people who buy it will have to give an economic price for it. The Minister will have to buy the cattle and pay the minimum price and we have this whole network of subsidy introduced into this again, because the local butchers in these congested areas must go out of business.</P>
    <P>It is not a business proposition and it cannot be done.  You cannot supply beef at 4d. a lb. and pay 22/- a cwt. for it.  You may try to do it for a while, just as long as your money or credit lasts, and then you will become bankrupt and you will have to close down. There is no use in asking people to do the impossible.  They simply will not pay 22/- a cwt.  Those people are being asked to carry on business under most extraordinary conditions.  This House solemnly carries on the farce of asking them to do the impossible.  The Bill could be reduced to one section.  The Government, apparently, have made up their minds that there will be no <Col N="974" /> more free beef and they are arranging for the distribution of beef on a contributory basis.  The farmers are told they will get 22/- a cwt. but, in practice, they will not.  Last night Deputy Haslett gave a practical demonstration of what takes place at an Irish fair. The whole thing is simply absurd.  The point that stands out in the Bill is that the Government want to make the people pay for their beef, they want to put an end to the free beef scheme. Of course, it is necessary to decorate the proposal in some way.  They endeavour to put some lettuce and other attractive items around the tin of bully beef so that the people will swallow it more easily.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a sop to the farmers.  They are told the butcher must not buy from them except at a fixed price.  Does anybody think that the average butcher will walk up to a man and say &ldquo;I will give you 22/- a cwt. for that beast&rdquo;?  Deputy Haslett demonstrated what occurs. Two men are making a bargain at a fair and they observe the inspector approaching.  They immediately close up like oysters and they wait until the inspector disappears.  That is what will take place.  The time of this House is simply being wasted.  An inspector walks into a butcher's shop and orders the butcher to take down a side of beef, possibly weighing 2½ cwts.  If the butcher has to carry out that order he probably, being a man weighing 8 or 9 stone, may injure himself to such an extent that it might possibly be a case for the undertaker. The only thing is to go out and get the assistance of some of the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand this amending Bill, it will do something to improve the conditions of the farmers. <Col N="975" /> I have been listening to very severe criticism of the Minister for Agriculture from the Opposition for some time.  One of the charges made by the Opposition was that he had not the backbone to stand up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that that Minister is getting away with everything and the farmers are suffering. I was considerably disappointed yesterday listening to Deputies on the opposite benches, for some of whom I have the greatest possible respect. They were responsible for a whole chain of interruptions against the Minister.  It is easier to find fault than to show a better way of doing things.  I have heard the question put again and again to Deputies on the Opposition Benches, what would they do in the circumstances?  Their answer, which simply disgusted me, was &ldquo;That is the business of the Government; it is not our business. Our business is to find fault.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Yesterday, when it was put up to Deputies opposite that there were butchers breaking the law, Deputy O'Higgins came to the rescue and he admitted they did break the law.  And yet, apparently, it is a crime to amend the law if the butchers are breaking it. I was really surprised at Deputy Belton's attitude.  I heard a great deal of talk about this Bill interfering with the butchering business.  The Minister did not say that.  We are going to interfere only with the butchers who do not observe the law, as most butchers do. I do not see that there is anything wrong in that.  If a man does not live within the regulations observed by his neighbours in the same trade, I do not see what is wrong about compelling him to do so.  That is all the Government seek to do in this Bill.  There was a lot of criticism about the 22/- per cwt.  The Minister is merely endeavouring to safeguard the farmer and to see that he will not take less for his beast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How any farmer Deputy can criticise a proposal that will tend to stabilise conditions for the farmers is a mystery to me.  I heard the same kind of criticism in regard to the <Col N="976" /> Butter Stabilisation Act.  Some of the Deputies who criticised it would not like to use the same words to-day.  I hope, when this measure is a few months in operation, the same thing will apply.  It is meant to better the conditions of the farmers, and why any Deputy on the opposite benches should oppose such a measure is a mystery to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If any trader is being hampered in his business to-day, the butcher is.  You are now going to appoint more inspectors to see that the butchers are hampered still more. From the time they get up in the morning to buy their stuff until they go to bed again at night, they have inspectors meeting them at every turn.  The butchers in my town are a decent lot of men, and they sell good stuff.  It is not fair to compel them to account for every small thing they do.  Between the free beef scheme and the way they are watched at the fairs and in their shops by the inspectors, I really do not know how they manage to carry on their business.  I do not think this measure will improve the condition of the farmers.  It will mean the appointment of extra inspectors to watch the butchers.  It is very unfair to the butchers, and I do not believe that the farmers' prices will improve in any way.  I was talking the other day to a friend from England, and he told me there were notices in the windows of large butchering establishments indicating that only British and Scotch beef was sold there.  If we cannot get rid of our beef in outside markets, it must be sold here, and if there is not sufficient consumption the farmers will not get the price you are fixing, bad and all as it is.  There is only one remedy, and there is no need for me to point that out to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate what sum the Government expects to realise from the levies imposed under the Act of last year and what they estimate to realise in connection with this Bill. What have the receipts amounted to? Could he give us, at the same time, what he estimates the expenditure is <Col N="977" /> likely to be in giving meat at reduced prices to the people?  The measure introduced last year was ostensibly for the purpose of improving the price to farmers and at the same time absorbing some of the surplus cattle which were rendered unsaleable by reason of the quota order.  Last year's measure was very comprehensive.  It contained at least nine parts and various precautions were taken to ensure that no sales would take place at a price lower than the price which was to be fixed by the Minister.  The general information indicates that in practice the provisions of the Bill failed to effect that purpose.  In some instances it was stated that when the inspectors called at the fairs it practically meant that there were no sales.</P>
      <P>We are prepared to admit that the Minister intended, like many other people, with good intentions, to do certain things.  The question is, did his Act succeed in doing them?  If the purpose of the Act of last year was to ensure the use of 60,000 head of cattle in the year and to get certain prices, the House should be told to what extent the Minister's examination in relation to the price has shown that that has been achieved.  Last year we understood that the levies would practically counterbalance the outgoings &mdash; that what was collected from the levies on cattle and sheep would about meet the cost of the distribution of meat to persons in necessitous circumstances. That is all very well as far as it went. This Bill now certainly does stop that policy or, at any rate, it changes it. This Bill proposes now to furnish meat at a cheap price.  If there were a balance in respect of last year's proposals and that the levies about meet the outgoings in respect of free meat, this Bill now means that the Exchequer will benefit as a result of its enactment. If that is so, does not the Minister realise that in his efforts to benefit the farmers or to increase the price to them the Exchequer gets the real profits of the transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it intended that in respect of these particular meat products the Treasury was to benefit by the <Col N="978" /> transaction?  The Minister knows quite well that the whole cattle situation has been more seriously upset perhaps than anything else in connection with the tariff conflict that is going on at the present moment.  The Minister, in coming to the House and telling us of his difficulties, knows that we must sympathise with him in these difficulties, but it is rather too much to say to the House or to the Opposition: &ldquo;These are my proposals; if they are not sound you must produce sounder ones.&rdquo;  The real problem is what steps are to be taken to remedy a situation which interferes with the law of supply and demand.  In a publication issued by the Northern Government some time ago there were given the prices paid for beef.  The highest price paid for beef in Northern Ireland was 60/-. It went down to 53/-, but here the maximum price is 25/- and it goes down much lower.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the procedure he proposes to adopt, is going to harass the business people of this State. Various regulations and provisions are provided in the Bill, which anybody must know are serious inconveniences to trade.  Let the Minister consider the particular question here in relation to business people, but let him not consider that all people in trade are out to rob everybody.  The various trades here are as well conducted as they are anywhere else.  The Minister will recollect that an important official of his Department addressed the dealers last year and told them that though they were to lose over the minimum prices paid, even in that case they should be prepared to bear some of the losses.  The Minister, in addressing the butchering trade here now, tells them much the same thing.  It is scarcely fair to the trade to suggest that to get into the speculative circle of business one must endeavour to get all the profits possible in order to provide for the day when the Legislature may enact laws which will entail losses on persons engaged in trade.  That is not good business.  As a result of this measure, £100,000 or £200,000 may go into the Exchequer.  But after all the regulations that have been imposed <Col N="979" /> the price will vary, and perhaps even less money will be paid to the farmers. Viewing it from every angle, the regimentation of business and the giving of power to the Minister to buy cannot be a success.  Anybody who has any experience in connection with trade or business knows well that neither the municipality nor the State can ever hope to transact business as satisfactorily as individuals.  Whatever faults may be in individuals and in individual trading, the waste that is inevitable in connection with Government control will more than counterbalance any advantages of that control.</P>
    <P>Supposing in this case the Minister gets into business and he insists on the butchers buying from him, does he not know that it would be practically impossible for one of his inspectors to go into the market and buy cattle without raising all sorts of political suspicions and agitations from one party or another?  In connection with that, surely he must know if his inspector goes down to buy cattle that the first question that will be asked will be: &ldquo;To whom did he go; whom did he pass; did he pass so-and-so; did he buy the best and did he buy the best only?&rdquo;  There will be the consequential lack of confidence that arises from the State going into business, because there will be concentrated on the inspectors all the criticisms that can possibly arise in connection with that matter.  Does not the Minister know that when his inspectors went to sales last year they practically stopped sales?</P>
    <P>Is not this position likely to arise &mdash; that the Minister will be approached by somebody in the House to know is the inspector going to such and such a fair, and if he is &ldquo;Patrick Murphy or James McCarthy or somebody else has excellent cattle to sell and would he advise the inspector to see these men before he completes the sales?&rdquo; The Minister will realise that he is placing himself in an anomalous position by this Bill and especially by this provision in the Bill.  He must realise that he is raising difficulties for his inspectors, because no matter <Col N="980" /> what his inspectors do somebody will raise complaints.  Then, in addition, certain people who have been employed at this work will lose their employment. This disturbance of trade creates lack of confidence and stirs up the critics.  Will it do any good?  No man who has any experience of going into business will deny that in connection with matters of that sort the further removed the Minister is from it the better it will be for him and for the State.</P>
    <P>To come back for a moment to the measure before us, I submit that it certainly does increase restrictions upon the particular trade.  It does not guarantee prices.  It hopes to guarantee them.  It makes provision for guaranteeing them, but the best provisions in the world are not going to interfere with the law of supply and demand.  This Bill ensures to the Exchequer much more profits than last year's Act.  In the circumstances I think it is not fair to the cattle industry now that that should be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in this Bill the Minister deserves a certain amount of sympathy.  I say that because as a result of this Bill he finds himself in a position that is going to prove an extremely difficult one.  I am satisfied that this Bill instead of making it easier is going to accentuate that position.  The Minister sets out to improve the position of the farmer. Nobody in this House will cavil at that.  That, I take it, is the main purpose of the Bill, but the Minister has simply brought that in as a source of experiment.  In the original Bill, which is called the Principal Act, he found many parts of this scheme unworkable. The machinery was very cumbersome.  Now he sets out to create further difficulties &mdash; to make this difficult Bill still more difficult of being put into proper effect.  We have been told that there have been evasions of the law.  If there have been evasions of the law under the Principal Act, there certainly will be much more evasions of the law under this Act. The inspection system is aggravated. The harassing that is going to take <Col N="981" /> place with regard to the inspection of butchers' premises is much more marked.  All sorts of registers will have to be kept.  Machines will have to be got.  The premises, of course, are always open to inspection.  On the whole, the butchering trade is going to be harassed in an unparalleled way.</P>
      <P>One part of the scheme, I think, will commend itself to everybody, and that is the doing away with the demoralising effects which have followed from the granting of free beef.  The doing away with the granting of free beef ought to give the Minister an opportunity of doing away with the levy to some extent.  As has been pointed out here, any profits that are going to come from this Bill, as a result of the elimination of the free beef element, will go straight into the Treasury.  As a trader myself, I protest against any State interference in trade.  We all know from experience that State interference with private trade in any form is bad.  Interference in trade by the Government or the State is always costly, cumbersome, unsatisfactory, and, in the end, highly extravagant and inefficient.  So it will prove in this case.  The butchers are to be, I might say, butchered to make a legislative holiday here, and try to make the people believe that they are going to be sacrificed for the benefit of the farmers.  I think the farmers will see through all this, and in spite of the inspections and restrictions the price which they secure for beef will be one that is based on the economic law of supply and demand.  The Minister, I think, has found that the enforcement of the minimum price was a complete failure.  I am very sorry that it was, because I am sure the Minister meant very well in trying to enforce it, and that he did enforce it as far as the machinery allowed, but it was ineffective.  I am afraid that this Bill, which is even more cumbersome than its predecessor, will make the situation still more difficult for everybody concerned.  In the end, it will prove to be grossly ineffective in carrying out the objects which the Minister himself has in view.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton raised the question last night as to why we did not enforce this minimum price provision in regard to the exporters.  Deputy Belton took a keen interest in the Principal Act when it was going through this House last year, and I think he should remember that the Act dealt only with cattle and sheep slaughtered for consumption in Saorstát Eireann.  It had nothing at all to do with exporting. We afterwards addressed the exporters and asked them to give the minimum price, because there was great agitation and great feeling at the time that the exporters, having the handling of the licences, were not giving the price they should give for the cattle.</P>
      <P>There has been great comment here on the speech made to the exporters by the Secretary to my Department, for which, of course, I take the fullest responsibility.  We have been reminded that he told the exporters they would either have to give a better price or get out of business.  They did give a better price for a while, and then got out of business as far as the export licences were concerned, because from the 1st January the export licences went to the feeders.  If the feeders are getting the export licences why should we make any rule or law about the exporters paying the minimum price?  We were always told by Deputy Belton, and others like him, that if the producers got the licences everything would be all right, and especially of course if the producers got the licences, and were able to sell their cattle in the great British market, they would get a great price. There was no question about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are given to certain farmers.  In County Dublin it is one in 12.  You can get one licence for 12 fat beasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The farmer brings out his 12 cattle to the Dublin market.  There is a licence for one. Is the farmer going to say to the dealer &ldquo;I have 12 to sell; I can only send one to England and because of that you can buy that particular beast for whatever you like?&rdquo;  That is absolutely ridiculous.  I thought Deputy Belton had more sense than to make a point like that.  Evidently he is losing his senses like the rest of them.</P>

      <P>The whole argument there is that the Bill will not work, or alternatively, for fear that might be wrong, that it is too drastic.  Whatever may happen now the Deputies opposite will be right.  If we work this Bill in a drastic way, and it succeeds, they will tell us: &ldquo;It was too drastic.  You need not have gone so far.&rdquo;  If we work it, and do not succeed, they will say &ldquo;We told you it would not succeed.&rdquo;  That is a very comfortable attitude for Deputies to take up.  I think Deputies should take a chance, and come to one side or the other.  They should either say &ldquo;It is too drastic; a little less would do&rdquo;, or else say &ldquo;It is not drastic enough, and will not succeed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The impression is given by speakers here that we are going to deal in a drastic way with every butcher in the country.  That is not true.  The majority of the butchers, if Deputies would only go and speak to them, will say that they want those drastic provisions so that the slackers will be compelled to pay the same price as they themselves are paying.  That is the system in any decent trade where you have decent people in it.  I mean that where you have decent people in trade they will always want the law administered in a drastic way against those who are trying to evade it, because those who are evading it are simply taking advantage of the people who are obeying the law.  I am quite certain that if Deputies have amongst their acquaintances any decent butchers, and discuss the Bill with them, they will find that these decent butchers welcome it.  No decent, respectable man is afraid of a drastic law, because he knows that he is not going to be hit.  The question of the levies was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Belton.  Deputy Belton said that I made the statement that the levies were earmarked for the purposes of this measure.  Of course, they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not getting rid of the export bounties.  I think the Deputy should attend a night school because I have not the time to instruct him.  The question of the finances of the Cattle Act and what we will raise this year was referred to.  We expect that the levies will raise between £300,000 and £325,000.  The expenditure on free beef is going to be at least £325,000.  The supply of cows to the Roscrea factory will cost about £100,000, and in a full year about £150,000.  The supply of cattle for canned meat will cost about £20,000 and the administrative expenses will come to between £30,000 and £40,000. If Deputies look up the Book of Estimates, and I think it would be well if they devoted some little time to research of that kind, they will find that the net expenditure under the Cattle Act will be about £200,000 this year.  Taking the receipts and deducting the expenditure, it is anticipated that the net expenditure will be about £200,000 this year.  That is based on this Bill coming into operation before the 1st of September and on the contributory basis for free beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>These estimates, I take it, were framed about last December. Are we to assume that, even though the Act that we are now amending only became operative in September, and the estimates were framed in December, that a Bill that was passed and only came into law in September is going to be amended now in this fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was framed on the assumption that the contributory basis for free beef would commence on the 1st of April, and also on the basis that the Roscrea factory would start on the 1st of April.  We can take it that the saving, due to the fact that the Roscrea factory has not yet begun to operate, when put against the delay in bringing the contributory basis in regard to free beef into effect will about balance, so that, as I have said, the net expenditure this year will be in or about £200,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that we continued to supply free beef through the whole year, in the same quantities as last year, the expenditure would be £430,000 for a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with the levies, and how the farmers are affected by them.  Deputy Belton said that the whole trouble, so far as the farmers are concerned, was that when they brought out cattle they were told to hold out for 22/-, but that as they wanted to pay their rates and annuities they had to sell their cattle at the prices offered.  Surely, under this scheme, we are going to help the farmer to pay the levies if we see that he gets 22/- instead of 14/- or 15/- for his cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such test. We are trying to legislate so that the farmer will get a good price for his cattle, and it is ridiculous for Deputy Belton to ask if we will take this beef instead.  The type of question that the Deputy asks shows the state of the man's mind.  Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of his speech, made the statement that we were neglecting the more important market in Great Britain for the less important market at home.  Such a statement shows, of course, not only the ignorance of Deputy O'Higgins but the man's mentality, because the market in Great Britain is not more important than the home market.  The Deputies opposite seem to be suffering from a kind of anglomania, an inferiority complex about everything that we produce here.</P>

      <P>I do agree with what Deputy O'Higgins said that if we had a public abattoir, say two or three in every county, a scheme of that sort would help us to get over a great deal of this trouble.  I think it would be a useful thing if we have them.  At the same time I know that if I brought in a proposal here to the effect that every butcher should bring his cattle to the public abattoir to be slaughtered I would meet with nothing but opposition from the Deputies opposite. We would have a speech from Deputy McMenamin about the poor butcher in Dungloe who had to take a beast to the abattoir in Glenties.</P>

When the principal Act was going through last year I was told by Deputy Belton, when I said that I proposed paying the inspectors a certain salary, that we would get nothing but crooks, and that if they were not crooks at the date of their appointment, then the salary was so low that they would become crooks.  That is not true and every Deputy who has spoken on this has testified that it is not true. They have said that the inspectors they came in contact with were able, good men, and that they did their business properly, so that Deputy Belton is again proved wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to reap these things up.  Deputy O'Higgins said that we had hit the farmers, that now we are trying to hit the butchers, and that if we succeed, he is not sure but consumers will be hit. That is splendid reasoning.  It is sounder than we usually hear from the opposite benches.  Naturally, if we get a better price for the producer the consumer will have to pay more.  Nothing can be clearer than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are interfering with the economic laws.  If we can we are going to make the butchers pay more than 14/- or 15/- and thereby we are going to hit the consumers by making them pay more.  If the economic war was over, we will finish up by the consumers paying more.  Then there will be a cry to go back to the economic war.  When I bring in a Bill I am always told by Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies of the same mentality, that the easiest way to deal with every question is to stop the economic war.  That is a lazy mentality for any Deputy to adopt. It is as easy to get up when any <Col N="990" /> measure is introduced and to say: &ldquo;You have destroyed the markets. Stop the economic war!&rdquo;  No thinking is necessary; the Bills need not be read. Just say that every time.  If people fall into that sort of mental coma it will not be necessary to think any longer.  But we have the task of dealing with a difficulty that is there.  It would be great mental exercise for the leaders of the Opposition if they tried to get their minds down to these problems, instead of looking upon them in a theoretical way.  If they were in office they should ask themselves what they would do.</P>

Deputy Haslett says the farmer pays the levy.  I think the Deputy will agree that if exporters and butchers are in the Dublin market, the butchers have to pay what the exporters pay. Therefore the butchers put the 5/- on to consumers.  They cannot deduct the 5/- from the farmer.  Then take cattle; if we could get the minimum price enforced, the butcher might, in addition, <Col N="991" /> pay the £1.  The whole object of the Bill is to get that price enforced.</P>

      <P>It does not apply to sheep.  If we succeed in getting the minimum price enforced the butcher will pay it and pass it on to consumers. The farmer will not pay it.  I want Deputies to help me to get the minimum price enforced.  Deputy Haslett says he is not opposed to this in a political way.  He is in a comfortable position.  He has not to think.  He has only to follow the people on the opposite benches into the division lobby.  Naturally the Deputy does not approach anything in a political way.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked a question about the change that is being made.  I have studied the section in the meantime and I am convinced, although I undertook to consult legal opinion, that it means what I said: that it saves the head office the trouble of having to send a man down to vouch that a document is what it purports to be.  However, I will think it over. Deputy McMenamin refused to give me advice.  My own legal advisers think that the position is all right in the Bill. Naturally I was impressed by the profound opinion expressed by Deputy McMenamin.  In my humility I asked him to help me and I was spurned.</P>

I think the price of 60/- for beef in Northern Ireland mentioned by Deputy <Col N="992" /> Cosgrave is a fantastic figure.  It is possible that that happened at shows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price there would not be better than the British price.  That price is very unusual.  The average would be 36/- or 38/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very small part of the argument.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Cosgrave that neither the State nor a municipality can do business as well as people who are in the business.  I do not think the buying of a few cattle to be handed over to butchers, under a Bill like this, could actually be described as going into business.  We are not taking over the whole butchering business. We are saying to particular butchers that for a specified time our inspectors will buy cattle and give them to them.  If you like we are supplying them with the raw material but we are not going into the business in any way.  They are getting the cattle more or less at the same price at which they could buy them.  I do not think we are interfering to any great extent with that business.  In any case, we would only be too glad to step out, and to let them buy again when they go back to the old methods that they were pursuing before the original Act came into operation, by buying from surrounding farmers.  It is only in such cases that provision will be enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's difficulty?  He buys a certain amount of cattle of particular quality and the butcher gets some.  Alternatively you have the butcher who gets <Col N="993" /> a particular type of cattle that the inspector has not got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not happen.  The inspector will give the butcher an order for the number of cattle, as well as the type and weight, he requires.  The inspector will try to oblige him as far as possible in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not accepted that there was what the Minister practically called evasion of the law by a number of people?  I listened carefully to the Minister and I got no idea, and I do not think the House did of the extent of that particular evil.  In connection with the answer given to Deputy Cosgrave I was not impressed that this section would be a deterrent to the practice that he condemned.  I understood when the Minister introduced the measure that that was the object; now I gather that there will be no deterrent. It seems to me that the butcher gets better cattle easier when they are bought by the Government.</P>

      <P>He will have to pay the minimum price.  He has been getting them more cheaply before and, perhaps, there will be a little expense attached to the buying of the cattle by the inspector.  With regard to the evasion, it is a small minority which is concerned.  It is very difficult to give a figure, but I am assured by the officials that it is only a small minority that is concerned and that they are evading the Act in such a way that they cannot be caught out.</P>

      <P>The Act was passed on the 29th September, 1933.  Regulations had then to be made under Section 2 of the Act prescribing the manner in which the shareholding banks should nominate their representative on the Investments Advisory Committee.  As the preparation of these regulations involved consultation with each of the eight shareholding banks, the regulations were not in final form until the beginning of November, 1933.  They were formally made on the 16th November, 1933.  In the interval the Chief Justice and the Stock Exchange were consulted as to their nominees on the Investments Advisory Committee.  On the 12th February, 1934, the committee was formally constituted by the Minister for Finance and held its first <Col N="999" /> meeting on the 5th March, 1934.  After the constitution of the committee, the preparation of the further regulations required under Section 7 of the Act was put in hands by the Department of Finance.  These regulations prescribed the form and manner in which application was to be made to the Minister for Finance for the approval of securities under Section 7 of the Act.  This is a Second Reading statement I may say, but I am making it at the Deputy's request.  The draft of these regulations was agreed to by the Investments Advisory Committee on the 10th September, 1934, and the regulations were made on the 29th September, 1934.  A notice was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stating that the regulations had been made and that copies of the prescribed form could be obtained on application to the Department of Finance.  Since then the committee has been at work but it will be understood that practically every new application at this stage involves prolonged and somewhat more detailed consideration as to the procedure to be adopted in dealing with it because it is only now that the practical procedure is being determined by the committee.  Therefore, there has naturally been a certain amount of time taken up in laying down the lines upon which future applications will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Section put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may by order, whenever and so often as he shall think proper, extend by such period as he shall think fit and shall specify in such order all or any of the following periods, that is to say, the several periods of four years from the passing of the Principal Act respectively mentioned in subsections (1) and (2) of Section 6 and sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act, and the period of four years and six months from the passing of the Principal Act mentioned in sub-section (3) of Section 9 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act.</P>

      <P>The amendment merely provides that before extending by Order for a further period of years the periods &mdash; four years or four and a half years, as the case may be &mdash; specified in the preceding sections, the Minister must consult the Chairman of the Investments Advisory Committee.  As the House is already aware, in accordance with the terms of Section 2 of the Principal Act, the Chairman of the Currency Commission is Chairman of the Investments Advisory Committee, and is the only one of the five members of that Committee in regard to whose appointment there is no choice.  The amendment will ensure that both the Committee and the Currency Commission will be consulted before the Minister exercises his power under the section, and will obviate any appearance that the Minister is arbitrarily disposing of the time and energies of the Chairman of the two bodies.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will agree with me that a Minister who is anxious to have this Committee functioning properly is not likely to override the firm opinion of the person upon whom the duties of Chairman will devolve if the Order is made extending the period.  I think, after all, that we must realise that unless the Committee is willing to co-operate in a matter of this sort it would be futile to extend the period by Order.</P>

      <P>The Minister's mind has undergone a considerable change since I was in office.  What I often <Col N="1001" /> said on that occasion was that I could not conceive any Minister then acting in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the business.  The Minister is falling into the same frame of mind as I had at that particular time.  But precautions must be taken in respect to the future.  My own view with regard to our financial business generally is that it will require very close attention to prevent such catastrophic events as occurred elsewhere. I want the Minister to look into this with a view of seeing whether or not something stronger than the amendment that is in is not advisable.  Can the Minister conceive a Minister for Finance not being in agreement with the Committee &mdash; leave himself out of it absolutely now &mdash; and making an order, after speaking to the Committee and after consultation with them, with which they will not agree?</P>

      <P>I know, but the Committee, to some extent, has a curb on the actions of the Minister for Finance and the question of discretion in regard to certain investments, and I take it that, if the Committee were unwilling to act in a case like that, the Minister, having a freer hand, would not be disposed to press the order unduly.  The Committee is a body in which there is quorum. Let us assume that there is a person unable or unlikely to act, or something of that kind, whose successor might not agree with the advice given, and suppose there is an endeavour to give an order.  I want the thing examined so as to see whether or not there is a danger in this.  The Bill, and its predecessor, is certainly no credit to the Minister.  Within two years we have an amendment.  Surely to goodness, these things could have been foreseen.  Has every Bill introduced by the Minister to be amended within a certain period of time?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to discuss the question of credit or discredit attached to this Bill.  I am afraid we would have to say disagreeable <Col N="1002" /> things to one another, because this Bill, in my opinion, is introduced 12 years too late.  It should have been introduced during the term of office of the previous administration.  I pointed out on the first occasion that it was purely tentative and experimental and that it was only being given currency for a period of two years, but that, at the end of that time, we would have to reconsider it. Since then, the Banking Commission has been set up, and I do not think it is desirable to change the existing procedure until at least we have had an opportunity of considering the report of the Banking Commission which, I am sure, will deal with the activities of this Committee.  That is one of the justifications for prolonging it, and the other justification was that the experience of it is short and we did not have time to enable this experiment to be worked out.  After all, even if the members are capable of prescience in the way the Deputy suggests, none of us can visualise the future for all time, and I do not think there is any great discredit if we say now that it will take longer than two years before any conclusions can be drawn with regard to this experiment. However, in deference to what the Deputy says, I shall consider what he has said on the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <P>The object of amendments Nos. 6 and 7 is to remove any doubts that may exist as to the position of a Supreme Court Judge sitting in the High Court at the request of the Chief Justice by virtue of the provisions of Section 5. During the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, Deputy Costello mentioned that the words &ldquo;and be an additional Judge thereof for such purposes and during such time as shall be specified in such request,&rdquo; which it <Col N="1005" /> is now proposed to delete from sub-section (1), might have the effect of limiting the jurisdiction of a Supreme Court Judge sitting in the High Court and leaving him subject to <i>certiorari.</i> The deletion of the words I have quoted and the insertion of the new sub-section as provided for in amendment No. 7 should leave no doubt upon the point. This matter was raised by Deputy Costello on the Second Reading, and we think that that would remove his doubts.</P>

      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Every judge of the High Court who, at any time after the commencement of Part I of the Principal Act and before the passing of this Act, discharged the office of Judicial Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission shall be deemed to have been, while so discharging such office, duly assigned in manner prescribed by law within the meaning of Section 3 of the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923 (No. 27 of 1923), to discharge that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The President of the High Court shall, from time to time as occasion requires, assign a judge of the High Court to discharge the office of Judicial Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission, and the President <Col N="1006" /> of the High Court may, whenever he thinks proper so to do, terminate any such assignment previously made by him.</P>
    <P>(3)  The President of the High Court may, whenever the judge for the time being assigned by him under the next preceding sub-section of this section to discharge the office of Judicial Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission is temporarily unable because of illness, absence, or any other cause to discharge the duties of the said office, assign temporarily (without terminating the assignment of the said judge) another judge of the Hight Court to discharge during such inability the said office.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every judge of the High Court who shall be assigned under this section to discharge the office of Judicial Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission (including a judge so assigned temporarily) shall be deemed to have been and to be so assigned in manner prescribed by law within the meaning of Section 3 of the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923 (No. 27 of 1923), and that section shall apply and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>This amendment is aimed at removing doubts which arise under the existing law regarding the position of Judicial Commissioner under the Land Acts. Section 3 of the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that from and after the establishment of courts pursuant to Article 64 of the Constitution a judge of the High Court should be assigned in a manner to be prescribed by law, to discharge the office of Judicial Commissioner under the Act.  The intention at the time, apparently, was that the then pending Courts of Justice Bill should prescribe the manner in which the assignment should be made.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, did not, in fact, make any such provision and there is, therefore, some doubt as to whether the present holder of the office is lawfully assigned at all.  The amendment regularises this position with retrospective effect and also implements Section 3 of the Land Law (Commission) Act, 1923.  The <Col N="1007" /> opportunity has also been availed of to make provision for the temporary assignment of a judge of the High Court during the absence through illness or any other cause of the judge permanently assigned.</P>

      <P>Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  An application under Section 25 of the Principal Act for the remittal or transfer of an action pending in the High Court may be made at any time after an appearance is entered therein and before service of notice of trial therein and, where the summons in such action is required by rules of court to be set down for hearing before the Master of the High Court, notwithstanding that such summons has not been so set down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained <Col N="1008" /> in Section 25 of the Principal Act, an action for the recovery of a liquidated sum shall not be remitted or transferred under that section unless the plaintiff consents thereto or the defendant either satisfies the High Court that he has a good defence to such action or some part thereof or discloses facts which, in the opinion of the High Court, are sufficient to entitle him to defend such action.</P>
    <P>This is a new section which we propose to insert in the Bill following the recommendations made by the Joint Committee.  The matter contained in this section was overlooked through an oversight when the Bill was first introduced.  The object of the first sub-section of the section is to enable an application for the remittal or transfer of an action pending in the High Court to be made at the earliest possible opportunity so as to relieve the parties of avoidable cost.  The Joint Committee's recommendation on the point is contained in paragraph 34 of their report. Sub-section (2) of the new section carries out the recommendations made by the Joint Committee in paragraphs 32 and 33.</P>

The granting of a special certificate at the discretion of the trial judge as contemplated in the section is an exercise of discretion for which only the judge who has heard the whole case is, in general, competent. If such an exercise of discretion is made subject to appeal the appellate tribunal must of necessity (as a general rule) review the whole case, with consequent expense on the parties in putting before the court the entire evidence and documents for the limited purpose of reviewing the grant or refusal of a certificate as to costs.</P>

If any case is made for this proposal we shall be prepared to reconsider it on the next stage.  But for the 11 years in which this jurisdiction was allowed in the Cork court, only one case <Col N="1011" /> has arisen.  Deputies will understand that in order to deal with these cases officials must be <i>au fait</i> with the procedure involved and the rules and so on.  While it is not suggested that any mistake might arise, at the same time it is not fair to the officials to call upon them to deal with matters of this sort with which they have not practical experience.  However, if the Cork Deputies make any further representations upon the subject they will be considered.</P>

It is considered that this provision will be useful particularly in equity cases, <Col N="1013" /> that is, in an administration suit where during the course of the proceedings unsuspected assets came to light and excess of jurisdiction consequently occurs.  It is felt that the expenses already incurred in such a case in the Circuit Court should not be wasted and the parties required to commence the proceedings <i>de novo</i> in the High Court.  This amendment was suggested by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>

    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 32 was intended to ensure that nothing in the Bill would in any way alter the existing procedure on appeal from a decision of the Circuit Court under an enactment relating to a tax or duty under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  When the sub-section was originally drafted, it was believed that there was no provision for any such appeal except by way of case stated.  It appears, however, that Section 10, sub-section (5), of the Finance Act, 1894, as amended by Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1896, gives a right of appeal otherwise than by way of case stated to the Supreme Court from a decision of the Circuit Court on an appeal in relation to an Estate Duty case.  The amendment now proposed will have the effect of excluding this type of case from the scope of the general provisions relating to appeals from the Circuit Court contained in Part 4 of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  It shall be lawful for the Minister for Justice, whenever he shall think proper so to do after consultation with the Chief Justice, to direct one or more of the officers for the time being serving in the <Col N="1020" /> office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court to travel to a particular appeal town for a particular sitting of the High Court on circuit in that appeal town and there perform such duties as are mentioned in that behalf in this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every officer who is directed under this section to travel to an appeal town for a sitting of the High Court on circuit shall travel to such appeal town in accordance with such directions and shall there act as registrar (in addition to the county registrar) to the High Court on circuit during the said sitting of that court, and shall be and stay in such appeal town for such time before, during, and after such sitting as shall be necessary for the proper discharge of his duties as such registrar.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every officer travelling to and staying in an appeal town in pursuance of this section shall receive, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such travelling expenses and subsistence allowance in respect of such travelling and staying as the Minister for Justice shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, direct.</P>
    <P>It is intended that High Court judges when travelling on circuit to hear Circuit Court appeals shall travel in pairs to each county, and will there sit separately to dispose of the cases coming before them.  It will, therefore, be necessary to have two registrars available to sit in the two courts, which will be working simultaneously. It is possible that in some instances the county registrar will not be able to provide a second official to act as registrar, and power is taken in the amendment now proposed to direct one or more of the officers serving in the central office of the High Court or in the office of the Supreme Court to travel on circuit and to sit and act as registrars to the appeal judges.</P>

      <P>(2)  All expenses incurred in the provision of accommodation for judges (including commissioners) of the High Court on circuit and their servants in pursuance of this section shall, to such extent as shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 110:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Any person who, at the passing of this Act, holds office as a justice of the District Court may, by notice in writing sent to the Minister for Finance not more than three months after such passing, elect to retain the pension rights conferred by Section 75 of the Principal Act, and, where any such person so elects, the foregoing sub-sections of this section shall not apply to him and, in lieu thereof, the said section 75 shall (notwithstanding the repeal of that section by this Act) continue to apply to such person subject to the following modifications, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> (a)  the amount of any pension to which a person becomes entitled under the said Section 75 (as so applied) after the passing of this Act shall be ten per cent. greater than the amount of the pension to which he would have been entitled under the said Section 75 if this section had not been enacted but subject to the limitation that the amount of such pension shall not, by virtue of the addition of such percentage, exceed one-half of the salary of such person at the time he vacates his office, and</P>
    <P>(b)  for the purposes of the subsequent provisions of this section, a pension payable under the said Section 75 as applied by this section shall be deemed to be a pension under this section and the said provisions shall apply and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 47 of the Bill regarding the pension rights of District Justices represent a compromise between the recommendation of the Committee and the existing terms. The proposed terms are undoubtedly better on the whole and so far as I have interviewed District Justices, they are generally welcomed.  There is one respect, however, in which the new scheme may operate to the disadvantage of some of the present justices.  Justices at present are subject to the Superannuation Acts in the matter of pensions and, accordingly, the dependents of a justice who dies in office are entitled to receive a gratuity which is the equivalent of the annual salary of the justice.  It has been represented to me that the loss of this gratuity, which the adoption of the new proposals would involve, must be a matter of some concern and importance to some of the justices. The fact that such a gratuity is payable is certainly a consideration for a middle-aged man with dependents because the £1,000 he would receive, if he died in office, is more or less regarded by him as an insurance policy.</P>
    <P>Then, on the other hand, in the <Col N="1024" /> alternative when he retired he received a substantial sum by way of gratuity, calculated on the basis of the number of years he served.  The amendment seeks to alleviate the hardships the enactment of the new provisions may create in particular cases.  It proposes to allow any existing justice who so desires to opt in favour of his present pension terms. It is recognised that a justice who so opts will be forgoing the new and admittedly better terms because personal circumstances more or less compel him to choose the existing terms. The amendment, therefore, proposes as a measure of compensation to any such justice that the annual sum payable by way of pension should be increased by 10 per cent., subject to the limitation that the total amount payable will not exceed half the salary of the justice.  It may be mentioned that half the salary is the maximum pension allowed in any case where a gratuity is also payable.  I have interviewed representatives of the District Justices, and I afterwards interviewed some of those whose cases seemed to be exceptional.  We have gone into the matter fully and we have gone as far as we can go to try to meet some of the difficulties that have arisen in regard to some District Justices.</P>

    <P>(a)  if such transfer is so recommended because of the conduct (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) of such justice either generally or on a particular occasion, the Minister for Justice, if he so thinks proper, may at his discretion either transfer such justice, when a convenient opportunity offers, from the district to which he was assigned at the date of such recommendation to another district or censure such justice and cause such censure to be communicated in writing to such justice;</P>
    <P>(b)  if such transfer is so recommended for any reason other than such conduct as aforesaid, the Minister for Justice may, if he so thinks proper, transfer such justice, when a convenient opportunity offers, from the district to which he was assigned at the date of such recommendation to another district.</P>

      <P>(2) The Registrar of the Supreme</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> Court shall act as secretary to the said advisory committee.</P>
    <P>122.  To delete sub-sections (2) and (3) and substitute five new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister for Justice or any member of the said advisory committee may at any time bring to the notice of the said advisory committee either of the following matters in relation to any particular justice of the District Court, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the fitness of such justice to continue to hold his office having regard to his mental or physical health, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the conduct of such justice (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) either generally or upon a particular occasion.</P>
    <P>(3)  The said advisory committee shall investigate every matter brought to their notice under the next preceding sub-section of this section and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if such matter is the fitness of a justice of the District Court to continue to hold his office having regard to his physical or mental health, the said advisory committee shall either (as they or a majority of them shall think proper) decide that no action should be taken in the matter or decide that such justice is unfit as aforesaid to continue to hold his office, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if such matter is the conduct of a justice of the District Court, the said advisory committee shall either (as they or a majority of them shall think proper)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  decide that no action should be taken in the matter, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  decide that such conduct amounts to misconduct and that such justice be censured in respect thereof, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  decide that such conduct amounts to grave misconduct and that such justice is, on account thereof, unfit to continue to hold his office.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever the said advisory committee decides under this section that a justice of the District <Col N="1030" /> Court be censured, the said advisory committee shall cause their secretary to communicate such censure to such justice and shall also, if they or a majority of them so think proper, cause their secretary to communicate the particulars of their decision to such persons as they direct.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever the said advisory committee decides under this section that a justice of the District Court is unfit to continue to hold his office, the said advisory committee shall make and send to the Executive Council a report of their said decision (including a statement of the nature of such unfitness), and upon receipt of such report&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the nature of the unfitness stated in such report is mental or physical infirmity, the Executive Council may, if they so think proper, give such justice an opportunity of vacating his office on account of such infirmity and, if he does not or cannot avail himself of such opportunity, remove such justice from office on account of such infirmity, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if the nature of the unfitness stated in such report is grave misconduct, the Executive Council may, if they so think proper, give such justice an opportunity of vacating his office and, if he does not avail himself of such opportunity, remove him from office on account of such misconduct.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(6)  Whenever a justice of the District Court is removed from office by the Executive Council under this section on account of mental or physical infirmity, he shall be deemed, for the purposes of pension, to have vacated his office owing to permanent infirmity.</P>
    <P>132.  In sub-section (4), line 29, to delete the words &ldquo;so think proper&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;consider that the personal circumstances of such justice render the due discharge of his duties difficult in that particular district&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>133.  In sub-section (4), page 19, <Col N="1031" /> line 33, after the word &ldquo;district&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;and thereupon it shall be lawful for the said Minister to transfer such justice, when a convenient opportunity offers, from the district to which he was assigned at the date of such report to another district&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>134.  In pages 19 and 20 to delete sub-sections (5) to (10) inclusive.</P>
    <P>143.  In sub-section (11), page 20, line 33, to delete the words &ldquo;report made&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;decision of or report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be convenient to consider these six amendments together as, except possibly in the case of amendment No. 132, they are all interrelated and are intended to effect certain radical alterations in the scheme as originally proposed in Section 49.  It is proposed that the Advisory Committee set up under the section will have a statutory secretary who will be the registrar of the Supreme Court. Certain alterations are being effected in regard to the reference of questions to the Committee.  In amendment No. 122 it is provided that the Minister for Justice, or any member of the Committee, may bring matters to the notice of the Committee.  The original sub-section (2) provided only for reference by the Minister for Justice &ldquo;on his own motion or in consequence of complaints or representations made to him.&rdquo;  Also by reason of the form in which this sub-section was drafted, the fitness of a justice to continue to hold his office would have to be called into question if any matter affecting him were to be referred to the Committee. While the conduct of a justice on a particular occasion might be such as to be deserving of censure, it may well be that no question of the justice's fitness for office arises.  Accordingly, the new sub-section (2), which is proposed in amendment No. 122, segregates the matters which may be referred to the Committee under two headings:&mdash; (1) the fitness of the justice for office, having regard to his mental or physical health, and (2) the conduct of the justice.  As regards the functions of the Advisory Committee <Col N="1032" /> in relation to matters referred to them, the principal changes proposed are: (1) When the Committee decides that a justice should be censured they will direct their secretary to convey the censure to the justice and also to inform such persons as the Committee thinks proper.  The original proposals provided that the Minister for Justice should convey the censure.  (2) The idea of transfer by way of punishment has been dropped altogether.  The Committee, on the conduct of a justice being referred to them, may decide (i) that no action be taken, or (ii) that the justice is guilty of misconduct and should be censured, or (iii) that the justice is guilty of grave misconduct and that he is on that account unfit to continue to hold his office.  If the last-mentioned decision is reached the Committee will report accordingly to the Executive Council, who may then give the justice an opportunity of resigning and, if he does not do so, remove him from office.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for allowing a justice to resign whose removal from office is recommended because of the state of his physical or mental health. It is proposed to retain the provisions of sub-section (4) of the section which deal with the question of the transfer of justices for personal reasons not involving misconduct.  Amendment No. 132, however, proposes the insertion, in place of the words &ldquo;so think proper&rdquo; in line 29, of a more specific form of words which, it is felt, will have the effect of making the object of the sub-section clearer and more effectually limiting its application to the type of case to which it is intended that it should apply.  Amendment No. 133 to sub-section (4) is merely consequential on the deletion of certain of the subsequent sub-sections, which is proposed in amendment No. 134. Likewise, amendment No. 143 is consequential on amendment No. 122.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court by leave of the High Court from the decision of the latter court on a case stated by a District Justice. It is possible that points of importance will arise in such cases and also that the decision would affect rights or privileges in many other cases.  A case in point would be where a ratepayer contested the legality of a particular rate by refusing to pay and being sued in consequence by the local authority in the District Court.  The power of the local authority to levy the contested rate would be the real issue at stake in such a case, and it is considered that having regard to the importance of this issue an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Before Section 57 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment and, in particular, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 18 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928 (No. 15 of 1928), as amended by this Act, every appeal which lies to the Circuit Court from an order of the District Court in a criminal case under the Licensing (Ireland) Acts, 1833 to 1927, or under the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1927, shall lie to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose circuit is situate the licensed premises or the club premises on or in respect of which the offence the subject of such order was committed or to which such order otherwise relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to remove the possibility of certain anomalies arising in licensing cases under Sections 56 and 82 as at present drafted.  The latter section makes provision <Col N="1035" /> for appeals in cases arising under Section 26 and 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927.  Appeals in cases which do not come within the scope of these two sections of the 1927 Act would lie, by virtue of the provisions of Section 56 of the Bill, to the Circuit Court Judge in whose Circuit the District Court courthouse is situated.  In certain instances this would not be the judge to whom appeals under Sections 26 and 27 of the 1927 Act would lie by virtue of Section 82.  Again, these latter appeals might lie to a judge other than the judge responsible for the grant or renewal of the licence.  The proposed amendment, the adoption of which would involve the deletion of Section 82, would clear up this position by providing simply that every appeal which lies to the Circuit Court from the District Court in a criminal case under the Licensing Acts or the Registration of Club Acts shall lie to the Judge of the Circuit Court within whose Circuit the particular licensed premises or club premises is situated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 159:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 59, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a person is brought before a justice of the District Court charged with an indictable crime, and such charge either cannot lawfully be or is not disposed of summarily by such justice, and such justice refuses to send such person forward for trial on such charge, then and in every such case it shall be lawful for the Attorney-General to direct that such person be sent forward for trial to a specified court to which such justice could lawfully have so sent such person.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Attorney-General gives a direction under this section that a person be sent forward for trial to any particular court on any particular charge, the Attorney-General shall cause such direction to be communicated to the District Court clerk for the District Court area in which such person was brought before the District Court on such charge, and thereupon such direction shall have the same operation and effect in all respects as an order of a justice of the District Court sending such person forward for trial to such court on such charge would have had, and all persons concerned shall act accordingly.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give power to the Attorney-General, in any case where a District Justice refuses to return for trial a person charged with an indictable offence, to direct that such person be sent forward for trial.

      <P>(2)  The Minister for Justice may, if and when he thinks proper, by order declare that as on and from a specified day (in this section referred to as the appointed day) a specified district prescribed under Section 68 of the Principal Act or under sub-section (3) of Section 47 of the Court Officers Act, 1926 (No. 27 of 1926), shall be styled and known as the Dublin Metropolitan District.</P>
      <P>(3)  If and when the Minister for Justice makes such order as is authorised by the next preceding sub-section of this section, the following provisions shall have effect as on and from the appointed day, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the said Minister may, at any time or times, by order transfer the title &ldquo;Dublin Metropolitan District&rdquo; to any other district prescribed under the said Section 68 or the said Section 47 differing wholly or partially from the district to which such title was previously attached;</P>

    <P>(c)  every reference in Section 72 or Section 74 of the Principal Act to the Police District of Dublin Metropolis (now styled the Dublin Metropolitan Area) shall be construed as a reference to the Dublin Metropolitan District, and the said sections shall have effect accordingly;</P>
    <P>(d)  every enactment which shall, on the day before the appointed day, be in force in and apply to the Dublin Metropolitan area and in and to no other part of Saorstát Eireann shall, on and after the appointed day, cease to apply to the Dublin Metropolitan Area and in lieu thereof shall be in force in and apply to the Dublin Metropolitan District, and every reference in any such enactment to the Police District of Dublin Metropolis or to the Dublin Metropolitan Area shall be construed as a reference to the Dublin Metropolitan District;</P>
    <P>(e)  every enactment which shall, on the day before the appointed day, be in force and apply to the whole of Saorstát Eireann except the Dublin Metropolitan Area shall, on and after the appointed day, be in force in and apply to the whole of Saorstát Eireann except the Dublin Metropolitan District, and every reference in any such enactment to the Police District of Dublin Metropolis or to the Dublin Metropolitan Area shall be construed as a reference to the Dublin Metropolitan District;</P>

    <P>The object of Section 60 of the Bill was to enable the Minister for Justice to carve out the Dublin district of the District Court with as much freedom as he has in carving out the other districts.  Under the 1924 Act, by an accident of drafting, &ldquo;the police district of the Dublin Metropolis,&rdquo; just as it stands, had to be taken as and for the Dublin District Court.  Section 60 was drafted to give the freedom required and Sections 48 and 50 were consequential amendments.  Section 60, however, does not solve the difficulty completely, as it still necessitates the inclusion in the Dublin district of the entire area of the County Borough of Dublin.  This may very possibly be undesirable.  The amendment which is now proposed gives the Minister for Justice absolute freedom to delimit the Dublin district just as he pleases without being bound to include either the whole of the City or the whole of the old Dublin Metropolitan area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 163:</P>
      <P>Before Section 62 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  From and after the passing of this Act, the power of fixing fees conferred by Section 8 of the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891, on the Land Judge with the approval of the Lord Chancellor and the consent of the Treasury shall be exercisable only by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and the power of altering such fees conferred by the said section shall be similarly exercisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> (2)  The reference in sub-section (1) of the said Section 8 to the Land Judge (where that expression secondly occurs in the said sub-section) shall be construed and have effect as a reference to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to transfer to the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power of affixing the fees charged in the Land Registry which, under Section 8 of the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891, was exercised by the Land Judge with the approval of the Lord Chancellor and the consent of the Treasury.  The question of who is now the Land Judge and who is now the Lord Chancellor for the purpose of this section is one which, it is thought, is incapable of being answered with certainty.  The present opportunity is being availed of to remove this uncertainty and to bring the fixing of fees charged in the Land Registry into line with the fixing of court fees in general as provided for in Section 61 of the Bill.  No change has been made in the existing scale of Land Registry fees since the establishment of the Free State.</P>

    <P>These two amendments propose the setting up of a committee for the making of rules to regulate the conduct of the business of the Land Registry.  The power of making rules was vested in the Land Judge, with the approval of the Lord Chancellor, by Section 94 of the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891, and, as in the case of the fees charged in the Registry, doubts arise as to who is now the Land Judge and who is now the Lord Chancellor for this purpose.  The Registrar of Titles has represented from time to time that the existing rules are unsatisfactory in many respects, and could be amended with advantage to everybody concerned.  In view, however, of the uncertainty regarding the rule-making power it has not been possible to do anything in the matter. The adoption of the proposed amendments will remedy this position.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 195 is purely a drafting amendment.  The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was inadvertently inserted in the original draft.  It should obviously be &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  With regard to amendments 198 and 199, there was a good deal of discussion on this matter on the Second Stage.  The object of the amendments is to provide for a unanimous verdict in cases involving the capital penalty.  A good deal of experienced opinion on that point seems to favour the requirement of unanimity in such cases.  A majority of the Supreme Court Judges, the High Court Judges, the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and several other organisations which made representations in the matter, were in favour or requiring unanimity.</P>

      <P>Before Section 74, page 28, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, in a civil proceeding in any court, there are two or more defendants and the plaintiff succeeds against one or more of the defendants and fails against the others or other of the defendants, it shall be lawful for the Court, if having regard to all the circumstances it thinks proper so to do, to order that the defendant or defendants against whom the plaintiff has succeeded shall (in addition to <Col N="1048" /> the plaintiff's own costs) pay to the plaintiff by way of recoupment the cost which the plaintiff is liable to pay and pays to the defendant or defendants against whom he has failed.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that where there are two or more defendants in an action in which the plaintiff succeeds against one or more of the defendants, and fails against the other or others, the court may, if it thinks proper, order the unsuccessful defendant or defendants to recoup the plaintiff the costs he had to pay to the successful defendants.  The Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland last year decided that the courts had the discretionary power to make an order requiring an unsuccessful defendant to recoup the costs which the plaintiff had to pay to the successful co-defendant.  Our own Supreme Court, by a majority decision, decided in a contrary sense in a case which came before it in 1929.  The proposed amendment is, therefore, necessary to remove all doubts upon the point.</P>

      <P>The object of amendment No. 210 is to make the original intention of the section quite clear&mdash;that an action under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1846, may be heard by a judge without a jury, but only if all the parties to the action consent.

    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> (2)  The amendment of sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1929, made by the foregoing sub-section of this section shall have effect as from the passing of the said Act and accordingly the said Section 14 shall be construed and have effect and be deemed always to have had effect with and subject to such amendment.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes the repeal of paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1929, with retrospective effect as from the date of the passing of that Act.  Section 14 provides for the taking of charges by the Agricultural Credit Corporation from persons in possession of holdings which are subject to the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts, and giving to such charges priority over all other charges thereon up to £400.  Paragraph (e) imposes the requirement that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;at the date of such instrument (that is the charge in favour of the Corporation) no <i>lis pendens</i> is registered in respect of such land in the Central Office of the High Court or in the Circuit Court Office for the County or County Borough in which such land is situate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been found impossible to comply with this requirement as, firstly, a<i>lis pendens</i> is only registered in the High Court against the name of the person believed to be the owner, and not against the lands; secondly, there is no registry of <i>lis pendens</i> or machinery for the registration thereof in the Circuit Court.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has represented that this has created a serious situation, as a substantial amount of money has been advanced under the provisions of Section 14 of the 1929 Act.  A number of cases are pending where the Corporation has to take proceedings for the recovery of moneys so advanced, but while paragraph (c) remains as it is proceedings cannot be instituted.  It is, therefore, proposed to repeal paragraph (e) with retrospective effect.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes the repeal of the Judgments Extension Act, 1868. This Act provided that a judgment obtained in the High Court in England might be registered in the High Court in Ireland and vice versa.  The same provisions applied as regards judgments obtained in the Court of Session in Scotland.  It has been recognised that the position in this matter was unsatisfactory, more especially as it has been judicially decided in England that the Act of 1868 does not, since the establishment of the Free State, operate to permit judgments of the Free State High Court to be registered in the English High Court.  On the other hand, it has been judicially decided in the Free State that judgments of the English High Court can be so registered here.  While, therefore, the English judgment creditor can avail himself of the benefits of the Act, a Free State judgment creditor cannot do so.  There is no reciprocity in the matter.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Reserved Commodity (Sewing Cotton) Order, 1935, made on the 2nd day of July, 1935, by the Executive Council under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934 (No. 36 of 1934).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason which the Executive Council had in the making of this Order, which is the first Order of its kind made under the Control of Manufactures Act, was to secure the development of the sewing cotton industry in the West of Ireland.  It was considered to be an industry suitable for establishment in the West of Ireland, but it was anticipated that it would be difficult to get a firm to establish a factory for the purpose in the West unless such an Order was made, as a firm established in a western centre would have certain difficulties in competing with a rival firm established in Dublin or in certain other parts of the Saorstát.  Arrangements were made with a firm for the <Col N="1053" /> establishment of a factory at Westport. This firm is called the Irish Sewing Cotton Company, and is associated with a British company called the British Thread Mills Company, Limited, Leicester.</P>
    <P>The factory at Westport has commenced production on a limited scale at present, but in a manner which will enable it to produce a quantity of cotton thread capable of supplying the requirements of the country, which are estimated to be about £75,000 in value. It is intended, therefore, to issue a licence to that company under Part III of the Control of Manufactures Act. After the Reserved Commodity Order has become effective, the licence will be subject to the conditions set out in the Act, and will have the effect of operating over the affairs of that company a certain measure of control not exercisable in other cases.</P>
    <P>The arrangement which has been made with the company in the matter of the price of its products ensures that the price at their factory at Westport will not be higher than the price for corresponding goods sold to the British thread combine in Great Britain which is, in our opinion, a very satisfactory arrangement.  All the processes of manufacture&mdash;spooling, dyeing, bleaching, mercerising and doubling thread will be carried out at Westport.  All these processes will not be carried out at the initial stages, as workers have got to be trained, but when the full processes are being carried out, as is the intention, it is estimated that employment will be found for 150 or 200 hands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  A considerable proportion of those employed in the factory will be women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be 10 per cent. men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  A number of the employees will be men. But, because of the nature of the industry, it is one which is conducted by women to a great extent in all countries.  In accordance with the <Col N="1054" /> provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act, notice of the intention to make the Order was issued, and all interested parties desiring to do so were invited to make any objections which they thought fit to the making of the Order.  A number of objections were received, but with one exception they were not relevant to the Order. They were objections such as those advanced by persons who were agents for importing firms and directed against the manufacture in the country at all of cotton thread, and not against the proposal to make sewing thread a reserved commodity. There was really only one relevant objection to the making of the Order. That was made by the Irish Thread Manufacturing Company of Dublin, a firm which was established primarily for the purpose of manufacturing linen thread.  They stated that their plant was suitable for the doing of a number of the processes on cotton thread as well, and that they would propose to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained, the main reason why the Order is necessary at all is to enable the industry to be satisfactorily established in the West of Ireland.  Consequently, the Executive Council decided to proceed with the making of the Order despite the objection made.  In any event, I do not know that that objection is being pressed by the Irish Thread Manufacturing Company, which is not yet fully in production in the manufacture of linen thread for which it was established. Another firm&mdash;a British firm &mdash;lodged an objection on the ground that they would also be prepared to make sewing cotton in the Saorstát. That, however, is not a valid objection because the licence issued under a Reserved Commodity Order is not an exclusive licence.  The Order merely ensures that no firm can engage in the manufacture of a reserved commodity without such a licence.  In any event, it would be in accordance with the policy of the Government not to issue a licence to an external firm to manufacture here goods that were being produced, or arrangements for the production of which had been made, <Col N="1055" /> in sufficient quantities to supply the requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any further point on which information is desired at this stage.  The question of issuing a licence to the Westport Company does not arise until after the Reserved Commodity Order has been made.  As to the question as to whether we should make sewing cotton a reserved commodity, it is the opinion of the Executive Council that that should be done, and that it would be established in the West of Ireland.  Were it not for the fact that it is proposed to establish the industry in the West, it would not be the subject of an Order of this kind.  When the Order has been made the powers conferred will be exercised to secure the intention of the Government, that the industry will be established in that area, and that firms wishing to engage in it in the East or in the South will be prevented.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister points out, this is the first occasion on which an Order of this kind has been presented to the House.  We see from the Minister's procedure what an outrageous scheme the whole business is for getting the House to take decisions, not only concerning an Irish industry but some of the most important aspects of Irish industry.  The Minister has placed an Order before us which simply says: &ldquo;Sewing cotton is hereby declared to be a reserved commodity.&rdquo;  The only information we have in the Order is that the Executive Council considers either that this commodity is not being manufactured in Saorstát Eireann, or is not being manufactured to any substantial extent.  Because of that, they consider that it should be established, and therefore they want to make it a reserved commodity.  The Minister extends that to say that they want this to be a reserved commodity, as there is a market of £75,000 here; that a company appeared on the horizon, in some kind of way, and undertakes to establish itself in Westport, to provide the whole of the requirements needed, and to employ approximately <Col N="1056" /> 150 persons at the work, on condition that it is made a reserved commodity, and that no one else will be allowed to have anything to do with its manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And nobody is going to be allowed to have anything to do with the manufacture or the importation of this commodity in future. The Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo; with regard to manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily follow, because the Act gives the Minister power to give a licence to someone else.  But the Minister tells us that his policy is not to give a licence to anyone else, and the attitude of the company, as we understand from the Minister, is that the company is going into this business on condition that no one else is allowed to import cotton thread or allowed to manufacture it.  The Minister said that this company has commenced production, and that while not doing so at present it will carry on spooling, dyeing and bleaching.  A question was put to the Minister by Deputy Dillon on the 19th of June as to whether this company was preparing to manufacture thread from raw cotton, and the Minister was asked to state explicitly if the company had undertaken to manufacture all their thread here, as well as spooling, bleaching and dyeing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will do all processes of manufacture from the yarn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us to the conditions of the licence.  The Minister put a notice in the Press that it was the intention to make this a reserved commodity.  He says that he has got no substantial objections, and that he is going ahead.  He also stated that the licence is not issued. Surely, if an important Irish industry is going to develop in this way, and if Irish capital is induced to put itself into an industry with the protected terms, that no one else will be allowed <Col N="1057" /> to manufacture or to import, the Minister should examine the situation most carefully before we would give that particular type of protection and assistance to any group of people setting themselves up in this matter. The fact that they have to get so much protection shows that there is a considerable amount of danger in going into this business unless they are completely protected.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given no evidence that he has examined the situation, and not only that, but, as it were, covers himself from telling us the conditions under which he is to give a licence by saying that a licence has not yet issued.  When the Minister, in spite of considerable criticism, forced his legislative proposals dealing with reserved commodities generally in the Dáil, he said he was going to impose a number of conditions.  We want to know what conditions he has imposed on this company.  The first question that arises is: Did the Minister go into this question himself?  Did he take the initiative in selecting this as a reserved commodity, or was it because persons applied as the Act provides in Section 20?  The Act says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Any persons who proposes to manufacture a reserved commodity may apply to the Minister for a reserved commodity manufacture licence.</P>
      <P>Was the Minister approached by a body to make this a reserved commodity or did he take the initiative? If he took the initiative I would like to hear what kind of inquiries he carried out, and what he found.  The Act also provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such application shall be in the prescribed form and be made in the prescribed manner, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such application shall state&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the area within which the applicant proposes to manufacture such reserved commodity, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  such other particulars as may be prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us what area the present application is for, and what other particulars he required the <Col N="1058" /> company to supply?  Apparently they applied for a Reserved Commodity Order to cover the whole of the Free State, and apparently it was part of their stipulation that they should be given a monopoly in that area. Again, the Minister requires some other particulars, and I would like to know what the particulars were, and what general information he got.  Section 23 says:</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister grants a reserved commodity manufacture licence in respect of a particular area, the Minister may attach to such licence conditions in respect of all or any of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister is allowing them to manufacture for the whole of the Free State.</P>
    <P>(b)  The extent to which materials for the construction or adaptation by such holder of any factory within such area and the plant, equipment, and apparatus of such factory shall be materials, plant, equipment and apparatus produced or manufactured in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what kind of conditions applied in that respect.</P>
    <P>(c)  The time within which such holder shall commence to manufacture such reserved commodity within such area.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that these people have commenced production.  What does he mean by &ldquo;production&rdquo;?  It was put to the Minister the other day that this company was simply importing thread and spooling it.  I should like to know what the Minister means by &ldquo;production&rdquo;. Does he mean production of thread from raw cotton?  What condition did he impose on the company to begin the manufacture of thread in that way by any particular date?</P>
    <P>(d)  The maximum quantity of such reserved commodity which may be manufactured in any year at the factory in such area in which such holder manufactures such reserved commodity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> The Minister tells us that £75,000 is the annual market for this trade here. Will the Minister say what conditions he imposed on this company as regards the amount of thread they will manufacture in their first, second and third years, and when he will require them to be in a position to manufacture, from the raw yarn, the full requirements of the country?  The Minister may impose restrictions with regard to the amount that may be sold in any year.  Has he done anything in that connection?  He may impose conditions with regard to the minimum quantity to be manufactured.  That arises under the other point.  He may impose conditions as regards the maximum price which may be charged by such holder for any such reserved commodity.  He may impose conditions with regard to the nature and quality of such reserved commodity.  Dealing with these two conditions&mdash;maximum price and nature and quality&mdash;Deputy Dillon drew attention in the House on the 19th June to quotations that had been given by one of these firms.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the present moment, if my information is correct, quotations have been given by these firms for certain types of thread.  According to these quotations, threads that are available in Great Britain at 112/- to 120/- are going to cost 200/- here; threads that are quoted in Great Britain at from 48/- to 52/- are going to cost us here 60/-; and thread that is costing from 52/- to 58/- in Great Britain is going to cost 80/- here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to say that if the industry were going to convert the raw material into the finished product, a case might be made for permitting the Irish manufacturer to charge 150/- or 160/- for what costs in Great Britain 120/- because he would be going into a business which requires technical skill and would be in a competition with firms which had led the world in that trade. These quotations were, I understand, already given to firms requiring thread here and the matter was brought directly to the Minister's attention by Deputy Dillon on the 19th June.  As regards the nature and quality of the <Col N="1060" /> reserved commodity and the general difficulties which the users of thread in this country expected they would have to face, Deputy Dillon said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand that one of these concessionaires has informed thread buyers that if they want coloured thread&mdash;coloured thread is a very important raw material of the readymade clothing industry&mdash;they must buy not less than six gross of a shade. The Irish producers will not be in a position to furnish less than 6 gross of a particular shade.  That means about £20 worth.  Heretofore, the ready-made clothing manufacturer could get his choice of 260 shades, in 5/- lots of any shade, from a central agency for a world-wide firm of English thread manufacturers.  I have repeatedly pointed out that this system of imposing tariffs without careful inquiry into the probable consequences of their imposition very often does far more harm to established industries than you can hope to balance by the good you are going to do in setting up the new industry you have in mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure it has been pointed out to the Minister that some manufacturers have very considerable difficulty in getting the right type of thread to suit their machines and that very often it takes years of experience to arrive at the proper type.  With shirt manufacturers and, probably, with clothing manufacturers, the thread problem is not simply one of price. However, the Minister has power to control the price and the nature and quality of reserved commodities.  The licence may also contain conditions regarding the mode of manufacture and packing of such commodity.  It may also contain conditions as regards the employment of Saorstát nationals. The Minister was not able to tell Deputy Norton what sort of people were going to be employed in the factory, though it was stated that women would dominate the factory. Surely, in asking the House to give a monopoly to a particular firm and practically to exclude the importation of all other manufactures of that type, the Minister should come to the <Col N="1061" /> House better equipped with information than he has come in this case, when he is not able to give the House an idea of the percentage of employees who will be women in this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister may include in the licence a condition dealing with the extent to which the capital invested in the business is, from time to time, to be owned by nationals in Saorstát Eireann.  He has not given us any idea of the amount of capital involved in the establishment of this new industry.  The licence may contain a condition as to extent to which the management of such business is, from time to time, to be controlled by nationals of Saorstát Eireann and the extent to which the directors of the company shall be nationals of Saorstát Eireann.  There may be also a condition as to the return to be made to the Minister and as to the taking of samples.  There is a general provision under Section 25 that the wages paid by the holder of a &ldquo;reserved commodity manufacture licence&rdquo; to persons employed by him shall not be less than would be payable if such business were carried on under a contract between the Minister and such holder containing a fair-wages clause. The Minister has not told us anything as regards the rate of wages which will be paid in this establishment or the nature of the general wages bill.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which the Minister might address himself in dealing with this motion. On the 19th June, the Minister told Deputy Dillon that cotton thread was not yet being manufactured in Saorstát Eireann, but that the issue of licences for the importation of cotton thread free of duty was suspended while he was considering whether or not the issue of such licences in future would be justified.  Does the Minister propose to continue to hold up the issue of licences for the importation of cotton thread?  Will he say if there is a complete hold-up or whether the people running this company are getting a permit for the importation of cotton thread free of duty?  If so, will the licence continue to be issued <Col N="1062" /> to them for the duty-free importation of cotton thread?  If licences are not being issued at present for the importation of cotton thread free of duty, will the Minister say to what extent cotton thread is being imported at all and to what tariff the cotton thread that is being imported is subject?  In this case, we have a sample of the way in which the Minister approaches these subjects.  So far as we know, the Minister has been simply approached by somebody who said, &ldquo;If you give us a monopoly we will set up machinery for the manufacture of cotton thread?&rdquo;  He thought over the matter and issued an Order simply stating that cotton thread would be a reserved commodity, without going into details as to the amount of capital involved, the wages to be paid, the type of stuff to be turned out, or the extent to which the present requirements of the thread trade in the country were going to be met.  The Minister has given no indication, good, bad, or indifferent, that he has examined these matters at all.  That is why I say the whole procedure for which power was taken in the Control of Manufactures Act to deal with Irish industry in this particular way is simply outrageous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has displayed remarkable skill to-day in not telling the House the conditions which he proposes to impose on this company which is to manufacture cotton thread at Westport.  We are entitled to know from the Minister what precise conditions he has in mind in granting a licence to this firm.  It is true that the Minister has power to issue other licences, but it is equally true that if the Minister once grants a licence to the Westport firm, allows it to capitalise itself heavily, to purchase machinery, to build up its hopes on the assumption that it will be the one firm engaged in the manufacture of this commodity, the Minister will be confronted with all kinds of pressure, political and otherwise, to ensure that no other firm will be allowed to operate in competition with the Westport firm. I think, therefore, that the issue of a licence by the Minister under this Order <Col N="1063" /> virtually means that the State is conferring monopoly powers on this factory at Westport.  While there might, in certain circumstances, be some plausible reason for granting such monopoly powers to ensure the manufacture of a commodity, we ought to be very careful before we confer on a privately-owned monopoly the right to engage in the manufacture of this reserved commodity.</P>
      <P>I, personally, am not in sympathy with the idea of the State conferring monopoly powers on a privately-owned industry.  Neither in this country nor in any other country has there been any benefit to the plain people or to the community in general derived from conferring monopolies on privately-owned undertakings.  In many countries, and in many instances in many countries, there has been abundant evidence that monopolistic control over a particular industry by a private group has had serious effects on the well-being of the community, and on the circumstances under which that community may purchase the products of these undertakings.  As a matter of fact, many countries have found it necessary to control by specific legislation, and even then the control has been found to be very inadequate, the trusts and monopolies which have been allowed to come into existence, either by the exercise of political pressure on an Administration to secure such monopoly, or by the creation of highly-capitalised undertakings which, in the course of time, have eliminated their competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of a concession to a firm to engage in the manufacture of this commodity at Westport virtually means that the State is conferring a substantial advantage on that firm an advantage which will, in fact, not be conferred upon any other firm, and we ought to know from the Minister what conditions he has in mind in contemplating the granting of a licence of that kind.  The Minister stated that this firm would probably be able to supply the home demand for £75,000 worth of cotton thread.  We ought to know when the whole of the home <Col N="1064" /> demand will be satisfied; how soon the firm proposes to undertake the manufacture of all ranges of that commodity; how soon it hopes to be in a position to supply the whole home market and, generally, under what conditions the commodity is to be manufactured.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister that it was expected that this firm would employ 150 employees, but the Minister did not seem to know how many of these employees would be women, how many would be girls, how many would be boys, and how many would be men.  If we are starting out to grant concessions to private undertakings, surely it is desirable that we should have information of that kind and not allow these factories to be carried on under unsatisfactory conditions. I do not say it is the intention of the proprietors of this factory to put into operation unsatisfactory conditions of wages or of labour, but, at all events, we ought, as far as this House can ensure it, to have some precise information that it is intended to control in a very drastic way the type of employment afforded in the factory.  The State has been altogether too prone to grant concessions, either in the form of very definite tariff preference or by the indiscriminate use of its own money, to private enterprise without being satisfied as to the conditions of employment in these industries.  I had one recent notorious case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of course, the Minister does not want to hear this case.  That is why he wants to have my reference to it regarded as out of order.

      <P>And the Minister will have no guard of honour if he goes down to that factory, as he had the other day at a Rathmines factory. Let the Minister go down and investigate these conditions.  Let the Minister send his inspectors down to investigate the conditions.  Let the Minister get the wages books produced and we shall see the rates of wages paid.  The Minister comes in here full of mock indignation at what he calls an attack on Irish industry. It is no such thing as an attack on Irish industry.  It is an attack upon the bad sweating type of employer in that industry.  It should be the Minister's concern to eliminate that type of employer rather than to stand up to make a defence for him.  At all events, as far as I am concerned, I shall expose that type of case at every opportunity and I shall make sure, as far as my voice can do it, that Irish workers will not be meekly compelled to accept these conditions. They certainly will not be allowed meekly to accept these conditions from firms which are substantially assisted by the State.  I am not much concerned whether the Minister objects to the denunciation of that particular type of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the Minister an opportunity of doing that now and <Col N="1068" /> of assuring us that we are not going to have the same thing repeated in this instance?  At all events, Sir, State assistance to private employers, in my view, should only be granted when we are satisfied that decent conditions in respect of labour, decent working conditions, obtain in the industries to be protected or in any way assisted.  In this instance there has been a singular disinclination on the part of the Minister to give us particulars as to the conditions which he proposes to impose in the licences, which he is authorised by this Order to issue.  I think we are entitled to claim in a matter of this kind that we ought to have from the Minister detailed particulars as to the conditions which he proposes to lay down.</P>
      <P>One would imagine, for instance, that when coming to the House with an Order of this kind&mdash;an Order under which precedents will be set up, because it is the first&mdash;the Minister would have some precise information as to the kind of people it is proposed to employ in the factory.  He said that it was intended that 150 hands should be employed.  I asked one simple question of the Minister on that point&mdash;how many of the employees will be women and how many will be men?  The Minister said he did not know.  Surely this elementary information should be obtained from the Minister.  Surely we ought to know the kind of industry to which we are going to grant a monopoly, because one could be very enthusiastic in granting a monopoly, if there are to be well paid men employed in the factory rather than underpaid women?  Yet the Minister has no information on that aspect of the matter. I asked another simple question&mdash; would ten per cent. of the employees be men, but even expressed as a percentage, the Minister could give no information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I say we are entitled to have some idea, some clear picture as to the kind of industry to which we are going to facilitate the Minister to grant a licence.  It is not unreasonable, when you are going to exclude competition from within and without <Col N="1069" /> the country, that we should endeavour, as in this instance, to enthrone conditions which are as near satisfactory as this House can make them.  I would say that one of the objects we ought to try to achieve in that respect would be to ensure that as many male employees would secure employment in this industry as possible.  Recently, on another Bill, the Minister told us of the desirability of checking the tendency of women to enter industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. Séamus Bourke Mr. Séamus Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Séamus Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise this matter on the adjournment because I was not altogether satisfied with the answer the Minister gave to my question yesterday.  It seemed to me pretty obvious from the answer on that occasion that the Minister intends to depart from the precedents which were laid down when we established the Greater Dublin Commission of Inquiry and that he intends to implement, or pretend to implement, Section 101 of the Greater Dublin Act, by setting up what is to all intents and purposes a Departmental tribunal.  I am aware, and I am glad, that Mr. Gavan Duffy is being appointed on that tribunal. He is the one outside individual.  I presume Mr. Gavan Duffy will be the chairman of the tribunal, but in any case he will not be in a position to add very much from a constructive point of view to the deliberations of that body. I presume most of the constructive work will be done by the other members. I yield to nobody in this House in my admiration for the ability, the zeal and the industry of the officials of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Certainly, in all matters which fall properly and suitably within their functions as civil servants, I have got the greatest respect for their opinions and decisions but I consider that this is really not a matter which should be disposed of solely by permanent officials.  We all know that civil servants are, by their training and experience, men of caution.  The one thing that they shy from is change or innovation of any kind.  Their natural tendency is to <Col N="1071" /> keep along the well marked-out highways and let other people blaze new trails.  Their mental bent is rather to criticise and to analyse than to create or to initiate, and we cannot expect anything very novel or very bold from a body constituted as this body is constituted.</P>
      <P>As regards the two individuals from the Department who have been selected, I do not think a better selection could have been made.  Certainly, as regards Mr. Courtney, I can scarcely conceive of the Tribunal functioning without his being on it.  Owing to his experience and training in this country, there is nobody more suitable than he for a position on that particular Tribunal. We must remember, however, that Mr. Courtney is probably one of the most hard-worked officials in this country at the present time, and I do not see how he is going to have the time to devote to this particular work. If there were several other officials to assist him, so that he need not devote all his time to it, it would be a different matter, but with only one other official and with, presumably, the Chairman, Mr. Gavan Duffy, I do not see how he would be able to reach upon this extra work.  I thought that, when the Minister was going to set up this body, he would refer back to the original Greater Dublin Commission and that, if he did not exactly readopt that personnel, he would get a body of equal prestige and independence to do this work.  The questions that will have to be decided by this Tribunal are amongst the most important that will have to be decided by this generation.  The City of Dublin happens to have the distinction of being probably the most complete Capital in the world, in this respect: that there is no activity or no function of national importance in this country that has not its head centre here in Dublin; so that, whatever happens in Dublin is of vital importance to the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister is thoroughly aware of the fact that there are a great many problems in Dublin which are becoming acute at the present moment and which later on may become desperate. <Col N="1072" /> We have a very rapidly increasing population in the City of Dublin.  The population has been increasing by leaps and bounds since the Free State was established, and the pace at which that population is increasing has become accelerated owing to various circumstances: to begin with, owing to the stoppage of emigration to the United States, the surplus population from the country districts that originally flowed into the American cities are all being jammed up here in Dublin now.  The industrial policy of the Government, if it leads to anything, is bound to attract the surplus population of the country to the city, and, likewise, their agricultural policy is bound to drive people from the country into the city, because very few people will be prepared to put up with the standard of living which is being left to the agricultural population owing to the Government's particular policy.  This increase of population is leading to various other problems.  There has been a marvellous development in housing construction in this city, and that development, unfortunately, is along haphazard and chaotic lines.  That development also is likely to become more rapid than in the past.  I see that, already, in the United States, they have pre-fabricated houses.  These houses are constructed before they go on the site at all, and can be put together in the same number of hours as it took months to put houses together previously. We are likely to find that development over here, and if there is not some control over that development we are going to have confusion still worse confounded in the city.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of our water supply in the City of Dublin, which has already given food for very serious consideration to the responsible authorities.  How is that to be dealt with?  Our traffic problem also, if we are not to have a continuation of accidents like what happened at Mount Street Bridge, will have to be dealt with very drastically.  Then there is the question of parks and recreation grounds for the population. All those matters and kindred matters <Col N="1073" /> of public health and so forth will have to be considered, and we want the tribunal to go into those matters and go into them thoroughly.  The question is whether four independent, absolutely unconnected, and uncoordinated bodies such as we have looking after local government in the County of Dublin at the present time are best suited to deal with that problem or whether, in view of the report of the Greater Dublin Commission, the time has not now arrived to set up some co-ordinating link, if not with executive powers, at least with consultative powers, to try to bring about some uniformity and some better regulated system in the development of the various municipal bodies that are responsible for the government of that area.  The Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, for instance, are already seeking wider boundaries.  They want to include more territory under their jurisdiction, and it is a question whether that matter should be dealt with solely from the point of view of Dún Laoghaire or whether the body should not advert to the position of the boundaries of Greater Dublin as a whole.  These are only some of the many points that might be raised on this very important matter, and I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us that the very wide powers that this body will have, for summoning witnesses and hearing their evidence, will be fully exercised and that this tribunal which the Minister is setting up is not merely being appointed in order to give statutory sanction to decisions which have already been arrived at in the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give the Deputy the assurances he asks for as to the scope of the inquiry right away.  The inquiry committee is not being set up merely to implement decisions already arrived at.  The Committee, I hope, will hear many different points of view, but certainly, so far as I can influence its work, it will be ready and willing to hear all responsible bodies that wish to come before it to offer evidence. <Col N="1074" /> There is already in existence, as the Deputy knows, as a result of the activities of the Greater Dublin Commission, which I think the Deputy himself had some responsibility for setting up, and which sat from the year 1924 to 1926, a great amount of information available.  That Commission heard a great deal of evidence.  It sat over a long period of time and did a considerable amount of work.  All the evidence it collected is still available. That valuable material relating to the Dublin Council, and local bodies, is still in existence.  The commission, or committee, now set up under the statute will examine into the experience that has been gained as a result of the work of the Greater Dublin Act, and the organisations set up under it.  It will take the evidence already given, and examine how the new institution or institutions with altered boundaries and revised powers have reacted to the powers given them.  That will be examined first of all.  Then the Commission will invite anyone who has evidence to offer, or criticism to make, to come before them.  Every proper method will be adopted for the hearing of evidence, and all the new matters that may be brought before them will be sifted.  This tribunal will be a competent body to sift the evidence.  It will be an experienced body in local administration, and will advise the Minister as to what steps they think are necessary further to improve local government administration within the area referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission will have no other powers.  They will have power to take evidence and they will be asked to report, and to submit their report to the Minister.  That will be the extent of their powers.  They will not have power to deal with the various problems such as the growth of population and the important problems of transit and housing.  These are very big and important problems but no commission set up under that section of the Act of 1930&mdash;the Greater Dublin Act&mdash;would have such powers.  They will have the powers suggested in the Act of examining into the new situation created by that Act, and how it <Col N="1075" /> is working.  They will have powers to ask for evidence and to take evidence, and make a report upon the situation as they find it and probably make recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Deputy speak so well of the personnel of the Committee set up.  I think it is a good Committee.  I was very much exercised in my mind as to the kind of committee that should be set up.  I had the views of all kinds of people as to the committee to be set up.  I think if we had set up a body like the Commission of 1924-26, we would be only repeating their work and going over work done by that former body, which would simply mean a duplication of evidence already given. We have all that available and it can and will be used.  I think with a committee partly independent and partly official we have a better balanced body and one that will do its work efficiently and expeditiously. In thinking out the type of committee to be set up I considered all the suggestions, and almost demands, made upon me to have all types of organisations.</P>
    <P>If I were to start to set up what would be called a representative body <Col N="1076" /> I would require a body as large as the Dáil if I was to satisfy the extreme demands made upon me by some people.  All sorts and conditions of societies demanded representation.  I said it could not be done.  I said I would set up a small and expert body with outside control.  That is what the Committee is.  The Chairman will exercise a considerable amount of control. He takes an interest in the subject and he knows his subject.  He will be the guide.  He will not be led by anyone but by the evidence before him and his own experience.  I agree that civil servants are not people who by their training would be out for revolutionary ideas.  That is not the role of the civil servant; but the Committee of which Mr. Courtney and Mr. Baker are members will listen to all suggestions put up to them.  The Chairman will be there to hold the balance.  It is possible that the ideas of the other members may be on the conservative side but I do not think the Chairman has ever been noted as a great conservative and, therefore, there will be a good balance and I think the work will be done more efficiently and expeditiously by the Committee I have set up than any other body.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.20 p.m. until Tuesday, at 3 p.m., July 23rd.</P>
