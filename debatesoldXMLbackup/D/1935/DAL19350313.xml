    </Speaker>
    <P>The frequency with which applicants for unemployment assistance are required personally to attend at a local office of my Department, or whether <Col N="677" /> they need attend at all, depends upon the distances at which they reside from the nearest local office.  The rules are that applicants residing within two miles of the local office must, in order to prove unemployment and to receive payment, attend daily; those resident between two and four miles distant must for the same purposes attend on alternate days; applicants residing between four and six miles are required to attend only once a week, whilst those residing more than six miles distant are not required to attend at all, arrangements being in operation by which they may make their applications, prove unemployment and receive payment through the post.  I am not convinced that under the existing arrangements applicants resident in the district mentioned in the Deputy's question are exposed to the hardships suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated by me in the debate on the 5th instant with reference to the Supplementary Estimate for the Vote for Export Bounties and Subsidies, it is possible, in view of the increase in the exportable surplus of eggs and the actual and possible restrictions on the quantities which other countries will take from us, that in the near future the present rates of bounty on eggs will have to be reduced.</P>
      <P>If, as is practically certain, an increase in the present bounty were to encourage further production, the absence of markets in which the additional exportable surplus could be disposed of would react disastrously on the price of eggs.  It is obvious that the securing of a reasonable price to poultry keepers can, in the circumstances, best be secured if production is limited to such quantities as the available markets could just about absorb.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £35,985 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána (No. 7 of 1925).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the net additional sum required for this service.  The printed Estimate in the hands of Deputies will show the various sub-heads of the Vote for which the increased provision is required. The gross total of the increase is £41,985.  As against that it is anticipated there will be a saving of £6,000 <Col N="689" /> on other sub-heads.  In sub-head (B) the increased expenditure is estimated at £7,550, and it is made up as follows:&mdash;Rent allowances, £1,000; plain clothes allowance, £2,800; detective allowance, £2,000; transport allowance, £500; Gaeltacht allowance, £1,100, and Miscellaneous, £150.  The Gaeltacht allowance was granted last August to all members of the force stationed in the Irish-speaking division which was created in West Galway. This allowance was based on 7½ per cent. of the members' pay.  The increased provision for rent allowance is due to the fact that the number of marriages of sergeants and guards during the year was greater than was anticipated.  The other increases have resulted from the necessity of employing a large number of men on plain clothes, detective and transport duties.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-heads (C) and (D)&mdash; Subsistence Allowances and Locomotion Expenses&mdash;the increased expenditure under these two heads is due to increased duties imposed on the Guards arising from activities with which, I think, Deputies are conversant. Much of it is due to interference with court officers in protecting sales and so on.  As regards sub-head (E)&mdash; Clothing and Equipment&mdash;the greater proportion of the increased provision required is the result of an alteration in the accounting arrangement made by the Department of Finance under which supplies of cloth held in stock by the Post Office Stores Department became a charge on this year's Vote.  No provision had been made in the original Estimate for this payment to the Post Office, which amounted to £8,000.  The sum of £1,615 is required to provide clothing for additional recruits whose recruitment was authorised during the year.  The increase under sub-head (H) &mdash; Transport and Carriage &mdash; is mainly required to cover the cost of additional motor transport which it was necessary to provide in respect of those matters to which I have already referred.  As regards sub-head (HH)&mdash; Garage and Workshop&mdash;this is a new sub-head to provide for cost of equipment for a garage and workshop which it was found necessary to erect at the Depôt.  In the case of sub-head (N)&mdash;<Col N="690" /> Incidental Expenses&mdash;the additional sum of £2,619 is required for the purpose set out in the details of the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin my comments on this Supplementary Estimate by congratulating the Minister for Justice on his recovery and expressing my pleasure at seeing him back here again.  I propose, in connection with this Supplementary Estimate, to make some further remarks on the subject of the handling by the Gárda Síochána and by the authorities generally of the agitation in County Longford to which we were making reference in this House last week.  I must say I am sorry the President of the Executive Council is not here to stand over some of the statements that he made on Thursday last on the Motion for the Adjournment. On that occasion he worked himself up into a high state of moral fervour and indignation at the improper, irresponsible and disgraceful conduct of myself and, by reflection, my Party, in raising the matter of the Edgeworthstown shooting, and in making the case against the Government that we made in connection with the shooting.  He accused me of being wise only after the event and suggested that I was really debarred from criticising the Government, because I had not warned them before the event took place what was likely to happen. My first knowledge of any agitation at all in Edgeworthstown was when the actual murder took place; and as regards the representative of that constituency in our Party, Deputy MacEoin, he was apart from and outside the events that were taking place in that locality since many months before the murder.  He took part in a deputation, not to Mr. More O'Ferrall, but to his predecessor, Mr. Montague.  He was convinced on that occasion that the town tenants had no case and thereafter he stood aside; and he was in no position to give first-hand information to the Government about the dangers of the situation.  He has stated publicly within the last few days that a Fianna Fáil Deputy for <Col N="691" /> the constituency, Deputy Victory, told him after the meeting held by the I.R.A. that in his opinion there would be shooting; and also that, after the murder had taken place, Deputy Victory said to him: &ldquo;I told you so; I told you there would be shooting.&rdquo;  Consequently, there may be grounds for complaint by the Government against Deputy Victory, if he failed to warn them&mdash;I do not know whether he did or did not fail to warn them&mdash;but there does not appear to be the least excuse for blaming the Opposition.  In any case, it is rather a droll conception of the duties of the Government that they who are paid to be the guardians of public order should expect Opposition Deputies to reinforce whatever information they would be receiving in the ordinary course from the Civic Guards or from their own organisation in the constituency.</P>
      <P>The case that I attempted to make against the Government was this: That there was an overwhelming proof against them of negligence and that there were, at any rate, <i>prima facie</i> grounds for attributing that negligence in part to the improper influence of Party considerations.  Let us consider again whether it is just or unjust to accuse the Government of neglect in this matter.  My complaint against them rests upon three grounds.</P>
      <P>The first is that they failed to prosecute at the time when the Town Tenants' Association originally invited the I.R.A. to appear on the scene.  I said the other day, and I repeat, that that in itself, coming as it did after ordinary methods of agitation had been exhausted, constituted a grave threat to the public peace.  There could be no point in calling in a body, which boasts of possessing arms and claims the right to use those arms, except to substitute methods of violence for constitutional methods,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I complain of the failure to prosecute at the time that the meeting was held under the auspices of the I.R.A. when highly inflammatory language was used.  There can be no suggestion that the Government were <Col N="692" /> not aware of what took place at that meeting.  The report of it was published at any rate in two newspapers, <i>An Phobhlacht</i> and the <i>Longford Leader</i> and Civic Guards were present at it who, I have no doubt, made reports to their superiors in the usual way of what was said.  The statements reported in the newspapers were in themselves very inflammatory and obviously incitements to breaches of the peace.  I am informed, however, that other statements were made of a much more violent character which were not reported in the newspapers&mdash;statements, for example, such as these: &ldquo;It has got to be Jerry's blood or ours,&rdquo; referring to Mr. More O'Ferrall; and: &ldquo;We will only leave one tree in his place and that will be the one we will hang him on.&rdquo;  The President of the Executive Council replied that language such as that was not taken seriously and that it has been the policy of the Government only to prosecute when there was an overt breach of the peace.  I wonder if that is true.  If so, I wonder when that policy began and when it ended; because I seem to remember prosecutions on the strength merely of language used when there had been no breach of the peace other than the use of violent language.  I remember, for instance, the prosecution of General O'Duffy on a farfetched suggestion that he was inciting to the murder of the President of the Executive Council.  The Government did not on that occasion wait until General O'Duffy or some of his supporters were discovered wandering around Blackrock or outside Government Buildings with Mills bombs in their hands.  Even since this murder I seem to recollect within the last week a prosecution of farmers from County Cork on the ground of the language they used, not on the ground of any violence they had actually committed. There is this contrast between the two cases: that while the Government might be excused for not taking seriously wild language, if wild language was used, that came from such a person as, shall we say, Mr. Brooke Brasier, ex-T.D.&mdash;indeed the prosecuting counsel, Deputy <Col N="693" /> Geoghegan, went to the length of saying that he could hardly take seriously wild language coming from a person with a tame, law-abiding record such as Mr. Brooke Brasier boasted of&mdash;on the other hand, there is not quite the same justification for refusing to believe it possible that a body like the I.R.A. meant what they said. Those people who were invited into Edgeworthstown were not &ldquo;Eloquent Dempsys.&rdquo;  They were men who have been extolled in this House by a Fianna Fáil Deputy from Kerry in the presence of the President of the Executive Council as the real people who ought to be in control of this House and this country.  After &ldquo;the real people&rdquo; arrived at Edgeworthstown and used the sort of language that was used at the meeting to which I refer, is it so unreasonable to expect that the Government might have taken it seriously?  Therefore, I cannot acquit them from blame for failure to prosecute at the time when the I.R.A. were first invited in and again at the time when this meeting took place where highly inflammatory language was used.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I blame them for failure to give reasonable protection to the man whose life was threatened.</P>
    <P>The President of the Executive Council informed us that Mr. More O'Ferrall had told members of the Gárda that he did not want police around his house.  Mr. More O'Ferrall saw that statement of the President's in the newspapers and he forthwith wrote to me to say it was untrue and that no such protection had been asked for, offered to him or refused by him.  I was so taken aback at this violent contradiction of what the President said that I wrote to him to make assurance doubly sure and asked him whether, if he had not been offered such protection by the Civic Guards, he had been offered it by any authority at any part of the proceedings&mdash;whether he had been offered protection near his house or in his house, and again he replied to me quite definitely in the negative.  It is impossible to suppose that Mr. More O'Ferrall is telling an untruth in this <Col N="694" /> matter.  He could have no motive for doing so.  I can only suppose that the President of the Executive Council was misinformed.</P>
    <P>The President of the Executive Council stated that if danger was to be apprehended as the result of these I.R.A. activities&mdash;all the violent speeches, all the drilling, all the recruiting and all the general atmosphere of hatred and violence that was being created&mdash;such danger would naturally arise only at the moment when an attempt was being made to collect rents or to evict persons who refused to pay rents, that is to say, presumably, in the broad daylight in the streets of the town of Edgeworthstown.  It seems to me if the President really believes that, he must be a very simple man.  It seems to me that what has taken place is much more in accord with the usual technique of the I.R.A. than what the President said he would have expected to be the natural form that violence would take.  A nocturnal incursion into a private house under cover of darkness is a not unfamiliar form of activity on the part of the organisation to which I am referring.  I think it is a form of activity which preeminently the Government should have felt it was desirable to guard against. Therefore, it seems to me that the case against the Department of Justice is overwhelming as regards negligence in this matter.</P>
    <P>Whether the negligence was due to Party considerations is another question, a question on which I would heartily wish to acquit them, but I repeat that there is a strong <i>prima facie</i> case for them to meet in that respect.  The President of the Executive Council suggested that a proportion of the Edgeworthstown Town Tenants' Association were supporters of this Party and that that had, indeed, been indicated by the fact that General MacEoin had been selected to be their spokesman.  Now, that was a very misleading statement on the President's part.  There was, as I have said, a deputation to Mr. More O'Ferrall's predecessor, a long time ago&mdash;I believe some time in the summer of last year&mdash;and on that occasion <Col N="695" /> both the local Deputies, Deputy Victory and Deputy MacEoin, participated and spoke.  It was not a case of Deputy MacEoin having been selected at all.  It was a case of both local Deputies, in the normal course, being asked to accompany the Edgeworthstown tenants on that occasion. My information is that the lion's share of the talking was done, not by Deputy MacEoin, but by Deputy Victory.  If there were some supporters of the Opposition amongst the Edgeworthstown town tenants, I am informed that they had no hand or part in inviting the I.R.A. to come and take up their case.  My information on that subject is borne out by the fact that in the newspaper reports of the first meeting which the I.R.A. held in the district, the speakers consisted solely of imported representatives of the I.R.A. and of local men who had been actively associated with Fianna Fáil.  The local speakers mentioned in the report I have before me are Mr. M. Maloney, Mr. Hugh Devine and Mr. R. Tuite, county councillor&mdash; all, I understand, active supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party up to that time, and some of them active supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party until this moment.  On the occasion that the I.R.A. were invited into the constituency, the gentleman who was in the chair was Mr. James Ledwith who, I believe, has also been an active supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The discussion which took place a few days ago at the Longford County Council, when a resolution was introduced condemning this murder, is a pretty plain indication of the direction which Fianna Fáil sympathies in that locality take.  Further, the mere fact that the local Deputy who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, was so much in touch with the situation, as we have heard he was, and that nothing was done on his initiative to prevent mischief coming from it, gives additional force to the suspicion that Party considerations had a sinister effect in preventing the situation at Edgeworthstown being treated as seriously as it should have been <Col N="696" /> treated.  If I am wrong, however, in imputing Party influence, I shall be only too happy to withdraw the imputation.  There is, however, a <i>prima facie</i> case which requires to be answered in the interests of the good name of the country and in the interests of the Government themselves.</P>
    <P>What has occurred at Edgeworthstown is, unfortunately, only one symptom of a disease that is widespread throughout the country.  The Government take the view that serious notice need be taken only of overt breaches of the peace by members of the Irish Republican Army.  Now, I should rather say that overt breaches of the peace were the least dangerous or the least objectionable form of their activities.  When there is an overt breach of the peace, it is because they have had a failure.  It is because their general policy of intimidation has broken down.  Where intimidation has succeeded, there is no need of an overt breach of the peace. When a murder like this takes place, there is at least this much good about it, that it horrifies the country and brings it some distance towards facing the realities.  When an overt breach of the peace takes place, the worst that can happen to any individual one of us, whom that breach of the peace affects, is that we are given the opportunity&mdash;even the privilege&mdash;of losing our lives in defending this country against a most horrible menace.  But when no such breaches of the peace are taking place there is, none the less, a poison steadily spreading over the country, causing general degeneration and deterioration and lowering the whole standard of our civilisation.</P>
    <P>That is a state of things for which the Government cannot escape responsibility. This organisation is their nursling&mdash;the nursling of President de Valera's past&mdash;and they have the responsibility for its activities in the present that comes from their feebleness in dealing with the organisation and that comes even more from the confused atmosphere of hatred and ill-will and general muddleheadedness that is created by their &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; about a Thirty-Two County Republic.</P>

      <P>The Estimate before the House is relatively small and is specifically itemised.  The Deputy is aware that general policy, even of the Department of Justice, should not normally be discussed on a Supplementary Estimate, particularly in view of the fact that the main Estimate will be before this House within a few weeks.  To go into the question of a 32-county Republic is surely travelling far from the Vote.</P>

      <P>I shall not go into the question, Sir.  I only referred to it in passing, and in conclusion, because the general policy of the Government, which frenzies the minds of these unfortunate men who take part in an organisation like the I.R.A., cannot be disregarded when you come to consider how to cure the whole situation.  It is not sensible to be angry with such people.  Their minds are diseased and frenzied.  They are pathological specimens. One should pity them rather than be angry with them.  But until the Government takes its courage in its hands and applies itself to remedying the whole situation in the spirit of a doctor treating a deeply rooted disease, then we must expect that the civilisation of the country will go on deteriorating.</P>

      <P>As my name has been drawn into this Edgeworthstown question, both on the adjournment debate and again to-day, I feel called upon to make a brief statement for the general information of the House.  I regret very much that Deputy MacEoin is not in his place to-day, because I would much rather say the things I have to say in his presence than in his absence.  I do say, however, that the General MacEoin I knew before the Truce is a very different personality to-day, and were it not for some statements he made in Mullingar on Sunday, as reported in Monday's <i>Independent,</i> I would not intervene to-day.  Here are the words that General MacEoin used on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A certain number of people in Edgeworthstown then decided to <Col N="698" /> discuss the position again, but a revolutionary body was brought in with consequences which they all condemned and deplored.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those words are very different from the words he used to the members of the deputation after the interview with Mr. Montague that we hear so much about.</P>
    <P>These words were handed to me to-day and I have a clear recollection of Deputy MacEoin using them on that occasion, and I am sure that the deputation will bear out that the General used these words on the day we came back from the interview.  The following are the words he used:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter lies in your own hands now.  You must fight it.  If I, as an old soldier and campaigner, were leading a column now as I did in years past, I would have this fight won inside of 24 hours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the class of statement we hear from the Opposition to-day?  I was then trying to keep the peace in the district, but there was another atmosphere abroad at the time.  We had Deputy MacEoin advocating dictatorship and we had the people supporting him trying to create turmoil and confusion in the country.  Those were his words after the interview with Mr. Montague.  But Deputy MacEoin is a different man to the man I knew before the Treaty.  He is a very different man now.  In connection with this question of the town tenants, the words I used were that there were times we had met when we did not want everybody to know it, but that we were meeting now and we wanted everybody to see that we were meeting and to know that we were there. There was nothing revolutionary in that statement.  We were meeting for the purpose of preserving the peace in Edgeworthstown and not for the purpose of creating any trouble.  I was one of a deputation of about ten. I wanted to keep the peace.  I knew that there were tenants whose rents had been raised 25 per cent. in the last ten years.  I knew that some of these tenants were amongst the most industrious men in the country&mdash;men that <Col N="699" /> six o'clock never found in their beds. Yet, notwithstanding all their energy and industry, their rents are raised 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I say that this House would be spending its time wisely if Deputies of all Parties were to get together to-day and try to find a solution for this very difficult question of town tenants. I say that here in this House and I say it outside.  I say that it is the duty of every public representative to take this matter seriously.  We all know that there is a certain amount of ill-feeling in connection with this. We see various resolutions being passed and we hear about them, and I say that it is the duty of our public representatives to come together and draft something to ease the situation of the town tenants instead of trying, as we saw here to-day, to make Party capital out of it.  The President has dealt with the matter as well as it could be dealt with.  I can say that I had neither hand, act nor part in the I.R.A. meeting.</P>
    <P>It is thought to bring me into it, but if you want to settle the blame, settle it in the words General MacEoin used to the deputation after coming back.  As General MacEoin is now in the House I will read the words again.  I regret that I should have to disclose them but the fault is his.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter lies in your own hands now.  You must fight it.  If I, as an old soldier and campaigner, were leading a column now as I did in years past I would have this fight won inside of 24 hours.&rdquo;</P>

I deny absolutely and categorically that I ever made such a statement as that attributed to me by Deputy Victory.</P>

      <P>I am afraid of nothing in this world except God; neither you nor anyone else.  To put words like those that have been quoted into my mouth is, as everyone who knows me believes, outrageous. At no time since the establishment of this State have I advocated or shown any countenance to any act, overt or deliberate, that would be in any way a breach of the laws passed by this House or of the laws of God.  To say that I would, even for a second, recommend people, or a body, to make a statement that would initiate revolutionary action or hostile action of a violent kind, is a most outrageous proposal.  I say that everybody who knows me knows that it is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Victory will admit that when we were leaving that house we left on the lines that the Government of this State was about to bring in legislation that would, at least, give relief to town tenants.  I went there with Deputy Victory as a public representative and as a constitutional leader and as nothing else.  To say that at any time in my career I said I could settle a case like this in 24 hours is, on the face of it, futile and hopeless.  I could never do it.  Why say it then?  We went, no doubt, to get a remission or a reduction of rents, which, I believed, were a bit high.  When I was going there I was not aware of all the facts.  I had one side of the case.  I think Deputy Victory also had only one side.  When we went there we met another side. That changed the matter considerably. The agent was prepared to investigate individual cases.  That was what I claimed he said.  I did not take it that he meant it seriously or sarcastically when he had a good headline; that the Government claimed such right for the Irish farming community as to whether they were able to pay or not.  I do not know how my speech can be relevant to the subject matter of this Estimate except by way of <Col N="701" /> reply to Deputy Victory.  I ask the House to take it from me that I never used the words implied.</P>
    <P>In reference to the Estimate, as far as I am aware, the Guards have carried out their duties to the best of their ability in very difficult circumstances. They are operating in difficult times. I have nothing whatever to say to the Guards in the discharge of their duty. I may have slight complaints against some members of the Gárda force in Longford.  In Westmeath I have considerable complaints against members of the new force, where they have been guilty, I think, of very harsh treatment of the farming community.  I have several cases in which they have been insulting and harsh to the farming community whose houses they visited. In one particular case they asked the woman of the house for the rent, and when she replied that she had not even food in the house, they asked her what was boiling on the fire.  When she said it was pig feeding, the reply was: &ldquo;That is good enough.&rdquo;  I do not think that is a remark that should be made by Guards.  When the matter was brought to my notice I said that a report of it should be made to the responsible officers.  Whether that has been done or not I do not know.  That is a type of some of the complaints I have heard.  Deputy Victory stated that he wanted to ask me a question. If you, Sir, give him permission, I am prepared to answer, but I suggest that it would be much better for the Deputy to ask me outside, where the privileges of the House will not apply, and where we can meet upon an equal footing. The Deputy says that I am afraid.  I assure him through you, Sir, that I am not afraid of anything I ever said or of any man.</P>

      <P>I know that you, Sir, have told the House that this is a Supplementary Estimate, and that discussion may, therefore, be restricted. But, even on a Supplementary Estimate, asking the House to vote £35,985 extra for the police force in a country where the police force does not exist, requires discussion.  I can appreciate Deputy MacEoin's point that he has no blame for the Guards in County Longford.  They are operating in a difficult area, in which, not very long ago, a superintendent was removed because he was doing his duty, and, therefore, was not <i>persona grata</i> with the local Fianna Fáil Clubs.</P>

      <P>I do not want to travel outside the strict limits of order in this matter, but I think a situation exists which requires discussion now, when the Minister has the effrontery to come in and ask the House to vote £35,000 additional.  When the situation is so serious it might easily be the occasion on the ordinary Estimate for next year of a very big discussion.  A discussion on the Supplementary Estimate, dealing with the Minister's statement, <Col N="703" /> might be somewhat more restricted than it would otherwise be when we have heard the Minister.</P>
      <P>The net amount of the Estimate for the Gárda Síochána introduced at the beginning of the financial year was £1,782,478.  That was £70,000 more than the net Estimate submitted by the present Government in the beginning of the financial year 1933-34.  It was £150,000 more than the actual expenditure in the last year of the previous Administration. The Government that presents these Estimates to us and that exceeds them to the extent of £35,000 this year, is the Government that had a certain line of thought on the Gárda Síochána and the cost of it immediately before they took office.</P>

      <P>Again, Sir, I would plead with you that there is a situation existing in this country which this House cannot allow to go undiscussed when it is asked by the Minister for Justice to vote additional money now for the police force.  This morning&mdash; there has not been time to examine the matter properly yet&mdash;we had a series of questions on the Order Paper that dealt with 12 cases in which armed and masked men committed outrages.  The Minister told us that seven of these have not been dealt with; that in nine additional cases, without masks, armed outrages took place, that in six nothing has happened; that in seven cases explosives were used to commit outrages and that as regards six of them nothing has happened; that in three cases in which fire was used to commit outrages nothing has been done in one case.  That is only part of the picture that I think requires discussion.  I propose to put some things that strike me in connection with this matter <Col N="704" /> before the House, and I would plead for a certain amount of tolerance from the Chair in doing so.  I have not proved, I think, to be a very difficult person to be handled by the Chair.  I will give just one quotation from the President with regard to the cost of the Gárda Síochána, and will then pass to the main matters that I want to draw attention to.  Two months before the Fianna Fáil Party came into office the President, at Ennis, as reported in the <i>Clare Champion</i> of the 26th December, 1931, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Army was there for the purpose of keeping down Republicans, Sinn Féiners and everybody who did not agree with the policy of the present Government.  By removing the causes of the dissatisfaction amongst the people, the cost of the Army could be reduced by £500,000, and the police, a lot of whose work was of a political character at present, could also be reduced, and another £500,000 saved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The President thought two months before his Party took over the government of this country that on the Gárda Síochána force £500,000 could be saved. What is it wanted for now?  There are some bright spots in the country.  In Kerry it has not been necessary to arrest on suspicion a single person under the provisions of Article 2A of the Constitution.  Will we be told that in Kerry there has not been a single case in which any person has interfered with the collection of public moneys during the 12 months ended 31st December last?  In Longford, during the past 12 months, it has not been necessary to arrest a single person on suspicion of having been engaged in committing outrages under the provisions of Article 2A of the Constitution. These are some of the bright spots.  In Cork, where crimes do occur and where the police do not follow them up&mdash;if there are these bright spots in the country&mdash;and if crime is being committed and is not being followed up, why does the Minister come before the House and ask us to vote an additional £35,000 for the Gárda Síochána?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 27th November at half-past <Col N="705" /> two in the morning a farmer and his wife are in bed.  A crowd of armed men come to their house demanding entry.  The farmer's wife goes to the window of the house.  A revolver is pointed at her and she is told to open. She declines.  The armed party then get in through the sittingroom window. They go into the bedroom and threaten to kill the man.  They brandish revolvers all round.  They take the man out of the house and bring him down a bit of the road.  They threaten to shoot him there.  On the following morning informations are sworn by the persons thus outraged against two persons. Further information was given with regard to some others.  That was on 27th November.  Nothing happened for six weeks.  Then, when there was an identification parade, three other persons were identified at it.  Did anything happen then?  Nothing happened for another six weeks.  The foul bird of murder had to roost over the Fianna Fáil nest in Longford before the police in Cork thought it better to move in the matter.  That was nearly three months after this outrage had been committed in Cork although informations had been sworn against definite persons on the following day.  The country is stamped with that reflection on the police force.</P>
    <P>This morning, as I have said, the Minister answered a certain number of questions, but in the time that has elapsed it has not been possible to analyse his answers closely or exactly. But the facts I have quoted stand: that out of 21 cases during the last few months, in which arms have been used, not a single person has been brought to justice in the case of 13. These arms are still in the hands of unauthorised persons in the country. Those who possess them are able to go about with the feeling that the morale of the men in the police force at the present time is such that it is not going to get them.  The position in the Kerry area is particularly marked.  There have been seven cases of armed and masked men during the last few months in the Kerry area making attacks on people.  In one case 50 armed men raided houses in a number <Col N="706" /> of areas.  In six of these cases nothing has happened, except in one.</P>
    <P>Where the 50 armed men raided a considerable number of houses, three persons have been convicted&mdash;three out of 50.  Would the Minister tell us if a single one of these arms carried on that occasion has been recovered?</P>
    <P>The Minister published the other day, in reply to a Parliamentary question, a statement with regard to the number of halls destroyed in different parts of the country.  When you take the Minister's figures, so far as destruction of that particular kind is concerned, you have the Counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath and Offaly forming a group on the map in which, during the last 12 months, the following acts of destruction have taken place.  There have been two halls destroyed in Leitrim, and two partially destroyed; one hall destroyed in Sligo and one partially destroyed; there have been two halls destroyed in Roscommon and one partially destroyed and recreational equipment destroyed in another case where the hall was partially destroyed.  In Roscommon, explosives were used and there also there were two armed attacks on dance parties.  In Longford there were two armed attacks on dance parties.  In Cavan a hall was destroyed, explosives being used, a hall was partially destroyed and there was one attack on a dance party.  In Westmeath a hall was partially destroyed, and there was an attack on a dance hall, explosives being used. In Offaly two halls were partially destroyed by armed bands and there was one attack on a dance party by an armed band.  In the whole of the seven counties marked by that particular type of activity, during the last 12 months, there has not been a single arrest.  If the additional outrages of a violent kind are taken into consideration, that area might be regarded as one in which there is a considerable amount of armed violence.  The Minister told us, in reply to a similar series of questions, of the number of cases in which there had been interference with the collection of public moneys.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> We find that in the area which includes Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford, Limerick and Cork, with a smaller area which includes Meath and Westmeath, there has been a very considerable amount of interference with the collection of public moneys.  People who know the conditions in the country are aware as to why there has been that particular type of reaction.  When we come to examine the Minister's figures as to the areas in which the police are carrying out arrests on suspicion under the Constitution (Amendment) Act, we find that during the whole 12 months in the Counties of Cavan, Longford, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo &mdash; the greater part of the area in which all this violence occurred&mdash;there were only three arrests on suspicion under the Constitution (Amendment) Act, the persons concerned being let off.  There were no convictions in these counties, and there were only four cases in which persons were arrested under the Constitution (Amendment) Act and released within 24 hours.  There were 29 arrests in Westmeath and 9 in Offaly.  When we come to that part of the country where the difficulties of the farmers have found expression in resistance to the sheriff-machinery for the seizing and selling of their goods, in exasperating circumstances, we find that the full force of the Gárda is thrown into this type of arrest.  Out of 964 arrests on suspicion in which the persons were released because there was no charge against them, 843 took. place in what I might describe as the area of the farmers' difficulties.  In County Cork alone, 369 arrests took place, with an additional 19 in the City of Cork.  Instead of showing activity in getting after the type of crime I have described or showing any success in getting after it, the whole force of the Guards seems to be thrown against the people who are in economic difficulties. The excuse that the Minister gives for not following up violent crime is that he is too busy getting after those farmers who are resisting the collection of their moneys by the sheriffs.  He is too busy in that connection to deal with those who are <Col N="708" /> employed in a regular campaign against the people's recreation by destroying halls and who are exercising a regular tyranny against their political opponents by attacking their houses.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister on the 27th February whether he was aware that on the 30th September last a body of armed men opened fire on the hall at Kilfinnane during the progress of a dance; that on the 1st November last Patrick Creed's house was fired into; that on the 20th January a body of men drilled publicly at Ballinlina, Kilfinnane, carrying arms and firing rifle shots; that recently the houses of Mrs. Condon, Ballinanama; Miss Hayes, Ardpatrick; the Ardpatrick Co-operative Creamery and the Darragh Creamery were broken into and robbed, and if it were a fact that in none of these cases had the persons guilty of the offences been charged by the police.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking for the Minister for Justice, said that in all these cases in which an offence had been committed in that area, he was satisfied that the police had done, and would continue to do, everything possible to make the culprits amenable.  In reply to a supplementary question, the Minister excused the police by saying that they were having a difficult time, that they were not idle, and that they had arrested 40 members of the League of Youth.  The Minister is driven to that type of statement to excuse the failure of the police to do their duty.  He is also forced to hide the situation caused by the excesses of the police.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister on the same date to state the special circumstances which occasioned the arrest, detention and questioning of David and John Carroll, Garrouse, Bruree, on the 10th December last and why, particularly, these young men should be arrested, detained and questioned in the matter. The facts were that a party was outside the church in Charleville on the 10th December last waiting for a funeral.  One of the local Guards, accompanied by a detective, approached two young chief mourners at the funeral and arrested them.  They were men of good character.  There were plenty of people of good character <Col N="709" /> in the vicinity who would give an undertaking that these men would return to the police station, if required, after the funeral.  These young men were, however, taken by force from the funeral and brought to the barracks.  They were detained at the barracks until the funeral had moved off.  The police in the barracks rang up the police at Limerick and, apparently, got permission to permit the two young men to attend the funeral on condition that they would report at Limerick by 9 o'clock that night.  The young men gave the required undertaking and were allowed to go after the funeral.  They went to Limerick and they were detained there until the following evening.  When the Minister is asked for the reason for action so astounding, the answer is that these young men were arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed an offence mentioned in the Appendix to Article 2A of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Agriculture was pressed as to the way in which these men were treated by being made come to Limerick and kept there for 24 hours, he said they were under technical arrest&mdash;that is as far as the Charleville business went&mdash;and that to state that they were kept in Limerick for 24 hours was a gross exaggeration. The Minister and the police know very well that these young men had nothing to do with an offence which they were not prepared even to mention.  They were kept from Monday to Tuesday. Some railway wires were cut on 9th December.  It would be well that the Minister should inquire from the Guards why these railway wires were cut.  If he does the Minister will find that it was part of the type of vendetta that was begun really by the Minister himself, in a very methodical way, in Mayo, and that has been carried on subtly by the kind of administrative direction given the Guards ever since. These young men were given a chance on the 19th to try and provide funds for their organisation.  Some of the new I.R.A. in Rockhill determined that they should not be allowed to do so, and efforts were made to prejudice their success.  The wires which were cut were not cut by members of the <Col N="710" /> Blueshirt organisation but by people unconnected with them, who wanted to prevent them having a chance of carrying on their dance.  Then the Guards followed that up.  Their action showed how necessary it was to give a sort of official co-operation with that type of campaign.  Otherwise it would not be necessary to burrow right into the middle of a funeral leaving a church in order to make these arrests.  These people could have been arrested in a less spectacular way.  There has been that stamp in the administration of the police in certain areas where their whole mentality takes its cue from the Minister, whose policy seems to be to let crime go.  They fulfil their duties by carrying on a campaign of blackening those that the Government would like to see blackened, and a policy that the Government would like to see carried out against their political opponents.  Again, let us take the mentality of the Guards as indicated by what happened in connection with the display in certain cases of films dealing with the recent Royal marriage.</P>

      <P>I hope when it is duplicated in three weeks' time the Attorney-General will have cleared up some of these matters which are apparently outstanding between himself and the Minister for Justice and the Guards, and that we may have this very serious subject treated in a serious way by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice.  If the Attorney-General is interested in this debate, and is interested in the <Col N="711" /> proper discharge of their duties by the Guards, I hope he will be able to tell us what action the Guards took when a group of young men went into a cinema theatre in Wexford and told the proprietor that he was not to show a particular picture in his theatre, and when the proprietor thought it would be wiser to give in.  I would like to know what action was taken by the Guards.  Perhaps the Attorney-General would also tell us when the same thing happened in Kilkenny whether any action was taken by the Guards.  When the picture was to be shown in Ballinrobe it was possible for the manager to come out and to tell the people assembled to see that picture that it could not be shown because he was advised by the officers of the Gárda that the picture was not to be shown.  Perhaps the Attorney-General would tell us why nothing has been done to show what are the forces in this country that are interfering with the rights of the people in this way and why the rights of the people are held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the privilege of members of the Government to be present in a public picture house on one occasion when this picture, which could not be shown in Ballinrobe, Wexford and Kilkenny, was shown.  In Dublin the Minister for Justice and his Department had ample warning that an attack was to be made upon a picture house in the city by 400 men, yet it was possible, as the papers stated, for 400 men to enter the Savoy Picture House and prevent the showing of this picture.  Has anyone been brought to book for this offence?  The Minister says no.  In one of the principal streets of this city it was possible for 400 men to organise themselves, despite a previous warning to the Minister for Justice that there was going to be such an attack made, and to enter a picture house in the principal street of Dublin and prevent the picture from being shown and to get away with it.  The Department that is responsible for upholding the rights of the people sees them trampled upon in this particular way, and yet comes to this House and asks <Col N="712" /> for £35,000 more to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>An attempt has been made to rewrite history in some of our counties, and because a journal like the <i>Cork Examiner</i> will not write the history of the last 20 years in the way some people would like to have it written, it is punished.  Ministers withdraw their advertisements because they dislike the policy adopted with regard to wheat growing, and if newspapers refuse a kind of historical rouge and lipstick that some writers of history in Kerry would like to see applied, then the Government will not interfere when the property of that newspaper is being destroyed in that particular county.  The Minister himself tells us that nothing has been traced to the people who made such violent and destructive attacks upon the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in Kerry in December, and nothing is going to be done.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture can get information against people for offering inferior and unfinished cattle for sale under licence.  They may get information.  The Gárda turned around, very late in the day, and offered £1,000 for tracing the murderers of Mr. More O'Ferrall.  Does the Minister expect that he is going to get that information?  The administration of the Gárda has brought the Gárda to this, that if information is given by people to the Gárda, it is known within 24 hours to those people who form the new I.R.A.  It has even come to this, that a police officer may report to his superior officers vital information leading to the detection of crime in this country and that information, on the one hand, will not be acted on and, on the other hand, the information that that report has been received will be in the hands of the I.R.A. in 24 or 48 hours.</P>
    <P>These are matters which the Minister for Justice must know, and must take cognisance of.  Generally, the police idea, as it ought to exist in a civilised society, does not exist here.  Crime is escaping punishment and the police machinery is being directed to a particularly vicious type of policy which is the policy of the Administration&mdash;<Col N="713" /> the hounding down of people who are unable to pay State debts and the blackening, by suggestion, of the people who are the political opponents of the Minister.  The Minister came here and asked the House to pass this Estimate. He suggested that the reason for wanting it was the activities of the Opposition.  I should like the Minister to take the subject more seriously and to tell us a lot more of what is in his mind.  The matter is one which demands open and frank discussion, I should like to suggest, on the part of the Attorney-General as well as the Minister, because I think it is an appalling thing that, in a county which is stamped over with crime as North Kerry is, it should be possible for 50 armed men to parade and to make attacks on different houses, and that simply three persons are convicted, one by an ordinary court and two by the Tribunal.</P>

Will the Minister or the Attorney-General also say why the crime I mentioned in the beginning, on 27th November, in West Cork, where informations were sworn against two people and given against others has to drag on without police action of any kind, so far as charging people is concerned, until Longford makes the police in Cork feel that perhaps it is dangerous, in more ways than one, not to be discharging their duties?  These are only a few phases of the position which the Minister for Justice should deal with.</P>

The rest of the particulars are as I say.  These are matters which require to be dealt with by the Minister when asking this House to vote £35,000 more for a body which he thought, in December, 1931, could be reduced by £500,000, and which he has actually increased by £150,000, and is now bringing to the position in which the increase is practically £200,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister, if I mistake not, made a very short statement in introducing this Estimate, and gave some detailed figures regarding the lump sums that are mentioned.  Under the first figure of £7,550&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;he mentioned rent and accommodation allowances, £1,150; plain clothes allowances, £2,800; detectives' clothes allowances, £2,000; transport, £500; Gaeltacht allowances, £1,100; and miscellaneous, £150.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They total £150 more than the £7,550, unless I am mistaken. However, some case ought to have been made for this Estimate on its introduction.  This is a considerable sum amounting, as the Minister said, to nearly £42,000.  There are extra savings amounting to £6,000 which, presumably, would have occurred in any case, but the extra sum that is required is approximately £42,000. Reading through this Estimate, one is driven to the conclusion that it arises out of the Land Act of 1933; that it is designed to give extra power and support to the sheriffs, the court officers and other such persons.  The increase in the transport allowance amounts to approximately one-third of the original Estimate.  The sums <Col N="715" /> set out are locomotion expenses: £48,750, under D.; £18,040, for transport and carriage, under H; £500 mentioned in the B allowance; and £1,166 for garage and workshop.  What was costing approximately £1,000 a week is now going to cost slightly over £1,300. There is probably no work on Sunday, so that the Gárda transport costs are approximately £200 a day.  If Saturday is not a full working day they are even in excess of that, going up to probably £250 a day for the other five days of the week.  While all this extraordinary activity is going on to vindicate a law that was passed here for the collection of annuities, apparently from the Minister's own admission and from what can be read in the newspapers, regarding outrages and so on, scarcely any attention is being paid to the maintenance of law and order throughout the country.  Is it likely that there is going to be respect for the law here if almost 1,000 persons are arrested, questioned in connection with Article 2A of the Constitution, and released?  Do those people go out with any greater respect for the institutions of the State and the maintenance of law and order in the State? It would appear as if the whole efforts of the Department of Justice were directed towards helping the Land Commission in collecting their annuities. There is practically no attention whatever given to the maintenance of law.  This case which has been mentioned&mdash;the Edgeworthstown case&mdash;exemplifies perhaps more than any other the incompetence either of the Department of Justice or of the Gárda Síochána.  Their principal duty, presumably, the Minister will admit, is to preserve order in the State.  It is more important to have conditions of order prevalent than it is to arrest every person who commits a crime. The prevention of crime ought to be the duty of the Ministry, and ought to be the duty of the Guards.  In that connection it is their work to judge what steps should be taken in order to prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unlikely that you will get either respect for the administration or support for the Guards when you <Col N="716" /> have them employed to do political work.  This estimate might reasonably be described as the main political estimate which has come before the Dáil.  The Minister for Justice, by accident I suppose, happens to be a man who is slightly above the standard of the other Ministers.  He has some experience of the law.  He has experience of the courts.  He has experience of the type of person in the country that these extra men who are engaged here are going to be employed to prey upon, and he knows better than any other Minister or the whole lot of them together that this line of policy is hound to have its reactions, is almost certain to provoke discontent and perhaps lead to breaches of the peace throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister, in connection with this idea of transport, whether any other item than transport for the Gárda Síochána is included; whether it is really an extension of the transport costs of the Guards to which he refers in his speech as arising out of activities with which Deputies are conversant.  Presumably that means the Ministry's difficulty in the collecting of annuities. If twelve months ago when the Minister was making up his estimate he made a mistake of 30 per cent. obviously his Department and his advisers and the Gárda were unable to acquaint him with the set of circumstances which the legislation of this State had brought about.  The sooner the Minister himself informs the Executive Council that the situation is getting serious the better it will be for himself and for them.  Under the heading of incidental expenses there is an item &ldquo;sums required for (a) Purchase of ammunition and miscellaneous equipment, £373.&rdquo;  This is a fairly large item for equipment if it means guns, ammunition, and all that sort of thing.  The Minister would be very well advised to limit expenditure on that account.  As this Vote arises out of the employment of persons for a particular activity, would the Minister tell the House whether, in connection with sales of seized stock, it is <Col N="717" /> the law that those sales should be open to the public, or whether it is within the power of the Guards to say: &ldquo;No, certain members of the public cannot attend.&rdquo;  Will he inform the House if on an occasion within the last couple of years an auction was held above in the Depôt, and whether there is any truth in the statement that a piano was sold there for 25/- or 30/-?  The Minister might give the House his own view as to the propriety of selling things by public auction at the dictation of the State or the direction of the State for one-tenth of their value, and whether if such sales are likely to go on throughout the country they are likely to give people a respect for the law or the administration of the law.  The Minister ought to know&mdash;nobody ought to know better in the Executive Council &mdash;that that sort of thing is bound to create trouble.  It is almost inviting it.  This is a considerable sum to be brought up within a couple of weeks of the closing of the financial year. It arises out of legislation which the Government has passed.  It is on the Government that the responsibility for it rests, and it is no credit to any administration to produce a Supplementary Estimate such as this for the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <P>The whole trouble, in my opinion, about the condition of the Civic Guards at the present moment is this: The Civic Guards, one of the most efficient, competent, capable and tactful bodies, who were carrying out their work in a manner that pleased the general public, have, unfortunately, in recent times, seemed to change.  Some change has come over them, not through any fault of theirs, nor, in my opinion, through any fault of the Minister for Justice, or the Attorney-General.  The change has arisen because their control has passed entirely out of the hands of the Executive Government into the hands of an unauthorised body outside. In my opinion the first mistake that was made was the introducing into the old Civic Guards, who were developing a splendid tradition, a body of new recruits, as I might call them. These new recruits may be, so far as I know, the best men in the world.  I have nothing personally to say against them.  But the idea has gone abroad, rightly or wrongly, that they are more or less spies, secret service agents, introduced into the old body. As a result of their introduction, as is well known to everybody in the community, there has been a lack of that old comradeship and that mutual loyalty and co-operation which hitherto had existed.  The one point I really wish to make is that, whilst notorious and outrageous crimes, resulting in death, have taken place in this country, and are still undetected and unpunished, if a body of farmers in Cork or elsewhere meet, there is a <Col N="719" /> bevy of representatives of the Civic Guards attending their meetings, taking a note of everything they say &mdash;even of words sometimes uttered, possibly, in the heat of the moment and inspired by what they believe to be grievances under which at the present time they suffer.  These words are noted down and these farmers are hauled before the Military Tribunal and subjected to penalties that in some cases might be described as savage.  That, in my opinion, is not a good thing for the general welfare. It is rather a reflection on the general administration of the law, and the sooner the Minister and his advisers will see that it is brought to an end the better for the State and the better for everybody living therein.</P>

      <P>In ordinary circumstances, if this country were in a normal condition, and if the Guards were the force which the old Guards were at one time, there is nobody in this House who would vote money more willingly than I for the necessary expenses of the Gárda Síochána, be they in uniform or plain clothes.  But I, for one, will not vote for one single half-penny which goes to the new detective branch.  I will not vote for one single halfpenny for money which is to be expended on ammunition for that new detective branch, considering the way in which we know that detective branch has used ammunition in the past.  We have here, Sir, in this Vote, allowances for men engaged as plain clothes detectives. We have a sum of £373 to supply those plain clothes detectives with ammunition and miscellaneous equipment.  Are these new members of the S Branch behaving themselves? Are they adding to the reputation of the Guards or are they lowering it? Would I not be correct in stating that before they joined the Gárda Síochána that police force stood as high in the estimation of every person in this country whose opinions count, as high in their reputation and in the estimation of persons outside this country who took an interest in the affairs of this country, as any police force in the world?  They could challenge comparison <Col N="720" /> with any police force in the world.  I am sorry to say that they cannot challenge comparison with any police force in the world at the present moment.  As far as one branch of them is concerned, they have become definitely an incompetent and untrustworthy body of men, a body so incompetent that they have got the contempt of the people, not their admiration, and, I would almost add, the affection which the Guards enjoyed some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things which have happened in recent times which showed the inefficiency of that particular branch of the Guards.  I am not going to deal with very many of these. I will deal with just two at the outset. We had recently a very shocking murder at Lissard, near Edgeworthstown, in the County Longford.  There a young man rushing to the assistance of his father was cruelly murdered.  We have it that incendiary speeches had been made before that murder took place. We have it that the assistance of the I.R.A. had been called in at a public meeting, or that at a public meeting a certain commandant of the I.R.A. promised this assistance.  Was there anything done to protect Mr. More O'Ferrall? We were told the other night that patrols were sent, but the President said, of course, that the patrols were worthless patrols.  They were worthless patrols, completely worthless patrols.  There were no good men sent on these patrols.  Patrols to be effective in circumstances like that must be patrols of armed men.  They must be patrols of thoroughly well trained, reliable, skilful men.  You have not got them.  I am not talking even of the present Government, because things were different under the last Minister for Justice.  But when the present Minister for Justice took over office he had in the S Branch of the Guards, or C.I.D., as they were called, a thoroughly efficient, a thoroughly loyal, and a thoroughly trustworthy body of men.  The Minister has proceeded to change that completely.  He has proceeded to take trained and experienced detectives out of the S Branch and put them into the plain clothes section. These were men who again and again <Col N="721" /> had been praised by the district justices, by the circuit judges, and even by the judges of the High Court for their skilful work in the detection of crime.  These men have been taken out of the S Branch and put into the uniformed force.  In their place have been put untrained, inexperienced men. Of course, at the present moment the S Branch has become a most hopeless, incompetent and untrustworthy body of men.</P>
    <P>The principle of recruiting into the old S. Branch was this, that the very best men were selected out of the uniformed Guards, men who were, in the opinion of their officers, specially suited and who possessed all the characteristics which good detectives should have.  The members of the old S. Branch were a very competent body of men.</P>
    <P>The conditions are utterly different now.  Raw men from the Depôt, after two or three months' training, knowing nothing about discipline and nothing about police duties, are suddenly put in to fill the most important posts which sergeants or ordinary members of the Guards could fill.  I would like to know, if there was a proper detective division in Edgeworthstown, why it was not known, why there was not even a suspicion, that an attack would be made upon Lissard House and on Mr. More O'Ferrall?  It is not very long ago, hardly a year ago, since the Minister for Justice warned young men in the I.R.A. to clear out because he knew every single thing that was being done in the I.R.A.  I think he said that he knew everything which the I.R.A. were plotting and planning within 24 hours of the time they plotted and planned.  I think it is admirable that the Minister should have that information.  I think it very admirable that the £30,000 spent on Secret Service in this State should bring that information to the Minister. But I want to know has the Minister lost that touch with the I.R.A.?  How does it come that the Minister, who a year ago knew every single thing, every decision of importance that was come to even within the innermost circles of the I.R.A.&mdash;that was his <Col N="722" /> boast&mdash;was in ignorance that this attack was going to be made on Lissard House, especially when he was made aware, through a Commandant of the I.R.A., who publicly promised assistance, that the I.R.A. were going to come to the assistance of the people in Edgeworthstown?</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with anything that might hamper or impede the investigation of that shocking crime by the Guards.  I am, however, going to make this comment, and it can having nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of any particular individual who may be charged.  I would like to know how did it come that the car was not caught that night? Why was it not traced that night? It would be impossible, if a crime is committed out of a car in the City of Dublin, to trace that car; it would be impossible in Cork and probably even in Limerick or Waterford, where cars are very numerous.  But to say that on country roads in the County Longford a car like that could not be traced down, if the police work had been properly done, seems to me to be absurd.  The car should have been traced down that very night.  Within a very short time of the occurrence the Guards in Edgeworthstown knew of it.  It would have been their duty to telephone all over the country to warn every police barracks in the State if necessary, to look out for that car and every car should have been stopped on the road that night. I do not know whether such instructions were given.  I will assume they were, but this particular car was not stopped.  Why not?  It requires courage to stop a car containing armed men.  Your present detective force, your S Branch, have not got the courage of the old S Branch and I venture to think the reason why that car was not stopped that night was because your men had not the courage to stop any car which was likely to contain the assassins.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago, when we had the old S Branch, there was an armed robbery in Limerick.  The men went 80 to 100 miles in their car into the middle of Tipperary.  They <Col N="723" /> were armed men.  They were tracked down to a house which they entered. The Guards then had the courage to advance on that house and capture the persons who were in it.  In that case competent detectives were perfectly capable of tracing the car through country roads and were perfectly willing to take the risk of arresting armed men.  No such thing happened in this case.  I hope, and I believe every member in the House hopes that the police will be active and that they will get some competent men to do the detective work.  The country is full of competent detectives. I could mention one detective at present in the Gárda Síochána who, I believe, is as competent a detective as is to be found anywhere on earth, a man with a tremendous record for the detection of very difficult crimes.  His brains may be brought to work upon this problem. I hope they are.  I sincerely hope that the Guards will make every effort to solve this crime and I hope, and I believe every decent man in the State hopes, that the perpetrators of the crime will be brought to justice.  I am entitled to say that those men should not have been free for 24 hours. I believe if the S Branch of the Guards were to-day the same as they were two years ago, those criminals would not have been free at the end of 24 hours. But of course the whole Guards have been demoralised, the whole S Branch has been demoralised.  The personnel of it has been so changed that it is not the body that it was and the Minister is, to a very large extent, responsible for the behaviour of the S Branch on other occasions.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to consider another crime, a crime in my opinion more shocking than the murder in Lissard. I consider the murder in Marsh's yard in Cork, done by members of the Guards, a more shocking crime, as it was committed by servants of the State, than the murder in Lissard.</P>
    <P>I raised a question in this House and I received a very strange answer from the Minister for Justice in reply to it.  My question was whether he <Col N="724" /> intended to hold any inquiry as to the persons who fired at Commandant Cronin.  Though the facts demonstrated that it could only have been two of these new members of the S Branch and it was done within a few yards of the Guards, there being no other armed person in the neighbourhood, yet the Minister made the extraordinary reply that Commandant Cronin had been firing at himself. What is the result of that reply?  No inquiry of any kind.  The S Branch are told: &ldquo;You can fire as much as you like; you will have the Minister behind you,&rdquo; and if they shoot somebody, I suppose the Minister will say he committed suicide.  What is the result?  The men are emboldened by the Minister's attitude, they are encouraged by the Minister's attitude to use their firearms and we had the affair in Marsh's yard.</P>
    <P>I dealt with that from one aspect the other night&mdash;the aspect which concerned the Attorney-General&mdash;and I am going to deal with it from another aspect now.  By way of parentheses, I might say that I was astonished at the Attorney-General's reply on that night, because if you take the Attorney-General's speech and read it all together you will find this meaning coming right out of it&mdash;that never under any circumstances will there be a prosecution against the armed forces of this State for shooting down civilians.  &ldquo;Where is there a precedent?&rdquo; he asked, and I gave him one. I hope he will follow it.  I hope that if encouraged by the Minister for Justice these men indulge in any orgy of shooting the Attorney-General will follow that precedent.</P>
    <P>What has been enunciated here is the doctrine that the S Branch of the Guards are to be the sole and final body determining when they are entitled to shoot down citizens of this State in cold blood or in hot blood.  I hope that monstrous doctrine will be put an end to.  That is the doctrine which we have had preached here by the Attorney-General and, to a considerable extent, if not openly preached, at least by his covert action assented to by the Minister for Justice. I pointed out, in connection with the <Col N="725" /> shooting in Marsh's yard, that a small body of unarmed men, twenty or thereabouts, were in a trap, completely surrounded on every side, perfectly helpless, when they were fired upon in this cruel and merciless fashion.  When I raised this question on the Motion for the Adjournment, the Minister for Justice asked: &ldquo;Were they to wait until there was firing done?&rdquo;  The men at whom they fired had no arms.  These S Branch men were there with their revolvers and rifles.  If they thought there was any danger they could have covered the men.  The men had no revolvers but, if they had, the police should have waited until they saw a revolver pulled.  They could have shot the men they had covered. But they did nothing of the kind.  As one of themselves said, they shot, not because there was any danger, but because it was a precautionary measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot prosecute, I admit&mdash;that is the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;but the Minister can dismiss from the force or he can take another course, the second best course. If the Attorney-General was unwilling to prosecute&mdash;I sincerely hope the Minister asked him, but I am afraid it is too much to hope for&mdash;there was another course open to the Minister. He could have set up a commission of inquiry&mdash;not a packed commission as in the Kilrush affair.  It is very noticeable that it was two I.R.A. men who were injured in Kilrush.  They were, however, 20 men to two; they were armed and they had fired first. A commission could be set up to inquire into the Kilrush affair and the men dismissed from the Guards, but when the Guards are 48 to 20 and the men are unarmed, there is no talk of a commission then.  I do not mean a commission such as the Kilrush Commission&mdash;I mean a real commission; a commission constituted entirely of judges or district justices; a purely legal commission.</P>
    <P>That was not done.  Why not?  Can the Minister give any explanation?  I can, and the House can; everybody in the State can, because everybody knows that the Minister knew that these men had no justification for firing.  The <Col N="726" /> Minister knew that these men were, in law, guilty of murder, and he did not wish an impartial tribunal to bring out that fact.  The Minister knew&mdash; and I am quoting now the words of a report signed by three judges&mdash;that on that occasion &ldquo;there was no such great and inevitable danger of serious bodily harm as to justify the use of firearms.&rdquo;  Not only was there no great and no inevitable danger at the time they fired, but there was no danger at all&mdash;any danger that there was had long since ceased.  The men broke the law; we all know they broke the law; but if men break the law that does not justify their being punished outside the law.  If they broke the law, they could be made amenable to the law.  But it is a new doctrine, it is a vile doctrine, it is a monstrous doctrine which is now being preached, that the duties of judge and jury and hangman altogether are to be vested in one individual or half a dozen individual members of the S Branch of the Civic Guards.  That is what you have brought your country to at the present time, and you stand over that!</P>
    <P>If there was any respect for the law in this country it was due to the fact that for years we had courts that decided fairly and we had Guards who did their work fairly and justly.  We still have, thank God, the courts.  The Executive Council cannot interfere with them.  They are immune from the interference of the Executive Council. But we have got Guards now, not the old uniformed rank, not the old plain-clothes men who still command the admiration of the people of this State.  You have done your best to demoralise them but you have not demoralised all of them yet.  There are still men amongst them with courage to face armed, as well as unarmed, men who would shoot them down. There was a splendid example recently in North Dublin where a Guard tackled an armed man and deprived him of a loaded revolver, an armed man who, with others, had taken a prisoner away and confined him.  The prisoner escaped and came to the Gárda barracks.  The Guards&mdash;they were the old uniformed Guards, not <Col N="727" /> your new men&mdash;went out and, unarmed as they were, they tackled some armed men whom they met and took the arms from them.  That is the old spirit. That is the spirit you are killing in the Guards for what is your new method of promotion.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Justice some time ago if these men who did the shooting in Marsh's yard were still members of the Guards and if they still held the rank they held before. The Minister replied that they were all still members of the Guards and that two of them had been promoted sergeants. That is a nice state of affairs. It was not for efficiency that these men were promoted sergeants.  They had been a year and a few months in the Guards.  They had three months' training in the Depôt; they had done no ordinary police duty.  They had done nothing to warrant promotion. The one thing they had done was this shooting and they were promoted for it.  That is a nice new principle, a quick way for a Guard in the S Branch to become a sergeant.  All he has got to do is to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Look here, my hands are dripping with blood; I have shot one of your opponents, make me a sergeant,&rdquo; and the Minister will say: &ldquo;Excellent, that is what I like; you will be a sergeant with your three stripes on your arm to-morrow.&rdquo;  That is the administration of the Guards!</P>
    <P>There was a time when no words were more familiar to people in this country than the late Arthur Balfour's famous message to the police at Mitchelstown: &ldquo;Do not hesitate to shoot.&rdquo;  The Minister has gone one better than that.  He tells these S Branch men: &ldquo;Not merely do not hesitate to shoot but be alert to shoot. If you ever can get an excuse for shooting, shoot and you will get promotion.&rdquo; That is the Minister's attitude. At all athletic sports there is a race called the team race.  One individual races a certain distance and hands the baton to another, who runs a further distance, and so on until the team has completed the course.  We have something like that in Irish <Col N="728" /> history.  We have had men steeping their hands in Irish blood from time to time.  We have had our Cromwells handing on their batons to the Mountjoys, and the Mountjoys handing their baton on to Mr. Balfour.  We have got a very pleasant state of affairs now. We discover that that ill-omened race is not yet finished.  We discover that the man always known in Irish history as &ldquo;Bloody Balfour&rdquo; has handed on the baton to the still more blood-stained Administration that is occupying the Government Benches at the present moment.  This Vote, with its sub-head for ammunition, with its subhead for allowances for men engaged in plain clothes and detective work, is a Vote which cannot have the support of any single person in this House, I do not care to what Party he belongs. I do not care whether he belongs to our Party, the Fianna Fáil Party or the Labour Party.  If there is any single member in this House who has a love of human liberty, who believes that the Irish people have a right to live in their own country without being shot down without just cause or excuse, that member will not support this Vote no matter how strong his Party ties may be.  He will not vote for supplying extra ammunition to be put into the hands of the S Branch to be used as the S Branch used it, when they fired at Commandant Cronin and when they murdered young Lynch in Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally there is no Vote that I should be more glad to support than the Vote for the police, because I think the policing of a country is a most vital thing for any country, and, in a country with our disastrous record, it is even more necessary that we should create <i>ab initio</i> a condition of order and respect for the law and that the police should be very strongly supported.  The greatest argument that I know against supporting the Vote is certain things we hear in this House.  I remember, a good while ago, when I referred to a certain organisation, which aimed at changing the Constitution of this State by means other than those provided by law, as an unlawful association, a Minister on the Front Bench protested loudly.  Apparently to his mind only <Col N="729" /> those organisations were unlawful that the Government disapproved of as rather favouring the Opposition, that an organisation which by its very nature was directed against the law was a perfectly law-abiding and praiseworthy organisation.  That indicates to me a thoroughly bad point of view.  I could give many other instances, but I need go back no further than last week when the More O'Ferrall murder was being discussed here.  The President, in replying, put what might have been quite a good case, that he was handicapped by the fact that certain men were arrested for questioning.  But his argument thereafter was directed to trying almost to justify the situation of certain lawbreakers.  He argued that if prominent Fianna Fáil men were indirectly associated with it, so were members of our Party.  His statement was completely contrary to truth.  Here was a case where a diabolical murder had taken place, of a nature which never takes place in any other country. In other countries murders do take place, but the murders we direct attention to now are in quite a different category from the sort of murders one reads of as taking place in England and other countries.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily, a murder implies that some man, lacking self-control and under the control of passion, in secrecy sets out and murders a fellow human being and seeks his own safety in secrecy.  His safety&mdash;and his danger&mdash; lies in the fact that he dare not let his guilt be known to any other persons because they, in horror of that guilt, would invoke the law against him. That is his safety, and the danger lies in this: that he is isolated against society and has to depend entirely upon his own resources for evading the sanctions of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might refer to several murders in this country, but I shall take only four cases&mdash;the murder of two men in connection with the railway strike some time ago, the murder of a man named O'Reilly in Cork, and the recent murder of Mr. More O'Ferrall.  The public conscience of this country accepts as morally certain that the guilt of these murders is shared by a large number of people because they are the outcome <Col N="730" /> of widespread organisation, and the leaders of these organisations and those who are aware of the circumstances of the murder all share the guilt. Accordingly, although I only refer here to these four murders, one may say that all these people were party to these murders which, in numbers, are very much in excess of four.  When you are in a position where you have organised murder, you have a very particular situation.  In the first place, organisation gives strength.  Organisation means that the men who are actually guilty are not in that weak position of isolation.  It means that they have support and assistance from fellow-members of those organisations. Now, the Government at this moment are in a particularly strong position, because some short time before we went out of office we passed what was a very drastic piece of legislation, and the purpose of that legislation was to empower the Government and to give the Government machinery for dealing with organisations which seek to attain their ends through the method of murder.  The real purpose of that legislation was to deprive these criminals of the additional safety and of the support they get by reason of the organisation that is behind them.</P>
    <P>Now, in the case of the More O'Ferrall murder, what was the situation as it was put before us last week? There was a Town Tenants' Association which aimed at the reduction of rents.  There is nothing in the law to prevent people organising in a legitimate way to bring about reduction of rents by constitutional means.  At a given point, apparently, when they decided that this reduction could not be brought about by constitutional and lawful means, they invited an unlawful body, a body that seeks an unlawful end and that seeks to attain that end by means of violence, to participate in the dispute.  No member of the Government, or no member of this House, and no person in this country has any doubt that that organisation was invited to participate because it did not feel itself restricted by the laws of this country.  Deputy MacDermot, in speaking of it, indicated an <Col N="731" /> element of guilt shared by people who are fairly prominent in the Fianna Fáil organisation.  The President retorted by attempting to purport that that guilt was shared by members of our organisation.  I am quite prepared to agree with the President if what he stated was really true.  The reprehensibleness which was indicated by Deputy MacDermot began when that Association invited the murder gang of the I.R.A.  The members of the Government have no doubt whatever in their minds that that organisation was responsible for murder before. They have no doubt that the I.R.A. proclaim that they seek an unlawful end by the use of unlawful means.  The moment, then, the invitation went out to the I.R.A. there was, to my mind, a criminal condition.  The President's statement implied that members of our organisation shared in that guilt.  If members of Fine Gael, who were members of the Town Tenants' Association &mdash;which, up to that time, we may assume, was a lawful body&mdash;helped to promote the invitation to the I.R.A. to take part in that dispute, then I agree with the President that members of our organisation are equally guilty with members of the Fianna Fáil organisation. If, however, members of Fine Gael did not participate in the invitation, then the President's statement the other night was diametrically opposed to truth and had no other purpose than to relieve members of Fianna Fáil of responsibility and to attribute spurious guilt to members of our organisation.</P>
    <P>The President was faced last week with a very serious situation, and a situation that, I am absolutely convinced, he recognises as serious; but instead of facing it as such he came along with a little distortion and a little misrepresentation to try to cover up the situation by implying that we could not say anything about it because members of our organisation were equally guilty.  If it were true that members of our Party had taken such action, I would entirely agree with the President, and nothing that he could say against members of our organisation in that position would be <Col N="732" /> too strong for me.  If that were true, I would support him in every way on that point, but I am convinced myself that his statement was completely untrue and that it was only made in order to cover up the guilt of certain parties by trying to spread the guilt over certain other parties.</P>
    <P>In the case we are talking about, a public meeting was promoted by the I.R.A.  If members of the Fine Gael organisation participated in that public meeting, I contend that they cannot escape entirely sharing in the guilt of the crime that was committed afterwards. If they participated in that meeting, then they were parties to the incitement of that crime.  If members of the Fine Gael organisation, however, did not participate in it, then the statement of the President the other night was a completely dishonest statement and was meant to cover up the guilt of other people.</P>

      <P>As I said, I should like to hear more about that from the Deputy, and I can tell the Deputy this, that if they did so, you may regard them as being completely outside our organisation now because, in doing so, they were acting against our organisation. Nobody in this House, nor anybody outside it, has any doubt in their minds as to what is the attitude of this Opposition Party and of the organisation behind it to the murder gang, the I.R.A., the Republican Congress and so forth.  Any member of our organisation who assists them in their work knows perfectly well that he has no right to be in our organisation because, by doing so, he is serving those whose purpose is to destroy all that we wish to create in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take this situation.  An illegal body that makes use of the method of murder, that arms its members, and whose members, in the courts, proclaim openly that they have a right to hold <Col N="733" /> those arms because they propose using them in a way that is contrary to law in this country, and which can only be described as a diabolically criminal way&mdash;members of that body were invited to participate in this meeting. The police were aware of that.  The public meeting was held, and at that meeting there were public incitements to violence, and the police did nothing. In Hyde Park, in London, people get up and make the most extreme speeches, I understand, but this country is quite different.  The Government know perfectly well&mdash;I do not want to go back into the Government's past, because I myself am most happy, as soon as the Government makes clear its anxiety to discuss its own past, to assist it&mdash;but they know perfectly well that there has been in this country the tradition of seeking to attain political ends by extra-political means and by means of violence.  The Government know that perfectly well.  They know perfectly well that the mask of a political end has had the effect of atrophying the public conscience and of preventing the people from assisting the law in taking its course.</P>
    <P>The Government here had fair warning that whatever was proposed to be done implied the making use of means that were against the law.  Their agents were aware that threats had been made against a citizen.  Last week 14 farmers were, I understand, arraigned before the Military Tribunal, charged, if I remember aright, with being members of an organisation which was illegal, because it was alleged it advocated non-payment of land annuities.  The other night, when dealing with the More O'Ferrall case, the President spoke about pickets, and seemed to think that the pickets had been worthy of praise because they had not used violence. What were the pickets for?  I have only the knowledge that I got from the President, but I assume&mdash;although I may be wrong&mdash;that the purpose of the pickets was to prevent people paying lawful debts to that estate.  If that was so, these pickets were trying to interfere with justice; they were trying to deny justice to a citizen.  The President almost praised <Col N="734" /> the pickets for not using violence but, when it is suspected that an organisation proposes the non-payment of land annuities, the members are brought before the Military Tribunal.  In the More O'Ferrall case threats of violence were made against a man and his family.  No action was taken; thereafter a murder took place.  No Government could be blamed because an occasional murder takes place, but I think this Government is to blame, because it knows that there are organisations existing which maintain that murder, instead of being a diabolical crime, crying to Heaven for vengeance, is an act which calls for praise and is the highest form of patriotism.  The Government knows that.  It knows that during its term of office it has allowed these organisations an absolutely free hand to seduce the youth of the country and to lead them into the ways of crime. One of these organisations was invited in this case to threaten violence.  That organisation has been often guilty of violence when it made no threat.  Now the Government comes along and asks the House to vote money for the police.  No one would be more pleased than I would be to vote money for the police provided the police were going to use every human means, not only in maintaining law, but in creating a condition in which it would be almost impossible to organise such crimes, or until a time would be reached when there would not be the same need to act against such organisations.</P>
    <P>Just a year ago there was the murder of Mrs. McGrory.  There is a motion on the Order Paper about it. We have not heard much about that murder since the motion was put down.  I remember that Deputy Cosgrave referred to a meeting that was held in Parnell Square on the Saturday prior to the murder.  I do not want to misrepresent the case.  I do not think that meeting has been denied, a meeting of an unlawful association for the purpose of taking certain steps towards the overthrow of this State.  The police watched that meeting.  No action was taken. <Col N="735" /> The Minister for Justice at the time said that there was no reason to believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mean that the Minister for Justice at that time said that there was no reason to believe that that meeting had anything to do with the appalling murder that took place the next day in County Louth. There were military patrols around County Dublin on that Sunday, and there was every indication that the Government and the police authorities expected some particularly violent or illegal action on that day.  The matter has not yet been gone into here or explained.  It was referred to last year but, as far as one can judge&mdash;not being in the Government's confidence&mdash;the meeting in Parnell Square was one which the Government considered was important and dangerous, when they empowered police to go and seize a house opposite and to watch who was going in and going out of that meeting. Obviously they regarded it as very important.  On the next day they had troops going around County Dublin. I saw them myself.</P>

If these organisations had grown up secretly or were unknown to anyone, if suddenly a bomb was thrown, no one would blame the <Col N="736" /> Government if it did not know.  Here we have an organisation not only known to exist, but the ends it sought to attain.  The Government, during its period of office had experience of the murderous methods of that organisation. I am merely referring to this case as being somewhat analogous.  The Government knew that some meeting was taking place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue that now.  I shall confine myself to the More O'Ferrall case.  I feel that there is a grave responsibility on the Government because it had good warning.  It knew that a murderous association was invoked and that the operation was directed against a given family.  It had the means of arresting the leaders of the organisation.  It could have arrested every member of the organisation.  It had full power to do so.  Instead of that it left that <Col N="737" /> family unprotected.  It seems to me that if ever there was a case where the police neglected their duty, and failed criminally in their duty, it was in the More O'Ferrall case.  I should like to ask when the Government became aware of this&mdash;they might not be if there were no premonitory symptoms&mdash;if the police took no precautions but actually allowed the murder to take place, or what was the immediate action of the Government?  I assume that self-respecting officials of the police would have handed in their resignations, which would be immediately accepted by the Government. Here was a case where the police failed appallingly.  Failing resignation, I presume the Government would have called for the resignation of the Commissioner of the police.  I must assume that was done until I hear to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In to-day's Order Paper there were a great many questions by Deputy Mulcahy about various crimes. In this country the Government seem to say that everything is going well: that only a few organised murders take place.  There are many other things which are symptomatic of the numbers of morally degenerate that we have here.  Deputy Mulcahy, in a long series of questions to-day, called attention to a great many of these ominous symptoms.  One was with regard to interference at cinemas.  He asked if the Minister was aware that on a certain date in Ballinrobe the proprietor of the cinema there informed the audience that at the request of the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána the picture of the Duke of Kent's royal wedding would not be shown.  I understand that the Minister replied that the Gárda superintendent thought it advisable to issue such advice.  Now, what are the police for? The proprietor of that cinema had a perfectly legal right to show that picture, but the Gárda superintendent apparently thought that there would be action of an illegal nature by an organisation, such action that he, the Gárda superintendent with the forces at his control, would not be able to prevent a certain amount of sabotage <Col N="738" /> and injury being done.  The Gárdaí, presumably, had reason to believe that some such action would take place. That means that the Gárda superintendent was aware that certain organisations were directing their activities against the showing of films of that nature.</P>
    <P>If the Government takes itself seriously and, realising its duty to the people, thinks that such films should not be shown, then the obvious course for the Government is to legislate to make the showing of such films unlawful, and the police, exercising their authority, will prevent their showing.  But it was a perfectly lawful act for that cinema to show that picture.  What did the Gárda superintendent do, and what was the purport of his remarks to that cinema proprietor?  It was this: &ldquo;that the law in this country is not as strong as the criminal elements in it; legally, you have a right to show the picture, but you would be well advised not to show it because the law in this country is not as strong as the lawless, and it promises better for the safety of the citizens to make friends with the mammon of iniquity and with lawless and criminal organisations in this country.&rdquo;  That is a doctrine of anarchy.  That is just one of hundreds of instances that one could give of how organised crime is immune here.</P>
    <P>The President, speaking in the House the other day, made the point that members of the Fine Gael organisation had been parties to an invitation from the I.R.A. to attend a certain meeting.  Personally, I disbelieve that.  The President's argument was directed to prove that the Government was completely impartial in the administration of justice.  Going about the country and hearing the general comments that are being made, I would never have accused the Government of insisting upon prosecuting any organisation to which a member of Fianna Fáil might belong.  What my observations lead me to believe is this: that if people want to break the law in this country the best thing they can do is to have associated with them a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="739" /> Party.  The President seemed to think that, if besides not prosecuting in cases where Fianna Fáil supporters were involved they also failed to prosecute where not only Fianna Fáil supporters were involved but also supporters of Fine Gael, that proved impartiality.  I maintain that it does not.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread opinion&mdash;I do not want to say that it is necessarily based on fact&mdash;that if an organisation contains members of Fine Gael it is going to be prosecuted, but if an organisation contains members of Fianna Fáil it is not going to be prosecuted. I have heard that, in connection even with simple matters such as those dealing with sheep and so on, the police seem carefully to avoid prominent members of Fianna Fáil.  I am not saying that that is a fact, but that is the impression through the country, and the President's argument did not refute it.  What can one think when one sees what happens to farmers who belong to an organisation suspected of advocating the non-payment of land annuities?  They are all prosecuted and brought before the Military Tribunal, while at the same time no action is taken against an organisation known to be criminal and to be unlawful, known to use violence, to advocate and to incite to violence.  The members of it are left with a free hand to commit murder.  It is up to the Government to make it clear beyond any doubt to the people of this country that what seems, obviously, to flow from juxta-position of these two cases is not a fact.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how a Government with any sense of responsibility or any sense of duty to the citizens of this country could allow that meeting to take place, and such threats to be made, without immediately arresting and bringing before the Military Tribunal those guilty of participating in it. It did not do that.  It may do it now after a murder has been committed, but that will not bring back the murdered man to life.  I speak about this aspect of the police case because I feel that it is nationally and vitally important to do so.  When one points out things like that, the method of <Col N="740" /> argument adopted by Fianna Fáil Deputies is to jump up and say: &ldquo;what did you do in 1916, or 1918 or 1921&rdquo;? Now we may have done right or we may have done wrong.  The Government may have done right or it may have done wrong in the period up to 1930.  There is no need to go back on that.  We do know that there is a tradition which is detrimental to the establishment of solid order in this country.  That being so, it is more necessary for our Government than for other Governments to take action to kill that tradition once and for all, and to establish a tradition of obedience to the law&mdash;willing obedience to it. The Government have not done that.</P>
    <P>The Government have extraordinary powers, powers that we only possessed in the last three or four months of our regime.  These are the powers given under Article 2A of the Constitution. As well as my memory serves me, between the time that Article was passed and the time we went out of office there was no serious crime in the country.  The unlawful organisations it was aimed at were effectively crushed.  Since the present Government came into office the four specific murders to which I referred earlier showed every appearance of being organised murders.  The public conscience has attributed them to organisations that were known&mdash;to organisations that have been defined as unlawful under Article 2A of the Constitution.  Every member of the I.R.A. is, according to law, liable to be brought before the Military Tribunal and to be sentenced as a member of an unlawful association.  The Government have been very careful to abstain from mentioning that organisation, but it is known to be an unlawful association and the Government does not need to do that.  It is unlawful by the very nature of the organisation itself as set out under Article 2A of the Constitution.  The Government have failed to clarify the position by definitely banning that organisation. They have allowed it to go on.  The Government know&mdash;everybody in this House knows&mdash;the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and others with <Col N="741" /> high sounding titles in that organisation. If one belongs to the Land Annuitants' Defence Association, which is suspected of advocating the non-payment of land annuities, he is pretty certain to be brought before the Military Tribunal and duly punished; but if one belongs to the I.R.A., an organisation which is known to stand for murder, to advocate murder, to commit murder and which seeks to overthrow this State created by the Irish people, an organisation which under every provision of Article 2A of the Constitution is an unlawful association&mdash;you can belong to that organisation, according to the Government's teaching, have secret knowledge of its crimes and you will not be arrested or charged with membership of it.  The Government has not used the power it possesses for getting after crime.  It has given a headline to the police in not acting against these criminal organisations.  One action the Government itself can take&mdash;that is definitely to ban such organisations as the Republican Congress and the I.R.A.  The Government has not done that.  I may as well explain what banning means.  It means that the Government names an organisation and affirms that, in its opinion, that organisation fulfils one or other of the conditions set out in the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution as making an organisation unlawful. The Government's action does not make the organisation unlawful.  I myself am perfectly satisfied that the Blueshirts were not an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>All the Government did&mdash;I am speaking now as an Opposition partisan, if you like&mdash;was dishonestly to affirm that it believed something which it knew was not true.  In my opinion, the Blueshirts have always been a lawful organisation and the action of the Government did not make them unlawful.  All it did was to put the Military Tribunal in a position in which it had to accept that affirmation by the Government as full and complete evidence and not to be questioned. The I.R.A., the Republican Congress and other organisations of <Col N="742" /> that kind, are unlawful, whether the Government bans them or not.  The Government has pointed out to the police, by its own action, that it wants to use every weapon it can against such organisations as the Blueshirts and the Land Annuitants' Defence Association.  By its inaction it has indicated that it wants to abstain from taking any action that can possibly be avoided against these diabolically criminal organisations whch supported the Government in the last three elections.  Can one blame the police?  They see that, in the case of one type of organisation, the Government affirms its belief that it is unlawful.  On the other hand, when every public statement of the constitution of the I.R.A., the end the I.R.A. seek and the methods they use to attain that end are unlawful, the Government fails to take action which would simplify the matter for the Military Tribunal and enable them to punish the guilty parties.  The Government has, by its action and inaction, given a completely wrong value to what is happening.  I have no sympathy whatever with people who try to resist the law, whatever form it may take.  I should not be a party to any action which would break the law in any way, even though the law might seem to me to be unjust. The Government's line is that it is looking for an opportunity to get after certain people and that it is carefully blinding itself with regard to other people.  Does anybody think that any member of the Front Bench could get up and say that he was honestly convinced and morally certain that the organisations to which I have referred had nothing to do with any of the crimes that have occurred in the last couple of years in this country?  We are all morally certain&mdash;I do not say that we could prove it in court&mdash;that a great many of these crimes flowed inevitably from these organisations. Notwithstanding that that is so, the Government has abstained from acting. It was almost positive in its failure to act.  At the same time, there was no loathfulness to making use of those exceptional powers which we took for ourselves and <Col N="743" /> which the Government inherited.  It has made use of these powers to a point that seems practically a prostitution of its authority.  Consequently, you cannot blame the police. I am speaking as a man in the street, who is not in the Government's secrets and who has no access to the information which is in the hands of the police.  To that man it is perfectly clear that the Government do not want to go against the I.R.A.  If it wanted to act, if it cared for the maintenance of the law, or the moral well-being of the young men of this country, it would have made use of every power it had before now.  The police have, to a large extent, turned the blind eye to the activities of the I.R.A., so that they are allowed to grow in strength with the sense of security they have from their success in those previous murders, to which I am not allowed to refer now.  They feel that they can go on and murder people without any danger of having to face the consequences which the law provides. Consequently, it seems to me that we are fully justified in refusing to vote this money to a Government which takes people's money for the maintenance of the law and the protection of the State and its citizens and, then, by its own example, discourages the police from really getting after diabolical crime and concentrates upon getting after crimes which are only dubiously illegal.  I do not refer now to the case of persons refusing the payment of public moneys, but I refer to the Blueshirt organisation, which I doubt very much was illegal.  It seems to me that it is particularly necessary for the Government to make abundantly clear that it is going to use every power the law has given it to put down such organisations as the I.R.A. and the Republican Congress, that it is going to discourage the young men of the country from joining these organisations&mdash;which inevitably lead to the path of crime&mdash;by making it dangerous for them to join. Ever since this Government came into power there was every incitement to young men to join these organisations and go parading through the <Col N="744" /> country posing as patriots, instead of being, as they are, moral degenerates. It is clear from the More O'Ferrall case that the Government has failed in its duty and it is up to the Government to assure the people that it realises its duty and that it is going not only to prevent such murders as the More O'Ferrall case and to punish those guilty, but that it is going to prevent the premonitory symptoms of crime by preventing young men from being inveigled into organisations which lead up to such outrages as the murder of Mr. More O'Ferrall.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Estimate for the reason that it is supplying the sinews of war to carry on what the Minister announced as a drive for the annuities.  I understood from what the Minister said that that was part and parcel of this Supplementary Estimate.  We have here under various heads the sum of £41,985, and I find that part of this is for locomotion expenses and subsistence allowances which would amount to £15,000.  I would seriously advise the Minister and the Government to take due note of the situation before any further tyrannical measures are taken against the farmers in this country. It is really hard to talk dispassionately about the situation that exists in the country to-day, remembering that one hears stories of even night raids made for annuities, and of seizures for annuities where families are in fear and trembling of the sheriffs and the Guards and everyone else.  I should like the Minister to consider what the situation is and whether he is justified in stating that the conditions prevailing in the country are due to agitation or to any organisation against the payment of annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This day I received an answer to a question put to the Minister for Finance.  I would advise the Minister for Justice and other Ministers to study that answer.  The question was in relation to the unpaid annuities in every county in the Saorstát and the answer discloses a rather regular but sad state of affairs.  It gives the amount of money outstanding last year and this year, or, rather the amount of grants withheld from the county councils.  It gives the amounts <Col N="746" /> in each county on the 17th February last year, and on the 17th February this year, and they make illuminating and convincing reading.  I would advise the Government, before they look for a Supplementary Estimate to carry Guards into the farmers' homes, in order to compel them to pay money that they are not able to pay, to study this and see what comes out of it. Surely, the people from Donegal to Cork have not become so dishonest as not to pay their bills and annuities. If they have, the Government is to blame for their demoralisation.  Take any county in the year February, 1934 to February, 1935, and we find three times as much owing by each county in 1934 as in 1933.  That is a very sad state of affairs.  I admit, on the basis of calculation, it would be entitled to owe twice as much for the reason that the amount due on the 17th February, 1934, was only for the last half of the year 1933.</P>

      <P>No; I have not attempted to do that.  What I have attempted to do is plainly to show that a state of affairs exists which is regular, county by county.  I have no other way of showing that.  The Minister and many of the Government people will say that a state of affairs exists, for instance, in Westmeath, in Cork, in Waterford, in Tipperary and in other places which calls for Gárda activity and which justifies this Estimate. My object is to show that that is not so, but that the same state of affairs exists, county by county, all over the State and that the fact that the Minister directs the attention of the Gárda to the situation in Westmeath, in Cork, or in some other particular county will not cure a disease which is widespread and regular.  That is my point.  We have 27 county councils, Tipperary having two.  I will be very brief in my references.  The unpaid annuities have increased from 1934 to 1935&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My point is that, in face of that, there is absolutely no sense in bringing about greater Gárda and sheriff's activity, as the Minister said he wants the Estimate for, because he cannot cure that disease in that way.  That disease which exists in Westmeath exists all over the country and from one end of the country to the other.  I am not endeavouring to make any Party capital out of this; my object is to get the Minister to see that he cannot cure that situation by Gárda activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> I have been reading some papers recently, and I came across a paper, which I have here by me, with regard to the I.R.A. and its activities.  An extraordinary thing about the situation is that while it appears to be a crime, according to the evidence we saw given in Dublin last week or the week before, for a man to say that he has paid his annuities twice, it is no crime for a man, and even a public man and the chairman of a local authority, to declare that there is no national army in this country but one, and that the I.R.A.  He can declare that publicly, and has declared it publicly.  I have the statement by me.  Two members of a local authority in the South of Ireland made that declaration and had it published in the papers, and we expect respect for the established law while that thing is going on.  The Government must take the bull by the horns sooner or later.  Sooner or later it must be done, and I again submit that a strengthening of the Gárda force, the provision of greater equipment and greater locomotion, will not meet the annuities situation which the Minister wants to meet by this Estimate in any shape or form.  It has got to be met in some other way, and if the Minister and his Government do not see fit to meet it in some other way, they are not going to get a solution for it in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say only a few words, and, first of all, I shall ask the Minister a question.  I should like to know from the Minister how much of the costs which are entailed&mdash;and they are pretty substantial&mdash;in the collection of land annuities which are collected by seizure go towards the organisation which collects them by seizure?  I have seen some very substantial payments being made in that respect where seizures have taken place, and now that the introduction of the Vote which we have debated here to-day is influenced, to a large extent, by the extra cost to the State, due to these squads going around, I should like to know if any of these costs find their way to the alleviation of the new expense which we are asked to find to-day. When new and additional Votes <Col N="750" /> of money are required for those who administer the law in this country, it means that there is greater disrespect for the law, and when the present Government sat on these benches, I often heard and often read their denunciations of the huge cost of the Guards and of the redundant number of Guards and the statement that this country could very easily get on with a far lesser force at a far lesser cost.  As a matter of fact, I remember sitting in the Gallery on one occasion and listening to the members of the present Government firing everything from a landscape to an oilcan across the House at the previous Administration, and we find to-day that the amount required has gone to something like £200,000 over what the previous Administration sought from the taxpayer to administer the Gárda force of this country.  That must mean one thing, and that is, greater disrespect for the law.</P>
      <P>To my mind, this country is festering with politics.  Politics take command and control of everything, and politics to-day are responsible for disrespect for the law in this country.  Politics to-day in this country rule practically everything from the point of view of administration, local or otherwise, and once politics get into administration, local or otherwise, disrespect for the law is bound to occur and more money will be required.  So far as I can see, this Vote is not going to be the end of this, but future years are going to bring greater cost, because every day, among the ordinary people of the country, we find politics becoming a greater incentive and a greater influence, and it is not an influence for good.  Disrespect for the law brings about a state of affairs in which good citizenship fails.  As a matter of fact, it is quite honest and sincere to say that politics to-day are, in many parts of our country, a greater interest and a bigger influence than religion, and, naturally, when they reach the pitch at which they bring greater disrespect for the law, more and more upholders of the law, in the form of police and detectives, are required.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for the administration of the Department and, in that way, I endeavour to connect my remarks.  I do not wish to speak any longer than three or four minutes and to refer to this disrespect for the law.  I am coupling with that the necessary costs in which this disrespect is involving the taxpayer.  To my mind, the time has come for strong denunciation on public platforms of whatever organisation the new I.R.A. is called, or other organisations if necessary, for that disrespect of the law which they are bringing about in this country.  I am quite certain that Deputies on that side get a paper called <i>An Phobhlacht.</i> I buy it sometimes; sometimes it is sent to me.  Why that paper is allowed to be published in this country I cannot understand.  It is one of the means for bringing about a grave disrespect for all the institutions of this State.  A lot of what is printed in it is not only rank Communism but is also anti-Christian, and is having a grave influence on our young people. I certainly should like to see some of the Deputies on this side of the House, and some of the Deputies on that side of the House getting together on public platforms, and not being afraid, either politically or morally, to denounce that organisation and what they are printing throughout the country.  I have no more to say, a Leas Chinn Comhairle, because I feel myself wandering away from what the debate on this Vote is confined to.  In those few words I certainly am sincere, and I certainly think that unless public men come out strongly <Col N="752" /> in support of the forces of the law and in denunciation of those organisations which by solemn Pastoral have been denounced in this country, it is plain that those who are endeavouring to maintain the law may give up, and not waste their time trying to bring about a decent state of affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here an additional Vote of almost £36,000 for the Gárda Síochána.  One does not like to vote on this particular Estimate without expressing some opinions on it. One would not object to the Estimate if it were really necessary.  I note that one sub-head provides for equipment, etc. for 200 extra recruits.  As far as most of us are aware, there does not appear to be any great necessity for an addition to the Gárda.  If the Gárda were used, in the main, for the purposes for which they were originally recruited, I think the force which is in existence would be quite large enough. Latterly, however, the Gárda have been used for purposes for which they were never instituted.  Even if they were used in that particular manner, there might be some fairness, as between different sections of the community, in the use to which the Guards are put.  While we have repeated instances of the Guards' inability to discover the culprits in certain crimes, we have, on the other hand, desperate activity on the part of the same force in apprehending men, young and old, all over the country, detaining them for days, and then liberating them without having discovered any charge, even by the gravest cross-examination of the particular men.  In my own county we have repeated instances of that.  We have had shootings in Kilfinnane, as Deputy Mulcahy has mentioned in this House on a couple of occasions.  Houses were fired into. Nobody has been apprehended in that connection up to the present, and nobody will, I expect.  In that immediate neighbourhood since then we have had constant instances of young men being apprehended, taken 25 miles to Limerick, kept for two days, cross-examined and straight-examined and examined in every other method.  They were then liberated <Col N="753" /> without any charge whatever being made against them.  I do not know of any instance where any man was apprehended on suspicion of being implicated in the Kilfinnane crimes, taken to Limerick or cross-examined. There are just as much grounds for charging or suspecting somebody on one side as there are for suspecting somebody on the other.  Then we have the incident which occurred in Bruree. The Gárda go to a funeral, apprehend a couple of men, and take them away from the funeral.  The excuse was given that they were liberated afterwards. They were liberated when the funeral was over, but this indignity was offered to them.  They were questioned and examined but no charge was made.  We are now asked to pass an additional Vote for that sort of occurrence.</P>
      <P>There is, in this particular Vote, a sum for subsistence allowance.  A lot of that is unnecessary expenditure. Are we to assume, for instance, that we are going to have repeated instances of what occurred at a seizure in Limerick lately when numerous Guards were provided with. I suppose, subsistence allowance&mdash;they must have been provided with something&mdash;for perambulating around a farmer's premises for 14 hours, without any necessity whatever.  This is expense which ought not to be called for.  I am not charging the Guards with anything.  I do not want to charge them with anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had, and we have in this country, as fine a set of men in the Gárda as are in any country in the world. The Guards would, and did, and perhaps do their duty to a certain extent, but their activities must be curtailed or directed in a certain manner.  I am certain that the Guards must have some lead or some direction to devote their activities to persecuting or prosecuting a certain type of individual rather than another.  I cannot believe they would act as they are acting if it were otherwise.  There does not appear to be any particular necessity why the members of the public who support the Opposition should be prosecuted rather than the members who support the Government, but that is <Col N="754" /> what is happening in every county, particularly in mine.  We have had, as I mentioned a second ago&mdash;one does not want to repeat oneself too much&mdash; instances of men, young and old, being apprehended every second day and carried into Limerick without any necessity.  We have the Guards used in escorting bailiffs hither and thither from one farm to another without any great necessity; all this could be done in the usual way.  Ninety-nine out of every hundred supporters of our Party in the County Limerick, which I represent, and I daresay in every other county, would attend any court on a summons. If there is any charge to be made against them there would be no necessity whatever to send the Gárda around the country at great expense to question and apprehend them.  We do not defy the law, and our supporters do not defy the law.  We are willing to abide by the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When they were accused of cutting trees and wires, and sometimes when they were guilty, they did not defy the law or the courts. They recognised the courts; they recognised the authority of the judges to try them wherever they were sent, and they took their punishment.  If they were like other members of the public, unwilling to recognise any force or any court, there might be some necessity for expending huge sums of money in apprehending them.  But it is not for that purpose that this money is to be used.  It is to be used to put those citizens who are abiding by the law and upholding the law, to the expense of prosecutions and trials.  It is against such men that this is being used, against an organisation which, if perchance one of its members breaks the law, brings pressure to see that he abides by the law, that he acknowledges the courts of the country and seeks justice.  We had instances of that to which I am alluding in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Guards are brought to the level of a rowdy crowd.  That is the condition to which they are brought by the <Col N="755" /> present Ministry.  At one time it used to be the custom in street brawls and street fights for rowdies to act on the principle of &ldquo;Hit the man first before he hits you.&rdquo;  That is the policy the Guards are now asked to pursue.  Hit him first before he hits you.  If you are afraid he is going to hit you, then shoot him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the idea is get in your blow first.  That is what the Guards have come to now.  Perchance in a country district there is no real crime and no men are apprehended because it is a peaceful district.  What happens?  The officer in charge is called upon to explain why there are no activities in his district and he is possibly moved away from that locality and some officer who is more amenable to the directions given by his superiors put into his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now these are the things for which we are asked to vote money.  We have here an item of £373 for extra ammunition.  Why that is enough ammunition to shoot every farmer in Munster.  The whole farming population of the southern counties could be shot at less cost than £373.  We are seriously asked to vote money for this.  I will not waste the time of the House in going through the particular items of this Estimate. That one argument is quite sufficient why no Deputy in this House should vote for it.  In the first place there would be no necessity for this extra Vote if the force were properly used.  There is no necessity at all why there should be any addition at all to the money already voted.  In the second place, if there were impartial use made of the Guards and if they were allowed to be the force that they were a couple of years ago, the Guards would be able to do their duty without any extra expense to the community and they would do it impartially.  In addition, the number of Guards that we had three years ago would suffice now. The Minister cannot make any case to prove the opposite.  If there were any apparent necessity for an increase in <Col N="756" /> the number of the Guards or an increase in their allowances or for an increase in the supply of ammunition, the case would be different.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Guards will never again use their ammunition on the people; I hope that it will never be necessary for them to use it.  We had instances where Guards, under much greater provocation than was present in Cork, refused to use guns on the people.  The members of the old Guards and, indeed, the members of the R.I.C. who preceded them, did not use their guns in the way they were used in Cork.  I remember a case in Limerick where a lunatic was being apprehended and though he shot one of the R.I.C. they apprehended him without firing a single shot.  I know there were many instances of that in the Civic Guards, too.  It remained for one of our own Governments to applaud Guards who shot down, in cold blood, men whom they could have apprehended without the firing of a shot or even the use of a baton.  In the face of that we are asked to provide extra ammunition for the Guards.  I say it is an insult to the intelligence of the House that it should be asked to vote this money.  It is certainly an insult to the Opposition, whose supporters in the country are being persecuted and arrested without even any charge being preferred against them.  I hope that not alone will the Deputies on this side of the House vote against this Estimate, but that honest Deputies on the Government side, men who believe in justice, properly and justly meted out, will join us in voting against any increase in the Gárda Síochána Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to vote extra money, presumably, to enable the law to be administered.  I am a great upholder of the law and always was.  I would certainly support the Minister and his Government and give them every assistance in getting the money to uphold the law.  But before supporting this Vote I would like to be convinced that the law is being impartially administered.  In the next place I would like to be <Col N="757" /> convinced that there is an absolute necessity for this money to be expended in the way outlined by the Minister for Justice.  I think if there were a little commonsense and a little patience exhibited there might not be any necessity for any addition to the Gárda Síochána forces, or any necessity for this extra money.  In asking for that exhibition of patience I am only following the lead given by the President himself when he spoke of certain organisations in the country such as the I.R.A.  The President stated here on more than one occasion that there was a sort of tradition behind such organisations.  I, personally, sympathise with the President in the attitude he took up which really meant that if a little patience and forbearance were shown to members of these organisations the result would be more beneficial and that a better state of things would be brought about than if force were used against them.  Personally I think that he was right on that particular point.  The only qualification I have to make now is that I think the time has arrived when it is past showing patience and forbearance to such organisations.</P>
      <P>But I would say to the Minister and to the President in regard to the collection of annuities and to some of the incidents that have happened in the South of Ireland that perhaps some patience and some forbearance might be displayed.  I do not know much about these incidents because in Louth we are a very quiet sort of people.  We do not break the law much.  We try to do the very best we can in difficult circumstances.  At the same time we do sympathise with the people in the South of Ireland, knowing and believing the hardships they are enduring as a result of the policy pursued by the Government.  We do believe that these farmers are the victims of circumstances over which they have no control.  We, therefore, think that the Government should not take the extreme steps that they have taken and which, apparently, they are about to take so far as the future is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to know from the Minister is whether any of this Vote <Col N="758" /> will find its way into the pockets of those clever fellows from the North of Ireland who go down to the southern counties to buy cattle at sheriff's auctions?  I would like to know whether any of this money will go to these people to enable them to bring cattle from the southern counties into our decent county and enable them to take a jump across the Border.  I submit that if supporters of the Government are genuine and honest they should come out into the open and buy those cattle themselves.  If members on the Fianna Fáil Benches were genuine, and if they are really behind the President in the steps he is taking against the farmers in the South of Ireland, surely they should have the moral courage to go out publicly to the auctions and shout: &ldquo;this is our policy; we are going to abide by it and we are going to buy these cattle.&rdquo;  They should do that in preference to asking some trick-of-the-loop fellows to come down here from Deputy Donnelly's constituency in the North of Ireland and, while shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; do their best to provide John Bull with cheap beef. I want to know from the Minister if any of this money is going to these playboys?</P>
    <P>I would like also to know whether it is necessary at these sales to have an unduly large number of Civic Guards present?  I do not think the people in the South are so unruly as that the ordinary forces of Civic Guards in the districts in which the sales are held would not be sufficient to preserve order and enable the authorities to carry out whatever sales they intend to carry out.  I do not know whether it is in order to refer on this Vote to the Cork business, to the shooting that happened there.  A certain incident happened in Cork when men were shot in cold blood.  That has been applauded by the Minister and certain judges on the Bench&mdash;men shot without any rhyme or reason, men who could have been arrested without the spilling of one drop of blood.  That is what government in this country is going to come to and I as an Irishman would <Col N="759" /> say: &ldquo;Heaven deliver us from that type of liberty.&rdquo;  I hope we will never see the day when we will have complete freedom established in this country if what has happened in Cork is a forerunner of what we may expect from our own countrymen in the matter of the administration of the law.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer, but as the subject of it is <i>sub judice</i> I do not know whether I can refer to it here.  It has, however, been referred to in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st March and it is in connection with the unfortunate occurrence that took place in Carlingford, which resulted in the death of a young man there.  From the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st March one would gather that the Guards had definitely solved the Carlingford Lough mystery.  The report stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 5 (1) to delete paragraph (e) and substitute a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) make provision for the exclusion or the deportation and <Col N="763" /> exclusion of such aliens from Saorstát Eireann and provide for and authorise the making by the Minister of orders for that purpose;</P>
    <P>Perhaps a word of explanation might be helpful.  As the section stands, the Minister is given power to make orders in general, called alien orders, which would include a particular exclusion or deportation order.  The point is to remove this from that general class and enable the Minister to make an aliens order which would give him power to make these particular orders.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 5 (2) (b), lines 49 and 50, to delete the words &ldquo;and powers of searching persons and places.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose is to prepare the way for the amendment which meets the points made by Deputy McGilligan on the last occasion, namely, that the powers of search of premises, etc., should be restricted and should only be permitted when a warrant has been given.  Later on we are providing for a search warrant in such cases.  I promised to introduce an amendment of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not entirely meet the point I made.  I had an amendment down on the last day to the effect that nothing in the section shall operate&mdash;therefore, whatever powers there were previously would still remain&mdash;to confer on the Minister or on the variety of people mentioned any power or right to arrest or detain or search a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, or forcibly to enter the dwelling of a citizen.  The President proposes to take out of the section merely this: &ldquo;and powers of searching persons and places.&rdquo;  There is, therefore, still left this, that the Minister any time he likes can bring in aliens orders and that these may contain provisions with regard to giving the Minister and a variety of <Col N="764" /> officers through the country the power of arrest and detention.  That is not even confined to aliens.  There are powers for the arrest and detention of anybody.  I am presuming, since there is no restriction on it, that it has complete application.  The point I made, therefore, has not been met. That may be deliberate, but it is wrong to phrase it as if the point I made had been met.</P>
      <P>I urged that under the Constitution we have set out to give certain guarantees, such as personal liberty, freedom from arrest, and also that a dwelling house would be inviolable. We now have these two sets of principles broken in on.  With regard to search, the new proposal is that the power of searching persons and places is to be taken out of this section, and that is all.  It then goes into a special section afterwards and, when the search order is given, arising out of the order anybody may be arrested. So that we have the power of arrest reinforced.  First of all, under the section as it stands, the Minister at his own sweet will can bring in an aliens order and put in provisions conferring upon himself and a variety of people mentioned the power to arrest and detain.  Then later on he can move towards the arrest and detention <i>via</i> a search order.  But under this he can arrest and detain anybody, not merely an alien, and the necessity for that has not been explained to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did make a very special point, I think, on that occasion about the searching of dwellings and the power of arrest.  It is quite true that the powers of arrest are retained here, but powers of arrest are very general in a variety of laws. It has been pointed out to me that a park policeman can arrest and detain in certain circumstances.  It is thought that the power of arrest and detention is necessary and that there is no violation of the spirit of the Constitution generally in this matter.  As I say, we are meeting the particular point the Deputy made about search.  The necessity for the later amendment about a search warrant is that under the law <Col N="765" /> as it stands a justice could not, unless specially empowered, give a search warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is by way of being the most amazing answer to which I have yet listened.  The freedom of the person is a constitutional proviso.  We have put it up as a sort of constitutional guarantee.  I raised it here as a breach, at any rate, of the spirit of the Constitution&mdash;not that we pass a law precisely stating why a man should be arrested, but that we pass a law saying that the Minister can confer the power upon a variety of people. Groups of civil servants come into it; the army, customs and excise officers and the police come into it&mdash;anybody in the police force.  We do not state precisely the terms under which a person may be arrested, which I will call breaking in on that constitutional provision by law, but we make this general breach that the Minister can confer power upon all these people to arrest.</P>
      <P>The President's answer is that there are very wide powers of arrest at present. I know that.  Therefore, the President apparently thinks, to make this further breach does not matter. I do not mind a further breach being made in the constitutional provision as long as the law is fairly precise and clear, and known to people, but here the Minister can confer the power to arrest and detain&mdash;which is not a thing taken lightly in most countries&mdash;if he thinks the power is necessary for the purpose of giving full effect to enforcing compliance with the order.  That is not confined to aliens alone, but is applicable to citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that when this is passed it will be law.  The orders that will be made under the Act will set out fairly and clearly the conditions under which these powers are necessary.  They will be laid on the Table of both Houses and in that way will be open to Parliamentary criticism and they can be annulled if anything is done which does not meet with the approval of the Oireachtas. In that way there is no breach which is not a breach that would be in accordance with the definite will of Parliament.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>In page 4 before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever a justice of the District Court is satisfied, on the information on oath of an officer of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that it is reasonably necessary, for the purposes of the enforcement of an aliens order or an order made under an aliens order, that any particular land, building, premises, or other place should be searched by members of the Gárda Síochána, such justice may issue to such officer such search warrant as is mentioned in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A search warrant issued by a justice of the District Court under this section shall be expressed and <Col N="769" /> shall operate to authorise a named member of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of inspector accompanied by such other members of the Gárda Síochána as he shall think proper, at any time within forty-eight hours after the issue of such search warrant, and if needs be by force, to enter and search the land, building, premises, or place specified in such search warrant and to search and interrogate and to arrest all or any persons or person found in such place.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that a search warrant must be obtained before a premises is searched.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that the Deputy was rather anxious, when he was speaking about this, that an officer of sufficiently high rank should make the application and that an officer of sufficiently high rank would conduct the search.  Both of these matters are provided for.  The application is to be made by an officer not below the rank of superintendent and the search is to be carried out by an officer not below the rank of an inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Treasonable Offences Act, which the President at one time regarded as a frightful engine of oppression, the search had to be carried out by an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent. Again, we find here that the application to the district justice can be made by a superintendent.  Under the Treasonable Offences Act, an officer not below the rank of chief superintendent had to justify to the district justice his apprehensions of a rather precise thing&mdash;that treasonable documents were in the premises.  Here all he has got to do is to satisfy the court that it is reasonably necessary for the purpose of the enforcement of the aliens order that certain land or premises should be searched, which is very far <Col N="770" /> from being precise.  I do not know why the lowering of the rank of the officer concerned has taken place in this rather imprecise matter when previously the President raged at the thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was just a sort of hysterical rage.  He told us that this was a terrible engine of oppression. Incidentally, that Act was to be repealed but it has not been.  Under that Act, an officer of a rank not lower than chief superintendent had to justify to the district justice his apprehension that, I think the phrase was, treasonable documents would be found there.  Therefore, a chief superintendent going before a district justice had something rather precise in his mind's eye, something he could swear to, and make a reasonable case about. Here we are allowing a superintendent to justify to the district justice that the warrant is reasonably necessary for the purpose of enforcing this order. Again, it is weakening the guarantee given in the Constitution.  We are told that it is the law but, of course, the law can do anything.  If it were left as it was before, it would still be the law.</P>

      <P>This seems to me to be much more precise&mdash;&ldquo;reasonably necessary for the purposes of the enforcement of an aliens order.&rdquo;  I think the justice will have a much more definite matter before him than a district justice who is asked by a chief superintendent for a warrant to search for documents under the Treasonable Offences Act.</P>

      <P>Under sub-section (2) of the amendment, after a search warrant is issued, not merely can there be a search but there may be interrogation or arrest &ldquo;of all or any person or persons found in such place.&rdquo;  Why?  Is it just for the sake of taking them?  It authorises an officer to enter and search the premises.  That is the thing that is aimed at, but then, having got inside the premises, there may be interrogation, if not arrest, of all or any persons found in such place.  Surely there should be some words added indicating just what is the limit of the powers of arrest and the scope of the interrogation?  Surely it must have something to do with the purpose of the search?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that these powers are necessary if the orders are to be made effective.

      <P>This is aimed at citizens.  It is not directed against aliens.  The position is that all that a superintendent of the police hereafter has got to do is to get an entry to a house.  He gets that by justifying his position to the district justice, that it is reasonably necessary to enforce an aliens order that he should enter.  He then gets his search warrant or his entry warrant.  He enters and searches, and thereupon he can go around among a group of people on the premises&mdash;say, a family&mdash;and interrogate all or any of the persons found there and arrest the whole lot.

      <P>I think it is quite clear.  With regard to the Deputy's suggested amendment, I take it that it is implied in the whole Bill&mdash;in this section as well as in the others&mdash; that this would be done in order to make effective an aliens order.</P>

      <P>These things indicate in a general way whatever limitations there are, and I suggest that no matter what you do to meet the Deputy's further points, one can imagine contingencies where there would be abuse of powers.  The Deputy is aiming, I know, at limiting the chances of such abuse of powers. I admit that officers, in conducting inquiries and in making arrests, undoubtedly can abuse their powers, but there are ways of dealing with officers who act in such a way and I think we will have to leave that to be dealt with in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not by the courts?  The President speaks of the possibility of the abuse of power.  If you swing to the other extreme and say that nobody will abuse powers, then there is no necessity for anything except general phrases.  We do not always assume, however, that powers are not going to be abused.  Let us assume the possibility of the abuse of powers.  Is the liberty of the subject in this country so slight a matter that it is not worth while putting into a clause, which allows his liberty to be taken away, the general reasons for it. And has it not the further effect that if you put in a phrase limiting interrogation, arrest and detention and put in something to the effect that it has to do with the enforcement of the Aliens Act, you take that officer away from the control merely of his administrative authorities and put him under the control of the courts if he does something blatantly outside his authority? As it stands, however, a police officer can go into a house and interrogate people and arrest them for anything and say that he is arresting them for something quite outside the aliens order, and there is no power under that section to bring him before a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy will have to take paragraph (1) in connection with paragraph (2). According to paragraph (1), before the officers enter the premises they must have satisfied a magistrate that it is really necessary to enter the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is granted. Then they go in with a search warrant and search, but there must have been some <i>prima facie</i> evidence, at any rate, before the leave to enter would be granted.  When they get in, they will have to use their own discretion with regard to the questions that may <Col N="774" /> be asked in order to carry out their duties, and I think you cannot tie them down any more.  You will have to depend upon disciplinary action and administrative action to prevent any officer in such a case from overstepping his duty.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy McGilligan's point, why not, instead of the phrase &ldquo;all or any persons,&rdquo; have some such phrase as &ldquo;such person or persons as may be necessary for the purposes of the Act&rdquo;?  Deputy McGilligan's point is, surely, a substantial one.  There is no reason why the liberty of the subject should be left at the mercy of the whim of some person executing a search warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take this case. Suppose any of us here were officers carrying out this duty, is it not clear that that is the sense in which we would interpret it?  How can one imagine a circumstance in which an officer is going to arrest or detain unless he has good grounds for doing so under the order under which he has a warrant? In order to arrive at certain conclusions he might have to ask certain persons on the premises certain questions, but, as regards arrest and detention, under what circumstances is an officer likely to arrest or detain anybody but those necessary to be arrested and detained for the purpose of enforcing the aliens order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not that argument justify a power of universal arrest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give a case which must jump to the President's mind.  A certain gentleman was arrested in this country about two years ago.  The house had been entered on a warrant to search for stolen property, and when it was being searched for stolen property a gun was discovered on the premises.  That gun could not be taken, nor could any action be taken against that young man with regard to the possession of that gun because the warrant did not entitle the officers to take such action, and the police had to go back and get a warrant for it <Col N="775" /> under the Firearms Act.  They went back and got the warrant and came back and arrested him, and the President later released him.  There is one case.  At the moment, however, a house might be entered on a search warrant procured in relation to the Aliens Act, and something might occur in that house which would lead the officers on to an entirely different track.  Do you want to give them power to arrest in connection with this other matter?  As things are, it seems to me that they can arrest and say that they are doing it.  I think that some real importance ought to be attached to the liberty of the subject in this country.  We are giving wide powers in regard to orders generally, and still wider powers in regard to enforcing compliance with orders, and now a man can go to the district justice, just substantiate a plea in relation to the necessity for a search under the aliens order, get inside the house, and then interrogate anybody he meets there in any way he likes and, arising out of that interrogation, he can arrest and detain for some other matter. If that is desired, then say so; but the whole argument at this moment is that we must assume that these officers will act properly and that they will not arrest except in relation to aliens orders.  If that is the situation we want to bring about when we are making a further breach in regard to the law affecting the liberty of the subject, let us try to take some phrase that a court can seize on so that we will not have merely administrative action to deal with abuse of powers, but that in a blatant case the power of the courts can be called in to rectify whatever injustice there may be.  It only means restricting the powers of arrest and detention to the purposes of the order, or of the search warrant, which themselves are tied on to the Aliens Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Deputy must agree that if somebody were improperly detained as a result of a straining, or rather of an abuse of, the powers that are given here, whatever remedies that would be open to him under the amendment suggested <Col N="776" /> by the Deputy would be open to him as it stands here, because no court, I take it, would interpret that clause except as a whole.  It is clear, I think, that this arrest and detention would only take place when it was necessary for the enforcement of an aliens order.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that section and I say that that section would not be read by itself.  It would be taken in its complete context.  I also say that if a person were improperly detained and if there were an abuse of powers, whatever legal action would be open to him under the amendment suggested by the Deputy would be open to him as it stands and that the remedy would be just as likely to be forthcoming.  The whole purpose of this is to make aliens orders effective.  I do not think there is any need for trying to meet the point, because it may be taken that if any officer abuses his power disciplinary action can be depended upon as a last resort.</P>

I cannot understand how the intention of the section would not be looked to, with a view to seeing what is behind it, and to see what was the intention of the Legislature in framing the section.  The powers are given for the specific purpose of enforcing a particular law.  In this case part of a particular law is enforced unless the Deputy suggests that some words should be put in to hamper and to restrict the officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy calculates on some interference with the liberty of the subject; that some person will be wrongfully arrested.  I presume what the Deputy suggests is that there cannot be wrongful arrest. Supposing this section were qualified in any way, I cannot see where you could safeguard a person who was taken by mistake or wrongfully if officers of the law cared to go outside the powers they are intended to have.</P>

      <P>May I repeat my example?  The Attorney-General must know at the beginning of his period of a particular house and of a search warrant in relation to stolen property. When it was searched a gun was found on the premises.  The police could not take that gun or take away any person in relation to it.  They departed and got another search warrant for firearms.  A man was duly arrested and was sentenced and the Government released him.  Does the Attorney-General want that to happen again?  On entry being made with <Col N="780" /> an aliens search warrant that man could be taken up for having a gun. Is that desired?  I take it that is possible under the section.  If it is we know where we are.  The argument so far is that that is not desired.  Why not be precise?  Surely it is worth while, in a matter like the liberty of the subject, getting in a precise phrase saying that the arrest can only be made.  Tie it to one thing that it is considered necessary by someone to enforce the order.  If a man is arrested for having a gun, under this section that will not be legal.  The man who arrests can be brought before the courts, and the man who has been arrested can be got out under a writ of habeas-corpus.</P>

      <P>It was felt that the section, as it stands, was rather too precise and that greater liberty should be given to the Minister to deal with the variety of cases he may have to consider where we are extending reciprocity.  He would have to take all the circumstances into account, including the laws in force in the country concerned governing emigration. It might be very difficult to parallel exactly the exemptions here with the exemptions that might be granted in the countries to which it was desired to give reciprocity.

      <P>A couple of questions were raised by Deputy Cosgrave with regard to items in this Estimate.  There is a mistake in the figures I read out.  The first figure&mdash;that for rent allowance&mdash; should be £1,000 instead of £1,150.  The other question raised by Deputy Cosgrave was in regard to transport.  The item in the Estimate deals with the vehicles sent on protection duty and their various activities.  It covers the cost of additional cars and an item of, I think, £735 for petrol.  Deputy <Col N="785" /> MacDermot, at the outset, introduced a matter which it is very difficult for any member of the Government to deal with under the present circumstances. He referred to the reply given the other night by the President on the question of the murder at Edgeworthstown. I do not feel that I am in a position to deal adequately with that matter.  I could not possibly deal with it in the position in which matters are at the present time.  I think the Deputy appreciates that.  For these reasons, I submit that he should not have raised the matter at the present time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will permit me to interrupt him for a moment in order to deal with a point with which I intended to deal when speaking before.  As I understand, certain men were detained for interrogation last week.  I did not know beforehand that men were going to be detained.  I put down my questions on the subject quite independent of anybody being detained.  I do not know whether people are still detained. I am not <i>au courant</i> with the situation in that respect.  I cannot help remarking that nobody appears, even now, to be charged.  It is quite impossible for us to abstain from discussing matters of such importance, where the administration of the Government is called in question, because a series of persons may be undergoing questioning on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect&mdash;and only one aspect&mdash;of the matter can be dealt with by me now.  That is the issue raised in a letter dated 8th of the present month, which the Deputy received and which was only passed across to me by the Deputy this evening. That letter is from Mr. More O'Ferrall.  The President, in answering the case made by the Deputy the other night, gave the substance of the police report which dealt with that question of protection.  I shall quote a paragraph of the report submitted by the police as to the protection that was afforded.  This report was submitted to the Commissioner on the 2nd March, 1935, in answer to questions <Col N="786" /> forwarded by the Commissioner.  The report states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On Sunday, 11th November, 1934, Gárda Ml. Breen (1090) and Gárda Thomas E. Walsh (4228) called on Mr. More O'Ferrall at Lissard House to inquire when he intended to collect the rents from the Edgeworthstown town tenants and he (Mr. More O'Ferrall) informed them that he intended to attend at the Imperial Hotel the following day, 12th November, 1934. He said he did not anticipate any trouble and that, if the tenants did not pay, the Courts were at his disposal. He further intimated in no polite manner that he did not want the Guards around his place, that their presence would only interfere with the collection of the rents. Notwithstanding this, constant patrols were formed in the vicinity of Lissard House by day and by night.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The letter which the Deputy has quoted joins issue with that statement. Until that matter is cleared up, I do not feel that I should say any more with regard to the protection aspect of the question.  With regard to the other matter, I think that it would be most improper to enter into any discussion of it at the present time.  Lest anybody be misled by statements made in this House or outside it with regard to the activities of the Gárda, I may say that increased forces have been sent into that area.  The most efficient men in the Gárda in respect of detective work have been operating in that area for some time and no effort will be spared to secure that the people guilty of this crime will be made amenable.</P>
      <P>It has been sneered at here to-day, not by Deputy MacDermot, but by other Deputies, and it has been sneered at outside the House that a reward has been offered.  I have seen statements by Deputies who may consider themselves responsible Deputies that such rewards were appealing to the baser instincts of the country, and that it is a vicious business that we have started on.</P>

      <P>Under the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration rewards were offered to try and secure that information would be made available to the authorities that would bring certain people to justice.  We are simply trying to do that.  Deputy MacEoin pointed out something different from what we are used to hearing with regard to conditions in the country.  He said he had nothing whatever to say against the Guards in Longford.  He said they were doing their duty well and faithfully. He did make a complaint.  He mentioned certain cases.  In cases where he said there was certain hardship he attributed this to the new recruits taken in.  I suggest to any Deputy who is aware of any such cases existing, that the proper attitude to adopt, and the practice to follow, would be to send that information to the Commissioner of the Police, or to the Department of Justice.  If these cases are not fully investigated, it is because complaints are not sent in.  It is unfair to me and to the Gárda, that no responsible complaint is made to any officer as to the action of irresponsible members of the force if such there are, and it is not fair to raise them in another way afterwards here in this House.  What is worse is the practice of making general statements and not specifying or giving any details in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to a superintendent who was removed from Longford.  I do not know what case is referred to.  I know that superintendents have been transferred but I am not aware of any superintendent being removed from office, or of anything like that.  Questions were raised on the previous Estimate as to the number of transfers effected.  There is nothing abnormal about an officer being transferred. In many cases quite efficient and effective officers, for particular reasons, might not be found quite <Col N="788" /> suitable in one area, while suitable in another.  Very often, through no fault of his own, a Gárda officer incurs a certain amount of unpopularity, or a Gárda very often who is an officer may be anxious to be transferred to another place.  There is nothing penalising in a transfer of an officer from one place to another.  He loses nothing by it.  His expenses of conveyance are allowed, and he is not degraded or anything like that.  I do not see any point in a superintendent being removed if it means that he was transferred.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to cases where a lot of wires were cut by I.R.A., with a view, he said, to damaging the League of Youth and stopping their organisation in certain areas.  I suggest that people with any information about that should supply it to the Gárda.  He also mentioned that any information supplied to the Gárda is in the hands of the I.R.A. in twenty-four hours. I suggest to Deputy Mulcahy that that is a contemptible statement.</P>

      <P>The matter of the exclusion of the public from these sales was mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave.  These are public sales, and people going there in the normal course of their business are quite entitled to do so, but there are many other things that are public also and from which people can be excluded if they are going there for an illegal or unlawful purpose.  The Gárda were quite entitled&mdash;and if they were not so entitled, those people who were kept out have their legal remedy &mdash; where people assembled not for the ordinary purposes for which that sale was being held, but for a purpose which the Gárda know to be the prevention of those sales, to exclude such people.  It cannot be justified that people can go there simply because it is a public sale, if the Gárda are satisfied that those people are going there for an illegal purpose.  As I said, if that matter needs to be tested, there is a way of testing it.  The item for ammunition in this Estimate has been very much criticised.</P>

We are paying for our land and our neighbours are paying for theirs,&rdquo; and have that sense of responsibility as citizens, but the people of this country have not always got that, and they do not turn up for a sale and show their civic spirit by bidding at sales.</P>

      <P>A good deal of criticism was directed against this item of ammunition.  I share the hope with Deputy Bennett that it will not have to be used in any way.  He anticipated that it was going to be used to shoot all the farmers in Munster.  It is an item that was taken over by the Commissioner for training purposes and it has not anything of the sinister nature behind it which Deputies are inclined to suggest it has.</P>
      <P>We have heard on this Estimate the same things which we have discussed here on adjournments and on the Estimate last year.  A matter that has been discussed and dealt with several times is the shooting at Marsh's yard and I would ask Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to read again the words he quoted here, because if he had read them before he read them here, he would not seek to apply them as stating what the law was.  Everybody is conversant with the facts of what took place in Marsh's Yard and there is no use in trying to suggest here that it was such an innocent expedition as the Deputies on the opposite benches seek to suggest it was.  There you had a position in which something like 3,000 people had assembled and in which it is quite apparent now that a certain number of people were hired or arranged for&mdash;at any rate, they were paid afterwards or an allowance made to them&mdash;to get into a lorry, to break through the cordons of the Gárda, to dash against the gates and break them down and enter the yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says one should not do anything until one is hit. I do not know where he found that or whether he ever considered making such a regulation when he had charge of the Gárda.  There is no such regulation <Col N="795" /> in the code of the Gárda.  They have to deal with a situation as it exists.  They have to deal with many a situation very suddenly and they have to use their own judgment as best they can in dealing with it.  I have never seen any desire on the part of any member of the Gárda or any officer of the Gárda to use more force than he considers necessary.  To an extent, and perhaps to a very great extent, one has to sympathise with the people who were the dupes in the lorry of the people who organised this affair outside and who were not made amenable for it, but that is the only sympathy I have in the matter.  I have sympathy for the people who were made the dupes of the others who organised this business of smashing down the yard and rescuing the cattle from it.</P>
    <P>We have had references here to the partisan way in which the Gárda are carrying out their duties.  The necessity for this Estimate arises from no partisan spirit; it arises from the activities of the Party opposite, or of the wings of their Party in their actions through the country.  In the early stages, it might have been a little humorous to see middle-aged people dressing up and playing at soldiers, but, while it might have been humorous, it was quite serious enough from the Gárda point of view, in that wherever they held their meetings there was always danger, and there was some interference with those meetings. There were somewhere between 300 and 400 meetings of the Blueshirt organisation held last year, and at every one of those meetings Gárda had to be brought in to deal with any disorder that might arise.  I think that it is no wonder we have come to an additional Estimate when the actions of the Blueshirt organisation itself were responsible for practically bankrupting the Blueshirt organisation. They had taken up, as they say themselves, a policy of bringing people 20 or 30 miles in order to try and make the meetings look big. When those people were going to and returning from the meetings they had to be afforded protection as best the Guards could provide it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That meant bringing in Guards from all over the place.  I have here a quotation from the Party organ.  I think it is dated 24th November, 1934.  Amongst other things it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the things that left the Fine Gael Organisation and the Blueshirt Organisation in financial difficulties was the series of big meetings held last year.  The policy of holding meetings of the type of which General O'Duffy spoke so often was a mistaken one.  The crowds were made big or biggish, by bringing Blueshirts long distances. Not infrequently a substantial section of those in attendance at one of those meetings came from distances of ten, 20, or 30 miles.  The consequence was that a great deal of money was expended both by local committees and the Central Organisation, on transport, and, as it turned out, to no good purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it was to no good purpose or not, whether or not it was a mistaken one, as those people now admit, at any rate it had the effect of costing the State a good deal of money by having to provide protection as far as it could possibly be done.  There was this development at a later period, that you had a campaign of intimidation at sales throughout the country. At one of those sales in particular over 360 Guards had to be taken into the place to afford the necessary protection. At every sale there was intimidation, and protection had to be afforded.  All that meant a very big increase in transport, and a very big strain on the Guards.  Consequently you have this Vote to provide for all those things which could not possibly be anticipated at the time the Estimate was introduced.  Over and above the normal number of hours, extra duty was imposed on the Guards in seven divisions to the extent of 144,009 hours.  If there had to be a Supplementary Estimate then the people opposite should not complain.  It was due to their own tactics and their own policy, and the delay that was made <Col N="797" /> of over two or three months before anyone here, so far as the Irish papers published it, disassociated their Party from the acts that were going on in the country.  There was cutting of wires, obstructing of trains, interference with railway lines, and so on, and not until the 28th October had we a very tepid disassociation of the Party from it.  We hear a lot said now about the way people are allowed to have arms.  I suppose it is an Opposition's tactics to make the most of any incident that occurs, but that was not the decision of the leader, whom I think Deputy Dillon at one time described here as one of the greatest Irishmen of this generation, because when there was a shooting in Leitrim it was referred to at that time as merely a boyish prank.  That was, I suppose, because it happened among Blueshirts.  If it happened at the other side it would, I imagine, be a very serious and dastardly thing in the words of the Opposition.  A number of crimes have been quoted here. A number of questions have been put down, and answers obtained to them. Deputy Mulcahy gives a very long string of charges where nobody has been made amenable.  One would imagine that at the time he was associated with the administration of this country nobody who committed a crime ever escaped.  Does he not know perfectly well that those are not the facts?  All one has to do is to look at the statement which was made by Deputy Cosgrave at the time that he introduced the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.  If ever a Government has shown its bankruptcy, so far as being able to bring people to justice for crimes is concerned, it was certainly that Government.  There is a long recital here.  I will just read it, as reported in volume 40 of the Official Debates, 14th October, 1931:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 30th January, Patrick Carroll was murdered by armed men at Captain's Lane, Crumlin.  He was a member of the I.R.A., but was discovered by that organisation to have been giving information to the police.  Deputies will remember that an attempt was made to attribute <Col N="798" /> this murder to the police, who were in fact attacked during his funeral. On the 21st March, Superintendent Curtin was murdered by armed men at Tipperary as he was returning home from duty at night.  He had conducted a local prosecution for illegal drilling shortly before.  On the 20th July, John Ryan, of Tipperary, was taken by armed men at night from the house where he was employed and murdered on the roadside and the body left there.  He had made statements to the police in connection with the same drilling charge as led to the murder of Superintendent Curtin.  John Ryan was murdered because he refused to commit perjury.  For these crimes it has been impossible to make any person amenable.  On the 23rd April, at night, two young men crossing the Dublin mountains were fired upon by an armed drilling party, and one of them was severely wounded.  On the 1st August, shots were fired into a dance hall at Drumreilly, Co. Leitrim.  On the 12th September, Mr. William McInerney, of Kilrush, was fired at when entering his own house and seriously wounded.  On the 15th September, shots were fired into the house of the State Solicitor for County Clare.  On the 18th July, warders from Mountjoy Prison were attacked, whilst off duty, by armed men, and one of them was handcuffed to an iron rail and chained by the neck and legs.  On the 11th October an attempt was made by armed men to release the brothers Gilmore from Mountjoy Prison. Five or six armed men entered a house adjoining the prison and held up the occupants.  On the 14th April, in order to embarrass a political function, the electric cable at Tipperary was maliciously damaged, so as to dislocate the lighting arrangements.  On the 15th April, Dublin shopkeepers were visited and ordered not to sell imported sweets. On the 11th May the lighting arrangements at Tralee were interfered with for the same motive as in the case of Tipperary on the 14th April.  On the 21st May an armed <Col N="799" /> assault and an attempt at arson was made at the North Wall to prevent the importation of English made sweets.  On the 12th July, the railways, buses, and telegraph lines in Kerry were interfered with in order to prevent attendance at the Gárda sports at Tralee.  On the 9th August, the railway line at Dore (West Tirconaill) was blocked with boulders; the railway telephone wires were cut at Puck (East Tirconaill) and the main road from Stranorlar to Letterkenny was blocked with stones.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The speech goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The police were fired on when they interfered.  Special trains had been arranged to attend the Gárda sports at Letterkenny.  At Clonkeen (Portlaoighise) 40 telephone and telegraph wires were cut, delaying a Dublin special to the Gárda sports at Clonmel.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;On the 12th August a public meeting at Cootehill, Co. Cavan (Orange meeting), was prevented by the I.R.A.  The railway line was <Col N="800" /> torn up....  On the 24th August a party of boy scouts camping at Dunleer were visited at night by about 20 armed men and their hut burned down.  On the 12th January, 1931, a threatening poster was sent to Dublin residents with a view to influencing them as jurors.  On the 6th of February, 1931, several men were found openly drilling at Tipperary,&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Did anybody in the Administration prevent the Guards then doing their duty?  Why is it suggested now because certain crimes go unpunished that the Guards are not doing their duty?  We have here in this country, unfortunately, one fact and that&mdash;whether we like it or not&mdash; is when people misname certain crimes as political crimes it is very hard to get a conviction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>It has taken the Minister a very long time to learn that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always realised it.  Deputy Mulcahy came forward to-day, as he has come forward day by day, and spoke of certain incidents in the country and he reflected on the Government in connection with these incidents.  During the agrarian troubles Lord Ashtown published a periodical called <i>Outrages from Ireland.</i> At that time that publication used to be taken advantage of by certain people.  They were called dirty birds for fouling their own nests.  I suggest that in preparing long litanies like this to show certain things in the light they were shown, the Deputy is doing his best to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  That is what he is doing when he is preparing a category like that.  The Guards have a difficult task.  They have a difficult time and they are trying to act as fairly and as impartially as possible. They are trying to do their duty faithfully and well.  There is no use in any Deputy on the opposite benches trying to suggest that there has been any interference with the Guards in the carrying out of their duties.  If the Deputy has all the information which <Col N="802" /> he alleges he has and which he is so reluctant to give to the House, he might also have the information that there has been no interference with the Guards in the carrying out of their duties.  A certain policy has been pursued by the Government in trying to administer the law with the least hardship.  That policy has been tried wisely or unwisely. It has been given its chance.  I do suggest that the record of crime in this country since that policy was pursued stands out in fine relief against the position that existed when the Deputies opposite tried to pursue a very different policy in this country.  When people get up and talk about unfair or partial administration of justice they ought at least put their own house in order first before they go out and make charges like they have made.  That campaign against the payment of annuities has not ceased yet.  We have got to go and collect these annuities and we are collecting them.  While the campaign in its worst form perhaps has broken down and the duties may not in the future be so severe on the Guards as they have been in the last six months, much more could have been done if those who have the responsible position of representatives would put it to those people that they have to meet their obligations to the State.  No effort will be spared by the Gárda to bring to justice anybody who commits crime.  Everybody on the opposite benches knows that there is no ground for the suggestion that there has been any attempt by the Guards or anybody else to cloak crime or criminals.  I think I have answered every point raised by the Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I ask the Minister two direct questions: (1) If, as happened in the neighbourhood of Charlestown, County Mayo, a man is held up by men with revolvers, and he informs the police, and his house is paraded outside every day by I.R.A. between the date on which he lodged the information and the sitting of the court of summary jurisdiction before which the person charged is to be brought up, does the Minister expect that man to come in and testify that he was held up by men armed with revolvers, or does he expect that man to swear that he was held up, to the best of his belief and knowledge, by men with a broomstick?  I am simply drawing the inevitable inference to the question I asked him.  Does the Minister imagine that justice can be administered in the country if persons who co-operate with the Guards are allowed to be publicly intimidated? (2) If a public representative hears of certain charges such as that in the village of Keadue, where everybody in the district is to a certain extent intimidated &mdash; if such public representative hears that a land mine was exploded at the gable end of an individual's house by the I.R.A., and that one of the persons engaged in the operation of exploding that land mine was a uniformed member of the Gárda Síochána, whose name is commonly <Col N="804" /> canvassed through the district, is the public representative to assume that what is common gossip all through the district has never reached the ears of any public representative but himself, or is he entitled to assume that the information that has been given to him is common gossip in the neighbourhood and must be well known to the Gárda authorities, and no steps are being taken to bring the individual concerned to justice or to make an end of the common talk that is circulated in the district?  These are two concrete questions. They both represent facts as they obtain in districts with which I am familiar.  Perhaps the Minister would let us have his opinion on those sets of circumstances, and indicate what a public representative is expected to do.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for the Salaries, Allowances and Expenses of Circuit Court Officers, Deputy Circuit Judges and certain Local Registering Authorities; and the Expenses of Revision of Voters' and Jurors' Lists (No. 27 of 1926, etc.).</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Estimate arises almost entirely from the fact that the expenses incurred by the county registrars for that portion of their duties that relates to the enforcement of court judgments have been much larger than was anticipated.  So far as moneys voted by this House are concerned the additional sum is merely a formal or book-keeping transaction, because when the amounts of the decrees are recovered they include the costs incurred at the outset, namely, the lodgment fees, etc.  Apart from the abnormal volume of land annuities work, the State had to take over during the present financial year the work of the under-sheriff for County Kerry who died during the year.  This involves a considerable increase in gross expenditure as the State now pays the clerk and bailiffs, who were formerly the private employees of the under-sheriff. A large proportion of the gross increase in the State expenditure is due to the employment of 15 additional whole-time court messengers whose additional wages amount to between £50 and £60 per week.  Concurrently with that there is an increase in the travelling and incidental expenses.  In various parts of the country additional part-time court messengers have been employed, as and when required, and their pay and expenses add to the total.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has explained, the principal purpose of the Vote, especially as regards one particular county, is to enable duties that were hitherto performed by the sheriff to be performed by the registrar under the recent Land Act. One of the points that possibly might be adverted to in that connection is that a great deal of additional work has actually been thrown on the registrars over the country.  They have been asked, in connection with Section 28, I think it is, of the Land Act of 1933, to take on a great deal of additional work and, as far as I know, they have got no remuneration for that.  Some of that additional work is exceedingly unpleasant.  But there is another aspect of the case.  The House is asked to vote money&mdash;it does not matter whether the sum is £3,000 or £4,000 or £10&mdash;for the purpose of collecting the land annuities in this particular way.  This side of the House has always objected to that particular method of collecting land annuities.  We objected to it when the Bill was going through the House, and we object to that particular method still.  We think that in the actual circumstances now existing in this country the House should not pass any Vote to facilitate the Ministry in collecting those land annuities, considering the condition of the farmers who have to meet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to the people as to whom the Minister's colleague in the debate last week <Col N="809" /> pointed out that their farms could raise nothing but small cattle and that these cattle were practically uneconomic.  They can raise nothing else except cattle and milk.  Hence he has to pay a price of 22/- per cwt. for these cattle and then sell them afterwards at the rate of 12/-.  It is to these people that I refer.  I can well understand that the Minister has not these people in mind.  His thoughts do not run along the particular hardships they are suffering.  As I pointed out, one of the particular counties referred to is the county that the Minister's colleague has admitted has been reduced, or a certain portion of it has been reduced, to beggary by the policy of the Government.  Consequently, we object to this particular Vote as, in the circumstances, a Vote to which the House should not consent. I gather from the interruption of the Minister for Finance that Ministers take up the attitude that the farmers are able to pay.</P>

      <P>When the House rose on Thursday last we were discussing one of a series of ill-considered and hastily drafted motions, which Deputies opposite had put down on the Order Paper for the purpose of occupying the time of this House and giving them an opportunity of making speeches.  This particular motion is somewhat different to the others, but there was no difference between the speeches that were made in support of it and the speeches made in support of any other motion moved by the Party opposite during the past 12 or 18 months.</P>

      <P>Let us hear the motion. I want to remind Deputies of the motion which they have moved.  It is a curious motion:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that, owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-35.</P>
      <P>I say that is a curious motion.  By that I do not mean that it is a surprising motion, but that it is one which arouses curiosity.  The wording of it was obviously carefully framed to avoid giving any indication of the policy of the Party opposite upon the general question of derating agricultural land.  Have they a policy?  The particular proposal which they have embodied in these words, to relieve agricultural land for one year only, is of course very contrary to the policy they advocated when they set up a Derating Commission, and on the report of that Derating Commission, here in this House and throughout the country, criticised as uneconomic and unwise the whole policy of derating agricultural land.  Now they are prepared to do it for one year.  I wonder why this proposal was put forward in this particular way?  Is it because there has been another change of policy over there, that the news is being broken gently to their supporters, that they are only asking them to swallow the pill for a limited period as a preliminary to an announcement of the full conversion of Deputy Cosgrave and his Party to the policy to which they were opposed in 1931?  Or is it that individual Deputies opposite have a definite point of view in this matter, and that these definite views of individual Deputies could not be reconciled, and that this motion was introduced in this form to conceal the diversity of opinion amongst Deputies opposite?</P>

      <P>I want Deputies to remember that this is their motion.  They initiated the discussion.  They asked the Dáil to come to a decision on a question of policy, but not a single Deputy opposite has given us a reason for doing so.  We had a number of speeches made by these Deputies, but not a single one of them was related to the particular motion on the Order Paper.  We want them to tell us why this particular method should be resorted to in preference to some other method.  Do Deputies opposite believe in derating agricultural land or do they not?  We are entitled to get an answer to that question before the debate concludes.  They have brought in this carefully qualified motion.  They want the Dáil to commit itself to this very limited principle, but they have not given us any indication of their own outlook on the matter.  Either they believe in the policy of derating agricultural land or they do not.  They have asked us to agree to remove the rate charge from agricultural land for this coming year because of the agricultural depression, but remember in 1931 the arguments they used against the policy of derating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider in relation to the particular form of the motion, the considered opinion of the Derating Commission established by the late Government in 1931, on which they based their policy in that year:</P>
      <P>The relief of rates on agricultural land should be considered on its merits and the decision should not be determined or influenced by present conditions of agriculture.</P>
      <P>For the foregoing reasons we are satisfied that the question of relieving agricultural lands and buildings of rates should be decided on its merits and apart altogether from the question of depression.</P>
      <P>That was the policy in 1931 but they changed their opinions with the change in the side of the House on which they sat&mdash;and now, because of the depression in agriculture, they want agricultural land derated for this year.  Why is Deputy Cosgrave limiting the motion to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell you in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the minister did not change his opinions when he changed his seat in the House, and that he will vote for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have changed my opinion about a number of things and I shall tell you about some of them in a minute.  I said I was curious about this motion.  I am curious to know what is actually intended by it.  I am curious to know what it represents in relation to the Party opposite.  Remember the Party opposite is very secretive about its policy.  It takes very great pains on all occasions, in this House, outside this House, in its official organ&mdash;I presume &ldquo;United Ireland&rdquo; is still the official organ of the Party&mdash;and all its publications, to conceal its policy from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now got an opportunity of learning their policy upon one matter &mdash;a matter upon which we thought we knew their policy a short time ago, because they were among the most vigorous opponents of any proposal to derate agricultural land, on various grounds.  They now want it done as a <Col N="814" /> temporary measure.  What does Deputy Cosgrave mean by a temporary measure for the year 1934-35?  Does he consider that the motion, not having been passed within the financial year, can now be discarded and that we can come on now to the next motion&mdash;on which we can have a perfectly similar discussion in any event&mdash;or does he mean that the time limit to the motion was too short and that its terms should now be extended to cover the ensuing financial year?  Does Deputy Cosgrave think it possible to derate agricultural land temporarily?  I am quite sure that he does not.  I am quite sure that no Deputy opposite believes that if land could be completely relieved of that charge for a period it would ever be possible to impose that charge again. Of course it would not.  It is not possible to have a temporary derating of agricultural land, and Deputies opposite know it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am led to the conclusion that this motion was not introduced for the purpose of indicating the opinion of Deputies opposite as to the best method of relieving agriculture in the year mentioned but as an indication that their policy is being gradually brought over to the point when they will be able to emerge before the people as full-blooded supporters of the policy of agricultural derating.  As I said here on Thursday night, if the Party opposite are adopting that policy now, it is not because of the depression in agriculture but because of the depression in Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil was never depressed.  The policy of derating agricultural land was turned down, not mainly upon economic considerations but upon administrative considerations. Deputy Cosgrave was inclined to contest that argument here on Thursday last, but I want to read for Deputies some of the main reasons advanced by the Derating Commission against that policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;reasons which were reiterated by Deputies opposite when they were sitting on these benches&mdash; reasons, the fallacies of which, if there are fallacies in them, are only coming out now for the first time.  The following are some of the main reasons advanced by the Derating Commission:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The remission of agricultural and industrial rates would have far-reaching effects on the structure of local government in the counties and would involve the virtual termination of local responsibility for, and control of, local services.  Any reconstruction of the system of local government should take precedence of, and not be undertaken merely as a necessary consequence of, the granting of relief from rates on agricultural and industrial hereditaments. The transfer to the central authority of services administered by local authorities for the purpose of securing a remission of rates on productive hereditaments cannot be recommended.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Deputy and I can agree to differ on that.  There is another consideration.  Most of the Deputies who spoke on this motion, as I said, did not refer to it at all.  Not one of them offered a reason why it was better to relieve agriculture in times of depression by removing the rate charge instead of assisting it by some other method.  There is depression in agriculture, not merely in this country, as has often been pointed out, but in every country.  Because of that depression in agriculture <Col N="816" /> it is necessary for the State, out of its general resources, to provide assistance and relief for those engaged in agriculture.  That is being done.  It is being done to the full limit that this State can afford to do it.  Some part of that very large sum, that is provided annually for the assistance of farmers, goes undoubtedly for the relief of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional Agricultural Grant, for instance.  Other parts of that sum are given in the form of bounties upon exports.  Some parts of that sum are given in order to maintain guaranteed prices for wheat and other agricultural products in the home market.  Some part of it goes for the purpose of relieving the cattle situation by financing the free beef scheme.  The whole sum is divided up into subsidiary amounts, all of which are used in some particular manner or another to provide relief for agriculture.  I gather, however, that the considered policy, if they have a policy, of the Party opposite is that more of that sum should go to relieve the rate charge and less of that sum for the other purposes for which State financial assistance is now being given.</P>

      <P>I take it that this is what we are asked to agree to&mdash;I may be misrepresenting Deputies opposite <Col N="818" /> and I would hate to do that&mdash;that a larger proportion of the total sum which the State can afford for the relief of agriculture should be given in the form of relief in rates rather than in some other method.  I am quite certain that is what Deputies opposite have in mind because it conforms to Cumann na nGaedheal policy since the inception of Cumann na nGaedheal. They always said: &ldquo;Wait for something to turn up.  If there is depression in agriculture, let us give them something in the nature of relief in rates, and hope for the best.&rdquo;  It was a hope that at some future date some change would happen, how or why they did not know, but which would avoid the necessity for further relief.  Is that a sound policy?  Is it wise to ask the Dáil to commit itself to the giving of relief to agriculture in that way, rather than by setting ourselves down seriously to plan an agricultural policy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is your motion.  That is the real Cumann na nGaedheal Micawber-like outlook, expressed in words&mdash;carry on and hope for the best, that God is good, and that the British are not too bad.  The main difference between Fianna Fáil policy and Cumann na nGaedheal policy in relation to agriculture is what I have said.  Cumann na nGaedheal policy, if it is worthy of the name, is to afford some measure of relief in hard times and hope to goodness that something better will turn up in the future.  The Fianna Fáil policy recognises the facts of the situation, and the circumstances which are operating in the home <Col N="819" /> market, in the British market, and in every market in the world; the necessity for effecting a change in the basis on which agriculture here was conducted in the past, and to use our financial resources in order to induce that change as rapidly as possible and with the least possible hardship on individuals. Cumann na nGaedheal policy contemplates complete dependency on the possibility in the future of continuing to sell cattle to Great Britain at a profit.  Their whole outlook is warped by the idea that there is some course of action open to the people or the Government of this country which is going to make it possible for Irish farmers to sell still more cattle to Great Britain at a profit.  They refuse to recognise the hardest possible facts, no matter how often they are brought to their attention.  On Thursday last when Deputies Fagan and Holohan talked raimeis of that kind, I reminded them of the British Government's White Paper on agricultural conditions in Great Britain which had been circulated that morning.  It was obvious that they had not read the Paper, or, if they did read it, they did not understand its significance.  The market for cattle in Great Britain is one about which Deputies opposite should try to find out something.</P>

Why did the British Government think it necessary to subsidise the price of cattle in Great Britain if that market was so profitable that we should abandon everything in order to get the opportunity to sell our surplus cattle there.  Why did the British Minister of Agriculture say in the British House of Commons on Friday last that, but for the assistance given under the British Agricultural Industry (Emergency Provisions) Act, the cattle producers there would be faced with disaster?

      <P>We must assume that the Minister there knows more about the condition of the cattle market in Great Britain than we do, and knows more about the intentions of the British Government in relation to that market than we do.  The fact is that at present, according to the British Minister of Agriculture, the prices prevailing in that market are such that, if the Government had not subsidised them, cattle producers there would have to face disaster.  These were the words used by the Minister.  Are conditions there going to improve for us in the future?  Do Deputies opposite know what the policy of the British Government is in relation to their home market for agricultural produce?  Are the farmers of this country to be advised to continue producing for that market the limited range of products they formerly exported to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is 1934-35.  Mr. Elliott, the British Minister of Agriculture, stated in the House of Commons last week:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government held firmly to the policy set out in the White Paper and they had no intention of permitting the extinction of the livestock industry in Great Britain.  The Bill would give time while discussions were proceeding.  Their primary duty was to the home producer.  It was the home producer's position which was in jeopardy and it was his position which this long series of negotiations was designed to secure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the British Government in relation to the British market for cattle was made clear in that statement. The market is going to be reserved for British producers, to whatever extent the British Government can secure it.  It is because of that they sent out their ultimatum, not to this country, with which the so-called economic war is in progress, but to New Zealand, Canada, Australia and South Africa, to ask them to choose between a tax on meat sent to Great Britain or drastic quantitative restrictions. Deputies, are, no doubt, capable of keeping themselves informed how it is proceeding.  They saw the reply of the New Zealand Government, which was published yesterday, which was practically an intimation by that Government that if the British choose to adopt that course against their export trade they would retaliate against the British exports to New Zealand.  The British Government is prepared to face that because of the critical position of their own agriculturists in the British market.  Yet Deputies profess to regard it as a serious policy that we should cast everything else aside and stake all our chances upon our ability to secure in that market conditions that the British farmer cannot secure, and that no other Dominion farmer has been able to obtain.  It is nonsense, and Deputies opposite know it is nonsense.  I ask them, if they regard themselves as a serious political Party, to sit down on some occasion and seriously examine the facts in relation to the whole of our agricultural position, and, on the basis <Col N="823" /> of these facts and not on Deputy Belton's fancies, to try and frame a policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an alternative policy expressed in this motion &mdash; the policy of handing out relief in the form of a reduction in rates without any clear idea as to what is going to follow from it.  We want to give help to the farmers in their depressed condition. We do not deny that they are depressed. We do not deny that agricultural prices are unduly low, and that for many of his products the farmer is not getting back the cost of production; but for a number of these products to-day's price is higher than the average price of 1931, the last year during which the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office.  But, nevertheless, the price is too low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But not for cattle.  The same position applies everywhere.  It is not necessary to reiterate the fact, because Deputies must be aware of it. They know that the world price for every agricultural product is unduly depressed, because all countries are subsidising their exports; and as each country finds that its sales abroad are falling off it increases the subsidy, leading to a further increase in the subsidies elsewhere.  In fact, we are getting into the position in which it would appear to be the ambition of every country to give its agricultural surplus away for nothing to foreigners.  As a gentleman in Cambridge last week pointed out, we were the only country that had adopted the logical course of <Col N="824" /> giving part of that surplus to our own people for nothing.  The fact is that when you subtract from the price paid for some agricultural goods sent from Australia and New Zealand to the British market the cost of shipping them, the cost of insuring, the cost of distributing them in Great Britain and the profits of the distributors, there can be practically nothing going back to the primary producer.</P>
      <P>That is the depression in agriculture which has hit us as well as everybody else.  It is to deal with that depression that a policy must be formulated, a policy, however, much better than that enshrined in the motion which even the Deputies who have moved it know could achieve nothing.  Of what immediate benefit is it to a farmer to get relief of his rates?  On the typical farm the rates only represent 3½ per cent. of the total expenses of the farm.  On the average farm&mdash; taking large and small together and bearing in mind that any calculations based on the figures available for the average farm are necessarily misleading&mdash;the rate-charge is only 5 per cent. of the total farm expenses.  Is it going to help the farmers to meet the depression and to carry out the reorganisation of their industry, which is necessary, merely by relieving them of that small proportion of their total expenses?  Not at all.  If we are going to do the job properly we will have to do it on entirely different lines to that.  First of all, it is obvious that we must endeavour to limit the exportable surplus of every agricultural product to the extent of the probable export markets available for it.  That is sound commonsense.  It is obvious that we can get a much better return for our exportable surplus if we limit it to the size of the markets available for it than if we try to cram into already overcrowded markets much more than these markets are capable of absorbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our little surplus is only a drop in the ocean.  It does not affect prices in the export market at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But at the present time we are limited by quotas in every <Col N="825" /> market.  That is a fact which the Deputy is ignoring.  The total quantity of any agricultural product which we can sell in any market is fixed not by us but by the Government of the country concerned, and we must endeavour to limit our exportable surplus to the sum total of our quotas in all countries.  It is only upon that basis that we can secure, not more profitable prices in these markets because that is outside our control, but a better return in the home market for the Irish producers of these goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But if we are limited by quotas we cannot send the goods out even if we were to send them for nothing.  A quota is a quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is why I gave the Deputy that as the first consideration, namely, the limitation of the exportable surplus to the extent for which export markets are available, and, secondly, of marketing our goods under conditions which will secure for us the best possible return for them. That has not been done in the past. Deputies opposite are aware that the price of Irish butter on the British market has been kept unduly low by the chaotic marketing conditions that prevailed here: that as soon as one of the Irish creameries succeeded in getting a customer for its butter at a particular price, another Irish creamery came along and quoted a few points lower in order to get a sale for its product.  Therefore, it is necessary in the new world circumstances in which we are now limited by quotas so to organise our marketing arrangements that that type of competition between ourselves, to the disadvantage of other Irish producers, is eliminated. In the interval, while we are carrying out the reorganisation that is necessary, while we are effecting a reduction in the exportable surplus to the limits of that probable market, and while we are perfecting our marketing plans, we must maintain, to whatever extent our financial abilities will permit, the export bounties now being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must endeavour to produce for home consumption the agricultural <Col N="826" /> goods which hitherto we imported.  In the past we imported agricultural goods to the value of several million pounds annually and, therefore, obviously, in the present circumstances, we must try to produce these goods for ourselves.  We are doing it in great measure at the present time as regards wheat, beet, animal feeding stuffs, bacon and other products of that kind.  We imported these in the past. We have now got to produce them at home.  The market available at home for these goods is of very considerable value indeed amounting, in the aggregate, to £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 per year.  We must secure in the home market for the Irish producer a price that is going to yield him his cost of production, and a little more.  It is only in the home market that we can do that, and we can only undertake to do it when it is possible to so organise production as to ensure that the home market is going to be adequately supplied from Irish farms.  As a necessary corollary to that, we must obviously reserve the home market for the Irish producer of agricultural goods, and over and behind all that we must seek, by the development of our industrial and mineral resources, to provide alternative opportunities of employment for those who have not been in the past, and may not be in the future, absorbed in employment on the land.</P>
    <P>If that agricultural policy appeals to Deputies opposite&mdash;and it seems to me, in relation to the facts of the situation, that no other agricultural policy is possible&mdash;we must obviously utilise the financial resources which we have in our hands and can make available for the assistance of the farmers to give immediate effect to that policy rather than to finance the Micawber-like attitude the Party opposite would have us adopt.  Nothing is to be gained by merely handing out relief to agriculture in the form of reduction of rates unless, associated with that relief, there is a plan which is going to put the agricultural industry beyond the necessity for that assistance at some time in the future.  Deputies opposite are continually talking about the economic war.  I, for one, should like <Col N="827" /> to see the end of the economic war, if for no other reason than that it would make Deputies on the opposite benches face up to the situation and come to a realisation of the fact that the essential difficulties of agriculturists are not due, in any way, to the economic war.  The economic war has temporarily depressed the price of cattle.  It has depressed the price of cattle below the price we might have obtained&mdash;a price which in itself would have been uneconomic.  Even at the price at which our cattle could be sold in the British market if there were no special duties levied on them, it would not pay us to increase, or even to maintain, our present surplus of cattle. It is not paying the British farmer to produce cattle.  Why should it pay us? If the economic war were ended, in the sense that all these special duties were removed, we should still have to face the prospect of reorganising agricultural production on the lines I have stated.  If that be so, surely it is a wise policy for us to use the finances made available from the Exchequer to facilitate the change-over by giving assistance to agriculture in the form of guaranteed prices for wheat and other agricultural products, as well as by maintaining export bounties and contributing to the extent that is reasonable to the payment of the farmers' rates to the local authority.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies opposite in all seriousness to withdraw this motion now, to take it back to their councils and there reconsider their policy and the particular ideas which gave rise to this motion.  When they next come here with a motion relating to agriculture, let them come with one which will set out seriatim the particular steps that, in their opinion, should be taken to deal with the agricultural position and the particular legislative or financial measures that would have to be adopted to make these steps possible.  At the present time, they are merely talking generally and uselessly about the position of the farmers.  We all know the position of the farmers.  Deputies on this side of the House are as clearly familiar with <Col N="828" /> their position as are Deputies opposite. The only difference is that we are definitely trying to place the Irish farmers in a position in which they will be immune from the vicissitudes of international trade&mdash;in a position in which they will not be dependent for prosperity upon the chances and changes in a market over which we have no control.  We hope that we shall put their industry upon a basis that will secure for them the reasonable prospect of a livelihood based upon the production for home use of the agricultural goods we ourselves need and the production for export of only those goods for which an export market can be found in not more than the quantities required.  That is a clear policy.  It has, at least, the merit that there are no ambiguities about it.  If Deputies opposite do not agree with that policy, I ask them to give us their policy with the same clarity and lack of ambiguity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to two speeches from Ministers on this motion.  We were taxed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with not having read the motion.  He himself read it&mdash;it was, I suppose, a slip&mdash;as referring to next year.  That is not so.  It is intended for the current year.  I do not know whether the statement is true or not but it has been mentioned in the Press that one Minister has had to read a section of an Act of Parliament eight times to understand it.  It comes badly from the Ministry which is afflicted with that type of mind to tax us with not having read this motion.  We have just been treated to a dissertation on the Derating Report&mdash;a very able report.  That is a very interesting document.  There is only one thing wrong in introducing it on this motion.  That is, that it is dated 22nd April, 1931.  This is the year 1935. Much has happened in the interval and a very different state of affairs exists now amongst the farming community from the state of affairs that existed in 1931.  It might interest the House to know that although that was a very important Commission&mdash;a judge sat upon it&mdash;it was brought into <Col N="829" /> existence under a warrant of appointment from the Ministry of Finance. This, of course, is a much more stylish &mdash;I should not like to say snobbish&mdash; Government than the Government then in office.  When this Government brought forth a Commission to inquire into the pig industry, it was appointed under the hand and seal of Donal O'Buachalla, His Majesty's representative in this country.  I am quite sure that the Minister who has just spoken has not read that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been treated to many figures in connection with the price of cattle to show the dangerous position that live stock rearing has reached in Great Britain.  We are told, in effect, that live stock rearing is not an economic proposition over there.  The Minister has failed to realise that, in England, they are determined to put that industry on a sound basis.  He has probably not seen the Act passed last year which provided for bounties upon cattle of British origin.  Under one section of that Act, Irish cattle which had been three months in Great Britain were given the status and rights of cattle of British origin and became entitled to the bounty of 50/-, just as British cattle.  The back benchers of the Government Party who have addressed themselves to this motion are all, I presume, agriculturists, just as the two Ministers who have spoken with all the knowledge derived from a life-long experience and a realisation of the ups and downs, the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.  Some of those who have spoken told us during the past couple of years that there was no use in turning our attention to the British market.  They told us that, in the first place, Britain could not pay for our cattle, and, in the second place, that the people of Britain could not consume them.  The understanding or agreement which was arrived at during the last month or two marks down the statement that they cannot consume our cattle as so much bunkum.  They are going to take 150,000 more.  These people who, we were told, were not in a position to consume our cattle are able simply to get a good bargain for selling their <Col N="830" /> coal to take 150,000 head of our cattle. And they made a good bargain, notwithstanding the fact that some members of that Party over there said that they had brought the British to their knees?  What are they getting?  They are getting first class cattle&mdash;no better produced in the whole world&mdash;at rock bottom prices, and £6 on the horns of each beast, and a few pounds less on the horns of the less finished lots. Altogether we are presenting them with half a million of money along with 150,000 cattle and we are taking from them the coal that it was unpatriotic to buy some months ago. When the Party opposite had their coat turned one way it was unpatriotic to buy British coal; when they had it turned another way it was patriotic to buy it.  &ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;circulate the money among the cattle producers in Mayo.&rdquo;  And that is the modern patriotism!  Whatever way they turn their coat the label is the same.</P>
    <P>What Ministers have forgotten in connection with this whole business is that they disturbed an industry that was in a fairly frugal position.  I put it no higher than that.  For the first ten years of this State, although £4,000,000 per year was collected in annuities from the farmers, they were no more than £20,000 behind in their payments.  What is the position since this popular Ministry came into office? Although they halved the annuities they are £1,100,000 short on this year's collection.  And to-night we have had an Estimate for £45,000 for increased locomotion expenses of the Gárda, for more uniforms and possibly to buy more machine guns so as to impress this country that the forces of might are behind this patriotically-inclined Ministry.  Everyone who is acquainted with the position and knows it, as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health does, knows that the position has got far worse in the last three years.  The percentage of the collection of rates has gone against the collectors to the extent of 12 or 15 per cent. in the last two years.  Knowing that position of affairs they have sent out word to the county councils that they are deducting <Col N="831" /> large sums from their grants.  In the case of Cork County Council they have indicated that they are deducting £118,000, yet they ask us have we no better policy than what they call this footling resolution to put forward.</P>
    <P>Let us examine their policy.  In December, 1932, I met a farmer from Limerick who had 150 head of cattle which he could not sell in Limerick. He was offered £1 per cwt. for them there and refused.  He went over to England, paid the tariff, got the bounty and realised 29/6 per cwt.  Is it possible for every farmer in Ireland to bring his cattle across and get the last penny for them?  Of course not. The whole farming strategy of the Government would have to be gone through.  The speech we have just listened to from the Minister is complete humbug from start to finish.  It was well phrased, eloquent and high-sounding but there was no plan, there was no suggestion as to how the farmers could get the money to which they are entitled for their produce.  It was just the speech of a townsman such as we heard from the Vice-President the other evening.  He told us that he had been speaking to a clergyman in Meath who lost money the first year but made money the following year.  What was his explanation of how he made money the second year?  That he bought the cattle more cheaply.  What about the man who got the small price?  What about the poor farmer in distant parts of the country who had to accept half the price he got in former years?  Then we had the other part of the policy of the Government in order to help the farmers.  What was that?  The slaughtering of calves and the production of the skins for 10/- to 12/6.  Did anyone hear of such nonsense outside of Bedlam?</P>
    <P>Mention was made about the bounty. I know a cattle feeder in North Dublin whose land borders on Meath.  He had cattle weighing 12 cwt. and a man with a licence came along and offered him 17/6 per cwt. and no more.  Ten guineas was the offer for animals that would attract the best show-yard <Col N="832" /> buyers.  No better animals could be seen in England or Scotland.  What did the man with the licence get for them?  He paid 30/- to send them across, and £6 the tariff per beast; that is they cost him £18.  He sold them at a price returned in the agricultural markets report of 40/6 per cwt., so that the licence holder got as his profit the difference between £18 &mdash;£10/10/0 to the producer and feeder, 30/- transport and £6 tariff&mdash; and £24 which he realised in the British market.  Then we are told the Government have a plan.  They have devised a scheme for the extension of tillage and so on.  They have a scheme for tobacco and wheat and beet growing in the country.  But there are 4,000,000 head of cattle in this country. Suppose there are some hard-headed farmers and business men who will change over from one kind of farming economy to another.  After working in that way for a period will there not be a loss ultimately?  I know men who made money in the last couple of years and honestly they were not supermen. I know a man who changed over.  First he put cattle on his land; now he has 80 acres of tillage.  He is going into his accounts very carefully to see in what manner he would lose the least money.  I asked him how his land would be in five or six years.  &ldquo;No good,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I know that but at present I am losing less money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two sides to agriculture. There is the man who will in no circumstances allow his land to go out of what is called &ldquo;good heart,&rdquo; and there is the man who is not going to lose money.  The thing that should concern the Minister for Agriculture is to have the land in the best possible condition, capable of producing good live stock. He talks about improving the production of cattle, but that was done before him.  No matter how that is done there will be a surplus which must go into the fat cattle market for beef, unless you produce sires for other parts of the world, whose progeny will come into competition with ours in the markets later.  I hope in any trade with Germany we will not have a repetition of the Galteemore and Ardpatrick affair, when they met us at Ballsbridge, beating <Col N="833" /> us in prices realised for their live stock there.  These fat cattle are the farmer's stock, and he must sell them. It is out of them he gets his money. In face of these things, is there anybody foolish enough to compare the set of circumstances which exist to-day and that which existed five years ago? Nobody outside Bedlam would do it.</P>
    <P>A letter appeared in the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, dated 9th March, in which the prices in 1931 and 1934 are compared. Calves, six months and over, first class, were £8, and second class, £4, in 1931; in 1934, calves six months and over, first class, were £2, and second class, £1.  That is the profitable industry that has developed from the administration of the last couple of years. One to two-year-olds were £11/10/0 to £14 in 1931, and in 1934, £5 to £6/10; two to three-year-olds, in 1931, £15 to £17, and in 1934, £6 to £8.  Is it any wonder that we are asked for £35,000 this evening to harass the agriculturists of this country for rates and annuities having regard to these prices?  The cattle trade is not the only trade in this country.  In the report of the commission set up by his Excellency the Governor-General, or under his hand and seal, the output of pigs in Saorstát Eireann for the years ending 31st May, 1930, 1931, 1932 and 1933 is given.  For the year 1929-30 the value is £8,989,000; for the following year, £7,727,000; and for 1932-33, £3,779,000&mdash; down £4,000,000 inside three years; and I presume the Minister has read that report.</P>

      <P>We were told by one of the two Ministers who addressed the House on this motion that £9,000,000 had been distributed amongst agriculturists from the Exchequer, and of that he discovered £1,800,000 represented the reduced annuities.  What never went into the Exchequer never came out of it.  That is a certainty.  The second point he made was that £1,100,000 came out for butter.  That money never went into the Exchequer, and it has nothing to do with the Exchequer.  He mentioned £200,000 as the sum that was going to come out for wheat.  It may.  £150,000 went out last year.  In future, people are going to pay it to the flour millers.</P>

      <P>We have reached a point where national taxation is up by £4,000,000 per annum since this Ministry came into office.  In addition to that, they got the annuities that were in the fund, plus the sums that had been levied or provided for in the Estimates &mdash; pensions, Local Loans Fund, and so on.  The whole sum&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;in the <Col N="836" /> Suspense Account was £4,677,000, of which £1,616,000 was voted.  They got a net sum of £3,000,000 apart from that taxation.  In addition to that, we have the butter levy, the sugar tax, the wheat tax which the people are liable to meet next year in the cost of flour, and we have the bacon levy, and local rates are higher than they were three or four years ago.</P>

      <P>It happens that I am, strangely enough, and it is much higher valued in County Dublin than it is in County Cork.  If the Deputy wishes to know, it is £2 5s. an acre, and that is stiff enough.  It is in this set of circumstances, with the combined pressure of taxation towards the Exchequer and towards the various bounties and levies, and other things of that sort, and with local taxation higher this year &mdash; and if the Deputy has any doubts about it, he will know it next year&mdash;that we have to consider this motion.  If the prices of agricultural produce were as good as they were four years ago, the impact of that taxation, the impact of those levies, and so on, would make a case for derating. Even if there had been no increase in taxation at all, and if there had been the drop there has been in the collection, it is obvious there would be a case for consideration even in that respect.  That was the view of the Ministers some three or four years ago. It is not necessary to emphasise the undertakings that were given by the Ministry when they were looking for office.  We all know about them.  We know all about their promises, undertakings, persuasions and plans, but it is advisable occasionally to see what some of them may have said in the more lucid moments when they were not in office.  In the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, of March 9th, Mr. D.P. O'Connor writes:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" />&ldquo;I will quote from a report of a conference of Co. Limerick farmers at the Town Hall, Limerick, on February 14th, 1931, convened by circular, signed James Colbert, T.D.; Tadhg Crowley, T.D., and Alderman Bourke, T.D. Mr. Derrig said: `They knew the difficulties under which the dairying industry was labouring.  He understood the arrears of rates in Co. Limerick amounted to £54,000. The totals of the rates in rural areas at present represented an increase of over 50 per cent. on the 1914 figures.'  Mr. Derrig added `that the principle of the relief of rates was long ago admitted, when following the abolition of the Corn Laws agriculture was forced into the depressed condition in which it had remained since.  The British Government recognised that the farming industry required such relief, and in fact even before complete derating was introduced in Great Britain the farmers were relieved of 75 per cent. of their rates.  Your demand for an increase in relief at present is simply a demand to extend a principle that has been already almost universally admitted.  The farmers stood on the reasonable ground that those who received the benefits should pay for them.  It was very questionable whether any person's rateable valuation was in fact a fair estimate of his ability to pay rates.  They could easily imagine the case of a farmer who was so heavily rated that he could not pay his rates or annuities and compare it with the case of a prosperous professional man with a small valuation.' &rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Relief of rates was given&mdash;up to nearly £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministry gave £250,000 the first year they came in, over and above what had been granted by their predecessors.  In the second year they reduced the Agricultural Grant £448,000, on the specious plea that that money was going to be spent in home assistance and so on, and it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In that year the annuities were halved&mdash;another £2,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this year they gave £20,000 over and above what they gave in their first year, or some figure like that.  If the Minister contradicts me, I will admit a larger figure.  The annuities, we are told, were halved. The facts are that the British Government is collecting on agricultural produce almost £4,500,000.  The Ministry endeavours to collect £2,000,000 here, so that for a debt of £4,000,000&mdash;to put it no higher&mdash;the farmers are asked to pay £6,000,000.  We are told that they are getting relief and bounties.  I have described two particular instances of one bounty.  I have not gone around looking for them, but there is no man in this country who is satisfied that there is anything else but a scandal in connection with the licences.  Very few farmers are satisfied that the bounty reaches them.</P>

      <P>The British Government is collecting, you might say, <Col N="839" /> £4,500,000.  It was £1,000,000 over their Estimate, and the only way they could stop the money from flowing in was by putting a limitation on the number of cattle they were going to take.  That was the only way it could be stopped.  Then we were told that they could not consume them, and that they could not pay for them.  Mind you, low as is the price that they are paying, and heavy as the tax is that they are putting on them, we could get no more from anybody else, and we have tried hard.  Mr. de Valera, as he then was, is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 18th March, 1932, as saying that: &ldquo;The overhead charges on farmers are too high for them and must be lightened.  One of the heaviest of those charges is the burden of the local rates.&rdquo;  There is the oracle himself contradicting the Minister who told us that it was only three and a half per cent. or five per cent.  Here is the great man himself telling us that one of the heaviest of those charges is the burden of local rates. He added: &ldquo;We propose to derate agricultural holdings.&rdquo;  Now, that is pretty hot stuff.  &ldquo;They are derated in Britain and in the Six Counties.&rdquo; We cannot keep our eye off that old dear no matter what we do.  &ldquo;Two of the £3,000,000 unjustly taken from us each year in land annuities will suffice for this derating.&rdquo;  That is not a promise; it is only a statement! That was the state of mind of the President of the Executive Council, notwithstanding all the Minister has said.  He was satisfied that local rates were an unjust and unfair burden on agriculture.  He led the people of this country to believe that when they came in they would derate agricultural land.  The report of the Derating Commission was mentioned here to-night. Was there any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who supported that policy at the time?  Not one of them.  They were all against the report. Fianna Fáil would promise more than derating to get into the seats of the mighty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In very different circumstances. Two or three years were not necessary to teach me my business when I was over there.  I had had some experience of business.  I had had some experience of the world.  I knew the truth of Burke's statement when he said that you cannot indict a nation.  The policy of this Government is little short of indicting the farmers of this country, who are practically the nation.  Think for a moment, as Deputy Brennan has said, that in the short space of two or three years 450,000 men are going to be demoralised and are going to refuse to pay their rates!  No such thing.  It could not happen.  These are the real difficulties that are confronting the farmers and that have placed them in that position.</P>
      <P>This evening I asked the Minister for Justice did he stand over the seizure of goods, putting them up for sale and knocking them down at one-tenth of their value.  I asked him did he stand for that.  That is what goods are knocked down at.  There is no use in the Minister saying that it is a mistake for these people to allow their cattle to be seized.  The position is this: The farmer who is able to pay happens to be surrounded by a number of men who cannot pay.  He has to stand in with them.  That is unfortunate, but there is no Party in this country more responsible for that state of affairs than the Party on the Government Benches.  They told the people that if they stood together they could get their rights and now it does not lie in the mouth of any man on the Government Benches to say to a farmer &ldquo;I know you have got the money and you can pay.&rdquo;  That is no answer.  The man should be able to pay his debts and his rates and annuities out of the working of his farm; out of his industry and his holding he should be able to get the money that would meet all these liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a letter a farmer in Limerick points out that not alone in the price of cattle but that for practically every other commodity produced in the country there has been a catastrophic drop in prices in <Col N="841" /> the last four or five years.  The Minister tells us that the Government knows that.  Is it conceivable that from one end of this country to the other a whole succession of people say &ldquo;we are unable to pay&rdquo; unless it were so?  No organisation, not even the Fianna Fáil organisation at its best&mdash;and it was fairly strong just as we were going out of office&mdash;would have been able to prevent people paying their debts if they were able to pay them.  And at that time the Fianna Fáil organisation would have been delighted to place us in a difficult or impossible position with the farmers.</P>
    <P>For the non-payment of these annuities to-day there is no other reason than that the industry cannot pay.  It may be, in circumstances such as this, that there ought to be a pooling of the wisdom on the part of people who would say amongst themselves &ldquo;What can be done?&rdquo;  We believe that the only method of improving the condition of the farmers is to end the economic war.  Some time ago a great many people were surprised, having regard to the statements made by Government Deputies in the last couple of years in connection with the inability of the British consumer to buy our cattle, on waking up one morning to find that a pact had been arrived at.  That was the coal and cattle pact.  Were the circumstances so propitious for such an understanding then as was arrived at?  They were not, and if, in such circumstances, when there is a tariff war on and a great many people are doubting the sincerity of what is behind that tariff war, a pact is arrived at whereby the British people take 150,000 more cattle from us than they did a year ago, is it seriously contended that we could not make a better bargain with the British if there were a settlement all around?  Does not the Minister know that in any settlement of this tariff war, the Irish farmer would get off very much better than at present? Is it seriously contended that a reduction of half the annuities compensates for all that the farmer is losing?</P>
    <P>There is no greater danger than <Col N="842" /> driving honest men into a position in which they find that they cannot meet their liabilities.  In my time I have seen many honest men who would not defraud a person of a penny, men who would go out of their way to meet their liabilities, but who, when times became hard, were difficult to deal with.  If, as a result of the policy pursued now, the farmers are driven to depression or ruined, mark you, notwithstanding whatever good bargain may be got afterwards&mdash;at the end of a year or two&mdash;it will be found that nothing will restore or compensate for what has been lost.  It is nonsense to tell those farmers to change over.  When you have got numbers of people accustomed to a certain system of farming or accustomed to any particular system of agriculture, it is impossible for them to change from that system.  Anybody who makes an inquiry through the Land Commission as to what happened in the case of migrants will understand the truth of this.  Men were transferred from the less fertile parts of the country into the rich lands of Meath and Dublin.  The migrants got much better holdings in Meath and in the rich lands near Dublin.  These people would not come from the less fertile parts of the country unless they got better holdings.  I inquired as to how they got on and I learned that very few had been doing as well as they had been doing on the less fertile lands.  What was the reason of that? A different style of farming.  Possibly on the Government Front Benches, one out of the ten or 12 has experience of working land and these are the men who are asking for a complete change in the agricultural system pursued by the farmers.  They are ordering or directing a new system of agricultural economy.  It would take the genius of Solomon to make a success of that policy within the time in which they propose to make that change.  Possibly they think that the economic war is necessary in order to bring about this state of things.</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister and his colleagues that a very serious responsibility rests upon them.  It will not be possible <Col N="843" /> later by means of compensation Acts to restore the broken homes, to put back the children who have been taken out of the schools and to give to the young man who has gone along two or three years perhaps with his profession any compensation that will make up for what they have lost.  I tell Ministers it will not be possible to do that. Remember we had an experience of it before in connection with disturbed conditions such as these.  These disturbed conditions may have very much more reactions and troubles not alone for the Ministry but for the people of the country.  It would be well for the Ministers then, before it is too late, to review the circumstances and to see whether it would be possible for them to give the farmers what they are asking. Meantime, by reason of the increase in taxation in this country and the extra cost in such items as sugar and other commodities that the farmer has to buy; by reason of the increase in local taxation and by reason of the harassing of these farmers, I am convinced there is no way out of complete derating of agricultural land. I do not see how it is possible to rehabilitate the agricultural industry except by giving them derating.  If Ministers were in touch with agriculturists; if they heard the stories that are being told about the increased <Col N="844" /> cost in connection with tillage and other matters, they would realise just as clearly as I do that during the next few years derating has got to be given to agricultural land in this country.</P>
    <P>At the time when this motion was put down, what might be called normal rates were in existence throughout the country.  Now, the position is that by reason of non-payment of part of the annuities a sum of £750,000 is going to be deducted from the local grants.  We are told it is the law, but it is a law that can be changed without an Act of Parliament.  It is a law that a piece of white paper brought in here with a sum of £750,000 written on it restoring the money to the Guarantee Fund, would get over.  That is all that is necessary.  I would advise the Ministry to consider doing that before it is too late.  Somebody asked where is the money to come from.  In the Budget of 1932-33 there was produced a surplus of £1,141,000. In the third page of the Minister for Finance's speech on the Budget last year, he declared that he had a surplus of £1,355,000.  Those two items together would give derating to agricultural land this year and next year.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned until Friday, 15th March.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10-30 until 3 o'clock on Thursday, 14th March.</P>

      <P>The amounts of local taxation grants withheld from the several counties at the 17th February, 1934 and 17th February, 1935, respectively, are set out hereunder.  Separate figures for annuities payable under Acts passed previous to and subsequent to 1923 could only be taken out by the Land Commission with a very great expenditure of time, which does not seem justified.</P>
