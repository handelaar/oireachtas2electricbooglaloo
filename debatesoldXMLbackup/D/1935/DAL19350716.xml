      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that it is the practice of certain boards of health, where outgoing tenants of labourers' cottages are in arrears with their rents, to require incoming tenants to pay off such arrears; whether he has given his sanction to such practice, and if not, whether he will take the necessary steps to prevent it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been drawn to the increase of unnecessary noise caused by drivers of motor vehicles; and whether he proposes to abolish or, at least, diminish such abuses (a) by forbidding the use of motor-horns of an unreasonably discordant type; (b) by prohibiting the use of open exhausts; (c) by prohibiting the use of horns and other signals in certain districts and during certain hours.</P>

      <P>No representations <Col N="514" /> have reached me regarding increased unnecessary noise caused by drivers of motor vehicles.</P>
      <P>As regards (a), I shall consider to what extent existing regulations can be amended so as to prohibit the use of motor-horns of an unnecessarily discordant type.  The use of open exhausts, referred to at (b), is already prohibited.  Concerning (c), I am advised that, having regard to the provisions of Section 15, sub-section (3), of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, it is doubtful whether I have adequate powers to deal with the matter of silence zones.  I am, however, having that question specially looked into.</P>
      <P>Generally, I would like to call the Deputy's attention to Articles 21, 63, 64 and 65 of the Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (Construction, Equipment and Use) Order, 1934.</P>

      <P>(a) The Mayo Board of Health appear to be proceeding as quickly as possible with the scheme of labourers' cottages in Claremorris area; (b) four cottages are in an advanced stage of construction on sites acquired under the board's voluntary scheme.  Thirty-eight cottages are to be built at Lisnaboley and six at Cherryfield on sites being acquired compulsorily; (c) at the board's meeting in May tenders were received for the cottages to be built on the sites acquired compulsorily. The board considered the tender for the Cherryfield group excessive and decided to readvertise.  The tender accepted for the Lisnaboley group was considered excessive by the Department and the board were instructed to readvertise in this case also.  Fresh tenders are due for consideration by the board at their meeting on 20th instant.  Accordingly, at this stage it <Col N="515" /> is not possible to state the cost of erection of these cottages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to improve the position of persons who come within the scope of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, in certain respects.  Provision is made in Sections 5, 6 and 7 to establish machinery which enables applicants who are dissatisfied with the valuation of their means by the Unemployment Assistance Officers to have their appeals considered and determined expeditiously.  Section 3 seeks to provide that two periods of unemployment of not less than six days each separated by an interval of not more than six weeks shall be treated as a continuous period of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 are designed to enable unemployed persons entitled both to unemployment benefit under the Insurance Act and to unemployment assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act, to choose which of these benefits they will claim.  Section 4 is designed to secure the inclusion as dependents of their parents of invalid sons and daughters over 18 years of age. Section 8 seeks to ensure that in the event of any new area becoming an <Col N="520" /> urban area, the recipients of unemployment assistance who reside therein will continue to receive assistance at the higher rate appropriate to the area. Section 11 is designed to secure the distribution of the unemployment assistance more equally between applicants according to their circumstances. Certain other minor provisions are made whereby persons who obtain unemployment assistance by the deliberate making of false and misleading statements or concealing facts, will not be permitted to retain such assistance; there is also provision whereby public assistance authorities can, in certain circumstances, recover excess relief paid by them.</P>
    <P>Taking these matters in the order in which I mentioned them, I wish further to state as regards the expeditions determination of appeals that some 35,000 persons who were dissatisfied with the decisions given in their cases have appealed to the Unemployment Appeals Committee, which is the Tribunal set up under the Act for deciding finally questions of that kind. For the most part those applicants were dissatisfied with the valuation of their means.  By exercising their direct right of appeal to the Unemployment Appeals Committee they produced a volume of appeals so great that the Committee could not consider and determinne them in any reasonable time.  As the Dáil was informed temporary arrangements were made whereby the cases of these applicants are being re-examined by the unemployment assistance officers, and wherever possible, revised to the advantage of the applicants.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to establish permanent machinery by which the appeals can be considered and determined without delay.  The tribunals for determining these appeals must be capable of expansion in proportion to the volume of the appeals.  Applicants who are dissatisfied with the unemployment assistance officers' decision have at present, as I stated, a statutory right of appeal to the Unemployment Appeals Committee.  It is proposed in the Bill to retain to applicants this statutory right of appeal but to make <Col N="521" /> the appeal lie to an appeals officer rather than direct to the Unemployment Appeals Committee.  The appeals officers will be highly specialised officers, and the number to be appointed will be determined by the number of appeals to be dealt with. The necessary number of officers to enable these appeals to be disposed of expeditiously will be appointed. The appeals officer may decide the appeal himself or refer it to the Unemployment Appeals Committee for decision.  If he decides it himself he may give permission to the applicant to bring his case by a further appeal to the Appeals Committee.  But without such permission the appeals officer's decision will be final.</P>
    <P>The rights of the applicants are, therefore, preserved.  The appeals can be determined by a system sufficiently elastic to expand or contract according to the volume of appeals.  But the Unemployment Appeals Committee will govern the decision of the appeals officers.  The decisions to be given by the appeals officers who will be appointed under the Bill will be ruled by the decisions given by the Unemployment Appeals Committee or by any future decision which may be given by that body.</P>
    <P>With regard to the changes proposed to be effected by Section 3 the position under the Act at present is that an applicant for unemployment assistance must prove a fresh waiting week, during which no unemployment assistance is payable, on every occasion upon which he obtains more than two days' work.  That rule has operated so as to deter applicants who are in a position to obtain short periods of employment from taking such employment.  It is proposed to alter the rule so that it will be possible for recipients of unemployment assistance to take employment lasting as long as six weeks without suffering loss of unemployment assistance for any days other than the days upon which they have actually been working, provided they have been unemployed in the weeks immediately preceding and immediately following the period of employment.  This <Col N="522" /> alteration will make the position under the Unemployment Assistance Act similar to the position under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and will remove any deterrent from taking short periods of employment which the existing rule may cause.  The change supplements and does not substitute the existing rule for shorter periods.</P>
    <P>With regard to the changes proposed under Sections 9 and 10, the position under the existing Act is that an applicant for unemployment assistance, who obtains some credit in the Unemployment Fund by the payment of contributions in respect of employment in an insured occupation, is forced to exhaust his right to unemployment insurance benefit before he can have recourse to unemployment assistance.  In actual practice it has been found that this rule causes hardship to applicants in that before unemployment assistance can be paid it has first to be established that the applicant is not entitled to unemployment benefit, and delays often result from the application of the necessary tests.  It is proposed to alter this and to leave the applicant free to claim either unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit as he chooses, provided only that he shall not receive both at the same time&mdash; that is both in respect of the same day.  It is anticipated that this new provision will eliminate a rather fruit ful source of complaints by applicants for unemployment assistance.  They will now have a free choice to claim either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  In addition, these sections effect another change which has been urged from various quarters.  Applicants will be able-while actually in receipt of unemploy ment benefit, to prove their waiting week for the purpose of unemploy ment assistance, so that there will be no gap between the expiry of unemployment benefit and the beginning of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which deals with the definition of &ldquo;dependents for the purposes of the Act, effects three changes. <Col N="523" /> In the first place, there are drafting changes effected, because at present there is a certain lack of uniformity in the terms used in the definition of &ldquo;dependents&rdquo; and it is proposed to make the terms uniform; and in addition to secure that invalid children over 18 may be regarded as dependents of their parents who wholly or mainly support them.  That provision was omitted from the Principal Act through inadvertence.  The existing definition of &ldquo;dependent wife&rdquo; requires only that she be living with her husband and not working, otherwise than at her usual household duties, regularly for wages or other remuneration.  It is proposed to restrict this definition so as to ensure that where a wife is engaged in an occupation ordinarily carried on for profit or has an income sufficient for her own support she shall not be regarded as dependent on her husband.</P>
    <P>The change effected under Section 8 is designed to deal with the situation that would arise in the event of the extension of the boundary of a county borough or urban area so as to include areas hitherto outside the boundary and provides that recipients of unemployment assistance in such added areas would be entitled to continue to draw unemployment assistance at the higher rates which would then become applicable.  Under the present law if the boundary of a county borough were extended, a recipient of unemployment assistance in the added area would be left without that assistance, and a similar position would arise if, as a result of a future census, the population of an urban district was shown to have increased so as to exceed 7,000.  The Bill provides that recipients of unemployment assistance will continue to receive that assistance and that the rates will be increased to the rates appropriate to the alteration in the status of the area in which they reside.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is one designed to secure the distribution of the funds available for the payment of unemployment <Col N="524" /> assistance in a more equitable manner between applicants according to their circumstances.  A person entitled to unemployment assistance receives the rate laid down in the Schedule to the Act subject to a reduction of 1/- per week for each shilling or part of a shilling by which the value of his means exceeds 2/- per week.  One result of this arrangement is that an applicant who has means to the value of 2/- per week obtains the full scheduled rate of unemployment assistance in addition to his means.  This results in an inequality, inasmuch as a person with means amounting to 2/- per week is to this extent better provided for than the person who has no means at all.  It is difficult to justify this inequality and it is proposed to minimise it.  Recipients of unemployment assistance are able-bodied persons capable of work who normally support themselves by their labour. Unemployment assistance comes to their aid during interludes of involuntary unemployment, and if a man continued during such involuntary unemployment to have means amounting to 2/- per week it is reasonable that he should not receive the same amount of unemployment assistance as a similarly employed man who has no means at all.</P>
    <P>There are other general provisions which perhaps can be more suitably discussed in the Committee Stage, but reference can be made to them here. The first of these is dealt with in Section 16.  When a doubt arises as to whether an applicant for unemployment assistance fulfils the statutory conditions, some weeks must elapse before the question is finally determined, and during this period the public assistance authority may have provided the applicant with relief on the basis that he would not receive unemployment assistance.  If, as a result of an appeal to the Court of Referees, or in some cases to the Umpire, the final determination is in the applicant's favour, arrears of unemployment assistance are paid from the date of his claim.  These arrears would be additional to the relief provided by the public assistance authority pending the determination of the <Col N="525" /> application for unemployment assistance, and provision is made in the Bill to enable the public assistance authority to avoid this duplication by recovering from the arrears of unemployment assistance the amount of home assistance paid in excess of what would have been paid had the applicant been actually receiving unemployment assistance for the time his application was under consideration.</P>
    <P>With reference to Section 13, it is not clear at present that there is power to recover unemployment assistance paid to an applicant by reason of his false or misleading representations or by conceaiment of material facts.  The position is clarified by this Bill which ensures that an applicant who has obtained employment assistance, in such circumstances will not be permitted to retain it. With regard to Section 12, applicants who are not capable of work, who are not available for work or who are not genuinely seeking suitable employment, may at present insist on renewing their applications every day and thus require several decisions though their condition may remain unaltered and though they are not in a position to submit any new facts.  To enable an unemployment assistance officer to refuse to determine such ineffective renewals of applications, provision is made whereby within a limit of six weeks he may refuse to determine them.</P>
    <P>There are some other amendments which experience of the operation of the Act have indicated to be necessary. These are all minor matters, involving such things as the definition of a day, the abolition of any prescribed form of appeal, and the payments of unemployment assistance, due to a deceased or insane person, to their representatives without formally proving a will or taking out letters of administration.  I think I have dealt with all the main provisions of the Bill.  This is an amending Bill designed to deal with the different parts of the principal Act, and consequently it is a type of Bill that lends itself more to Committee Stage discussion than to a Second Reading debate. If there are any matters concerning <Col N="526" /> which the members of the Dáil desire to have further information at this Stage, I shall endeavour to pro vide it for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to say, in view of the fact that some of the provisions of the Bill are going to increase the costs of unemployment assistance considerably.  Only one section will definitely effect a saving, and that is Section 11.  Whether the savings under that section will or will not be offset by the increased costs under other sections it is difficult to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill, from the point of view of the class of the community who are affected by it, is an utterly worthless Bill and in many respects a reactionary Bill.  There is a saying that &ldquo;It is the poor who help the poor,&rdquo; and that principle is very strongly entrenched in this Bill.  Under the section dealing with the means of claimants for unemployment assistance benefit, the Minister is now seeking to amend the Principal Act in such a way as definitely to reduce the amount of income which applicants for unemployment assistance benefit will obtain after this amending Bill is passed.  If this amending Bill is passed by the House certain persons who are at present in receipt of benefit will get less benefit as a result of the passage of the Bill.  According to the information published by the Minister's own Department, there are 75,000 persons with means who are claimants for unemployment assistance.  We may assume that a very substantial proportion of that number have means calculated in the manner provided in the Act of approximately 2/- per week, or perhaps more.  Formerly the position was that if a person had an ascertained income of 2/- per week, <Col N="527" /> that was disregarded for the purpose of claiming benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  It might work out, therefore, that a person who was entitled to 6/- unemployment assistance benefit and had 2/- per week income from another source might receive that 2/- per week and his week's benefit would not in any way be reduced.  But under this amending Bill it is now proposed, if a person has means calculated at 2/- per week, to cut off 1/- from his ordinary rate of benefit.</P>
      <P>As I say, having regard to the number of persons who are computed to be in receipt of other means, a very substantial sum of money will be saved to the Exchequer under this Bill.  But the loss to such persons does not stop at tightening up the section of the principal Act in respect of the amount of the exemption limit.  There are at present a number of persons who are entitled to unemployment assistance at the rate of 1/- per week.  The very fact that they are entitled to unemployment assistance benefit at all entitles them to free beef which is provided by the Department of Agriculture. Any person now in receipt of 1/- per week unemployment assistance benefit will be definitely cut off from all claim to unemployment assistance benefit.  Not only will he lose the 1/- per week unemployment assistance benefit, but he will lose his right to claim free beef as well.  I should think that the Minister would not have very much difficulty in calculating what the saving to the Exchequer will be in the form of the withdrawal of the supply of free beef to such persons and the reduction at the same time in the amount of their unemployment assistance benefit.  The savings to the Exchequer under these heads will, I think, be very substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no other section in the Bill calculated to give to those in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit, any compensation for the benefits which they are losing by the provisions of this Bill for tightening up the section of the principal Act dealing with the means exemption limit.  So far, therefore, as this Bill is concerned, it means <Col N="528" /> that less unemployment assistance benefit will be paid in future.  That is the cardinal principle underlying this whole Bill.  Under the Budget which the Minister for Finance has described as a war Budget, and of which the Minister for Agriculture said he was very proud, a sum of £300,000 was saved to the Exchequer this year or will be saved to the Exchequer this year mainly by means of two employment period orders.  So that the State is going to save £300,000 by that form of economy.  Not content with saving money in that respect, this Bill is now introduced in order to save more money and the people who are going to contribute to the savings all the time are persons in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit.  Demanding sacrifices from people such as these, demanding sacrifices from people who are not capable of making sacrifices having regard to the fact that they are virtually propertyless people, seems to me to square very strangely with the declarations we have had from the Government benches in the past that taxation and burdens should be put on the backs most capable of bearing them.</P>
    <P>This is the second attack on the recipients of unemployment assistance benefit&mdash;the first in the Budget and the second in this Bill.  The Minister has shown no cause whatever why the Dáil ought to pass Section 11 of this Bill.  It is designed, and deliberately designed, to reduce the amount of benefit which is paid in the form of unemployment assistance.  One might understand the attitude of the Minister in the matter, although one need not necessarily agree with that attitude, if it was proposed completely to abolish any means provisions in this Bill&mdash;if, for instance, the Minister was proposing to say that no means will be taken into consideration in deciding the claim of a person to receive unemployment assistance benefit. But it is not proposed to do that. It is proposed to grant a certain means exemption limit and the principle of a means exemption limit is, therefore, definitely recognised by the State in this proposal, but with this difference, that, whereas it has been fixed at 2/- a week in the past, the Minister now proposes to reduce it to 1/- and we have <Col N="529" /> not a single word of explanation as to the necessity for a reactionary amendment of that kind.  I take it that when the Government originally fixed 2/- a week as the means exemption limit there were good and sufficient reasons for fixing it at that figure and not at 3/- or at 1/-.  The Government then felt that 2/- was a reasonable figure, but now they propose to reduce that to 1/- a week and they give us no explanation for so doing.  They offer no explanation as to why this amendment of the principal Act is being proposed. We are not told that 2/- a week is too much.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not even subscribed to the declaration that the principle of a means exemption limit is wrong. He could not very well do so, because he is still maintaining the principle of a means exemption limit.  A means exemption limit is recognised in the Old Age Pensions Act and in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill passed here within the last 14 days. It is remarkable that in the Old Age Pensions Act and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill the means exemption limit is much higher than will exist under the Unemployment Assistance Act when this amending Bill has been passed.  We grant to old persons, some of whom may be living on farms of 100 or 200 acres, a certain means exemption limit, but in respect of propertyless people living in towns and cities we reduce the limit.  I do not know how the Minister can honestly reconcile these two legislative contradictions on the part of the Government. Having regard to the low rates of benefit which are paid under the principal Act, there is really no case for a reduction of the means exemption limit unless the object is simply to save money, to grab any kind of money that is within convenient reach.  The rates of benefit provided under the principal Act are much less in many cases than what would be provided by poor law authorities yet, notwithstanding that, the Minister is proposing to reduce the rates of benefit still further.</P>
    <P>I think this is a particularly mean proposal.  It is designed to take money in a naked and deliberate way out of the pockets of persons in receipt of <Col N="530" /> unemployment assistance benefit.  The Government propose to do that following shortly after the declaration that it proposes to save £300,000 this year by means of two employment period orders.  The Government are asking the classes in the community affected by this measure to make a sacrifice which neither the members of this House nor any persons who have regard for equity would be entitled to ask them to make.  The Minister said his Budget was a war Budget.  If this is one of the methods of balancing the war Budget we can see quite clearly that, in respect of some classes in the community at all events, the longer the war goes on the better, because they are not being asked to make sacrifices or to bear burdens in proportion to their capacity to bear such burdens. On the backs of the recipients of unemployment benefit are placed substantial imposts in order that the war Budget of the Minister for Finance may be balanced.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that many of the amendments were necessitated by their experience of the principal Act.  It is rather remarkable that some of the amendments introduced are apparently based upon the feeling that the principal Act was much too generous.  No effort has been made to explain how the principal Act was in any way generous from the point of view of the benefits provided.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied, from his experience of the principal Act, that the rates of benefit are sufficiently adequate to provide a reasonable standard of sustenance for those concerned?  Of course no authority has a right to expect unemployed persons to be content with anything less than a reasonable standard of subsistence.  In the principal Act a man with a wife and six children receives a maximum benefit of 12/6 a week in a substantially-sized town.  Eight persons are compelled to live on 12/6, 1/6 per week per person!  The 1/6 per week is expected to provide food for that person &mdash;21 meals in the week&mdash;apart from the additional expense involved in the purchase of clothes and boots and, in the case of school-going children, <Col N="531" /> school books, and also the payment of rent and the purchase of a variety of other necessary articles indispensable in a modern household in this year of civilisation.  The principal Act requires eight persons, including two adults and children up to 16 years of age, to exist on 12/6 a week.  It must be manifest to the Minister and the Department that that rate is totally inadequate, and yet there is no provision made in this amending measure to increase the rates of benefit.  Does the Minister propose to defend the low rates of benefit provided in the principal Act as an adequate amount for the subsistence of the persons concerned?</P>
    <P>There is another omission from the amending Bill which it is rather difficult to understand.  Under the principal Act a person in receipt of any kind of employment is, of course, not regarded as unemployed.  That person is consequently denied unemployment assistance benefit.  There are many persons in employment receiving less wages for part-time service than they would get under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  There are in fact many persons in the State service who get in the form of wages for part-time employment less than they would receive under that Act.  I do not know whether that justifies the Minister's table of benefits in the principal Act. There are cases of part-time persons engaged in the Post Office, and many of them engaged in the delivery of letters and other communications containing benefits to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance of more value than they are themselves getting in wages for the delivery of those letters.  That, of course, does not mean, by any means, that the benefit received by the unemployment assistance recipient is adequate.  It only shows the extent to which low wages are paid in the State part-time service.  I think the Minister should make provision to include in the scope of the Bill persons only partially employed, which would supplement the low wages these persons are in receipt of.  I think that there should be provision that people <Col N="532" /> in receipt of such low wages should still receive unemployment assistance benefit, which should be available for every person in receipt of wages lower than the rates provided for under the principal Act.</P>
    <P>If there is any real value in this Bill it is in the appeal section.  There the value is only evident because of the jam which exists in the number of appeals against reduction of unemployment assistance benefit.  According to a statement of the Minister recently there are 31,000 appeals awaiting consideration. We have the statement of the Minister that 23,000 of these were made prior to the 1st January last.  In many cases that means that those who made the appeal against the reduction of the amount of their unemployment assistance benefit, are not getting benefit to which they are properly entitled, under the full consideration of the circumstances of their case.  Under the principal Act, and under this amending Bill, provision is made that there shall be retrospective decisions from the standpoint of being able to cancel retrospectively the issue of the qualification certificate.  But there are to be no retrospective decisions from the point of view of the benefit which has accumulated as a result of the Ministers having devised this defective machinery.  There are 31,000 appeals in the Minister's Department awaiting consideration.  Many of the applicants will ultimately be determined to be entitled to more benefit than they are at present receiving.  Under the principal Act there is no power to pay them their benefit retrospectively.  And the Minister is not taking power to remedy an obvious injustice to those people. There is to be no retrospective feature in respect of making good to those persons the full weekly income to which they would be entitled and of which they are deprived as a result of the jam that exists in dealing with appeals under the principal Act.</P>
    <P>I have before me the case of a person who received unemployment assistance benefit of 6/6 per week; his benefit was allowed in August last.  He appealed, and his appeal was heard and decided in April.  In April the <Col N="533" /> decision on his unemployment appeal resulted in his being allowed not 6/6, which was awarded him in the first instance, but 9/6.  As a result of the reconsideration of his case, he was found to be entitled to 3/- a week more than was allowed him in the first instance.  But there was no provision for paying him the additional benefit retrospectively.  If that person had his appeal heard in August last, he would be entitled, not merely to 6/6, but would have been entitled to 9/6 as from August; but because of the jam in dealing with unemployment assistance appeals, he was denied the benefit of his right of an additional 3/- a week from August, 1934, to April, 1935.  It was a manifest injustice to this applicant, that under the principal Act his appeal should have been held up; but it is a more obvious injustice than holding up the appeal to find that after the appeal decision was arrived at, the State declines to pay retrospectively the amount decided on, after it had been found that the applicant was underpaid in the first instance.  There is no provision in this amending Bill to deal with that obvious injustice.</P>
    <P>The Minister this year resorted to the use of the power given in the principal Act to issue an employment period order, and the second employment period order is about to be issued.  There are, therefore, to be two unemployment period orders under the principal Act.  I want to complain of the manner in which the Minister exercises, in an arbitrary manner, the powers conferred on him under this Act.  These employment period orders are blanket orders, without any precise inquiry as to whether, in fact, work is available for those affected by the order.  The Minister has issued these orders without making any inquiry as to whether the persons affected could, in fact, obtain employment, and although pressed to allow such persons who could not obtain employment to draw their unemployment benefit the Minister stated he was not prepared to agree.  Having reached that stage, the Minister now, without any inquiry, and altogether for the purpose of saving money, is issuing these employment <Col N="534" /> period orders.  They are purely economic orders&mdash;they are not employment orders at all&mdash;because everyone knows the persons could not obtain employment in the areas to which they relate.  The Minister pretended they could; but no inquiry was made. Instead of that he issued his blanket orders, designed to save as much money as possible, which is really the only reason for the issue of these orders.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in this amending Bill he ought to make provision for the setting up of a committee to advise him as to the extent of the unemployment period orders, the necessary areas in which they should be operative, and the category of persons to be affected.  At present the Minister of his own sweet will can make employment orders, and is not bound to consider anything except the condition of the Exchequer in having them issued.  I suggest the Minister should not exercise his power in that respect in that arbitrary manner.  I suggest he should set up an advisory committee which would make inquiries into the areas, and give the Minister the benefit of their advice, and also advise him as to the class of persons who might reasonably be excluded from the scope of the employment order.  In Great Britain, under the Employment Assistance Act, 1935, there is provision for the establishment of such advisory committees, not merely for the purpose of advising the Minister in matters of that kind, but for the purpose of looking after the welfare of the unemployed persons, helping to promote employment, helping to promote recreation, and helping to promote the maintenance of good health and bodily vigour. I think the establishment of advisory committees here, having the same object in view, would be helpful, not only to the State but to the unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister might have another look at the Unemployment Assistance Act in Great Britain. I gather that he, or his advisers, have already had one look at the Act, because one section in this Bill is lifted <Col N="535" /> word for word out of the British Act. It is rather strange when we come to look at the British Act that the only things worthy of emulation are those portions which enable the Minister to effect economies.  Section 18 of this Bill, which makes the wife of an offender a competent witness in legal proceedings, follows, word for word, the provisions in the British Act, and I suggest that there are provisions in the British Act, besides these, which might be looked at.  There are other worth while provisions of the Act, and quite apart from the rates of benefit payable there, which are substantially higher than those paid here, there are other features in respect of advisory machinery in that Act which, I think, the Minister would be well advised to embody in legislation here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has appreciated the dissatisfaction caused by the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and I hope that the amendments which he proposes in this measure will have the effect of enabling those who are interested in the administration of relief in other directions to get an opportunity of doing so with some satisfaction.  There are a couple of points to which I should like to draw his attention, and I think he has already had his attention drawn to them.  The first is with regard to claimants not making sufficient effort to obtain employment.  A considerable number of cases are held up by reason of the regulations under the Act.  I understand that the Minister proposes to meet the problem in some way now, but I should like to ask him how that decision is arrived at in most of the cases, because we find from officials concerned in the administration of outdoor relief that the cases which come to their notice do not justify the action taken by the Minister's Department.  I should like to have the Minister's opinion on how they determine a man is not looking for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton has referred to the rates of payment, and I agree that the amount is not sufficient, for the reason that it was generally felt, when this Bill <Col N="536" /> was introduced, that it was going to relieve local rates to a greater extent than it has, that is, to relieve us in the matter of the administration of outdoor relief.  It has not done that.  With regard to the proposed amendment of Section 17 of the Act, it is going to have quite a different effect.  It will likely bring about a substantial increase in the number of persons applying for relief as a subsidy&mdash;Army reserve men and others.  Many of them are already receiving relief to subsidise their unemployment assistance allowance.  This amendment, in my opinion, will affect the means test, with the result that the advantages he is seeking will have quite a counterbalancing effect.  Local boards are put in a position that, at the beginning of the year they have to strike their rates, and in very few cases is any provision made to meet cases of this kind, while there is a kind of duplication of the work.</P>
    <P>If the amendments the Minister now proposes do not give the satisfaction he desires, it would be better to withdraw the Bill altogether and have some definite means of subsidising those who are unemployed other than by outdoor relief, because the two will not work together.  There is general dissatisfaction with people who are operating outdoor relief, as against those who are trying to meet cases under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  In cases of delay in dealing with appealed cases, the maintenance of applicants is met by local rates.  Then, again, the amounts paid to these people range from £10 and £12 to £20, and there are no means of recovering it.  I understand the Minister is making some provision to meet that now, but I do not know how far it will be satisfactory.  I suggest that the Minister should get in touch with officials of outdoor relief schemes and try to hammer out some plan that would meet the situation, because there is nothing at present but general dissatisfaction.</P>

      <P>I find a very remarkable thing, that the Minister, having introduced this measure and having had the operation of it for somewhat more than 12 months&mdash;a <Col N="537" /> measure which has been so costly&mdash; has been driven to secure a reduction of £300,000 a year and to introduce an amending measure and not give the House the advantage of an explanation of his experience of any aspect of the administration of this Act or an outline of what exactly he found when he approached the unemployment situation in the country with this Act as a machinery for finding it out and for dealing with it.  The outstanding point in the measure now before us is the matter to which attention has been drawn by Deputy Norton.  When the Minister introduced this measure he contemplated that in the case of a man in the City of Dublin with a wife and five or more dependents might have a minimum income of 22/-.  Now, he considers that 21/- is enough.  In a rural district a man might have a minimum income of 14/6, and now he considers 13/6 enough.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can perhaps deal with that matter, but, at any rate, he has reduced the minimum income in the case of a person with any kind of means by 1/- in this Bill. I should like the Minister to explain to us why he considers this reduction in the minimum income of persons who have any kind of income, necessary, and why he proceeds to bring it about.  I think he ought also tell us what his experience has been with regard to the class of persons whom he finds it necessary to treat in this particular way.  Are they persons in urban or rural districts?  It is not easy to see whether it is rural or urban people who are going to be hit in the present circumstances.  If it is the urban people who are going to be hit, then I feel that a very great injustice is going to be done to them.  I do not think that the lot of people in rural parts is any better than that of the people in the urban districts, but the amenities for persons out of employment are somewhat easier there than they are in the urban districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should address himself to that particular matter.  I <Col N="538" /> can understand his difficulty when he finds the County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford drawing the attention of the Ministry to the low wages paid to agricultural labourers in Wexford, and when the rent collectors in South Tipperary have had to draw the attention of the Commissioner there and of the Government to the same matter. In view of that, it is no doubt difficult to stand for even the present rates as against the rural community.  The County Committee of Agriculture in Wexford declared that the average wage for agricultural labourers at the moment is 8/- a week with their food. When four rent collectors in South Tipperary were challenged by the Minister for Local Government with the neglect of their duty in not collecting the cottage rents, they drew the attention of the Commissioner to the fact that the average wage paid to agricultural labourers in that area was from 8/- to 10/- a week: that in some places the farmers were so badly off that they were six weeks in arrears in the payment of wages, while in a large number of cases labourers were depending on home assistance.  While that is the position I can understand the Minister's difficulty in standing for even the present rates of unemployment assistance in those areas. Nevertheless, I would expect him to give some explanation as to why he makes this reduction at the present time, and why he thinks, if he does, that even the reduced figures can be maintained if the position as revealed in Wexford and South Tipperary is going to continue and, perhaps, get even worse.  The Minister cannot shut his eyes to the position that exists throughout the rural areas both as regards employment and wages.  I submit to him that he had better face the task of explaining some of these things now, because the position will only become considerably worse, and explanations may not be of any avail if he faces the situation later.</P>
    <P>In the past, in the south-eastern part of the country bounded by Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Offaly and North Tipperary, agriculture was expected to give considerable employment to <Col N="539" /> agricultural labourers.  It is a part of the country where the total number of agricultural labourers would be more than one-quarter of the total number of persons engaged in agriculture. But, when we look at figures recently issued by the Minister with regard to the amount of employment given in agriculture, we find that in ten out of the 15 counties in that part of the country there were, last year, a smaller number of agricultural labourers permanently employed than the year 1931, and that despite all the public money that is going to the assistance of agriculture in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that there has been an increase in the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at any rate is this, that despite all the subsidies and public moneys that the Government could possibly concentrate in those areas, areas which naturally gave employment because of their agricultural economy to agricultural labourers, we find that the position is as I have stated&mdash;that last year in ten out of 15 counties the number of agricultural labourers permanently employed in them was less than the number employed in the year 1931 before the Minister's scheme ever came into operation.  The counties concerned are: Louth, Meath, Kildare, Offaly, Carlow, Wexford, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Waterford.  In six of these counties the number of agricultural labourers temporarily employed was less last year than in the year 1931, these counties being: Louth, Meath, Offaly, Limerick and County Dublin.  If that is the position in that part of the country, where agriculture used to give so much employment to agricultural labourers, a part of the country which has received so much assistance by way of subsidies and other public moneys, and bearing in mind what the position in Wexford and South Tipperary is as testified to by responsible persons, does the Minister think that even the present rates of unemployment assistance are <Col N="540" /> rates that can be continued with the economic condition of the country as it is?</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which I desire to draw the Minister's attention because it bears on the question whether it is the urban or the rural areas that are going to be affected by this reduction in the means allowance.  Consider that part of the country that takes in, as employment areas, Letterkenny, Sligo, Ballina, Tralee and West Cork, and that part which comprises practically the whole of the County Donegal, a little bit of Leitrim, Mayo, the greater part of Galway, Kerry and West Cork.  You have a population there which is about 25 per cent. of the total population of the country. The unemployment figures for the past 12 months in these areas and the payments to persons drawing unemployment insurance benefit, show that this is a part of the country that deserves some special reference from the Minister when dealing with any amendment of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The people there, as I have said, represent 25 per cent. of the total population of the country. During the year beginning May last, unemployment in that area had risen by 73 per cent. as against 8.3 per cent. for the whole country.  That population, representing 25 per cent. of the total population of the country, contains 45 per cent. of the total number of persons drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should tell us what he thinks the effect of this measure is going to be on that area because it seems to me to be an area that requires some kind of serious attention.  Unemployment assistance is, apparently, going to be required to a very considerable extent in that area.  Would the Minister say what effect the present proposals are going to have on it?  So far as one can see the position in the rest of the country is not such as to warrant any one in coming to the conclusion that it is going, in any way, to draw on the number of persons who are at present <Col N="541" /> in receipt of unemployment assistance in that area; nor does there appear to be any development that is going to provide them with work, either in connection with agriculture or industry.  At the bottom of the whole business is this, that we have just finished dealing with a Budget which Deputy Norton credits the Minister for Finance with calling a War Budget. I think the only Budget the Minister for Finance termed a War Budget was his first Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the words were put into his mouth.  That will be found to be so, because at the beginning of this year he told us in his Budget speech that we would be approaching in the next budgetary year normaley in the way of Budgets. He said subsequently that that did not refer to the Budget of this year but to the Budget of next year.  If the Budget of next year is going to bring us normalcy, except there is a radical change in the whole policy of the Ministry, I do not see that it will be in any way better than the Budget of this year.  This is leading to a situation which is going to require more and more assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act, with less capacity on the part of the people to bear it.  It is for that reason it is desirable that the Minister, when putting this measure before the House, should have told it what has been his experience of the administration of the Act, and to size up really what the position is of those who have applied for unemployment assistance; whether it is really getting better, and whether he sees anything in the general situation which will reduce the burden of this Act on the people as a whole.  He will find very few agree that expenditure is not going to grow while week after week the people will be less able to bear <Col N="542" /> the expenditure.  Introducing this Bill now and tinkering with the applications for this money for another twelve months is only going to lead the Minister into the position that it may be too late to start explanations or to start applying any remedies of this kind.  While this Bill is under discussion, he should take the opportunity to tell us something of what has been happening, and to disclose what has been the experience of himself and his officials in the administration of the original Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>After the principal Act came into operation we were promised this amending legislation time and again, and many of us hoped that there would be something in it which would bring a measure of relief to the unemployed. Deputy Norton described this measure very properly in his opening remarks.  The only thing about it is that it is increasing the machinery for dealing with appeals against the assessment of means.  There is nothing in it to prevent what I must describe as the conscription of farm labourers to go and work for farmers for less remuneration than they would get if they were not working.  Under the original Act a man in the rural areas was entitled to 6/- a week.  That class of men are being sent in scores from the different labour exchanges to work for farmers at 4/- and 5/- a week, and if they refuse to do so they find themselves suspended from benefit under the regulations.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to do something on behalf of these people. Another question arises concerning the non-payment of arrears of benefit, arising out of a favourable decision on an appeal against the assessment of means.  I had a case recently where a man appealed against the assessment of means.  The decision was a bad one for him, inasmuch as it was decided that he was not entitled to any benefit. Under the amending legislation I understand it is provided that in a case of that kind a claim will be made for repayment of any benefit that was drawn.  I submit to the Minister that something should be done to ensure that when there is a decision favourable <Col N="543" /> to an applicant he should receive the arrears of unemployment assistance. The assistance rates generally are scandalously low, and, in most cases, are below the rates payable by boards of assistance.  The amending measure provides for unemployment assistance for invalids over 18 years of age.  Unless the Minister is going to increase the rates of benefit I think it would be better not to have that provision at all, because most of these people are receiving 4/- or 5/- weekly from boards of assistance.  They will receive a much lower rate under this measure.  After waiting for many months for this amending measure this opportunity should be taken to show that the Government are really serious about amending the present law in the interests of the unemployed, and that something will be done to remove the discontent that exists among these unfortunate people.  If not, I venture to suggest that the Minister will feel himself compelled by the increasing discontent to bring in a further amending Bill at an early date.  He should avail of this opportunity to do so, and to save himself the trouble of having to do it later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than surprised at the Government and the Minister sponsoring such a Bill.  Certainly the unemployed are displeased with this measure.  They are disappointed at the inconsistency of the Executive Council in introducing a means test for the unemployed, while it makes a capitation grant of 7/6 for children sent to reformatories, in addition to a grant of 5/- or 6/- weekly paid by the local authorities.  That means that one individual living in a community represents something like 12/6 weekly for maintenance, while a means test is brought in to reduce the allowance to the unemployed, owing to the fact that a few shillings may be going into the house.  There are complaints in the rural areas against the attitude adopted by the Department towards tenants or owners of labourers' cottages.  A sum of 2/- weekly was assessed upon the tenancy, because the half-acre was tilled, while the rent paid to the local authorities for the <Col N="544" /> cottage was 1/3 a week.  I realise that the unemployed have no other alternative but to organise in such a manner that they will receive better treatment than they are offered in this Bill.  There were great hopes that there would be some redress for men unable to procure employment.  Now we find that this Bill is to be used&mdash;not as the Minister intended&mdash;as some employers in rural areas think, so that they can refuse to pay recognised wages.  While attacking and criticising the Government for giving relief to the unemployed, they are using the machinery of the Government, as a pretence to try to prevent men from receiving unemployment assistance, by offering them work at 5/- or 6/- a week in rural areas.  They are the farmers who were attacking the Government and the Government are assisting them, as employers, in depriving these men of unemployment assistance.  When a labourer refuses to work for 5/- or 6/- a week, the farmer reports him to the labour exchange and his benefit is suspended.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I should like to bring before the Minister.  A man may be engaged on relief schemes.  He may already have his qualification certificate. His work on relief schemes may last for three or four weeks.  He goes back to unemployment benefit because he has stamps on his card. Notwithstanding that he has a qualification certificate, he may have to wait for a month if he is in a rural area before he receives any payment on account of the stamps to his credit. During that time, home help has to be given to him.  His unemployment benefit is exhausted after the first week and he has to wait for another fortnight or three weeks until the unemployment assistance machinery has completed its work.  In the meantime, he has to go back to home help.  When a man has a qualification certificate and when the Department had three weeks or a month, in the first instance, to examine his claim, I submit that there should not be a further delay of three weeks in giving him unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I am merely pointing out what has happened.  Instead of unemployment assistance, home help has had to be given to these men.  As Deputy Doyle pointed out, public bodies reduced their estimates believing that the unemployed were going to receive assistance from the State.  Public bodies are now unable to obtain overdrafts to give allowances to unemployed men.  We have a deputation going to the Minister for Local Government to show that the county council is unable to give the usual allowance to the Board of Health.  Some of these farmers who, by their wage-cutting tactics, were trying to force a larger number of men on home help and cripple the public bodies are responsible for depriving the unemployed of home help by not paying their rates; and, secondly, by taking advantage of Government machinery and reporting to the labour exchange men who refused to work at a small wage.  The farmers have it both ways.  They are refusing to pay their rates.  Hence there is no home help.  They offer employment at a small wage.  Hence there is no unemployment assistance for rural workers.  Apart from that, there is unnecessary delay.  Take the case of County Wicklow.  How many thousands of appeals are awaiting decision in that area?  I have heard of small farmers in other parts of Ireland receiving this donation.  We cannot say that of our area because it is very hard for a genuine worker who is unemployed, after working on the roads, to get unemployment assistance owing to these unnecessary delays.  There are cases in my constituency which have been awaiting decision by the Department for one and a half years.</P>

      <P>I hope it will, but we have heard the Minister state what <Col N="546" /> the previous Bill was going to do.  He said it was going to relieve the position of public bodies.  He said that the State was accepting the duty of maintaining the unemployed.  There was no talk of these formalities which have caused so much unnecessary delay. There was no talk of the thousands of cases held up on appeal.  There was no talk of the position of the occupant of a labourer's cottage from whom a deduction is made on account of his half acre of land.  That is the position in my constituency.  I do not know if that is typical of the rest of the country.  It is on this Bill, and not on the Old Age Pensions Bill, that you are going to save £300,000.  This is the thin end of the wedge.  As Deputy Pattison pointed out, other Governments have been forced to cease from interference with the rates of benefit to men who may have a few shillings a week coming into their houses, through the wages of a daughter or a son.  The means test was abolished in other countries owing to the influence of the workers and unemployed.  If this Bill does nothing else it should encourage the unemployed to organise and secure that the wish of the citizens will be carried out and that they will not be subjected to the dictation of permanent officials of the Government who are laying down the policy of the Executive Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett seems to have a great grievance against the farmers.  That was the sum total of his speech against the Bill.  He spoke about farmers paying small rates of wages.  Of course they are.  And why? Does Deputy Everett think that the farmer is in a position now to pay a decent rate of wages?  Did not his leader talk a moment ago about a war being on?  Are the farmers to be the only persons to suffer in connection with that war?  It would be much better if the Deputy faced up to the facts.  Everybody regrets that any man should be under the necessity of going to the labour exchange.  There is one industry on which the Minister could be congratulated, and that is the industry surrounding the labour exchanges.  I cannot subscribe to the <Col N="547" /> statement made by the Minister recently that there were 25,000 or 35,000 more persons employed in agriculture now than there used to be.  Deputy Everett would hardly subscribe to that statement either.  We might as well admit that abuses in connection with unemployment assistance have been going on up and down the country. Men have been working, drawing fair rates of wages and, at the same time, receiving unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that it would be my duty to report such an occurrence, that I would be a bad citizen if I did not report that a man was receiving wages and, at the same time, obtaining money from the labour exchange. It is not my duty to administer the law.  The Government have their servants to do that.  But there have been abuses in connection with the unemployment assistance scheme and these were not in the cases in which paltry wages of from 4/- to 6/- a week were being paid.  It would be just as well if there were a tightening up of the administration.  I know genuine cases in which it was not possible to obtain unemployment assistance. It seems to me that the people who got away in this matter, were the cleverest people and not the genuine people.  I had various complaints in connection with genuine cases and I put down questions about them. There is certainly a genuine grievance in connection with the delay which occurs in these cases.  That is regrettable, and if this Bill would only have the effect of remedying such a situation and putting into effect these things which I have mentioned, which everybody realises were absent from the principal Act, it will certainly achieve something.  As the situation is at present, people have spoken to me about not being able to get unemployment assistance, and my advice to them was to bring the Minister into court in connection with it and not to have any more nonsense about it. People have complained to me about it and put up a reasonable statement, such as that, for one reason or another, a man who was fishing once <Col N="548" /> upon a time and was supposed to have a certain income out of it, cannot get any unemployment assistance now that he is no longer fishing.  That is regrettable, and I hope that this Bill will do something to remedy that situation and give assistance to the people who are genuinely entitled to it with greater expedition than the principal Act gives it.</P>
    <P>It is just as well for people to face the fact that farmers are not able to pay the wage.  How could they? Deputy Everett and his colleagues should realise that and should do something which would make it possible once more for farmers to give reasonable wages.  If Deputy Everett and his colleagues would do that, the farmers would give reasonable wages, as they did before and as they always have done, so far as it was possible for them to do so. Farmers were never millionaires in this country and they never will be, but they were always willing to pay when they could.  Deputies are aware of the statement in the Press of the Commissioner of South Tipperary.  I had nothing to do with it.  He is an official of the Minister.  Various questions were put to various officials under him as to what was the cause of the irregular payments of rents of labourers' cottages.  Deputy Mulcahy made reference to that statement before, and I need not stress it any more.  At any rate, it is public property. Mind you, that is one thing that the Minister or the members of the Labour Party cannot say: that it is we over here who do it.  It is there in the Press for everybody to see: that labourers in the country are unemployed; and I am sorry to have to subscribe to the fact, as it was stated there in connection with the inquiry that labourers there had to wait for their wages.  That is the situation, and I think that Deputies on the Labour benches ought to realise it and to apply themselves to remedying it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton, Deputy Pattison and Deputy Everett, expressed, their dissatisfaction with the unemployment assistance scheme as a whole because, they said, the rates of benefit were too low, and because there was a means test of eligibility to receive unemployment assistance at all. They objected on a number of other grounds also.  Deputy Mulcahy was rather inclined to support them in some of these contentions.  It is only a few weeks ago since we had before us the Financial Resolutions designed to secure the revenue without which the unemployment assistance scheme would be impossible; and Deputy Norton and Deputy Pattison and Deputy Everett voted against the majority of these Resolutions.  They voted with Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Mulcahy's colleagues in an attempt to defeat these <Col N="550" /> Resolutions, including one Resolution designed to secure additional revenue by increasing the income tax. If they had succeeded in defeating these Resolutions, there would be no unemployment assistance scheme at all.  Therefore, I think I am entitled to conclude that, in their plea now to have increased rates of benefits paid or various changes made in the Act designed to ease the conditions under which unemployment assistance can be obtained, they are very largely humbugging themselves and, probably, humbugging their supporters.  They are not humbugging me, however, nor are they humbugging members of the Dáil; because, if we did, in fact, adopt their suggestions and followed up the necessary legislation for that prupose with new Financial Resolutions, designed to secure the additional revenue which would then be required, they would vote against these Resolutions just as solidly as they voted against the last Resolutions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said that this is a worthless Bill, and he was followed by Deputy Everett, a member of his own Party, who urged, first, that there should be a more expeditious method of disposing of appeals against the decisions of unemployment assistance officers, and, second, that we should abolish the delay which now takes place between the termination of unemployment insurance benefit and the commencement of payment of unemployment assistance.  He also dealt with other matters, all of which are affected by this Bill.  This Bill aims to set up a new method of dealing with appeals and disposing of them very expeditiously&mdash;a method which can be expanded to any extent. <Col N="551" /> so as to enable all the appeals to be dealt with in the shortest possible space of time.  The Bill abolishes entirely the waiting period which heretofore operated between the termination of unemployment insurance benefit payments and the commencement of the unemployment assistance benefit payments. The Bill effects changes which will improve the position of applicants for unemployment assistance.  Yet, Deputy Norton described it as a worthless Bill.  He thinks it is of no value to effect these changes in the unemployment assistance code.  They are worthless, according to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to abolish the system under which a person who got three days' work had to serve an additional waiting period of one week before becoming entitled to benefit.  We allow a person to work for not less than six weeks, and again become entitled to benefit without waiting a day.  It is not possible to give an exact figure, but it is thought that that would cost about £25,000, unless it should happen to work out in such a way as to encourage people to take short periods of employment to a greater extent than in the past, in which case the cost might be less.  We are abolishing that additional waiting period between the termination of unemployment insurance claims and the commencement of unemployment assistance claims.  Again, it is not possible to say exactly what that will cost, but it is estimated that the cost will be fairly considerable.  We are making it possible for a person entitled to unemployment insurance benefit to decline to claim that benefit and to take unemployment assistance instead and allow his unemployment insurance stamps to remain to his credit.  We are extending the definition of dependents, and additional persons now receiving unemployment assistance will be enabled to get increased assistance because of the new dependency clause.  We are providing for alterations which may develop in the boundaries of urban areas, which, if this Bill were not passed, would operate to prevent people in those areas getting unemployment <Col N="552" /> assistance.  That is going to involve increased cost.  Yet all those provisions are described by Deputy Norton as worthless.</P>

Five are going to involve increased expenditure from the Exchequer. Five are devised to ease the position of unemployed persons.  One will operate to effect a saving&mdash;a saving which is perfectly justifiable&mdash;and yet because of that one clause in a Bill of 21 sections Deputy Norton describes the whole lot as worthless.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance scheme is designed, in the main, to provide some measure of State assistance for those persons who are unemployed through no fault of their own, and who have no other means of subsistence.  The class of persons for whom the scheme is mainly intended are those who have nothing else to sell except their labour.  Their position is being improved under this Bill.</P>

They are being given increased facilities for claiming that assistance.  They are being given that assistance more expeditiously than in the past.  They are being enabled to draw that assistance continuously, so long as they are unemployed.  In everything with which this Bill deals, their position has been <Col N="553" /> improved.  In no way has it been worsened.</P>

They are not affected one way or the other, except that the more equitable distribution of the funds available for unemployment assistance which Section 11 provides insures continuity of the unemployment assistance scheme, a scheme which would be jeopardised and might have to be abandoned if half the suggestions which Deputy Norton has made were put into effect.  Here we are operating a new social service; one which never previously existed; which was brought in under circumstances of difficulty last year, and which is costing the taxpayers of this country £1,500,00 every year.  That service was by way of experiment.  It was designed to attempt to give practical effect to the principle that the State had an obligation to provide some means of subsistence for those for whom it was temporarily unable to provide an opportunity of work.</P>

      <P>Because we contemplated that there might be difficulty in the assessment of means of persons coming within the limits prescribed in the original Act, and entitled to unemployment assistance, we allowed <Col N="555" /> a margin of 2/-.  We said that in determining the amount of assistance to be paid we would not count the first 2/- of means as calculated, in order to allow a degree of elasticity. But we recognised at the time that that section was going to operate unfairly.; that it would operate to the detriment of the person who had no means, and for the benefit of the person who had, and that an undue proportion of the total amount which the State had provided for unemployment assistance was going to persons with means, instead of to persons without means as it should have gone We found, in operation, that the margin we had allowed was too great, and that a much narrower margin would provide against whatever possibilities of erroneous calculation did exist, so I am proposing in Section 11 to reduce the uncounted means from 2/- to 1/-, and we are using the additional fund thus provided to effect all the other improvements in the Act, which otherwise would not have been possible because the necessary revenue could not have been raised in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said we were reducing the amount which we considered it necessary for an unemployed person to have in order to maintain himself.  The margin of means fixed in Section 10 of the Principal Act is not being changed.  In that section a person was entitled to a qualification certificate if his means as calculated were less than £52 a year in a county borough, or less than £39 a year elsewhere. That position is not being altered.  Persons with means under those limits will still be entitled to qualification certificates and, if unemployed and otherwise qualified, to draw unemployment assistance.  We are not providing 12/6 or 20/- a week for families to live upon.  The Deputy has an entirely wrong conception of the unemployment assistance scheme if he thinks we consider that those amounts are sufficient to maintain a family week in and week out.  This is a scheme designed to enable people temporarily and involuntarily unemployed to maintain themselves in some <Col N="556" /> way until fresh opportunities of employment offer.  There are very few persons in the country who are unemployed for long periods.  I gave here in the past information secured from an examination of the incidence of unemployment, which shows clearly that the great majority of the persons who on any day are registered as unemployed are going to get employment within a few weeks from that day.  25 per cent. of those who are registered as unemployed to-day will have received employment in the course of two or three weeks, and 50 per cent. will have received employment in the course of six or seven weeks.  It is only a very small percentage indeed of those who are registered as unemployed at any time that is going to remain unemployed for periods, say, exceeding six months. Deputies must not think of the number of persons upon the register of unemployed as the number of persons permanently unemployed.  They are not.  There is a continual change-over; on every day new persons are going upon the register and persons who were on it are going off.  There is continuous fluctuation in the employment position, and the whole purpose of the unemployment assistance scheme, coupled with the Unemployment Insurance Acts, is to provide for those persons during the weeks they are unemployed, between spells of employment, some measure of State assistance to enable them to maintain themselves.  But in fact the unemployed person, or his family, are not expected to maintain themselves permanently upon the rates of unemployment assistance set out in the Schedule to the Unemployment Assistance Act. Deputy Norton asks us also what we hoped to save by the withdrawal of free beef.  Now, it was made quite clear when the free beef scheme was brought into operation that it was only a temporary scheme and that it was designed primarily to deal with the surplus cattle which could not otherwise be disposed of. We thought it better to give that beef free to our own unemployed persons than to give it to other persons outside the country <Col N="557" /> at a subsidised price.  So the free beef scheme was brought into operation and it was continued in operation as long as that surplus of cattle continued. The scheme is not only withdrawn so far as it affects the persons under the Unemployment Assistance Act, but it is withdrawn generally and free beef will not be available for anybody in the future.  It is true that we are inaugurating a cheap beef scheme for the unemployed in substitution for it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Peadar Doyle raised a point the significance of which I could not follow.  He apparently thinks it is undesirable that any person should be deprived of unemployment assistance, even though the unemployment assistance officer considers that person is not genuinely seeking work.  The Deputy thinks he should not be deprived of assistance.  The whole purpose of the Act is to ensure that a person will not get unemployment assistance unless he is genuinely seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister arrive at that decision?  I would like him to give us some illustration as to how it works out.  I may tell the Minister that his officers have turned down cases for relief where we have information that the people are genuinely looking for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is left to the discretion of the unemployment officer on the information that comes to him.  When the applicant is turned down the officer tells him that he has a right to appeal to the Court of Referees.  Half that body are representatives of the workers and half representatives of the employers. Before that court any applicant who is turned down by an officer can bring his appeal, and if he gets a favourable decision from the Court of Referees he will get the unemployment assistance retrospectively. It is the duty of the unemployment officer on every occasion when he <Col N="560" /> believes the applicant for unemployment assistance is not genuinely seeking work to stop the unemployment assistance that the person is being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the point I want to make is this, that the Minister himself must know that cases have been turned down unjustifiably. We have evidence of that in the Dublin Board of Public Assistance, and when such cases are turned down they have to be relieved by our relieving officers.  That is what I want to bring before the notice of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Either these people are properly turned down or they are not. If they are rightly turned down, then certainly they are not entitled to any assistance.  If they are unjustifiably turned down they will become entitled to assistance on appeal and payment will be retrospective.  We are providing that the local public assistance authorities can recover from a successful appellant out of the moneys he is to get under the Unemployment Assistance Act the relief given him by the board of public assistance during the period during which his case was pending.  Deputy Mulcahy asked for some information as to what our experience now of the working of this Act has taught us as to the position of employment in the country.  The Deputy then proceeded to quote figures as between May of last year and May of this year.  He says there has been an increase of 75 per cent. in registered unemployment in western counties during that period.  During that period the Act came into operation, but these figures do not mean that there was any increase in unemployment in the meantime.  The figures mean that the efficient registration of the unemployed and underemployed was effected for the first time.  The Act came into operation in May last year, and an additional number of people got registered because of that Act.  The free beef scheme came into operation in August and as a result of that again a large number of additional people <Col N="561" /> registered in order to get unemployment assistance and the free beef, or to get both.  What has happened now is that we have got registered under the Unemployment Act a large number of uneconomic landholders and the sons of uneconomic landholders who are not fully employed on their father's farms.  A class of people have come on the register who were never on it before. Many of them have some way of employment at present, but nevertheless they are desirous of obtaining work and are seeking better employment than they have.  That is why these people are on the register.  There is no possible basis for a comparison between that register and the register of last year or the year before that, or the register that existed four years ago.  Each register was compiled on an entirely different basis and any comparison is bound to be misleading.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Norton stated, out of the 100,000 people receiving unemployment assistance roughly 75,000 are persons held to have means of some kind.  The great majority of them are, of course, landholders or persons working for their relatives on the land, and only the balance, the persons without means, are those who in the past were regarded as unemployed in the real sense.  As I have frequently pointed out here, there is no evidence whatever of any increase in unemployment.  All the evidence points to a decrease in unemployment. There has been very definitely an increase in employment, an increase which is recorded in all available statistics published by anybody in relation to the employment situation, including an increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture, not merely in those employed working on their relatives' farms, but also an increase in those employed for wages, both temporarily and permanently. Deputy Curran cannot deny that, because we have counted them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran made the most extraordinary and scandalous statement.  He stated that he knew that in certain parts of the country there was collusion to defraud the revenue; that persons were being employed for wages and being allowed to draw unemployment assistance at the same time.  He said that he knew I was going to tell him that it was his duty to report such cases; but he did not consider it his duty to assist in the administration of the law.  If that statement were made by some person outside the House with no knowledge of his duty, with no sense of civic responsibility, with no sense of decency, one might understand it.  But that a person who claims to be a representative of the people, a member of a responsible Party in this House, should make a statement that he did not consider it his duty to prevent fraud upon the revenue, to report information of criminal acts to the proper authority is a most extraordinary position.</P>

Any legislation of this kind, to be made effective must be operated with the co-operation and the good-will of all the citizens.  If there is any substantial body of people, including persons claiming to be representatives of the people, who do not consider it their duty to render that co-operation and to report frauds when they know of them, then legislation of this kind will become impossible.  I am thankful that Deputy Curran is probably the only member who would commit himself to such a scandalous statement and that the view expressed is not held by .001 per cent. of the population.</P>

      <P>It is not; it is as old as the Christian religion.  To get back to more important matters.  I do not know if there was anything else said that it is necessary to deal with at this stage.  Some of the points raised were obviously Committee points and can be discussed when the relevant sections are put from the Chair in Committee. I merely want to emphasise that this Bill is, in my opinion, one designed to effect a number of improvements in the Unemployment Assistance Act; that it is going to ease the position of persons who are, unfortunately, compelled to avail of the unemployment assistance scheme in many ways; that it is going to make that scheme itself more workable, and because it makes it more workable, is going to increase the chances of its being a permanent feature in our scheme of social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although certain Deputies expressed opposition to the Bill the only one section that they expressed any view against was Section 11, and Section 11 is not merely necessary but it is in itself just that that alteration in the original Act should be made in order to ensure that, of the money which the people of the country are able to make available for unemployment assistance, the greater part of it should go to those who are most urgently in need of it.  In my opinion, <Col N="565" /> persons without means, who have nothing else to sell except their ability to work, and who, when not working, have no means whatever, are much more entitled to our help and much more in need of our help than persons who, whether working or not, have, nevertheless, means to help them to carry on.  The reduction in the uncalculated means provided by Section 11 makes possible the other changes in the main scheme which this Bill is designed to effect, changes which are going to benefit considerably the other sections to which I referred.  I am quite prepared at any time to justify the amendment to Section 17 of the principal Act effected on the grounds that it is part of the general scheme embodied in the whole measure.</P>

There is no doubt that a certain amount of these Land Commission annuities have since been collected.

      <P>It has been the custom to review the situation a few times during the year, to take stock of the amounts outstanding and the amounts paid, in the different counties where annuities are outstanding.  I think that sums in respect of land annuities are outstanding in every county.  That review will be carried out this year as it was last year and an effort will be made to get from the Exchequer an accounting, first of all, and to get as substantial a sum as possible from the Exchequer towards meeting the claims of the county <Col N="567" /> councils and towards relieving them. Undoubtedly, in many cases, additional charges in the way of extra rates have had to be borne by these counties as a result of the failure to pay annuities. It would be my desire, at any rate, to get as much as possible of the money that has been collected at an early date. I cannot fix any date in that matter but when the time for review does come, I shall endeavour to get as much as possible and to have it divided amongst the various county councils, probably <i>pro rata</i> to the amounts collected in these counties.</P>

I understand that the rates have been prepared in such a way that the additional £718,000 has been charged to the ratepayers.  If a substantial amount of that money has been collected in the meantime, does not the Minister think that an arrangement should be made under which credit notes would be issued to the ratepayers so as to reduce the amount of rates they would have to pay?</P>

      <P>In some counties the county councils did not impose a rate sufficient to cover the amount that was lost to them, temporarily at any rate, as a result of the failure to pay annuities in these counties.  In some counties they put on very little to meet the liability that accrued in that way. However, that is by the way.  As to how this money, if we can get it, can be credited to individual ratepayers, that is a matter I shall have to take up with the Department.  I do not know whether the suggestion the Deputy makes would be practicable at this stage or not, but it is a suggestion I shall put before the Department if and when we get the money.</P>

      <P>I do not agree, Sir.  Again, I think the Minister should address himself to this subject.  He knows as well as anybody else the position in which the agricultural community is placed.  At the danger of repetition, I would point out what I have brought before him on other occasions. The Minister quite recently instructed his Commissioner in South Tipperary to find out why certain rent collectors were failing to collect all the rents in respect of labourers' cottages in the area.  A week or so ago, the Press reported that four of these collectors reported to the Commissioner that they could not hope to collect these rents.  The first reported that he could not do it, because the labourers had not the money and that the average wages they received was 8/- to 10/- per week.  The second reported that a number of labourers depended on home assistance or unemployment assistance for their maintenance.  A third reported that the farmers in his area were in such a condition that many of them were six months in arrears in paying their labourers' wages.  A fourth pointed out that certain industries that existed formerly in farmers' houses had since been discontinued and that the labourers had no income. That is simply a reflex of the condition of the agricultural industry in general.  It is in a year in which these things are brought directly under his notice from an area like South Tipperary&mdash;conditions that are only indicative of the position in many parts of the country, and that have been explicitly brought to the notice of the Executive Council in other counties, notably in Wexford&mdash;it is in a year in <Col N="570" /> which such conditions manifest themselves that the Minister is reducing the amount of money that is to be given in relief of rates on agricultural land.  We had a long discussion on various aspects of the Budget on Committee Stage the other day, and it was brought to a close unceremoniously by a three-days guillotine motion.  This is part of the Budget taxation.  It is taking £100,000 out of the pockets of the ratepayers of the country to patch up the financial situation the Minister for Finance is dealing with.  It is being taken from that section of the community who are bearing the brunt of the Minister's economic war.  This additional taxation of £100,000 comes on top of £117,000 in the shape of rates extracted from another section of the agricultural community to meet particular payments in respect of land annuities for the particular reasons disclosed by the rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make some statement in connection with this section.  The Minister, being at the head of the Local Government of the country, should try to look matters fairly and squarely in the face, and put a stop to this demand for £100,000 from the agricultural community. The stopping of this £100,000 can have only one result, and that is to lead to the breakdown, or partial breakdown, of local services throughout the country.  The Minister must have his reports from his own officials in Tipperary as to what is happening. The same is happening all over the country.  The Minister must realise that it is unfair and unjust, and must have a very detrimental effect on the local government services of the country to stop this £100,000 from them.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Local Government is taking this course on the initiative of the Minister for Finance.  I believe that is the pivot on which the whole thing hangs.  I appeal to the Minister who has these things in his control not to allow this state of affairs to continue. He is charged with the administration of the public services.  He ought to realise that the particular section <Col N="571" /> of the community affected are unable to meet these demands.</P>
      <P>I pointed out before, and I would like to point out again, that it is not that rates are not being paid.  There are some rates which are being paid by the farmers in South Tipperary even better than ever before.  This deduction this year in the Agricultural Grant is made to make good the non-payment of land annuities which is a course, simply shifting back the burden on to the farmers.  I said before it was time to divorce this question of the non-payment of the Agricultural Grant from the non-payment of the land annuities.  The Minister then said it would require legislation to do that.  But even so we can enact legislation pretty rapidly in this House.</P>

      <P>When it is a question that affects the amelioration of the farming community the Government are very slow about it.  I would remind the Minister that when his Party were on this side of the House they professed great sympathy for the over-burdened farmers, and they professed their readiness not only to reduce rates but to wipe them out altogether.  What have they done since they came into power?  They have piled up additional rates upon the community and, now, they are stopping £100,000 from the Agricultural Grant.  We all want to see the social services of the country carried on.  Having been engaged for many years in local government affairs I say the people are making the very strongest efforts they can to meet their obligations in connection with the payment of rates.  But when the burden is too great and the demands are too heavy you cannot expect the people to be able to meet them.  I ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to look seriously into this matter and even if it needs legislation to divorce one from the other, it ought to be done and done without delay.</P>

      <P>I know the position as well as anybody.  I know it as well as Deputy Curran, who is more intimate with the farming community than I am.  I say honestly, were it not for the campaign for the non-payment of annuities there would not be in certain counties rates due which are due there this year.  In counties where that campaign was for a time successful, and where they have had additional rates upon them, in consequence of that campaign, the rates in many cases have since been paid, but they are paid at more expense to the individuals and to the State itself.  That expense comes back again upon the individuals or the State in one form or another.  Deputy Curran knows that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the latest illustration&mdash;the County Westmeath.  It was the most backward of the Twenty-Six Counties in the payment of its rates.  Then, when the County Council was got rid of, and a Commissioner appointed, the rates came in without the asking.  In a few weeks after the Commissioner was appointed, payments came in at a rate not previously known in the <Col N="573" /> County Westmeath.  The money is there, and there is no difficulty in getting the rates collected when the ratepayers know they must be paid. The ratepayers were well able to pay, and there is the general belief that the Council had stopped the ratepayers from paying up.  The same is true of South Tipperary and of other counties. The rates are higher in some counties than they would normally be, because of the position created there&mdash;that is going back some years&mdash;but we are getting back to normal.  Next year the rates will have to meet the annuities position where it exists, and there is no intention, so far as I know, of altering the law with regard to the guarantee.  The late Government operated that section of the Land Act and penalised various counties where there was default of payment.  There was then no demand from Deputy Mulcahy or from Deputy Curran for an alteration of the law.</P>

At that time the full amount of the annuities had to be paid.  Now the amounts to be paid are only half what they were then.</P>

      <P>These deductions have to be made so long as the law remains as it is.  I see no reason for any change in the law in the near future.  Therefore, these deductions will continue to be made.  The loss will be the loss of the counties and the individuals concerned.  They will have to bear the additional cost of collecting the rates in the way that they are being collected.  As regards the annuities, the losses will be losses suffered by the counties concerned. When these moneys are repaid, the counties concerned will eventually get the benefit.  If the people are wise they will pay their annuities and their rates promptly and not be putting additional expense and trouble on themselves or on the State, which has been obliged to indulge in this expense in the last couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in dealing with this important matter, should not mislead himself by any consideration of a county like Westmeath. Westmeath got rid of the services of a Fianna Fáil county council, and no doubt things are being carried on a little better there now.  It has also to be borne in mind that Westmeath is one of the counties the did not dip very deeply into the Fianna Fáil mess of pottage&mdash;of subsidised crops.  Westmeath is also one of the counties that is peculiar for this: that while it did not take the same amount of subsidies from the public purse for its agriculture, it managed, nevertheless, to add to the number of agricultural labourers given permanent employment there. It also increased the number of agricultural labourers getting temporary employment.  It is not in the same position as, say, Tipprary, where, in spite of subsidies, the number of agricultural labourers permanently employed has been reduced as compared with, say, 1931, and where the additional number of agricultural labourers getting temporary employment is only about half the number that got the same kind of employment in Westmeath during the last three or four years.  Westmeath is also in this position, that its total warrant for last year was less than for the year before, whereas in the case of North Tipperary and South Tipperary the warrant for last year showed an increase of £6,000 in the case of the former and of nearly £30,000 in the case of South Tipperary.  The warrants for both North and South Tipperary must be very much increased this year as a result of the withdrawal of this £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the land annuities, I have no desire to discuss the economic war, but it would be getting away from realities entirely if it were not pointed out that the economic war touches everything that we discuss here.  The Minister has not produced any argument to show why additional taxation to the tune of £100,000 should be put on the ratepayers by the withdrawal of that sum.  Of course the financial situation, the discussion of <Col N="576" /> which the Minister for Finance had to close down in such a summary fashion in the last few days, has to be bolstered up by stretching out the hands of the tax gatherer over the borders of ordinary revenue by taking this additional sum of £100,000 from the taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this is to cut down relief of rates on agricultural land by £100,000.  I wonder by what method of reasoning the Minister can conscientiously support that deduction? When the Minister was out of office he, in common with the whole of his Party, considered that in the situation then existing it was necessary, in order to save agriculture from utter ruin, to remit all rates on agricultural land.  I think it was in the beginning of 1931 that the Fianna Fáil Party introduced a motion here to relieve the rating on agricultural land by the provision of an additional sum of £1,000,000.  It was estimated that, with the other grants, that would relieve the rates on agricultural land to the extent of £2,200,000.  The Minister, during his first year in office, gave, in fact, an agricultural grant totalling £2,200,000.  Now he proposes to cut that down to £1,900,000 or thereabouts.  Is it his case that agriculture does not need relief as much now as it did in 1931, or that poverty has so increased in the country that the Exchequer, in view of its commitments to other sections of the community, cannot afford to grant the same rating relief to agricultural land that his Party considered was the very minimum that should be given to it when they were out of office, and that the Minister actually gave during his first year of office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that the economic war in 1932-33 was not as severe on the people as it was in 1934 or as it is this year.  Not only are conditions made harder every day we carry on the economic war, but the cumulative effect is becoming greater.  I would like to know the arguments for a reduction in the agricultural grant.  I heard the Minister saying that the land annuities had been halved.  He knows perfectly well that they have not <Col N="577" /> been halved.  On paper they have been halved, and, if agriculture was given back the entire amount that the British are collecting by way of special tariffs, I would admit they were halved, but not until then.  The Minister knows that for 20 years there are payments of £600,000 on account of local loans to be met.  He knows that these are being paid to his Department now by local authorities and by individuals.  But he does not pay that money out.  He knows that the British are collecting the £600,000 from agricultural produce.  That £600,000 is an additional burden on agriculture, compared with the time that the Minister said there should be relief of rates on agricultural land to the minimum extent of £2,200,000.  The total amount collected by the British from agriculture is in the neighbourhood of £5,000,000.  That was not being collected by the British when the Minister said that there should be relief of rates to the extent of £2,200,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is reducing the relief for agricultural rating, and I am curious to know what case he will attempt to make for doing so.  His colleague on the Government Benches, the Minister for Education, assured his constituents in Carlow-Kilkenny that when his Party came into power no rates would be charged on agricultural land.  The Minister was at one with him in that, and so were Deputies who are going to vote for this reduction of £100,000 for the relief of agricultural rates.  I took the Minister's speech to mean that when the storm about refusing to pay the annuities has passed, and when we are back to normal, so much will not be withheld, and the Guarantee Fund will not be raided in order to meet deficiencies of land purchase annuities.  The Minister knows very well that the conditions obtaining <Col N="578" /> are responsible for the deficiencies, and for the difficulties that confront local authorities in this respect.  He mentioned that his predecessor allowed that section of the Land Act to operate, and that he insisted on the deficiencies in the Land Purchase Fund being made good out of the Guarantee Fund.  I have an open mind on that. Even if we were back to normal, the time may not have yet arrived when that section could be dispensed with. I concede that.  We all know the local prejudices and difficulties that would confront the Land Commission if it had to collect the annuities directly. It just brings on a certain amount of pressure.  I daresay the idea of the Government, as with their predecessors, and I must admit amongst people closely associated with local government, is that by having the section operating it brings home to the people that any loss by and attempts at conspiracy or boycotting of sales cannot be borne by the Land Commission but must be spread over the community.  I admit that there is a good deal to be said for that, even in normal times, and consequently I am not going to argue it against the Minister or the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will admit that the local authority with which I am associated has faced up to its responsibilities very well.  A couple of months ago it raised a large overdraft which has been since reduced according to the ebb and flow of the rates.  The Minister boasted some time ago that they swept the local elections.  They did not sweep the body with which I am associated, but that body is prepared to co-operate with this or any other Government in carrying on local government.  When it comes to business it is not politics counts.  You cannot do business with politics.  I am assuring the Minister that the body with which I am associated is prepared to co-operate with him or with any Minister, but I say that the conditions under which agriculture is working are such that it is being run at a loss.  I am not now speaking of what are called ranchers.  I am speaking of ordinary working tillage farmers, and mixed <Col N="579" /> farmers, big and small.  I say that there is no margin left and that agriculture is in a considerably worse condition in County Dublin than it has been in the memory of anyone connected with the industry in the county.  There is no need to prove that.</P>
    <P>I will give one instance.  There was a change in the system.  Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Kelly are aware that a similar position confronts people in Meath.  We took a census of the fat stock in County Dublin ready for the butcher this month.  There are slightly over 5,000, and licences for only 411.  When the Minister talked of a grant of £2,200,000 for agriculture, every beast fattened in the county had a licence.  The only hall-mark required was that it should be fat, when any. port in the country would take it and ship it to the British market.  That is not the position now.  We can only ship 411 animals.  What will we do with the others?  The first money for grazing comes to the County Dublin in July, because Dublin is the earliest grass county in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is one of the three or four grass fattening counties, and all we can get for the month of July&mdash;our heaviest month&mdash;is 411, or roughly 4 per cent. of the licences that, it is presumed, will be granted.  I ask the Minister to consider that, which is the practical proposition before us.  Some people will say: &ldquo;Why do you not till your land, and you will not require these licences?&rdquo;  We do till our land, but we could produce in County Dublin enough food for the whole of the Free State.  If every other county did likewise, what would we do with the produce?  Even on these 411 animals, we will pay £6 each.  That £6 had not to be paid when the Minister was shouting that the poor farmer was down and out.  There was a free market and that £6 had not to be paid on the 5,000 or whatever the number was.  Not only that, but there was a free market for various other lines which we exported from County Dublin. There is no free market now.  I should like to hear from somebody on the <Col N="580" /> Government Benches some justification for this proposal.  There is no justification on the ground that we have got commensurate relief otherwise.  It cannot be shown that we are better off now than we were three or four years ago, and the Minister said then that we could not meet our bills.  Nothing has intervened since to improve our situation.  If the Minister said that the country is so poor now that it must give £300,000 or £400,000 less, he would be telling the truth, and I would agree with him.  That would be a justification for reducing the Agricultural Grant.  I challenge him or any colleague of his to give that excuse.  This is a march, blindfolded, to bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Section 4 put and declared carried.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>(1) In this section&mdash; the expression &ldquo;the qualifying period&rdquo; means the period which began on the 1st day of January, 1934, and ended on the 31st day of December, 1934, and the expression &ldquo;adult workman&rdquo; means a male person who, on the 1st day of January, 1934, was not less than seventeen years of age nor more than seventy years of age and who was not and whose wife was not, at any time during the qualifying period, the rated occupier of agricultural land the valuation or the aggregate of the valuations of which during the qualifying period was equal to or greater than five pounds.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Brennan, I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 30, to delete all words after the words &ldquo;seventy years of age&rdquo; to end of sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, it would mean that the employment allowance would not be made to a farmer in respect of a male person employed, if that person or his wife was at any time during the qualifying period the rated occupier of agricultural land the valuation of which was equal to or greater than £5. It seems to me that a small farmer with <Col N="581" /> a valuation of £5, or a little more, would in nearly every part of the country in present circumstances be entitled to get some kind of benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I should like the Minister to verify that.  Here, the Minister says to a farmer: &ldquo;You will not get the benefit of the employment allowance if you engage on your farm a person who, though looking for agricultural work, is the owner of a holding of a valuation of £5 or more, or whose wife is such.&rdquo; I think that that is a very unreasonable restriction to place on farmers in regard to the selection of their own employees.  It seems to me extraordinary that a person who is probably entitled to some grant under the Unemployment Assistance Act should be prejudiced in respect of employment by a proposal like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment were adopted, it would mean that the rated occupier of a holding of a valuation up to £20 could get the allowance on his own holding and work for somebody else who would also get the allowance in respect of his employment.  I do not think that that would be fair. I heard the Deputy comment earlier to-day on the number of unemployed agricultural labourers.  I think that it would be fairer that the occupier of a £5 holding should get the allowance which is to be given him under the Bill and work his own holding and that the person who wants additional assistance should take people who have not holdings of their own than that people who have holdings which might be valued up to £20 should be employed.  The idea underlying the Bill is that the holding should be judged according to the number of persons who get a living out of it, whether they be members of the owner's family or his employees, and that every holder should get an equitable share of the amount allowed under this section.  The adoption of the amendment would not, I think, improve the Bill.  It would have the opposite effect, in my opinion.  We will get a more just distribution of the money available by adhering to the terms of the section.  Agricultural labourers would not, if this amendment were <Col N="582" /> passed, have the employment available to them that would otherwise be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was any use in the Minister saying that my proposal would allow people, who would become automatically entitled to their primary grant, to leave their own holding, or earn the grant in respect of their own holding, and then go and work on somebody else's holding.  The proposal means just what it says there: that is, to prevent a situation arising by which a person, who has a holding of, say, £5 5s. valuation, is prejudiced in respect of getting employment by a provision which is called an employment allowance. The Minister knows that the difference between the primary allowance and the supplemental allowance last year was only 2/-, practically, for every county; so that the, as you might say, unwarranted income that a person of £5 valuation might get, when you take into account the difference between the supplemental and the primary grant, would be a little over £5 at 2/- a £.  In other words, the difference would be 10/- and, because he gets 10/- more than he would get on his valuation on the supplemental grant, he is to be precluded and prejudiced from getting employment by, say, some local farmer who was induced to take some other person in his place so that he could get the particular relief in rates he would get under the employment allowance.  It must be remembered that the man who is prejudiced here, more than likely, is a person for whom, by reason of his position there, the State has provided unemployment assistance&mdash;one of these people who, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was declaring the other day, has been suddenly thrown on our political screen through the Unemployment Assistance Act, great numbers of whom in the West of Ireland and other places came on our register and are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that what the Minister is proposing is wrong.  There might be some question as to the limit to be proposed, and it may be that the limit would be required to be put there, but whatever the Minister might substitute as a <Col N="583" /> limit there would not drive him to consider what the effect of this unemployment allowance has been at all.  However, perhaps we shall have a word to say about that on the section.  I submit, however, that it is utterly wrong to have a provision in the Bill that prejudices a person, for whom the State has provided unemployment assistance, because he is not sufficiently employed.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment is to delete any reference to the valuation.  I think that the point made by Deputy Harris is that a man with a certain valuation will surely have a bit of work to do for himself and cannot go into employment for the whole year, and that if he is not a full-time man there is no relief.  Accordingly, I think that Deputy Harris's comments on this <Col N="584" /> are 100 per cent. in favour of the amendment.  In any case, I do not think there could be any abuse of that allowance that would make it worth while for the Minister to enshrine it in an Act.</P>

      <P>I think that, in justice, it is necessary to have that limitation there.  I see Deputy Belton's point, but it does not exclude any <i>bona fide</i> and genuine agricultural labourer form employment if his valuation is under £5.  If his valuation is over £5 he would not call himself an agricultural labourer.  I think that in most of the counties of Ireland a man with a holding of a valuation of over £5 would call himself a farmer and not an agricultural labourer.  Of course he might go, in some periods of the year, to work for a farmer with a larger holding in the neighbourhood, but then he would not be entitled.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what is the average valuation of holdings in the whole country.  As my information goes, the average valuation is somewhere about £10, although some holdings are as low as £1 and, of course, we know that in some of them the valuation would be up to hundreds of pounds.  In this connection, I think that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney made a case last year both against the age of 70 years and against the retention of £5 as the limitation.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney mentioned some cases where men of 70 years of age were employed and could get better employment than anything they might make out of their own farms.  He had in mind the cases of men who were accustomed to go to fairs for an employer, and things of that sort.  He pointed out that these men were very suitable for that work and that, in certain cases, they had never worked on their own farms. <Col N="585" /> There was another case in the West, which was brought to my notice, where a man with a holding of his own was employed continuously by another farmer in the district.  The farmer in question had from six to ten men employed, but this one particular man, with a small holding of a valuation of between £5 and £10, was the most suitable man for his work.  In such a case, I suggest that it would hardly be just, either to the man or to the farmer concerned, that he would not be regarded as one of those entitled to get employment on the land.  In the first place, that man is essential to the farmer, and whatever advantage the farmer may get under this measure would not justify him in dispensing with the man's services.  On the other hand, the farmer is giving that man employment all the year round, and still he is not entitled to get this reduction in the rates.  The result is that it creates a good deal of discontent and dissatisfaction all around.  In these two cases, the position is that these are practically the two best men they have got and they are not entitled to get the reduction to which the employment they are giving really entitles them.  In these two cases, then, there is certainly an inequitable provision in the Act, and I think the Minister ought to reconsider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the question of valuation will adjust itself.  Unless there is full-time employment, there is no benefit.

      <P>I suggest that the case which the leader of the Opposition has put up is probably an exception. I imagine there would not be many cases, if you take the whole country, where a man having a holding of over £5 valuation would prefer to go around and work for somebody else. The Deputy has a case or two in mind, but I think they would be exceptions. I am not closely acquainted with agriculture myself, and do not know what the conditions would be in counties where those holdings are in the majority. Take Donegal, for instance.  I think 85 per cent. of the holdings in Donegal would be under £10 valuation. I do not know how many there are in Mayo, but probably about 80 per cent. would be under £10 valuation.  The number of men in those small holdings who would be prepared to give up their holdings and work as whole-time employees for somebody else would surely be very small, and the number who would be prepared to do that over the whole country would also be very small.  Therefore, if there is any hardship on anybody I would say it is infinitesimal, and no <i>bona fide</i> agricultural labourer is being excluded.  A man on a holding of £5 valuation would regard himself as a small farmer and not as an agricultural labourer.  There are men unquestionably on holdings with a valuation of £5, or maybe more, who have special qualifications&mdash;they may, perhaps, be good after horses, or good as ploughmen&mdash;and who will work for neighbours during a period of the year, but the period during which they work for neighbours would not entitle a labourer to claim unemployment allowance in any case, so there is, therefore, nothing lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, the idea I take it behind this employment allowance is to make use of the Agricultural Grant to try and increase agricultural employment in the country.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has anything to say with regard to the effect of the grant in that respect?  At first when we got the 1933 figures for agricultural employment and now when we have got the 1934 figures we have been pointing out in spite of the huge subsidies to certain classes of crops in the country that there is very little increase in agricultural employment and particularly <Col N="589" /> very little increase in the province in which we might expect the greatest increase&mdash;that is Leinster. There were 158 fewer employed in the province of Leinster in 1934 than in 1931 in spite of the fact that the greater part of the subsidised crops is grown in the province of Leinster. With this employment allowance in addition now, it seems to me that the amount of the primary grant in respect of relief of rates on agricultural land generally all over the country amounted to £2 per head of the total population engaged in agriculture. The employment grant in Leinster, that part of the country which was the place where this subsidised employment was given to agricultural labourers, amounts to an additional £1 per head of the population engaged in agriculture.  It diminished in Mayo to £1 for eight people and in Leitrim to £1 for nine people.  A sum of £1 in respect of every person engaged in agriculture has been put into the province of Leinster.  It has been put in in this forced way as an inducement to persons to employ labour.  That inducement added to these subsidised crops has brought us this result that there are 158 fewer persons employed in the province.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the effect of this as an inducement to employ people at all?  It does not appear to have this effect.  It appears to be a family allowance in respect of the male members of the family of farmers in fairly reasonable circumstances.  The person who has a valuation of less than £20 will not get this relief.  The farmer with the valuation of £20 and upwards gets this additional relief in respect of every male member of his family or of his permanent employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we consider the figures that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has given in respect of agricultural employment in the country as a whole we will see the position.  The Minister tells us that there were 16,000 more people employed in agriculture in 1934 than in 1931, but 15,000 of these are members of the farmers' own families. I wonder what has happened?  The <Col N="590" /> farmer with a valuation of £20 and upwards has every male of his family stuck down on the list as engaged in agriculture.  Is not that what has happened? It has brought about this increase in the number of people employed. This employment allowance has been the inducement given to the farmer to do this.  But so far as Leinster is concerned where this was supposed to make the greatest impression, the result seems to be little. Indeed it seems to be nil in respect of the permanent employment of labour.  I would like to hear the Minister on this subject.  It seems to me that the Minister has started the idea of a family allowance for the male members only of the farmers who are in fairly good conditions.  This to my mind is certainly a novel point at which to start the idea of a family allowance, but I do not think there is anything but a family allowance in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If there had been a considerable decrease in agricultural employment we would have heard a great deal about it.  It would have been given here as another evidence of the collapse of agriculture, and those interested in propagandising the features of the agricultural situation would have been very vocal on the subject. But Deputy Mulcahy, in the figures he has quoted, and despite all he has said about the calamitous condition of agriculture in the country, has failed to show that there has been a calamitous fall in employment in the agricultural industries.  They do not deny the fact that in certain areas there has been an increase in agricultural employment.  It was only last year that for the first time this system of bounties on the employment of labour on agricultural holdings was introduced.  The figures for last year were the first figures we had, and, therefore, there is no real basis of comparison.  Even these figures that we have would require to be checked by the local authorities.  They have been checked, I presume, by those who have made the census, but the first year their checking was not probably as close as it might have been.  I am <Col N="591" /> satisfied that after a few years' working of this scheme, when year after year the returns will be made by the occupiers of the various holdings, there will be an opportunity given of checking these figures and it will be shown despite the depressed conditions of agriculture in this as in most countries the world over, that the consequent reduction in employment that might be expected to follow considerable depression of that kind and which might be expected to exist here as elsewhere, will have been shown to be abated as a result of the system adopted here.  It will have abated as a result of one of the methods used to encourage the agricultural community.  I only wish that the subsidy for employment could be greater.  I do not know that the subsidy, such as it is, is a very great encouragement, but it possibly is some encouragement and some relief to the agricultural community in general. Possibly, when conditions are better the farmers will not need encouragement of this kind.  But I think the principle is a good one, and although the amount available to encourage and support the principle is not extravagantly generous, still I think it is a good principle and should give encouragement, at any rate, to those of the agricultural community who do employ one or more male hands all the year round.  It is an encouragement, to some extent, to keep these in employment all the year round rather than take them on for two or three months at a busy season and then drop them until they are further needed.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that what the Minister has been talking about is not in any way indicative of any change in the amount of employment in the country.  So far as I can gather, the Minister is comparing figures compiled by county councils this year with figures compiled by the county councils last year, and says that in certain areas there is an increase in the number this year.  But that, to my mind at any rate, does not by any means go to show that there has been any real or substantial increase <Col N="592" /> or any increase at all really in agricultural employment.  This provision came into force last year, and a considerable number of employers discovered that they were not entitled last year to a rebate because they were employing men who owned holdings of over £5 valuation.  Of course, what is happening, and what will always happen in a case like this, is that people are simply getting over that by means of little shifts which enable them to get payment for persons who are really owners of holdings of £5 valuation.  It only means a change in the name of the owner of the holding.  Then the person who was not counted last year goes on for this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister is putting employers of labour in this position.  You have a man who has a holding of £5 valuation and you have either to dismiss him or you have to lose any advantage you get under this section.  You give him the choice either of making over his holding to some trustee or else tell him that he will have to go.  Of course, they make them over in a great many instances to some trustee or put them in their wife's name or their son's name, and the man continues to be employed as before.  The putting in of that particular figure of £5 will add, of course, nominally to the figures this year and increase them over the figures for last year.  Then, again, the result of not employing a person over 70 will put men over 70 out of employment, because people are losing thereby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that any bulk of employment that the Minister can show is of persons working upon their own family holdings, and that is merely a matter of book-keeping.  The thing only started last year.  What was going to happen was not clear to people and they did not understand it. The Minister started it very late in he year.  Naturally, it takes a very long time, especially in backward regions, for people to understand a new Act or the notices which may be sent to them by the county council.  This year they are more alive to it and it would be very astonishing if the Minister did not find a very considerable increase. I am always very sceptical as to these statements or as to how it can be <Col N="593" /> verified when a man is returned as working on his father's farm.  How many days has he been working off it. I should like to know?  If the Minister knows this country, and I am sure that by this time he knows a little about rural Ireland, I am sure he knows that there is many a man appearing as working for his father who is working on the roads a good part of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be satisfied that these sort of things will happen, so that any statistics he may produce are absolutely valueless as far as showing the number of persons employed at agricultural labour.  What they do show is that people are beginning to work out in their own minds how they can best take advantage of this provision. Naturally, people who see these particular advantages in the way of reduced rates going are not altogether scrupulous.  People are not always scrupulous when dealing with Government funds.  People are not at all scrupulous as to the accuracy of the returns they make.  The Minister's contention therefore is, to my mind, a very unsound one.  It is not always safe to rely on statistics or on figures, and I think this is a particular example in which figures will prove absolutely nothing as to the amount of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I really think that when we are spending £380,000 in this particular way we ought to go a little beyond the Coué position and examine whether in fact employment is being given as a result of this.  I submit that there is no evidence of it.  I think that a Department like the Local Government Department, which has so much machinery and which is in touch with the position in the country from very many points of view, ought to be able to examine the situation and make up its mind about it.  There is no use in labelling a few things here, there and elsewhere as employment-giving devices if, in fact, that has simply a propaganda effect for a year or two in getting people into the belief that something is being done for them that is not being done.  The Minister must have been away during the discussions <Col N="594" /> in the House for some weeks past or he would have heard a considerable amount about the position of the agricultural workers and the remarkable absence, even in the Minister for Industry and Commerce's figures, of any results in the way of increased employment being given by the very considerable amount of increased subsidies. In the province of Leinster, where in respect of the primary grant they got £2 a head for every one of the population engaged in agriculture, they now get an additional £1.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to realise the conditions upon which that is superimposed.  There were 40,000 additional acres of beet grown in the year 1934 as against 1931 and 73,000 additional acres of wheat.  Two-thirds of the beet was grown in Leinster and a little more than half of the increased wheat crop.  Yet the numbers of the type of person the Minister wants to see increasing in agriculture in the country, the permanently-employed agricultural labourer, have decreased in the province of Leinster.  If the Minister thinks they have increased anywhere else in the country he should look at the figures provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that this year 16,836 persons have been additionally employed in agriculture, but 15,700 of these are members of the farmers' own families. In the province of Leinster, or if you take the area from Louth to Cork which is the area where you have agricultural economy of the kind that would give employment permanently to agricultural labourers, there is not the slightest trace that this employment allowance is increasing the number of persons permanently employed in agriculture.</P>

There is no doubt that people <Col N="595" /> are not always scrupulously honest in filling up these returns.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that it was late last year when this system was introduced.  It was in operation for only part of the year, so that we have no returns with which to compare the figures or the summaries made out of the returns supplied by each county council.  There is nothing with which we can compare them.  We have not got this year's figures.  When we get this year's figures, we will have some basis of comparison.  It is only after two or three years' experience, when we have got all necessary information through the local officers of the county council assisted probably by the Gárda Síochána, and the rate collectors, that we shall have all the required knowledge at headquarters from these sources.  It is only after a few years' examination, taking each year separately for survey or review, that you will get down to accurate figures. Where there have been returns that have not been strictly honestly filled up, they will be eventually discovered. You will then have a check but I do not know how long it will take to arrive at it.  After two years working, you might be able to arrive at some definite decision as to what has been the effect of this new method of allocating the agricultural grant.</P>

      <P>There have been discussions between headquarters and the secretaries of the county councils on these matters, and the secretaries generally, after consultation, have arrived at their own methods of checking these returns.  They have available official machinery to check all the returns that are sent there.  They frequently seek information from the Gárda and they get information from the rate collectors and various other officials of the county councils in the different localities.  Where there is any doubt about the absolute reliability of these returns the returns are sent to the officials with a view to having them <Col N="596" /> checked.  As I said earlier, it cannot be assumed that many farmers would look upon 2/- or 3/- in the £ as an inducement to employ an extra man, but at any rate it is an indication of the desire of the Government to support those who go in for keeping their men all the year round.  I hope that when more money is available, after this principle has been adopted, that the amounts that will be available for distribution under these conditions will be greater and that the returns when they come in at the year's end will show that there has been an improvement in the number of men who have been permanently employed on agricultural holdings all over the Free State. There was a system in operation&mdash;I do not know whether it was a growing system or not&mdash;of taking on men for seasonal work and letting them go afterwards.  That, no doubt, continues at harvest time and other times of the year.  The practice of taking on men and keeping them in employment is one to be encouraged and in so far as this system would encourage it, it is all to the good.</P>

No error, as far as we are aware, has been made.  No error has come to our knowledge.  But in the allocation and special division of the money in different counties it might happen that it might be discovered the following year that somebody was deprived of some small amount.

If the allowance is made and a good rate struck I cannot follow the Minister's argument that the rate of itself would become bad.  Surely the rate is good whether the allowance made to a particular individual is good or not.  It seems to me that if a mistake is made, and that if an individual is not allowed his allowance, then, the amount he overpaid to the county council should be allowed to him in his next year's rate.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The council of a county may if it so thinks fit after a presentation of the relevant facts and conditions of persons unable to meet their rate obligations within the collection year, give credit for the credit note or credit notes (if returned) in carrying forward rates for future collection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to drag the economic war across the situation, but the Minister must know that there are a considerable number of people in the country who have really great difficulty in meeting the demands for rates made upon them.  They have that difficulty whether it be the first moiety or the second.  Whatever he thinks may be the cause of it, the addition to <Col N="601" /> the rates made in respect of each amount of money outstanding in respect to the land annuities is going to make their position additionally difficult. This amendment simply makes it possible for the county councils, on the presentation of the relevant facts and conditions by persons unable to meet their rate obligations within the collection year, to give credit for the credit notes if returned in carrying forward rates for future collection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that as long as people have to meet payments like rates and annuities you will always find some who find it difficult to pay.  You will find others slow; even though they could pay they hold out to the last moment.  With regard to credit notes, it is a system adopted by some county councils to encourage people to pay.  If they do not pay before a certain date they forfeit the allowance. If any credit was to be lost it would probably amount to less than £2 a year&mdash;£1 in each moiety.  The point was made against these credit notes that some county councils think it is an unfair system to give to people who can pay an advantage over those who find it difficult to pay and therefore do not use the credit notes.  I have heard all sides and you cannot get anything like an unanimous opinion.  Some were very strongly in favour of the credit note system; others against.  Where it is in operation it is used to encourage people to pay within a certain limited period. If people do not use it they forfeit the amount and it is of no value at all.</P>
      <P>If there is no limit to the time to which the credit note can be used, the credit note is no assistance towards getting in the rates.  Therefore, if there is to be no limit, as suggested in this amendment, and if the credit note can be carried forward and used five years hence when the person pays his arrears, if he does pay them, I think that would be a system which it would not be wise for any Minister to encourage.</P>

      <P>It was only on the 5th December last that the Minister <Col N="602" /> introduced to the Dáil the previous Bill of this kind.  Section 14 of that Bill refers to a person presenting a credit note &ldquo; before the end of the current financial year or such later date as such council, with the consent of the Minister, shall fix.&rdquo;  That is, in the last Bill, the Minister did not fix the thing firmly to the end of the financial year.  He took powers to extend the period in respect of which the credit note would be credited.  His sections in the present Bill are somewhat different in their form from those in the Act, and, as far as we can see, there is no provision&mdash;at least, I have not come across it&mdash;by which the Minister allows an extension either to a county council or to himself.</P>

      <P>It was suggested, after consultation with the secretaries and other officials of county councils, that, where they had been using the credit note system, they were somewhat hampered by the restriction which fixed the last day of the half-year or the year as the last time by which the credit note might be used.  Having discussed the matter with them, I met them by agreeing to put that section to which the Deputy referred into the Act of last year, enabling the Minister, after consultation with local authorities, to extend the period to which the credit note might still be used.  We have not refused any applications during the last financial year or up to the present for extensions, but I am strongly of opinion that it would be unwise to allow the credit note to be brought into operation and used in respect of arrears.  If this amendment be adopted, the credit note might be used for arrears of rates extending over a number of years, and I think the Deputy will agree that that would be a system that would not make for simplicity, at any rate, in handling the accounts of the rate collectors of county councils.</P>

      <P>I suggest that that is an appalling piece of hardship. Just consider the position the ratepayers were in last year.  There were substantially over £1,000,000 of arrears at the close of the financial year. There was a considerable amount of delay in making up the warrants, and while the warrants were being made up, one might say, the first six months of the last financial year of the local authorities was spent, not in collecting the current rates, but in squeezing about £800,000 of arrears of rates out of the ratepayers, and the new warrant was presented to the ratepayers with £300,000 of an extra bill tacked on. They ended the last financial year, a tremendous effort having been made, as the Minister admitted, by the ratepayers to meet their liabilities, with £1,100,000 outstanding.  There was that amount facing the ratepayers at the beginning of this financial year.  I asked the Minister a short time ago what the amount of the assessments and the total warrants for each county were, and he could not give them to me for the reason that he was not aware that they had been completed in some counties.  That was in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that some of the £1,100,000 outstanding at the beginning of the financial year is being collected, and is being collected with a considerable amount of difficulty, throughout the country and before October next, as well as whatever will be collected out of that sum of £1,100,000, half of the increased warrant, a warrant substantially increased by the inclusion in it of a part of £718,000 in respect of land annuities not paid up to the proper time last year, is going to fall for payment.  Unless the whole of that first moiety is paid on 31st October this year, as well as substantial arrears, the credit note is going to be lost to those people who have not paid their moiety.  I submit to the Minister that that is an outlandish proposal and <Col N="604" /> that it is not seriously put before the House.  If the Minister does put it to the House seriously, I think he ought to tell the House what the position now with regard to rate collection is with respect to the arrears from last year; what the position with regard to the issue of the warrants for the rate collection for the current year is; and how much of the arrears of last year is included and how much of the £718,000 in respect of land annuities not paid last year is included; so that we will know what kind of a bill the people are going to pay on the 31st October of this year.  I think this is an outlandish proposal on the facts as we know them.  The Minister has more up-to-date facts and can give a more up-to-date review of the position and a clearer idea as to what is before the unfortunate ratepayers from now until 31st October, and as to what exactly he has got out of them from 1st April to date.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In 1933, the original Act was passed and the operative clauses of that Act were to have effect for a period of three years.  Accordingly, the position has now arisen that, unless amending legislation be introduced, these operative clauses will become ineffective in September next, so that for practical purpose very little work could be done under the Act.  Under the original Act, a Committee was set up, called the Investments Advisory Committee, the object of the Committee being, in accordance with the original Act, to make recommendations when called upon to the Minister for Finance under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act.  Under Section 7, the proposal was that any person responsible for the issue of any security could apply to the Minister for the latter's approval of such security as a security suitable for the investment of Government funds and Government moneys.  Under that section, action <Col N="605" /> was taken in 1934 by the Dublin County Borough Council for the approval of securities.</P>
      <P>The procedure that was adopted, in order to facilitate the advisory committee and to enable them to map out their own procedure, was to send them a single application instead of the ten applications received, this application being in connection with the single fund, the National Health Insurance Fund Investment Account.  The application was formally referred to the Committee on the 10th January, 1935. The Committee disposed of it, and of subsequent references with regard to the nine other inquiries, on the 25th April, 1935.  The appropriate notice indicating that the Minister for Finance has approved of the six securities in question was duly published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It is proposed to refer the same securities to the Committee for consideration in connection with the National Health Insurance Central Fund Investment Account and, in fact, the matter is being prepared at the present moment in the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>This was the only series of applications which came under Section 7, sub-section (1).  Under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 6 the Minister for Finance is empowered to request the Committee to advise him as to the suitability of specified securities for the investment of any specified Government fund, or any specified Government money.  In neither case has any request been made by the Minister for Finance, so that as regards the actual operation of the Bill, it must undoubtedly be conceded that the positive results that have accrued have not been very great.  It must be pleaded, in extenuation, that the Committee took considerable time to settle down to work.  A great deal of preliminary work had to be done. As the work is of special importance and very technical, it was deemed necessary to take plenty of time and to do things in a proper manner.  In actual fact, the Committee was not formally constituted until the 12th February, 1934.  It held its first meeting on the 5th of March, 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Regulations under Section 7 were framed on the 10th September, 1934, and were agreed to by the Committee on the 29th September, 1934.  The applications from the Dublin County Borough Council were made on the 15th of October, 1934, and in January, 1935, the application, as I have already stated, was referred to the Committee.  In April of this year the Committee made its decision, so that in actual fact the work is only being planned out at the present time.  It cannot, therefore, be said that sufficient experience has been gained to enable the Department to make definite and final proposals, but it is quite certain that the Committee constitutes a most valuable piece of machinery.  Even though the preliminary work has been somewhat slow, very good results have been achieved. The position no longer exists that a decision cannot be taken under the laws with regard to a particular Irish security.  There is definite machinery there at any rate, although not final machinery, by which the question whether a security should be admitted as an approved security or not can be definitely referred to the Committee for a decision, and a decision arrived at.  It is considered that further experience of the work of the Committee will, however, be necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, as the House is aware, a Banking Commission is sitting at the present time.  It is very likely that that Commission, when it makes its report, which it may not do for some time yet, will have some observations to make on the question of trustee securities and of the field of investment in the Saorstát for securities of native origin.  But, even when that report is in hands its consideration will take a considerable amount of time.  It is to be expected that it will deal with a great number of very important issues.  The Government will require time to digest its recommendations and, if necessary, to prepare legislation.  In the meantime, the proposal is made in this Bill that the operative powers which the Minister for Finance has under the <Col N="607" /> existing Act should be continued for a period of two years.  Under the Bill no other amendment of the Principal Act is being proposed.  In view of the rather limited amount of work that has been done, and of the fact that the work of the Committee has been largely experimental, it has not been considered wise to amend the Act other than by giving the Minister for Finance power to extend the period further.  It is expected that, at the expiration of the two years proposed in this Bill, the Government will have definite proposals to bring forward. If not, then I think that under Section 4 of the Bill the Minister for Finance will have power to make a further Order if it should be found necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>As the Bill stands no credit note is going to be of any use in respect of the first moiety after 31st October.  I pointed out to the Minister the position the ratepayers <Col N="608" /> are going to stand in between now and October 31st.  If a man's share is not paid by October 31st, 1935, he is going to lose the value of his credit note.  That is very serious.  It is an outlandish proposal that the Minister should not leave in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think it can be said to be an outlandish proposal, considering that the whole credit note system is a voluntary one. We did not ask any county council to adopt the credit note system.  Some county councils refused to adopt it saying that it is an unfair system. Some did so and defend it as being a very useful piece of machinery to help them to get in the rates.  There is no compulsion on any local authority to use it.  If they found it served a useful purpose in some counties&mdash;and evidently they did when they put it into operation&mdash;I do not see why we should take it away.  I do not see how we could help with the use of the credit note system if we extended the period of operation to anything like what is suggested in the amendment.  It would lose all its value if it were extended in that way. I could understand if it were extended to be used within the period of the financial year, for the first or the second moiety, but if the question arises of using the credit note system for arrears then it should not be allowed, and should not be adopted by any county council.</P>

      <P>I am not pressing the amendment as it stands, and Deputy Brennan was only forced into putting down the amendment by reason of what has occurred.  The Minister says it is a matter for the local councils.  Remember that local councils in framing this system of collection for this year had before them not the Bill that the Minister introduced in May, 1935, containing this rigid system, but the Bill which the Minister introduced on December 5th last which contained a very elastic proposal.  I would be quite satisfied to have that extended to the present Bill.  I think the Minister must sympathise with the idea that a man <Col N="609" /> ought not, in the peculiar circumstances of this half year, lose the value of his credit note simply because he is caught by October 31st. If the Minister sympathises and undertakes to bring in some kind of elasticity into the dates, 31st October or 31st March, I am not pressing him to the strict wording of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states that the secretary of a council &ldquo;may from time to time amend any rate or assessment made for the service of the current financial year on any tenement of agricultural land in any rate-book.&rdquo; That is an extraordinary power.  For the last three years we had a series of Bills introduced which imposed penalties varying from £1 to £100 on citizens who deviated in any respect from the law.  Now we have a Bill amending the provisions of a previous Bill.  If an official of a county council makes a mistake, or if something of that kind occurs, he can amend it with impunity.  That is an extraordinary power to give.  I do not think it should be exercised in the way laid down in the Bill.  If the ordinary citizen is expected to obey the law, and if, after nearly 40 years of local government administration, we have not arrived at the point when we can look with certitude on figures of assessment, it is very bad.  What usually happens in these cases is that someone becomes careless about what is being done, or says that all he has to do is to ring up the Minister about it.  I do not know anything more reprehensible or anything which reflects more gravely on the local government service than to have to ask the Minister about this and that.  While that state of affairs exists there will always be a disposition to lean on the central <Col N="610" /> authority.  It is far better that people should realise that they must lean upon themselves.  There might be some excuse for this sort of thing in disturbed or difficult conditions, or if books were not available, but, in the normal course of events, men who are acting as secretaries of county councils should be qualified to deal perfectly with rate-books and accounts, without having this power reserved, enabling amendments to be made in the rate-books.</P>
      <P>There was a period in this country when it was practically impossible to frame a demand note in accordance with the law.  There were numerous difficulties and complexities in the way, but, notwithstanding that, in only one instance in 25 years was a rate broken.  People learned from the evils that flowed from the breaking of that rate not to go on with it.  In this case we are, apparently, getting at the point where that cannot be done.  If this were a habit that had been persisted in, or if this provision were designed to correct an abuse, there might be some justification for it.  The Minister is aware that Bills like this impose considerable expense on county councils.  I heard Deputy Brennan say here recently that the administration costs had involved Roscommon County Council in a sum of £600 or £800 for a period three years.  Where administration costs are added, it amounts to a reduction of whatever grants are made from the Central Fund.  Dealing with this section, it is regrettable that it should find a place on the Statute Book of the State, and, if it be used to any great extent, public confidence will be shaken.  We can imagine the story which will go round: &ldquo;Did you hear the power that the secretary of the county council has now; he can alter any rate and charge a ratepayer anything he likes?&rdquo;  That is the kind of story that gets about, and I think the Minister should reconsider this matter before Report Stage and, if possible, exclude this clause from this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the power sought is an unusual one.  It is one <Col N="611" /> that ought not ordinarily be brought into a piece of legislation of this character.  It was, however, put up to me that owing to the new and complicated nature of the machinery implementing this legislation, it would be wise to have a power of this kind so as to prevent any effort at litigation that might lead to the quashing of the rate on account of errors in arriving at the strict allocation of the moneys under the Bill.  I raised points similar to <Col N="612" /> those raised by the leader of the Opposition when the draft of this measure was put before me.  I thought that a section of this kind ought not to be necessary.  It was only on strong pressure and on representations that it would, probably, not be necessary to repeat this provision when local authorities got used to the machinery, that I agreed to the inclusion of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, the Minister for Agriculture is empowered to deal directly with four specified diseases of animals, namely, cattle plague, pleuro - pneumonia, foot - and - mouth disease, and swine-fever.  Under the present Bill it is proposed to extend the power of the Minister so as to enable him to deal with diseases other than these four diseases.  As regards the four diseases mentioned, I am glad to be in a position to say they have practically been eliminated and that the country is free from them.  Pleuropneumonia has disappeared practically and so has cattle plague.  The last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country occurred in 1931, in the Six-County area, and we have been lucky enough to escape foot-and-mouth disease in the Saorstát area since 1928.  Even swine-fever, which was rather a common disease here in former days, has become unknown, at least for the last 12 months.  In 1932 we had 42 cases of swine-fever; in <Col N="614" /> 1933 we had 97 cases; in 1934 we had 26 cases, and we have had none since. I do not know to what exactly the improvement is due.  Some claim that it is due to a great extent to the stoppage of the import of foreign bacon, while others claim that it is due to the enforcement of the boiling order for offals and so on, which has been enforced in the City of Dublin for some time, as it was in the vicinity of the City of Dublin that these cases usually occurred.  The position is that, under the 1894 Act, any diseases of animals, other than the four diseases specified, have to be dealt with by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill to give the Minister for Agriculture power to deal directly with any diseases that he may think fit.  The object of the Bill is to deal with tuberculosis in cattle. Under the scheme, which has been mentioned on several occasions, for the disposal of old cows at Roscrea factory, we hope to get rid of all the useless and old cows in the country for conversion into meat meal, but the Roscrea factory is not for the purpose of taking tuberculous cows, although possibly some tuberculous cows may be sent there.  It is proposed then to follow up the clearing of county by county for Roscrea by a campaign for the elimination of tuberculosis in cows as far as possible, and it is felt that this can only be done effectively if it is administered from the central authority.  The administration of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order by local authorities cannot be regarded as satisfactory.  In the year ended 31st March last the number of animals slaughtered under the Order was 3,672, and that would mean only about 0.3 per cent. of the number of cows in the country, which is undoubtedly much lower than the number of cows in that could be detected as suffering from tuberculosis, and an attempt made to eliminate the disease. To give an idea of the working of this scheme in the year referred to, that is, the year ended 31st March last, I may say that the number of animals slaughtered in one county was 751, in <Col N="615" /> another county 718, while in another it was six.  It is quite plain, therefore, that there are certain local authorities much more alive to the danger of tuberculosis in cattle than others, and that no uniform attempt has been made to stamp out the disease.</P>
    <P>If this power is given by the Dáil it is proposed to make Orders from time to time taking over the administration of the elimination of bovine tuberculosis in any particular county for a particular period, and afterwards perhaps handing back that power to the local authority to deal with.  It will mean of course that officers of the Department will have to take over administration of the Act wherever an Order is made.  I may also mention that it is proposed to widen the scope of the existing Bovine Tuberculosis Order.  The present Order deals with any cow which is or appears to be suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, indurated udder or other chronic diseases of the udder; any bovine animal which is or appears to be suffering from tubercular emaciation, or any bovine animal which is suffering from a chronic cough, and showing definite clinical signs of tuberculosis.  The new Order which it is proposed to bring into operation shortly will include the aged cow which is or appears to be suffering from tuberculosis in any form, and a bovine animal which is or appears to be suffering from open tuberculosis, that is tuberculosis with a shedding of tubercle bacilli in any of the discharges of the animal.  The new Order will also, of course, include cows which are suspected of giving tuberculous milk. If we reach the very ideal position of having tubercle free herds in this country we shall be in a position to help that movement very much by taking the administration of this Act into central hands.</P>
    <P>Another question that may perhaps arise is: &ldquo;How do the veterinary surgeons who are at present employed by the local authority stand under this Act&rdquo;?  Their position is being <Col N="616" /> safeguarded.  If they are taken over by the Department under this Bill they will be paid on a <i>pro rata</i> or per case basis, and, if the Department hands back the work again to the local authority to administer, the veterinary surgeon will of course go back to where he left off.  The compensation that will be paid for any animals slaughtered under the central administration of the Order will be paid for entirely by the State.  At present the local authority pays half the compensation, but if this administration is now taken over by the central authority, and if it is pushed vigorously, the amount to be paid by the local authority under the present basis might be very heavy.  It has been suggested, therefore, that the central authority should pay the whole cost while they are administering this Act.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not know very well that it is unlikely that any county council will now spend money in that direction, when it sees its neighbour, who neglected to take any steps at all in the matter, getting the whole sum paid by the central authority?  Take a county in respect of which £700 has been paid in compensation. Let the Minister put himself into the position of the chairman of that county council.  I would expect that to-morrow morning he would assemble his veterinary surgeons before him and say: &ldquo;Well, £700 was spent last year on that service.  The Government is going to take it over in the places where no attention has been paid to it; consequently, we can save that £700 in the coming year.&rdquo;  That is a situation to which I think the Minister must not have adverted.  I <Col N="617" /> think there is general agreement upon the desire to eliminate disease in our live stock, and that there ought to be active co-operation in getting that work done, but I wonder what will be the position of a county council which has, up to this, been active in having disease exterminated, and now sees this action on the part of the Department of Agriculture in respect of counties in which no activity has taken place.  It is obvious that from the moment of the introduction of this Bill nothing is going to be done in those counties.  I do not know whether the Minister has made any arrangement to deal with the situation.  I would suggest to the Minister that what he ought to do is to amend the Bill on Committee Stage in regard to putting the whole cost of the compensation on the central authority.  Otherwise, it is exceeding unlikely that the counties which have been spending money will continue to do so.  It may be that there are men on certain county councils who are sufficiently public-spirited to argue that that service ought to be continued, even if it be expensive, but when the rates are increasing, when the difficulty of collecting them is getting more and more pronounced, when they see State aid coming in to the county councils or local authorities who have been slack, this is certainly not the time in which one could expect the same activities on the part of those councils who wish to eliminate disease as existed heretofore.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he intends to make an Order specifying the diseases that he is going to deal with?  He means the Act to deal with any disease, and, as I understand it, takes power to issue an Order which will enable him to direct the slaughter of cattle suffering from any disease, and once he issues an Order like that, it has statutory authority and does not come before any other approving body.  Do I understand that Orders will be issued and that it is his intention to confine those Orders to the diseases that he mentioned, those diseases being specified in the Orders that will be issued?</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minister that there are two classes of cattle which he will be entitled to deal with under this Bill, but I must say that, so far as I am concerned, I consider that the explanation which the Minister has given is rather vague. He intends to deal with tuberculous cows, and he also intends to deal with aged cows, but he did not say what the machinery really is for dealing with the two specifie cases.  Everybody is agreed that it would be a good thing for the country not to have tubercular cattle, but the Minister has not given us the information we have asked as to really what machinery he intends to use in connection with this Bill.  I understand from him that he would not deal with the whole country at the present time&mdash;that he intends to deal with it county by county.  On that matter I would like more information, and I hope it will be forthcoming before we are asked to pass the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I may not have been very clear.  Perhaps I was confusing the Deputy when I said that old and uneconomic cows would be taken to Roscrea for conversion into meat meal. It was considered better to have that done at first so that we would only have tubercular cows to deal with when we were taking the matter county by county.  It is cheaper to take the cows through taking the counties one by one.  Then when we have done this we can clear out the tubercular cows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps one and a half years.  It may be more; I am not sure. It is a matter as to how quickly Roscrea will deal with the uneconomic cows.  When Roscrea is working to full capacity it may be able to take 65,000 cows a year.  Then we will follow with this Tuberculosis Order. First the Order must be made stating that such a disease is taken into central control.  The Order will then operate for that particular disease and for no other.  In answer to the objection raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I want <Col N="619" /> to say that I do not think there is any great danger of what Deputy Cosgrave points out because the intention is to go for County Kerry at first.  Kerry is the first county that is being cleared up for Roscrea.  When that is done we can go on to Kerry with this Tuberculosis Order.  We do not expect to take more than two or three counties at a time and we can then hand it back to the county councils.  We will deal that way with each county council.  I do not think there is any great danger of any trouble arising in that way in the other counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we may do four or five counties at a time and these will take two or three months, perhaps. The organisation required will be very big.  It was considered in the beginning that we should do it that way&mdash; that we would go out and clear up the whole country.  It would require a very big staff to be recruited apart, of course, from the administrative staff which it will be easy to get.  I think it would be difficult to get the number of veterinary surgeons required to do the whole country at one time but if we do only two or three counties at a time it will be possible.  I think that it is the best way under the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The experience gained in administering the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts of 1930 and 1931 shows the necessity of some amendments which are incorporated in this Bill and which aim at a smoother working of the Acts.  In the first place, it is proposed to exempt in certain circumstances beef exporters from the inspection fees payable for the examination of animals slaughtered for export.  It is intended to use this provision only in exceptional cases and it is for the purpose of encouraging an export trade in beef offals to relieve the surplus of cattle.  Under the Act of 1930 we are compelled to charge the full fee for inspection even if only one particular organ of the animal is exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> Under the Act of 1930, where the registration of slaughtering premises has ceased, the exporters' licence remains in force and there appears to be no legal way of getting over that difficulty.  It is proposed under this amending Bill that if the registration of the slaughtering premises is cancelled the exporter shall automatically lose his licence.</P>
    <P>Under an arrangement made with certain local sanitary authorities, the veterinary officers of these authorities are appointed as veterinary examiners for the purpose of the Fresh Meat Acts.  There is a danger that, as they do not devote the whole of their time to the working of the Public Health Acts, their right to pension is possibly jeopardised.  That point was dealt with in the Pigs and Bacon Bill in which their position was safeguarded and the same thing is being done under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Schedule are of a minor character and are generally intended to provide for a more satisfactory certification of exports.  The words &ldquo;free from disease&rdquo; are being changed to &ldquo;fit for human consumption.&rdquo;  There is also the position that carcases which are mutiliated or perhaps not fully developed might quite possibly be free from disease but not fit for human consumption and the original Act is being amended to give the examiner power to reject meat as not being fit for human consumption even though it is free from disease.</P>
    <P>Then the object of the amendments to Sections 36 and 40 of the Act of 1930 is to permit a licensed exporter to collect offals from other licensed exporters and export all from his own premises.  As the Act stands, nothing can be exported from licensed premises except it is exported direct from that premises.  There was, for instance, some trade for livers to Germany last summer and it was very difficult for the exporter to get them sent from each registered premises.  It would have been much more convenient if they could have been all <Col N="624" /> collected in one registered premises and exported from there, and this amendment is being introduced to meet such a contingency.  There is nothing of any great principle in the amendments. They are designed, in fact, to meet administrative difficulties, and I do not think they should give any great trouble to any Deputy.</P>

You have a Bill passed and then you have a Bill to amend it.  That sort of business is hardly fair to people who are not lawyers.

      <P>I think the point that Deputy Curran makes is a very good one and that the Minister ought to take it into consideration.  This method of legislation is all right in connection with Bills affecting lawyers mostly, but in the case of the Cereals Act, for instance, there were three amending Bills.  It is not fair to farmers or millers that that should be done.  I understand that Deputy Professor O'Sullivan mentioned that the Executive Council might consider some method of dealing with a situation such as that.  We have had a whole series of Bills of that sort amending, and amending, and amending, and, at the present time, I think one of these Bills requires a person to have two of one year, one of another, and another of a third year.  It is very easy for people to lose sight of one of these amending Bills in the circumstances, although it is said that where there are penalties involved to mention that would get one out of them.  That is not the question, however.  The question is to make it easy for people to live.  The trend of legislation for the past few years has been to make it as difficult as possible for business people or people engaged in agriculture to get along.  Some scheme ought to be adopted to get in a single form those enactments dealing with agriculture or business generally.</P>

      <P>We have to oppose this motion.  During the period of the last Administration, up to about three years ago, this question of an increase in the number of judges was under consideration.  It was felt that the necessities of the times and perhaps the circumstances of the case would have warranted an increase in the number of judges at that time.  The only reason there was for not introducing a Bill to deal with the situation&mdash;at least it was the main reason&mdash;was the general feeling, shared at that time by practically all members of the House, that every effort should be directed towards reducing the cost of administration in the country.  Viewing the situation to-day as compared with what it was three years ago, I am not satisfied that we are in such a prosperous state as would warrant our agreeing to the expenditure of this sum of money on the courts, to an increase in the number of judges in the courts and all the other expenses that are incidental to the passing of this Bill.  I am not satisfied that we are in as prosperous a condition as we were three years ago.  Taxation has increased very considerably during those three years.  That is to say, <Col N="627" /> there has been imposed about £6,000,000 of new money&mdash;not extra taxation, mind you, but new money&mdash; and there has also been imposed something amounting to over £3,000,000 in hidden taxation.  One might ask, what does a few thousand pounds matter in these circumstances?</P>
      <P>The next question is, assuming that we are in difficulties, in regard to the provision of the money, is it so necessary to incur this expenditure just now?  I do not know if that case has been made.  I have not been informed that there is such a congestion of business or such a hold-up in the courts as would warrant the appointment of additional judges.  In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that this is a reasonable proposition to put before us just now, that we should appoint one or two Supreme Court judges and one or two High Court judges in present circumstances.  This is a time when we ought to reduce the cost of public administration wherever possible.  Having regard to the present condition of the main industry of the country, I think it is not fair or reasonable to impose this extra cost on the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Of course, this matter was discussed on the second stage of the Bill.  I suggest to Deputy Cosgrave that it was not due to financial reasons that this Bill was not introduced by his Administration, but that it was due to the difficulties which arose in the drafting of the Bill, which was such a large measure. At least a number of considerations had to be taken into account.  I suggest that the Department had been consulted and that certain drafts had been submitted to the Executive Council and that they had begun the preparation of the measure for introduction. I cannot give the Deputy any accurate information as to what the possible cost of the measure will be.  It is the present intention of the Executive Council to appoint as few judges as possible.  I know that representations have been made by judges who have experience of this matter, that it will require more <Col N="628" /> judges than we certainly anticipated, but we are not disposed, until this Bill has had a fair trial or until it has been in operation for a year or two, to appoint more than a few judges.  If the courts get into arrears the question as to whether further additional judges will be required will have to be reconsidered.  What we have to mind at the moment is the appointment of two extra judges, not more. We can let that arrangement operate for 12 months or so, to see if it will be sufficient to deal with the business that will have accrued in the courts. If it is found, after a year or two, that it is impracticable to carry on without the appointment of further judges, then we shall have to come back to the Dáil and ask it to reconsider the question.  Under the new system of appeals there will also be travelling expenses.  I have got a tentative figure for that of about £1,000.  Of course, it is only tentative. I cannot say definitely whether or not it will cost more.  Then there will be other incidentals such as criers and attendants in respect of which I have got a tentative figure of about £500.</P>

      <P>I desire to oppose this Money Resolution.  I wonder if the absence of Deputy Corry from the House to-night is due to the fact that this Bill is before the House.  Reading the reports of the proceedings in this Dáil before ever I came here, I always admired, even from a distance, Fianna Fáil's policy of reducing expenditure.  I remember distinctly that Deputy Corry used to say: &ldquo;We will pay no one man more than £1,000 a year; he is not worth it.&rdquo;  What is the Deputy or his Party doing now? They are proposing to appoint men at salaries up to £2,500 each.  If the times were normal, nobody would object to these two judges being paid a reasonable and fair salary, if it is necessary to appoint them, but this is one proposition that I, for one, will not subscribe to.  I think that at the present time it is not fair to put this expenditure upon the country. The time is altogether inopportune to appoint them.  I think this is another indication that the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="629" /> have departed from everything they ever said when they sat on these benches.  This is no time to add to State expenditure in any Department. So far as the ordinary layman is concerned it would seem that the Military Tribunal is relieving the courts of much of the business which should normally come before the courts in the ordinary way.  For that reason, there is no justification at all for asking us to subscribe to further expenditure on high salaries for positions which we do not think are necessary at the present time.</P>

      <P>I also have to oppose this resolution.  I quite concur with Deputy Curran in his statement and in his references to Deputy Corry.  At a time when I was not a member of the House, any more than Deputy Curran, I remember reading in the Press statements of Deputy Corry to the effect that his Party would pay no man more than £1,000 a year.  As Deputy Curran has stated.  I should like to see Deputy Corry here this evening to stand up to these words. As Deputies are aware, the farming community are now in a deplorable position.  Rates and taxes have increased to such an extent that they are incapable of bearing any further taxes.  If you appoint two, three or four additional judges, that will mean that each of these judges must be paid £2,500.  My opinion is that having regard to the present state of the country this is no time to come to the Dáil with a proposal to appoint new judges.  The Military Tribunal, of which we hear so much, must have lessened the work of the judges.  I, as a representative of the taxpayers, strongly protest against the proposed appointment of these four new judges.  I hope that the Minister will take into account the present condition of the country and wait until better times arrive before he decides to impose this extra expense on the taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is certainly a peculiar time to increase expenditure upon the judiciary, in view of the conditions that obtain in the country at the present moment.  It may be <Col N="630" /> true to say that decisions are delayed, and that some of the existing members of the judiciary are hard worked. But in view of the fact that this country is suffering largely both from the economic point of view and the physical point of view from want of work, they should not complain.  I think it is quite reasonable to expect that the existing members of the judiciary should be able to do the work necessary.  It is argued that certain members of the Bar joined various political Parties for the purpose of getting judgeships.  I do not think this is an opportune time to redeem promises made to those particular gentlemen.  I do not reflect on any particular people for that or that this proposed expenditure is simply to allow the present Government to redeem certain promises.  I think that before proceeding with any further expenditure the Government should try and improve the conditions under which the majority of the people are living, and that they should not force them to pay this further expenditure.</P>
      <P>I have no objection, personally, to the payment of proper salaries to judges.  I think, generally speaking, they deserve every shilling they get, and that they should be maintained on a standard that would put them beyond any hardship, financially, and that they should be well paid.  What I am arguing is that the present time is not opportune for an increase in the number of judges.  The Government seem to seize upon most inopportune times for things like this. For that reason I suggest to the Government that they should not be in a hurry and that they should leave this over until the country is able to go to law.  Nearly half the country would like to go to law but they are not able to pay for it.  In many counties there are people who want to go to law on account of bog roads, by-passes, and things like that.  Owing to the financial condition of the farming community, if they want to go to law they cannot do so.  I am opposing this Bill and suggesting to the Minister that he should be content with a little in regard to this Bill and leave the expenditure over to a more suitable occasion.</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt about the facts in regard to the position in the country as put forward by Deputy MacEoin and that the view he holds is that held by a large section of the community.  It is very difficult indeed to see any clear answer to those contentions at the present moment.  It certainly has occurred to me that the Minister should be able to produce a very strong case to the House to justify the immediate putting into operation of this Bill.  Certain amendments of the law which the Bill enshrines are no doubt very good amendments.  I am not dealing now with isolated sections, or portions of the Bill; I am dealing with the Bill as a whole, because of course the Financial Resolution deals with the extra expenditure upon the Bill.  I am not going to rub into the Minister the very curious attitude the Executive Council have taken up.  It is only a very short time ago that we had in this House debates for the cutting down of pay all round.  Indeed it is a matter of general information, and if I am not mistaken, it was actually mentioned in the House, although I am not certain about that, that representations were made to the judges that in the very trying state of national finances it would be highly advisable for them to consent to a cut in their salaries at a time when the salaries of civil servants and the Guards were being cut and the other members of the community as well.  It seems a little illogical, indeed it seems distinctly illogical, for the Minister to come along with the Bill now which asks for an increase of expenditure in this direction.  I am not, however, so much concerned with that particular aspect of the question except to say that I did not expect, and nobody could expect, anything approaching consistency from the present Government.  It is a Government which lives from hand to mouth.  It produces its programme without thinking of the future to see how it can get over this emergency and that emergency, and for these reasons it is not a Government from which we can expect any kind of consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> It is not my intention, however, to press the argument of inconsistency against the Minister or the Government too far.  But I think the Minister ought to be able to let the House know what the actual expenditure, which the appointment of two extra judges, with the necessary concomitants, will be.  I was not in the House when the Minister made his remarks upon that matter, but, as far as I can gather, the Minister made the statement that he was unable to foretell what the expenditure would be.  Surely that is a matter the Minister ought to be able to calculate, and to give the House, not possibly within five or ten pounds of the amount, but probably within £50 or £100 of the amount.  The extra expenditure which the judges' salaries will cause, the extras for registrars, for travelling expenses, and matters of that kind, would be, one would think, very easy to be calculated.  I think the Minister also should give some better reason why it is the intention to appoint two new High Court judges and to pay these High Court judges Supreme Court salaries.  That seems to me to be one of the very weaknesses of the Bill, and a weakness which I think, from anything I heard the Minister say, is not explainable.  I know it has been said that, on theoretical grounds, it is very desirable to have a Court of Appeal of five.  But one must remember that this State has carried on with its present Supreme Court, as a final Court of Appeal, since the inauguration of the Free State.</P>
    <P>It is a matter also of very general knowledge&mdash;and the Minister and the Attorney-General must know it&mdash;that there has been extremely little work in the Supreme Court recently.  The volume of work which the Supreme Court has done since Christmas, I venture to say, is extraordinarily small, and a extraordinarily small number of appeals are going up to the Supreme Court at present.  Whether that is entirely due to the cause which Deputy MacEoin put forward&mdash;the poverty of the country&mdash;or whether it is due to other causes is very difficult to know, but while the cause put forward by Deputy MacEoin may not be the sole <Col N="633" /> cause, it must be admitted by most people that it is the predominant cause.  Why, at the present time, it is necessary to have two Supreme Court judges beats me.</P>
    <P>As I have said, what this Bill is designed for, and what this money is being voted for is to have two new High Court judges paid at the rate of Supreme Court judges.  There is no need at the present time for any new Supreme Court judges at all, as is perfectly clear.  We have carried on with the Supreme Court as it is, and that Supreme Court has been our final Court of Appeal.  In theory, it was argued by some persons, and not by others, that there was an appeal to the Privy Council, but, in fact, there was no appeal to the Privy Council. Whenever an attempt was made to bring any case before the Privy Council, this House intervened, and no case from the Irish Free State has gone to the Privy Council since this State came into existence and intervened. Why, for a theory, this new expenditure should be carried out at present is very hard indeed to see.  I should like to know from the Minister how he justifies the extra expenditure involved in the appointment of Supreme Court judges when the very strongest his case can be put is for the appointment of High Court judges.</P>
    <P>On the question of the appointment of High Court judges, there is no doubt, in my opinion, that the modern system of Circuit Court appeals is not completely successful.  I know that there is a difference of opinion upon that question, and I know that some persons&mdash;some judges and, possibly, more judges than think the other way &mdash;are of opinion that the present system is better than the old system. For my own part, I do not think it is. I have never been very enamoured of the new system of appeal and, in my judgment, this House never gave the new system a fair chance at all, because, when rules of Court were introduced into this House which would have had a strictness in pleading which the Circuit Court has not got, and which, considering that it has got jurisdiction up to £300, it ought to <Col N="634" /> have, and which it would be necessary for it to have if the present system of appeal were carried out, this House, the Minister included, refused to give the Circuit Court that chance.  I do not say that the Circuit Court would have been a success if it had the chance, because I do not know, but when the House refused to give the Circuit Court that chance, this system was, in my judgment, doomed.</P>
    <P>We come now to another question&mdash;the question as to whether, having endured this particular system for this length of time, we should change it at the present moment.  I, as a member of the Bar, find it very difficult, on a question like this, I must frankly admit to the House, to address the House in anything but professional terms.  It is a very natural thing for a person who has spent his whole life at a particular profession, when he sees a certain piece of legislation affecting his profession, to look at it entirely from a professional point of view.  From the point of view of the Bar, it is highly desirable that this change of the method of appeal should come, but as to whether it is wise to bring in this change at present, and, what is more important, whether it is necessary to bring it in at present, in view of the strong force of non-legal opinion which there is against these expensive alterations is a matter upon which I am not by any means clear. There are other things in the Bill, such as the majority verdict in criminal cases, which I think are real improvements of the existing law, but so far as the expenditure of money, which is the only matter I can discuss on this Resolution, is concerned, I should like the Minister to tell us what arrears of Circuit Court appeals there are, and, on the question of time, to tell us if the judges are not fast catching up, if they have not already caught up, with the fast dwindling number of Circuit appeals.  The Circuit Courts are doing very little work, as everybody knows, and, in consequence, the number of new appeals are decreasing very rapidly.  It is impossible for me to give any statistics to the House, but the Minister must have statistics which I think he ought to put before <Col N="635" /> the House and allow the House to know precisely the urgency of the expenditure of this sum at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. V. Rice Mr. V. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene in this discussion merely to deal with a matter raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. He referred to the question as to whether the Circuit Courts have been a success or not and he suggested that perhaps the House had not given them a fair opportunity of operating because they had refused to pass rules to enable them to carry out their duties properly.  A Committee was set up a number of years ago, consisting of members of the Dáil and Seanad, and presided over by Lord Glenavy, who was one of the most distinguished lawyers this country has known for a generation.  I was a member of the Committee myself and it included a number of experienced lawyers, one being Mr. Jasper Wolfe, a solicitor and a member of this House at the time, who had experience which could not be surpassed by any person in this country of the working of the Circuit Courts.  That Committee refused to sanction that set of rules because we came to the conclusion that they were hopeless from the point of view of being a workable set of rules.  They had obviously been drafted by theorists.  A number were <i>ultra vires.</i> They provided for discovery in Circuit Court cases.  The Circuit Court having been set up in order to provide a cheap method of litigation, they gave unlimited discovery in Circuit Court actions, which would have produced this result: You would have had a system of rules operating in the Circuit Court which would have made actions in the Circuit Court as expensive as any in the High Court.  That Committee, therefore, condemned that set of rules and that is why they were not recommended to this House by that Committee.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has suggested that the system of appeal that exists did not get a fair chance.  I think that it did: that it got too long a chance, and was too <Col N="636" /> long in operation.  The system of hearing an appeal on notes has been found to be unworkable in this country. That system was adopted in countries where the distances between towns are enormous.  In the case of Canada, for instance, the distance between big towns would be 1,000 or 1,200 miles.  Therefore, in those countries it would not be practicable to bring witnesses long distances for the hearing of oral evidence on appeal.  But that system was not necessary in this country where the distances between towns are short. The old system, which provided for the taking of oral evidence on appeal, was not only very valuable but on the whole was very satisfactory to the people of this country, and that is the main test.  It was found far more workable than the present system.  The old system was in operation up to 14 or 15 years ago when the facilities for bringing witnesses for the taking of oral evidence on appeal were not nearly as great as they are to-day. These are the only observations that I desire to make in reply to what was suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. He said that the system of hearing appeals on notes was not given a fair chance.  I say that it was given more than a fair chance, and that it has been found to be a failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I have not been a sufficiently long time a member of the legal profession to express what are the opinions of the profession on this matter, and if I speak on this I speak entirely as a layman, with a layman's point of view that I had formed when I was a member of Government.  Here is the peculiar situation that presents itself to my view.  A Committee was set up to investigate the working of the Courts of Justice Act of 1924. Those who represented Fianna Fáil on that Committee reported against the addition of any judges, and they reported against the addition of any judges notwithstanding all the evidence that was given as to delay in the hearing of Circuit Court appeals. That was the only point on which there <Col N="637" /> was supposed to be delay in the courts. As far as the criminal work was concerned, as far as the hearing of ordinary High Court actions was concerned, or the hearing of cases that went from the High Court to the Supreme Court, nobody raised any question of delay or of inefficiency in working in any way.  The whole point upon which the Committee pivoted was the hold-up with regard to appeals from the Circuit Court to the High Court.  The evidence given on that may be taken roughly in this way: that there was, in the main, a year's arrears piled up as far as that type of case was concerned, and that was the only thing on which there could be an allegation of delay.</P>
      <P>In the then situation of the country the Fianna Fáil Deputies on that Committee, after hearing all the evidence with regard to that type of delay, voted that they could not approve of the appointment of new judges until the economic condition of the country had improved, and then, when they had improved, they desired that the judges to be appointed should be appointed at less salaries than the salaries that were being paid to the judges then sitting on the bench.  In addition to that, it is a well known fact that in any elections which were held when Fianna Fáil were in opposition&mdash; even when by-elections were held and when certain legal gentlemen stood as candidates&mdash;one of the posters most vigorously used was the poster which showed the immense salary payments, starting with the salaries given to judges.  I think it is not an unfair conclusion to draw from that that Fianna Fáil was resolutely opposed to (a) the payment of high salaries to judges; (b) to numerous appointments being made and (c) that they were then impressed with what they called the bad economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the change?  Must not one approach this with the utmost brazenness and the most complete cynicism, that following a Budget which grips old age pensions, which takes something off the unemployed people and taxes bread, butter, sugar and tea, the <Col N="638" /> Party that did not approve of the appointment of judges, that did not approve of the payment of salaries to certain judges should now be asking the House to vote a Money Resolution for the appointment of additional judges.  If anyone is going to tell me, in the face of the last Budget, that the economic condition of the country has improved, then he has a big case to sustain by argument in this House before he succeeds in getting it across to the long suffering community.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, what is the case with regard to delay?  A series of appendices was published to the Report of the Committee that considered the Courts of Justice Act, 1924. There were statistics with regard to the cases originating in the Circuit Court and these were divided into certain groups.  They covered a three-year period.  I do not know whether it is actually so or not, but one can arrive at an average by taking a group of cases and dividing it by three.  If one does that, a certain result is revealed as to the number of cases originating in the Circuit Court in each of the three years covered by the appendices to the Report of the Committee that dealt with the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  I set down some questions recently to find out how far legal work was improving or disimproving, and I asked for results over the five years that have intervened since these appendices were produced. I took the figures given in bulk, and by dividing them by five I found that the Circuit Court work has gone down by one-third.  The results were the same as in the previous case where the three-year period was taken.</P>
    <P>The amount of work that is now going to the Circuit Court is only two-thirds of what it used to be, and even that result was rather fallacious because, when I made further inquiries, I found that the average under one heading, namely, damage to property, had risen from, say, about 10 or 12, in each of the three years covered by the first return to something in the neighbourhood of 500 or 600.  I knew, of course, that that was <Col N="639" /> a fallacy and I probed it further.  I then found that the damage to property cases bulked somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3,000 or 4,000.  They were listed as returns in the Circuit Court.  Of course, these have only occurred in the last 18 months and will not occur again.  They represent an evanescent type of work.  If the figures relating to these cases are subtracted from the ordinary Circuit Court work, it means that the work in the Circuit Courts has gone very much below the two-thirds mark of what it used to be.</P>
    <P>Finding that these were the results, I pursued the matter further and asked a question with regard to criminal work.  I do not know whether it is a matter that we can be pleased about or not, but on the point of accuracy, at any rate, it has been found that as far as the criminal work is concerned it is on the increase.  It is the only type of legal work that shows an increase.  When speaking of criminal work I am adding in cases that come before the Military Tribunal, as being the type of work that if they offered&mdash;and it is open to doubt that they would offer so often&mdash;before ordinary judges, would be criminal work.  When I take the same criterion with regard to the High Court work a surprising result emerges.  Cases originating in the High Court had apparently settled round about the number 7,000 for the five years prior to 1932.  They began to go down before the beginning of the year in which Fianna Fáil came in as a Government. They went down considerably the year after, and in 1934 they amounted only to 4,500.  They had therefore dropped by more than one-third.</P>
    <P>The situation, therefore, in the legal world, apart from the criminal side, is that there has been a great decrease in Circuit Court work.  We know that that work has gone to some point lower than two-thirds of what it used to be, and that High Court work has fallen by about the same amount. In these circumstances, with less work to be done, and with a more <Col N="640" /> impoverished community, we are asked to vote and to supply salaries, I suppose, for two or three great patriots, who are ready to make the supreme, or the Supreme Court, sacrifice for their principles.  There ought to be some case made to justify the introduction of this measure in these circumstances and at this time.  There is no work requiring the addition of these judges. There is certainly no work that would impress itself upon the mind of any member of Fianna Fáil, who previously thought, as the Party thought, in relation to this matter, when they urged on the Committee that the country could not afford more judges.  It cannot be said that it can now afford this any better than previously.  I put it mildly, comparing the present with the times that existed five years ago&mdash;too mildly indeed to explain to farmers and others who find their all now being seized in a rather uncertain type of legal activity.  It is hard to put it to them that they should have possibly to bow their backs even a little bit more, in order to meet the cost of appointing people to the bench to deal with a declining amount of work.</P>
    <P>The only excuse that can possibly be alleged is the argument rebutted by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney regarding the Supreme Court.  It is an argument that always amazed me, one founded on the numerical strength of the Supreme Court.  It used to be said that with a Supreme Court consisting of only three judges, there was this weakness, that on some cases coming from the lower courts, on a simple enumeration, you might find a greater number of judges favourable to the defeated side than to the side which eventually won.  That may still happen with a Supreme Court of five. There is, however, strength and strength.  Increasing the Supreme Court by the simple addition of two judges does not necessarily add strength to that court.  Conversely, it would be possible to strengthen it by adding a single individual, if that person were some one learned in the law, who would commend himself on the mere mention of his name.  I comment so, all on the assumption that the <Col N="641" /> Supreme Court requires extra strength, a point on which I venture to express a doubt, and by way of caution to remark that it certainly cannot be taken that there is unanimity in the view that the Supreme Court requires such numerical or other enlargements.</P>
    <P>There is the further argument based on the plea that our Supreme Court is the final court of appeal.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney replied on that also.  It always was the final court of appeal; it has always been so regarded and so treated; there is no recent change; and in that argument there is no great weight.  There is one more feature about all this.  I know from being inside the Government for some years that there was a very stern and long drawn out battle waged by officialdom to get the fees for resort to court raised&mdash;the court fees that litigants have to pay.  Officialdom was repulsed many times in these onslaughts but is now victorious.  The victory has been won, although at the beginning we started out to make resort to the courts cheaper.  We have a clause in this measure which gives the Minister for Finance power to increase court fees, and there is no upward point beyond which the Minister cannot go.  I know well the fallacious arguments used to show the necessity for doing that.  Very fallacious comparisons were made as to what part of the cost of justice in England was borne by court fees and what proportion of the same costs was borne here by such fees.  When considering such figures it must be accepted that criminal work cannot pay for itself.  I never saw the real comparison made, the percentage of the relative costs of civil justice in England and here that is borne by the court fees in each country.  It is, of course, not clear in the Bill whether the victory is a complete one or only a minor success.  Up to date the repulse of the officials had been the practice.  Now they have won for the first time.  And so court fees are to be raised, and this country, which set out to make a reduction in the cost of resorting to the courts, is now turning <Col N="642" /> its back on that purpose, and admitting that we cannot achieve this reduction. I regard the emergence of this as ominous.  The efforts and the persistence of certain people who did not take rebuff lightly, but who persevered in their efforts, are now being rewarded.</P>
    <P>On the fees section, in the latter part of the Bill, the official mind is predominant, and the Government has been swayed to take the step of making resort to the courts more costly, and so more difficult.  How far this will go we do not know, but the first step is here.  Has this matter of the court fees a bearing on the legal business now left to be done?  From the figures given, taking them roughly, it can be said that the legal business now arising is only about 65 per cent. of the work that used to be done.  Yet, in such circumstances, we decide that we had to have a few more judges. Why?  How is anyone to go to the community and explain what has brought about the change of mind in Fianna Fáil Deputies who, at one time, could not be brought to think of appointing new judges, who thought that those appointed were always highly and extravagantly paid, and who felt that even with an improvement in the economic condition of the country, there was another matter to be considered, and that an investigation should be made into the French system of appointing judges.  This system, I understand, puts judges on a much lower level of salaries, and this was the system recommended here&mdash; to put newcomers to the bench on a lower level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the money paid is very well paid, and I would not like even to appear to have slipped into a condemnation of the salaries paid to our judges.  But I cannot understand the attitude of those who previously thought that judges as a class were extravagantly paid, and also thought we had too many judges in this country, and yet are apparently now ready to vote for a larger number of judges at the old salary level, while the business they have to attend to is decaying and declining.</P>

      <P>I cannot give a silent vote on this matter.  As a farmer placed in the front line trenches, as a result of the policy of the Government, I support the arguments that have been put up by Deputies on these benches.  After that statement by Deputy McGilligan, it would be out of place for me to give my vote without expressing my views.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies who served on the Committee which inquired into this question, voted against the pay of the judges and against incurring further expense owing to the economic position in which the country then was.  This is no time to come along with a motion of this kind.  I am sorry that Deputy Corry is not here, because he preached at one time, I think, that nobody was worth more than £500 a year.  I do not like to do the Deputy an injustice. One of my colleagues told me to-day that the figure he mentioned was £1,000.  I accept that figure, for the sake of agreement.  I am surprised that Deputy Corry is absent when such an important measure is before the House.  It shows the consistency of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is no time for a measure of this kind when we are even killing calves for patriotic motives.  The calf seems to be burdening the country and we want <Col N="644" /> to take the responsibility of rearing them off the farmers.  Now, we are in the position that we have not got enough cattle in the country.  As Deputy McGilligan said, the present time, when we are putting a tax on tea and sugar, is not the proper time for taxing the people in this fashion. The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us the other day that people are in a better position now than they were in the past because they are drinking more and smoking more. Everybody knows that when people are in trouble they drink more and they smoke more.  That is the position which has been created by the Government. I propose to go into the Lobby against this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find myself at home with Bills appertaining to the courts nor do I give them much attention, as there are plenty of lawyers on all sides to do that.  There is, however, the financial aspect of this Bill to be considered.  We had a Bill dealing with the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Dealing with a section of that Bill, I said that there could be no grounds for reducing the grant except that we were getting poorer. Now, in our poverty, we are going to increase the cost of law and of justice. I am aware that there is alleged to be congestion in the courts but I do not see in this Bill any proposal to work off the arrears.  What is proposed is to get five highly paid judges to do the work of three.  I wonder if the House is beginning to fall and if some of those who helped the fall are looking for jobs for themselves before it comes about.  I wonder who has his eye on a judgeship and hopes to get it while the going is good.  I should like to see a Bill brought in here that the people who are paid large salaries by the State should be made to work a full day.  If a full day were worked by our highly-paid judges, there would be no arrears.  It must be remembered that the man on a heap of stones who is breaking them for 2/- or 3/- per cubic yard has to help to pay these salaries.  The man following the plough, and ploughing fallow because he cannot get a profit out of <Col N="645" /> it now, has to pay for these judges. I do not want to be uncharitable, but I can see nothing in this but a sign that they think the ship is sinking and that jobs must be got for the people who helped the ship to sail for a while.  What need is there for five judges in the Supreme Court?  Has not the Government ready-made law in the Military Tribunal?  Is there any real justification for increasing the expenditure?  I said at the outset that the feeling throughout the country is that law is too dear for the ordinary man.  I have had a few cases in the courts and the issue would want to be terribly important before I would go into court again&mdash;even before the Tribunal.  The Minister and the Attorney-General are aware of the old story of the man who got the lick of the brick.  I know from experience that when you go into court there is no end to your costs. There is no end to fees.  Take the case of a poor man looking for a house in which a certain Deputy on my right is very interested.  He jibs at one thing&mdash; the drafting of a few sheets called a transfer or assignment.  It is stamped all over with fees and court charges of half a guinea and a guinea.  I understand that these fees are to be still further increased.  The whole institution of the courts is going to be made dearer and every Deputy on the Government Benches, and every Deputy who should be on the Government Benches, was hoarse from shouting from every platform at the crossroads that the people were taxed too much for justice&mdash;so heavily taxed that there was really no justice left for the poor man.  Now, this national, republican Government is going to increase still further this tax.  This is the reverse of all that the Government spokesmen have pretended to advocate.  It is not a matter of facilitating justice but, in the name of justice, of manufacturing jobs for the props of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in making my protest against the increased cost that must necessarily arise from this motion.  The Government are about to make changes <Col N="646" /> in the administration of justice. Since the Free State was set up, many changes have been made and, by a curious irony of fate, the present Government, who claim to have a monopoly of nationality, seem to have fashioned this Bill on the British model.  I congratulate the Government on their good sense so far as that aspect of the Bill is concerned because it is conceded by all that British law is the best in the world. We should be proud of the fact that many of our own countrymen have been concerned in the framing of the laws in Great Britain.  I quite understand that many of the changes that will be effected when this Bill passes will be of advantage to the people who engage in law.  For instance, the appeals by oral evidence instead of by transcript from notes, which formerly appertained, will be much better for all concerned.  In looking through this Bill, however, I find that the Government have made provision for the appointment of two extra judges, bringing the number of Supreme Court judges up to five.  In view of the present economic position, I think that this is not a very opportune time to make these appointments, especially when one considers the present heavy load of taxation that the people of this country have got to bear.  When one considers the salaries that would be paid to these High Court judges, the position of many of these unfortunate people who, at the present time, are in receipt of a few shillings from the Unemployment Assistance Act, and the manner in which that Act is being administered by the officials in the various labour exchanges&mdash;the method of assessment whereby many of those people in receipt of, say, 10/- are reduced to 8/- and 7/- because of the fact that they have a few shillings coming into them through the earnings of their sons or their daughters&mdash;I think it will be agreed on all sides that it is not the right time to increase the number of judges in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, when one considers the speech of the Minister for Finance, in which he stated that it would be <Col N="647" /> necessary to effect economies through the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, one has, perforce, to come to the conclusion that this is not the time to pay a few thousand pounds a year by way of salaries to High Court judges that are not needed.  When one considers also the position of many of the farmers throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, especially the farmers in one northern area in my own county, the Cooley area, where many hundreds of farmers have not been able to obtain even 1/- per cwt. for their potatoes, and that those same farmers have to pay through taxation, whether direct or indirect, the costs that will be incurred in the increase in the number of High Court judges&mdash;there again, I think it will be agreed that the present is not a favourable time for embarking on such a policy.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I offer objection to this increase is because of the many statements that have been made by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the length and breadth of this country.  One can easily understand that, on the occasion of a general election, people, perhaps anxious to get votes, do make certain statements and make certain promises that they do not mean to fulfil; but certainly there were many statements made by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party during the last and the previous general election, and, in fact, for many years previous to their coming into power, in which they were very emphatic in telling the people of this country that no man, however efficient he might be, was worth more than £1,000 a year.  I think I heard the President himself stating that view in this House on several occasions, and those statements were reiterated by the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party, including especially Deputy Corry, who represents Cork, on the occasion of the Economies Bill that was introduced by the Government and that reduced the salaries of certain professional men in this country&mdash; members of the medical profession, <Col N="648" /> for instance.  The salaries of those men, in my opinion, never should have been reduced.  But here we have the Government now going to make a very big increase in the cost of the administration of justice in this country.  In view of the fact, that the present Government and also the previous Government have been able to carry on for the past eight or nine or ten years without any additions in the number of judges, I think we could carry on a little longer until such time as the people would be in a better position to bear the additional burden of taxation that must necessarily be imposed as a result of the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the judges to be appointed, of course that is to be a matter for the Government.  We are only concerned with the financial end of this Bill.  I would impress on the Government that, if only on account of the promises they themselves made during the past few years with regard to the costs of government, they should think twice before they proceed by means of this measure to put increased taxation on the people at a time when they are least able to bear such increased taxation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coburn is sometimes a reasonable man, and I can understand some of his speech; but I cannot understand how he can have been deluded by the speeches delivered from the Front Opposition Bench, and how he can have failed to realise the inconsistency in the arguments which have been advanced.  The position is this: that the present system of appeals was first devised and embodied in the 1924 Act, that there have been complaints and evidences of dissatisfaction with it all over the country, and that, in 1929, a committee was appointed to enquire into the whole system.  That committee reported against the system in 1930, and suggested a return to the system which he has praised so much.  In that report there was first of all a recommendation that the Supreme Court should be added to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The Chief Justice himself in his evidence before the committee pointed out that the Supreme Court should be added to.  It was also suggested in that report that the High Court should be added to.  In this Bill, as I explained on the Second Reading, we have adopted only one of the proposals, and that is that two members should be added to the Supreme Court bench, but we have made provision in the Bill to enable the new system of appeals to work by allowing the Supreme Court to be called on to assist in the hearing of appeals. It is not a matter about which lawyers, I suppose, particularly lawyers on the Government side, will be believed if they complain that extra judges have to be found to make the system work.  I realise that it is unfortunate for the Government that the Opposition are able to seize upon this stick with which to beat the Government, and to suggest, in the way they have suggested, that this is an inopportune time to add to the expense of the working of the Courts.  I suppose it was to be expected that they would use that argument.  They referred to the fact that when this Party was in opposition similar arguments were used.</P>
    <P>The position is&mdash;and this is what I commend to Deputy Coburn&mdash;that if the system is to be changed, if you are to have a reversion to the system of hearing appeals otherwise than on the notes, if you are to have the system which this Bill now introduces, the number of judges at present available would be inadequate, and the only way to prevent an addition to the judicial bench at the moment is to abandon that whole scheme altogether. I doubt if any thinking Deputy will suggest that the criticism of this system&mdash;which grew to such strength that in 1929 the Government of the day felt called upon to appoint a Committee to investigate the working of the system, a criticism which found expression in the report of that Committee&mdash;was not something to which the Government had to pay respect. I am personally aware, and I am sure that Deputy Coburn or any Deputy <Col N="650" /> who has been through the country is aware, that laymen generally throughout the country, and those who are interested in the working of the Courts, do desire a return to the old system.</P>

      <P>There are divided opinions amongst the legal profession, and there are some people who say that the new system embodied in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, did not get a fair chance.  I admit that there is a good deal to be said on both sides.  I myself gave evidence before this Committee as representing the Bar Council, at a time when, as I said, on the Second Stage, I could not be accused of having any axe to grind.  I gave evidence that from my experience of the old appeal court system, experience in connection with the Sinn Fein Court system, and experience of the working of what might be called the new system, my opinion was that a reversion to the old system was called for, and I gave reasons there.  One of the reasons which appeal to most people is the lessening of the costs to the litigants. Deputy McGilligan, I think, stressed the additional costs which he says this change is going to add to litigation, but one of the arguments in favour of this return to the old system is that the individual litigants, litigating in the Circuit Court and going on appeal to the local Appeal Courts, will have the cost of their litigation considerably lessened.  I think amongst the solicitor profession the majority opinion is that there must be a change in the system, and since this Bill was introduced I know that the Minister has been pressed practically every day by solicitors of every shade of political opinion to have this measure pressed forward.  I do not think it has been pushed in any undue haste.  The recommendation <Col N="651" /> of the Committee is now five years old.  The Bill was hammered out, as the Minister pointed out, under the old administration.  They spent some considerable time in trying to get it into shape.  It is a very difficult measure to draft in a satisfactory way.  Even here we come in with a number of amendments designed to meet the criticism which was directed against it on Committee Stage.  That the system of appeal on stenographers' notes has to go is now, I think, accepted by everybody as the wish of the majority of the people of the country.  It is the wish of a clear majority of the solicitors, and of those who have taken an interest in the working of the system.  Deputy MacEoin smiles.  I say there are arguments for the other view, but that is undoubtedly becoming the settled opinion, first of all crystallised in the report introduced by Deputy MacEoin's own Party when the previous Government was in office, and which undoubtedly they intended to implement.  I do not think we would have heard so much about the state of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is the position&mdash;although Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney rather glossed over it&mdash;that a new situation has been created by the definite admission now that appeals to the Privy Council cannot be embarked upon.  I would ask Deputies to consider the fact that in attempting to frame a judiciary to deal with the new system and to avoid extra expense as far as possible, the Government has compromised. They have added to the Supreme Court, and in order to avoid the expense of extra High Court judges, this system has been devised as a compromise, and Supreme Court judges will be called upon to assist in making workable the scheme of Appeal Courts to deal with cases by way of re-hearing.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General, <Col N="652" /> I think, is hardly fair to the House.  He was rather sympathetic with Deputy Coburn on being caught by speeches from the front Opposition bench.  But what is the gist of the Attorney-General's speech?  That it is essential to appoint those judges in order that the courts might function. I think it is a very proper thing that this measure should be introduced this evening.  Earlier this evening we had a Bill which provided that in the case of any person who is applying for unemployment assistance, and who has an income of 1/- per week, that should be considered as means.  On another Bill which we had here, we are taking £100,000 of the Agricultural Grant.  I think it is a fitting conclusion to these things that we should have introduced a Bill here to appoint two men, giving them a salary of approximately £2,500 each&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a bit extravagant.  Deputy Coburn spoke here about people making speeches at General Elections and promising things they did not intend to fulfil.  But there is one class who do mean what they say, and those are the carpet-baggers who go round at election times.  Apparently, Deputy Coburn overlooked those.  Strange that the carpet-baggers came along with this Bill and helped to carry it through the House, after we have done the things that we have been doing this evening, and to which I have referred already. This Bill is a commentary on the intelligence and logic of the House, and if I were a Minister I would be ashamed to perpetrate such an act as is proposed in this Bill, especially after what we heard from the Ministers this evening. I wonder how the House is going to vote on this measure?  Are Deputies going to display any humanity at all? Are they going to vote for this thing now after the things they have cut out this evening?  I take it two judges are going to be appointed.  I am not saying that they should not get their salaries, but surely if the finances of this State <Col N="653" /> are such as have been indicated this evering in the case of the other two Bills we had before us, it is nothing short of an outrage on the country to propose what is proposed in this Bill. It is nothing short of an outrage to ask the country to bear this new burden. Deputy Belton has pointed out that the rats are leaving the sinking ship. One set of people, the limited class of carpet-baggers, are permitted to over-rule the Dáil and to carry the Fianna Fáil Party with them in support of this Bill.  I really wonder what the back-bench Deputies of Fianna Fáil will say down the country to justify their action on this measure.  The Attorney-General said that if the Party on this side of the House had been returned in 1932 the state of the country would not be considered in connection with the Bill.  If this Party were returned in 1932 the country could not possibly be in the state in which it is now.  In 1929, when the Committee on the Courts of Justice reported, this country had an export trade of £49,000,000.  Is the Attorney-General aware of that fact or has the House forgotten it?  These are the conditions.  Assume that the Bill had been introduced in 1929 or 1931, there would be some justification for it.  But what is its justification to-day, when the export trade of the country has fallen to £18,000,000?  The Attorney-General very carefully glosses over that.  The Attorney-General would be fairer to himself if he had not spoken on this measure at all. One would be inclined to think that he was piloting through this Bill for other motives.  If I were in his position, I would have left the House before I would make the speech he made.  Perhaps the Attorney-General is not aware of what the House did this evening in the case of other measures.  Surely he cannot justify the appointment of two judges at a salary of £2,500 or £3,500 each and carry the Financial Resolution and ask the House to vote for it.  In another Bill this evening the House voted that if a poor man has 1/- a week &ldquo;means,&rdquo; that that 1/- a week is to be taken into consideration when he is being granted unemployment assistance or free beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> In the same way, we are taking £100,000 off the agricultural grant. Most Deputies in the House this evening referred to the condition of the country and the state it is in.  Is the House now going to stultify itself in carrying through a Bill of this kind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy McMenamin has said with regard to the Attorney-General carrying through this measure.  We have a motion here saying that it is expedient to authorise the Government to pay further moneys out of the Central Fund in order to make further and better provision in relation to the administration of justice.  As Deputy McMenamin points out, we had some examples this evening as to the type of justice meted out to the people of this country.  We had the Minister for Local Government and Public Health standing for a long time over a section which would prevent a ratepayer getting the benefit of the credit notes authorised by the Oireachtas to be given in relief of rates, if he had not paid the first moiety of rates before the 31st October next.  He has to pay that without any appeal or escape, in spite of the fact that in the depressed state of the country ratepayers are asked to pay enormous additional sums as a result of the arrears of various kinds in respect of rates and land annuities which the people were not able to pay last year.  There is no question of the justice that is going to be meted out to the people of this country. The people are being helped in no way by the Government.  Week after week in their own arena we see instances of the type of justice that they are getting.  The people of the country have been practically put outside the courts and outside the sphere of review of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening to the people to-day?  A man may have a couple of hundred pounds' worth of cattle seized by the sheriff for a debt of £10.  He may have that couple of hundred pounds' worth of cattle sold for less than the amount of the debt, the expenses of the seizure, and the auction expenses.  The provision proposed to be made by this Bill is not going to <Col N="655" /> bring these people nearer to an arrangement under which they can get justice administered.  As a matter of fact the whole machinery to-day of the Government is to tax these people more and more and to take all possible relief further away from them.  It is not so much what has happened here to-day that is important.  One hundred thousand pounds has been saddled on the ratepayers; the recipients of unemployment assistance throughout the country are being cut down to the extent of £300,000.  That is a very discreditable state of affairs in face of the number of farmers who cannot get work and the number of unemployed people who need assistance.  That has been disclosed in the debates this afternoon. What is really more alarming is what happened here last week.  That strikes one most in connection with this measure.  The Dáil was practically shut down and prevented from having a detailed examination into the ramifications of the tax gatherer's activities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Ten million pounds extra has been taken out of the country and spent by the present Government over and beyond the taxable capacity of the country and over and beyond what it cost when the present Government came into office.  With all that heavy burden and with the increased miseries inflicted on the people we now have this additional burden put upon them &ldquo;to provide better machinery of justice.&rdquo;  Deputy McMenamin spoke of two judges being appointed at £2,500 a year.  As I understand it this is a scheme for appointing two Supreme Court judges at £3,500 a year each and an additional judge or two at £2,500. Reference was made to the operation throughout the country of a more expanding system of hearing appeals. It is very late in the day to deal with the report of the Courts of Justice Committee three years after the present Administration came into office.  We have this additional burden now before the Summer Recess and before the shutting down of the Dáil.  It has been brought in after these guillotining <Col N="656" /> motions last week for the shutting down of discussion in the Dáil.  That in reality was an attempt to stifle discussion of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>What was before us last week was a discussion of the taxation in the country and that discussion was shut down by the guillotine.  The Attorney-General now brings this before us and throws a red herring across the whole discussion here when he simply comes in and talks of the new procedure with regard to appeals.  In my opinion that has nothing at all to do with the whole business.  There are many more pressing problems in the sphere of justice alone requiring attention in this House. It is a very interesting sidelight on the Government's mind that it is so intent upon getting this new system of appeals in order &ldquo;to provide better justice&rdquo; that it does not mind what happens as to the details of taxation and whether or not they are to be discussed here. I would like to hear the Attorney-General say what particular class of the community is in a position to bear the increased cost of this Bill and what section of the community are going to get a fairer appeal in the matter of justice after the machinery contemplated here is brought into operation? One reason why this matter is brought here now is to find business for the Government for this week and so help to find an excuse for their action last week in shutting down discussion on the inflated Estimates, the burdens of which the people are called upon to bear in the present depressed state of the country.  I submit that the only reason for bringing this Bill forward now is as an excuse to cover up the action of the Government last week, and that the action of the Government last week is one of the soundest reasons why this measure should not be proceeded with now and should not be proceeded with until we have some more definite information as to what the Government are going to do to restore the economic condition of the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy may be assured that there is no special <Col N="657" /> purpose whatever in bringing forward this Bill for discussion at this stage. Before the question discussed last week arose at all, an arrangement was arrived at to take the Government amendments to this Bill now and then to re-commit it on the next Stage, so that the Government amendments, which to a considerable extent affect the amendments handed in by Opposition Deputies, could be considered from the point of view of the amended Bill when it is re-committed. It was made clear then that there was no intention of pushing this measure through this Session.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that this Bill was introduced a good while ago. It was introduced some time ago and a reasonable time was allowed to elapse to allow the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society, and numerous other interested parties to put their proposals before the Department of Justice and have them examined. In some cases there was delay in getting these proposals or suggested amendments and the comments made, particularly by the legal members of the Opposition, on the Second Reading of the Bill, some of which were helpful and some worthy of consideration, had also to be considered. Therefore, it was not until within the last week or so that this measure was ready for being brought up for discussion.  It could not be taken last week and the only hope I have for the present Session is that the Government amendments to which agreement has been got will be dealt with.  That is all I desire to have dealt with in the present Session.  The Bill can then be re-committed on the Report Stage when all the other amendments, which may not be covered by the amendments of the Department of Justice, can be taken up and discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have failed to follow many of the arguments advanced, particularly Deputy McMenamin's argument that this Bill is not necessary at present. I wonder does Deputy McMenamin maintain that the present appeal system is satisfactory?  I understood Deputy Mulcahy to say that the <Col N="658" /> system of appeal proposed in this Bill would be more expensive.  The contrary is the case.  If the Deputy or Deputy McMenamin looks up the Report of the proceedings and the evidence given before the Select Committee set up in 1929, he will find there evidence given by solicitors and others who point out the difference between the costs which obtained under the old system and under the system of appeal on shorthand notes.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine who gave evidence before that committee mentioned a case in which I happened to be engaged myself where two cases were tried as one and a decree was given against one man for £10 and against another man for £5.  The costs in the circuit court were 18/6 and 19/6.  The case went to appeal under the shorthand notes system and the costs were £70 in the case of the £5 decree and £70 in the case of the £10 decree, or £140 for decrees of £10 and £5.  Under the old system or the system which will obtain under this Bill, the most the costs would amount to would be from £9 to £11. You have examples like that all over the place.  All the legal men know of them.  Those unfortunate people, who were inured to another system, where they went into court and had their cases re-heard, after this system of appeal on shorthand notes had been adopted, had their cases heard in Dublin.  The shorthand notes were read out and these people, living in the country probably, were not allowed to give evidence.  It was stated that there might be additional evidence given.  I can assure the House that it is very difficult to get in additional evidence.  While I am not aware of any great miscarriage of justice arising under that system, it certainly has led to a good deal of dissatisfaction arising from the fact that a man who was defeated in the court below found himself in the position that he was not able to rebut evidence which he could have rebutted as he was in a position to do under the old system.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the rules that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to <Col N="659" /> would have been the slightest help or assistance.  Legal members of his own Party are of the same opinion. Let the Deputy take up the attitude that Deputy Rice has taken up here, where he unequivocally and in an unqualified way supports the restoration of the old system.  Let anybody who does not know the facts with regard to the costs incurred under the system as it obtains at present compare with the costs under the old system and he will find numerous examples similar to the example which I gave where the costs, which would be from £9 to £11 under the old Assize system, might now go up to £140.  This change is not being made for the purpose of encouraging litigation.  It is being made for the benefit of people who, unfortunately or otherwise, are often compelled to go to law, not by their own desire. Are these people not entitled to get as cheap law as can be provided for them and as satisfactory a method of dealing with their cases as the Government can provide?  Of course they are.</P>
    <P>If you want to alter the system at present obtaining you have to increase the number of judges.  The Select Committee reported unanimously and the overwhelming body of evidence was unanimously in favour of having a system of appeal by way of rehearing. If you want that system you have got to have extra judges.  I stated here this evening in reply to Deputy Cosgrave that it had been indicated to me by judges that even with the appointment of two judges they did not think that it could work satisfactorily.  We are at any rate prepared to experiment with it for twelve months or so, and if it fails or breaks down, we are prepared to come back to the House and put before it whatever recommendations we may have to make with regard to remedying that situation.  It was admitted by eminent legal men&mdash;I do not want to mention the name of any eminent legal man but if any Deputy cares to read up the report of the Joint Committee he will see that it was recommended that the Supreme Court <Col N="660" /> should be strengthened&mdash;that since the Privy Council appeal was abolished and since the Supreme Court was to be the final court of appeal, it was necessary that the Supreme Court should be strengthened.  I say that evidence was given by men than whom there are no higher legal authorities in this country.</P>
    <P>Question were asked by some Deputies as to the probable cost of this system.  I cannot give any closer estimate than that which I gave to Deputy Cosgrave and which was only tentative.  It is impossible at the moment to visualise what the exact cost will be.  There will be the appointment of two Supreme Court judges with jurisdiction in the High Court.  There will then be travelling expenses which are estimated at £1,000.  The law, however, will be brought to people's door and they will not be put to the same expense in bringing evidence before the Court. The way in which the system has previously worked out meant that appeals were brought purely on questions of law.  There were practically no appeals on questions of fact although I believe it was the intention when the 1924 Act was passed that there should be appeals on questions of fact as well as on questions of law.  In practice, however, there was no appeal on question of fact.  The system which is now proposed will bring the law practically to the people's doors, thus making it easier for people in poor circumstances to prosecute appeals. People in various parts of the country, in the west of Ireland, for instance, instead of having to come up here in future, in cases in which additional evidence might be admitted, will have their cases tried in their own country towns and will be able to produce all the necessary evidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to the question of arrears.  I cannot give the exact amount of arrears, but the reports which we have been receiving since I came to the Department of Justice indicate that there are between two and three hundred cases in arrears.  Somebody has stated that this Bill is not going to help the <Col N="661" /> wiping out of arrears.  If Deputies look at the Bill they will see that jurisdiction is given to Circuit Court judges to adjudicate in any Circuit Court area in the Free State.  The position at present is that when a Circuit Court judge is assigned to an area he can only adjudicate within that area and, even though he may be idle at various times in his own district, he has no power to adjudicate in any other area.  That disability is being removed and provision is made in the Bill that any Circuit Court judge will have jurisdiction in any area in the Free State even though he may be assigned to one particular area.  Indications were conveyed to me at various times from many Circuit Court judges that they would be very glad to assist in other areas when their time is not fully occupied in their own circuits.  It was indicated to me that these judges would be quite as well satisfied to help in wiping out arrears in the City of Dublin, for instance, as to be on an enforced holiday in their own areas. Dublin is the only place where arrears of Circuit Court work have accumulated to any extent.  This arrangement will obviate the necessity of appointing another Circuit Court judge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> We shall try as an experiment the appointment of two judges.  As to the urgency of these appointments, that is shown by the fact as stated by the Attorney-General, that pressure was brought to bear on the previous Government and indications were given throughout the country that the present system was working unsatisfactorily. That was brought to the notice of the Administration which in 1929 set up this Committee.  The Committee deliberated for some time and brought in a report based on the evidence submitted to it, recommending changes which were embodied in the Bill now before the House.  The preparation of that Bill was proceeded with during the last administration, but certain alterations had to be made in the Bill and it is now brought to this House in the ordinary way as soon as it possibly could be.  There is no point in saying that this is not the proper time to bring it before the House.  If the people of the country are suffering and have bled under a system that is unsatisfactory it is the duty of the Government to come along and give them satisfactory law at the cheapest possible price.</P>
