      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that waterworks schemes sanctioned by his Department for Mountmellick and Ballinakill, County Leix, at an approximate cost of £18,000 have now been condemned by the consulting engineer to the Laoghis County Board of Health; whether he will order an immediate investigation by his Department into the cause of same and the steps to be taken for the purpose of providing a waterworks and sewerage scheme for each of the towns mentioned and if he will recommend the provision of generous grants in each case for the purpose referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Mountmellick scheme I am aware that complaints in regard to the supply have been made to the Commissioner by the local Waterworks Committee.  Permission was given to the Commissioner to engage a consulting engineer to report on the scheme.  The engineer's report has not yet been received by the Department.  The position will be fully considered as soon as it is received.</P>
      <P>As regards Ballinakill scheme, the water at the source of supply (water collected within the demesne of Heywood House) was reported by the County Engineer to be inadequate in September last.  The gaugings then made by him showed that the estimate of yield on which the scheme was based was inaccurate.  An alternative scheme has been proposed by the County Engineer.  A consulting engineer has been engaged by the Commissioner to report thereon.  The consulting engineer's report has not yet been received by the Department.  The position will be fully considered as soon as it is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> I understand the Commissioner proposes to proceed with a sewerage scheme for Mountmellick in next financial year.  The allocation of a grant towards the work next year cannot be considered until funds for that year are voted.</P>
    <P>No proposals have been put forward to the Department for any extension of the sewerage system in Ballinakill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the reason for the delay in giving his sanction for plans and estimates for the provision of a water supply for Stradbally, County Leix, or whether he is yet in a position to approve of same, and also to state the amount of the grant to be made available to the Laoighis Board of Health for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme proposed in 1932 by the late engineer to the Board of Health provided for a supply from a well.  The yield of this well was given at the time as 40,000 gallons.  It was stated that this yield represented the driest flow at the time measured.  Satisfactory plans for this scheme were not submitted.  In September, 1934, the County Engineer who was entrusted with the completion of the plans reported that he had taken gaugings from the proposed supply and that he had found that the discharge from the well was not more than 2,500 gallons a day.  The source of supply was abandoned.  Proposals for obtaining a supply from a river have been <Col N="176" /> considered by the Commissioner, but I understand difficulties have arisen in regard to the acquisition of the water rights by reason of the possible effect of the abstraction of water required for maltings in Stradbally.  The Department is not, therefore, at present in a position to approve of any scheme.  The question of a grant cannot arise until final approval is given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum qualifications and experience required from persons seeking employment as clerks of works on housing schemes promoted by boards of health are contained in Rule 48 (2) of the Labourers (Ireland) Order, 1912, viz.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following persons shall be deemed eligible for employment as clerks of works to act under the direction and control of an architect or engineer qualified as aforesaid with respect to supervision of works: Builders' foremen, building tradesmen, or persons who have acted as clerks of works, and who can satisfy the Minister that they possess satisfactory testimonials as to competency, character, and general fitness for the post.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In many cases persons possessing higher qualifications, such as engineering or architectural degrees, have been appointed.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of sanction having been expressed to the employment of clerks of works by boards of health unless they possessed the minimum qualifications prescribed.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the following works in Laoighis County were received:&mdash;Portlaoighise, sewerage; Portarlington, water supply; Stradbally, water supply; Mountmellick, sewerage; Mountrath, sewerage; Durrow, water supply.</P>
      <P>A grant of £4,000 was allocated to the Portarlington scheme.  I have indicated in replies to other questions the position as regards Mountmellick sewerage and Stradbally water supply.  If funds are provided in next financial year the Portlaoighise scheme will be considered. The plans for the Mountrath scheme have not yet been submitted in final form for approval.  The Durrow scheme has been postponed by the Commissioner for six months.</P>
      <P>In Offaly County the following schemes were submitted:&mdash;Edenderry, water supply; Clara, water supply.</P>
      <P>The Edenderry scheme was approved in December, 1933, and a grant of £3,500 was allocated.  It is understood that the work is now completed.  An inquiry into the Clara scheme was held in May, 1934, and following on the inquiry the Board were informed that the plans would require to be revised in order to provide a more ample supply.  An alternative source has been suggested, and the engineer was to submit alternative plans accordingly.</P>
      <P>Grants were paid to the Board of Health in 1933 for extension of Grinkle water supply and repairs to dam at Longford.</P>

      <P>The number of establishments covered by the Women's Clothing and Millinery Trade Board in 1934 was 725.  While only 258 firms were inspected during the past year, these included all the larger firms so that the percentage of the total workers inspected was very much higher than the percentage calculated by firms. Contraventions of the Board's determinations were discovered in 35 cases. One-third of these were cases in which individual dressmakers were working on a small scale.  In six other cases arrears have been paid subsequent to inspection and rates adjusted to the proper level.  The rates paid in the remaining cases are still the subject of correspondence.  No prosecutions were taken in 1934.  The Board expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts of the Department to secure compliance, and I have taken steps to arrange for a more complete inspection of the firms engaged in this industry.</P>

      <P>The services of three instructresses have been dispensed with consequent on the closing of industrial centres in Donegal.  It is intended to close one other centre on 31st March.  Of the three instructresses whose services have been dispensed with, one had two years' service, one three years', and the remaining instructress eight years' service.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Milk and Dairies Bill, 1934 be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In deference to representations received from various quarters urging that additional powers should be given to sanitary authorities in regard to the registration of dairymen and purveyors of milk, the Milk Bill, 1934, was withdrawn in the last session for the purpose of having the requisite provisions included.  In drafting the new legislation, opportunity has been taken to incorporate therein, as far as possible, existing enactments for safeguarding the purity of milk and for preventing the spread of disease by infected milk.  The present Bill, therefore, embodies practically all previous legislative provisions framed for the purpose of ensuring the purity of milk intended for sale for human consumption in the form of milk.</P>
      <P>As the members of the Dáil are already familiar with the terms of the original Bill, it is only necessary on this occasion to set out in detail the additional matters which are being dealt with in the Milk and Dairies Bill, 1934.</P>
      <P>Part I. of the Bill contains preliminary and general provisions.  The principal alterations as compared with the original Bill are as follows:&mdash;A new section, No. 9, defines more precisely what are to be regarded as premises utilised by dairymen for the purposes of their business.  Section 12 replaces Section 11 of the former Bill and deals with the right of entry of sanitary officers and of inspectors to premises for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Act.  The object of this amendment is to set out such powers more clearly and to increase the penalty for obstruction of right of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parts II. and III. of the present Bill represent two new portions which have <Col N="188" /> been added to the original Bill.  Part II. provides for the registration by sanitary authorities of dairymen and dairies.  A temporary exemption from such registration is granted by Section 19 to suppliers to creameries which are authorised to sell pasteurised milk under a special designation licence. The reason for this exemption is that the milk produced by such suppliers has already for a number of years been subject to inspection in pursuance of the requirements of the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  This Part of the Bill requires every sanitary authority to keep a register of dairymen and to register the name and address of each applicant and particulars of the several premises specified in his application. If a sanitary authority are satisfied that an applicant is not suitable for registration as a dairyman they may refuse to register him or where he requests registration in respect of several premises they may refuse to register him in respect of such of these premises as they do not consider satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Every order made by a sanitary authority refusing to register an applicant or premises shall state the specific grounds on which the application has been refused.  Appeal to the Minister against any such refusal order is provided for, and he may confirm such refusal order or direct the sanitary authority to register the applicant or premises, as the case may be.  The sale of milk by unregistered dairymen or on unregistered premises is prohibited. Provisions are included for the carrying on of business for a transitory period after the death of a dairyman in order to give time for the registration of the new proprietor. Power is taken to cancel registration of any dairyman or of particular premises where the sanitary authority are satisfied that just cause for such cancellation exists.  Power of appeal to the Minister is given in respect of cancellation of registration and he may either confirm such cancellation or revoke it. Arrangements are made for rectification of erroneous entries in the register, and for annual re-registration of dairymen.  The particulars included in the register are to be admissible in <Col N="189" /> evidence in legal proceedings on the production of a certified copy of such particulars.</P>
    <P>Part III. of the Bill authorises the making of regulations by the Minister in relation to dairies and milk and the inspection of animals.  These regulations cover a wide field in regard to the construction of dairies, the cleanliness of dairies, vessels, machines and vehicles used in connection with the production and distribution of milk, the precautions to be taken for protecting milk against contamination or infection, and the methods of handling and distributing milk.  The regulations are to be made with the concurrence of the Minister for Agriculture.  The same right of temporary exemption from the provisions of this part of the Bill is given to suppliers of milk to creameries selling pasteurised milk as is given in Part II. of the Bill.  Provision is also included for the inspection of animals in dairies by veterinary inspectors or registered veterinary surgeons, and for the taking of samples of milk from any animal for examination.</P>
    <P>Part IV. of the Bill provides for the sale of milk under special designations. The only alteration in this part as compared with the original Bill is in regard to the provision dealing with fees payable for special designation licences. It is specified that such fees shall be collected in money and in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct. The Public Offices Fees Act, 1879, is not to apply in respect of any fees payable to the Minister.  Arrangements are also made for different fees being prescribed in respect of different classes of special designation licences and also in respect of special designation licences granted by the Minister and by other authorities.</P>
    <P>Part V. of the Bill deals with the prevention of disease likely to be caused by infected milk.  The only alteration in this Part is the inclusion of a new Section 41, which prohibits access to milk in a dairy by persons infected with a disease to which that part of the Act applies or by persons who have been in contact with such an infected person.</P>
    <P>Part VI. relates to the sale of milk <Col N="190" /> from diseased animals and contains only consequential alterations.</P>
    <P>Part VII. deals with bacteriological examination of milk and has been amended in Section 48 in order that the manner of examination of milk can be prescribed so as to secure uniformity as far as possible in the methods adopted.</P>
    <P>Part VIII. provides for the taking of samples of milk and has been altered in Sections 50 and 53 so as to distinguish between the procedure to be observed in sampling:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  milk contained in closed receptacles (such as bottles) for sale retail in such receptacles, and</P>
    <P>(b)  loose milk contained in churns, cans, etc.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made for the transmission direct to a bacteriological examiner of any milk sample taken on a sampling notice if such notice so specifies.</P>
    <P>Part IX. contains miscellaneous provisions. Section 55 has been altered by eliminating the reference to infected milk, seeing that the sale of such milk is already prohibited by Sections 39 and 44 of the present Bill.  A definition of contaminated milk is also added.  In Section 56 it has been deemed desirable to insert the Irish equivalents of milk, cream and buttermilk, seeing that the word milk in this part of the Act covers these classes of milk as well as separated or skimmed milk.  The latter class of milk is dealt with in the following Section 57.</P>
    <P>The following additional enactments are being repealed, viz.:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, 1878 and 1886, as the powers thereof are incorporated in Parts II. and III. of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, which will be made redundant by the passing of Section 38 of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 53 and 54 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, which will become unnecessary on the passing of Sections 59 and 42, respectively, of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, 1908, which will be no longer required in view <Col N="191" /> of the greater power of control of dairymen granted to sanitary authorities under the registration provisions in Part II. of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I may add that in framing the new Bill careful and sympathetic consideration has been given to all the points raised in discussions on the previous measure, and the legislation now proposed will, I am sure, commend itself to all persons interested in improving the methods of production and distribution of milk with a view to maintaining its purity and wholesomeness, and will ensure that increased consumption of this important article of nourishment can be encouraged with unalloyed benefit to the public health and more especially with advantage to the physical development and welfare of young children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying principles of this Bill are sound and must be welcomed by every member of the House.  There are a few points, however, that I would like to have cleared up.  I am afraid many difficulties in the way of administration may arise on this measure, but they will probably be more suitably dealt with on the Committee Stage rather than on the Second Reading.  There is one section in particular, Section 16, dealing with the financial aspects of the Bill, which I think is unfair in a certain respect. Ensuring clean milk is a necessity, ensuring pure milk is a necessity, but the chief purpose of the measure is to fight against tuberculosis.  Fighting tuberculosis in this country and in every country in the world must be regarded as a national problem.  Under our county councils there are veterinary surgeons appointed to deal with bovine tuberculosis.  Their salaries are refunded either in whole or in part by the Department of Agriculture or some Government Department.  Now, we find that this Bill, which is superseding practically all the others, is to be financed wholly out of the local rates. I do not think that that is fair.  I believe the administration of this Bill is going to present difficulties, but the Government have an opportunity at the present time of taking stock of the administration of similar measures in <Col N="192" /> other States, and in that way they ought to be able to devise a machine which will work more smoothly than could possibly be the case if we were the originators of a scheme of this sort.</P>
      <P>In Sections 10 and 11 there is a very hard and fast rule directing the sanitary authority to enforce the provisions of this measure.  I have no doubt that a number of officials will have to be appointed to see that the Act is carried out.  Ordinarily I think that the Government ought to endeavour to meet this in a national way&mdash;to meet the financial aspects in a national way &mdash;and in view of the present state of the finances of local authorities I think such a course is extremely desirable. That is my main objection to the Bill. I strongly urge the Government to consider whether this fight against disease ought not to be financed to some extent by them.  Local authorities, and particularly boards of health, are having new duties and additional expenses shoved on to them day after day.  The result is that, because of their increasing burdens, they are finding it very difficult to carry on.  I ask the Government to consider whether they ought not to regard this as a national matter, this fighting of disease.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is made clear in the Bill that milk producers who sell milk to creameries should be registered.  If they are not obliged to be registered, then another difficulty will arise.  I understand that some creameries supply whole milk and, in that case, my contention would be that every supplier of the creamery would have to be registered, even though he supplied a very small amount of milk. If they supply any whole milk, I think the suppliers ought to be registered in the ordinary way; otherwise you will not be able to work the Act, and the Act will not be worth printing if it is not administered effectively.  The barrier in this respect will be finance. It is very hard to expect local authorities to take on the additional duties and expenses which are being placed on their shoulders at the present time.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should seriously consider putting this point to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated in that this Bill is a distinct advance on the measure that was before the House a couple of months ago.  He has improved this Bill very much by accepting the suggestion then made to introduce legislation providing for the registration of dairies.  There are other sections of this measure that have also benefited to some extent by the discussion in the House, and the amendments that were submitted with the object of improving the former measure, particularly in regard to the conditions governing sampling.  Nevertheless, I am somewhat disappointed that, having had the advantage of a couple of months' consideration of the measure, and the points that were put before him in the debates in this House before Christmas, he has not accepted some more of the suggestions then made to him.  He appealed to us then to assist him as far as we could, and I think it is a little disappointing that he has not taken more advantage of the assistance offered to him.  During the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Milk Bill, I suggested that the Bill was deficient in three very important points.  The first was that there was no consideration of the possibility of eradication of tuberculosis in cattle.  If I remember aright, it was suggested that that must be dealt with separately, and I think he said that it was a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not press that point now, as it does not come within the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point to which I drew his attention was the great importance of the system of registration or licences, and he has accepted that.  The third point was that there was no power for a sanitary authority to go outside its own district and study at its source the milk that is sold in that district.  He has not seen fit to strengthen the measure in that respect.  I am disappointed that he has not dealt with that, because it is clearly of great importance. The provision in the Bill, that the local authority of a particular district may invoke the aid of a local authority of another district in order to study the milk sold in the first district <Col N="194" /> at its source in the second district, I do not think is adequate to meet the case at all.</P>
    <P>One cannot expect a local authority, working at secondhand, to oblige a neighbouring or distant local authority, to be as much interested in the manner in which milk is produced as would be the authority of the district where the people suffer if bad milk is supplied. Moreover, the local authority, let us say, of a country district which supplies milk to Dublin or Cork, will be loath to interfere with the sale of its milk in distant areas, and will certainly not exercise the same enthusiasm in securing pure milk as would a local authority such as Dublin or Cork if they could trace the milk to its source.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, although he has considered these points for some months, has not closed his mind against further consideration of them, and that he will be willing to consider on the merits any amendment put forward at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan has just drawn attention to an extremely important point, that is, as regards the expense of working the Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Bill is framed to be compulsory on local authorities, but its success will depend on the energy with which it is worked.  I can quite see such a measure as this, if it receives the hostility of local authorities, becoming a dead-letter within a year.  The interest of the local authorities must be aroused, and they must be encouraged. That cannot be done simply by stating that it is their duty to carry out the measure.  The principle which governs most health activities both in this country and in Great Britain, where they have a longer experience than we have, has been that expenses in regard to the promotion of health should be a divided charge between the local authority and the State.</P>
    <P>In regard to most undertakings there is a fair half and half division of expenditure&mdash;the State pays half and the local authority half&mdash;and the fact that the State pays half has been a great inducement to local authorities to undertake activities in regard to which they might otherwise have been slack. That is the law in regard to many <Col N="195" /> activities undertaken in this country. It is the law, and in fact is the practice, in Great Britain where, as I say, the experience is longer and more intimate than ours.  It is the law here as regards the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.  Theoretically, but not in practice, it is the law in regard to the salaries of dispensary doctors. Unfortunately, it is not the law as regards the salaries of county medical officers of health and that probably has a good deal to do with the fact, as the Minister pointed out in his very interesting broadcast a week or two ago, that many local authorities have been acting in defiance of the law in regard to the appointment of county medical officers of health for ten years this year.  If they had the encouragement they have in regard to the appointment of tuberculosis medical officers I think there is very little doubt that they would have been more speedy in obeying the law in that respect.  I hope that the Government will take that point into consideration, because I am quite convinced that thorough and energetic and enthusiastic action to protect the milk supply will not be undertaken by the local authorities unless they get some assistance from State funds.</P>
    <P>Although this measure is compulsory on the local authorities I note in regard to the control of licences and other matters that the local authorities have power to inspect but that they have no duty to inspect.  The Bill does not impose any duty upon them of inspecting dairies.  The result is that a dairyman may hold a licence for a considerable time without anything being discovered wrong with the milk because there has been no inspection of the dairies.  If the licensing system is to be effective, it will be necessary to impose on the local authorities, as was suggested in some amendments put down in regard to the Milk Bill of last year, the duty of inspecting licensed dairies at regular intervals, certainly not more infrequently than twice a year. Otherwise the licences may become almost a dead-letter and little regard will be paid by the holders of the licences to the necessity for keeping <Col N="196" /> their dairies and premises and methods of high class.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Second Reading of the previous measure it was pointed out that there were still several counties in which there was no county medical officer of health.  At that time I said that I thought there were about six and the Parliamentary Secretary corrected me and said there were only five.  I see that the Minister in his broadcast a couple of weeks ago stated there were eight, so that we are still in doubt as to the exact number. Since the Minister's statement I have noticed two further appointments gazetted, so that at the outside I do not think there are more than six and quite possibly fewer.  The Minister was hardly likely to exaggerate the number of the local authorities that had failed in their duty in that respect. At any rate, whether it is four or six or eight, there are a number of areas in which there is no machinery for administration.  The Bill provides that the dispensary doctor is to be the active officer in this respect, but one can hardly take such a suggestion as providing anything like adequate machinery.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, too, that in the provisions regarding licences the Parliamentary Secretary appears to have still in mind that even special designation licences should be granted by the local authority.  I think it would conduce to greater respect for these special designations if the grant of such licences was confined to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has just pointed out that a definition of contaminated milk has been inserted amongst the miscellaneous provisions but, as far as I can see, there is not contained in the Bill any definition of dirty milk.  That was one of the points on which the Parliamentary Secretary appealed to the House when moving the Second Reading of the other Milk Bill and two amendments were put down, each of which seemed to be fairly exhaustive.  There may be faults in them which did not appear on the surface and the Parliamentary Secretary may have good reasons for <Col N="197" /> refusing to accept either of the amendments, but I think that if he refuses to accept either of the amendments, which on the face of them appear fairly satisfactory and practicable, he should introduce a definition himself.</P>
    <P>As regards the control of sickness, both in the workers at the dairy and in the animals themselves, I do not think the conditions, though somewhat stricter than they were, are strict enough.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider an amendment which was put down for the previous Bill in reference to the occurrence of sickness of unknown cause either in a dairy worker or in an animal, and that some provision should be made for excluding a dairyman who has been sick until the cause of his sickness is known, and also preventing the milk of a cow that has been sick going into the general stock until the cause of the sickness is known. I put down an amendment to that effect on the Committee Stage of the last Bill, which was drawn up after conference with experts who had given much thought to the matter.</P>
    <P>The clauses dealing with the exemption of dairymen who supply milk to creameries seem to me to contain one very great element of danger.  I can conceive no more rapid method of spreading tuberculosis amongst the stock in a neighbourhood than supplying milk that is infected with tuberculosis to the local creamery.  The milk goes into the common stock, and it is afterwards distributed over the whole district.  If tubercle bacilli are present in milk that is distributed all over the parish, that naturally produces a large number of calves, and subsequently cows, infected with tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>In regard to pasteurisation, one has to exercise a certain amount of caution, because the efficiency of pasteurisation depends altogether on the method that is pursued and the care with which that <Col N="198" /> method is followed.  It has been shown after examination, notably in Scotland, that there was grave danger to the health of the public by milk which had been technically pasteurised.  If the milk is efficiently pasteurised its purity may not be open to question, but when the milk is not so pasteurised the criticism has considerable weight.</P>
      <P>In the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee some years ago, there was a suggestion made to which I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary on the Second Reading Debate of the previous Bill some months ago, but I do not think it received any consideration.  The Inter-Departmental Committee pointed out that it might be difficult for small producers to meet the necessary expenditure required, in order to conform with such restrictions as might be imposed on the production of milk, and suggested that there should be power to give financial help to them so that they might fit themselves to carry on their business in a way that would be satisfactory to the community and to conform to the provisions of the reformed legislation.  I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that matter again.  It is not only necessary to get the sympathy of local authorities in the operation of this Bill but it is also necessary to get the sympathy of producers in order to get milk produced under the best conditions.  It may be necessary, in order to safeguard the public health, to hold out some inducement in this way to producers to meet the requirements of the law cordially and willingly and I think that the Government should give some consideration to that recommendation of the Inter-Departmental Committee.  I welcome the improved measure and I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will improve it still further before it leaves the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Rowlette in the last few sentences of his speech has laid his finger on the kernel of this question.  As the Bill stands it is undoubtedly going to entail more expense on the producer.  In a large number of cases, people are being compelled to set up new housing for their <Col N="199" /> cattle.  A number of them will have to instal new machinery and things of that description.  If any Bill of this description is going to work as successfully as we would wish to see it work, it will have to carry with it some provision for grants or other advances to enable small producers of milk to erect proper housing and instal machinery.  It would also require a provision definitely setting out the prices that the producer will get for that milk and the price at which the milk must be sold to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as you say, A Chinn Comhairle, is a Health Bill, but what we are concerned with here, I think, is the working of the Bill afterwards. We do not want to see the Bill more observed in evasion than in fulfilment.  I suggested that the Bill will be observed more in evasion unless it carries with it some inducement to the producer to produce Grade A milk, for instance.  He is undoubtedly entitled to a decent price, and the Bill makes no provision for that.  In that way, the question of price will have to be considered on the Second Reading in conjunction with the provisions of the Bill.  I consider that a Bill of this description which makes no provision for the producer and only imposes extra expenses on him&mdash;expenses which, in my opinion, will drive a large number of the smaller producers out of the market altogether&mdash;is a matter which needs very serious attention.  This Bill will undoubtedly entail extra expense on the producer, and in a large number of cases, where their housing facilities for cattle are not what they should be, will entail driving them out of production altogether.  I think that this Bill should carry with it, side by side, a Bill from the Minister for Agriculture making provision for these things, or <Col N="200" /> that that provision should be contained in the Bill itself.  Undoubtedly the present position of the producer in many of our towns and cities is in no way an enviable one.  He is producing milk that is being sold at practically butter fat prices to the retailer.  The retailer is one of the get-rich-quick profiteers of either Dublin or Cork City, who buy the milk at 4d. per gallon and sell it at 1/8.</P>

You cannot expect a farmer to undergo large expenses and all the preparations that are entailed in providing milk under these conditions unless there is a fair price.  I think the Bill should carry with it definite provisions for a fair price for the producer, according to the different grades of milk he produces and should also carry with it a definite price for the consumer so as to end, once and for all, the profiteering in milk that has been going on, for the past ten years at any rate.</P>

      <P>I am more or less in favour of this Bill.  While I think it is a good Bill, it will entail a great deal of extra expense on producers, in order to carry out the milking of cows under the conditions set out in it.  The producers will be put to the expense of having to build houses or to put other buildings into proper condition.  It is not such an easy problem as some people might think to have cows milked in houses, and to have the milk as clean as everyone would like to have it before it is sent to the towns or the creameries.  Farmers will now have to erect cowhouses and sheds with proper floors, proper ventilation and drainage, and that will be a big expense.  In addition, there will be further expense <Col N="201" /> entailed in having new inspectors.  A great deal of that expense will also have to be borne by farmers.  If they are to keep milk in the condition that the Bill requires, some of the expenditure should be borne by the Central Fund.  If the Bill is to be a success the State should undertake to bear some of the expenses.  Producers have to bear enough expense at present without having to incur any more.  If the Bill is to be worked satisfactorily, in my opinion, it will be necessary for the State to contribute the expense that will be entailed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has in this Bill attempted to meet some of the objections that were raised to the previous Bill.  I presume the Bill is a necessity.  Every Deputy who is interested in the supply of clean, uncontaminated milk to residents in cities and towns will acknowledge generally that the Minister has produced a fairly good Bill.  But I should like to join with the other Deputies in asking the Minister to consider whether on the further stages he could not introduce a clause making a more generous allocation of State funds towards the working of the Bill.  If, as Deputy Brennan pointed out, local bodies are burdened with considerable expense in putting this measure into operation, there will be reluctance on their part to work it fully.  I objected in the previous Bill to the question of registration being introduced by Deputy Rowlette, and while we all admit that people living near cities and large towns who supply milk intended solely for human consumption should be subject to some provision&mdash;if you like some sort of registration&mdash;that need does not apply to producers of milk, rather than suppliers, in out-of-the-way parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the principle of registration I objected to in the previous Bill.  The Minister then stated that he would meet the points raised by putting a clause into this Bill excluding suppliers of milk to creameries from the registration section.  He has met us in that respect as suppliers of milk to registered premises under the Dairy Produce Act&mdash;I presume these mean <Col N="202" /> creameries&mdash;are temporarily excluded from the provision requiring registration. I should be opposed to the registration of these producers at any time or in any circumstances, as in recent years they are subject to various regulations governing the conduct of their business, which make it incumbent upon them to produce and supply clean milk.  As they are governed by innumerable regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture I would object to bringing them under the terms of compulsory registration.  I am glad that the Minister has, in a measure, met us, but I still object to Section 19.  The first sub-section excludes creameries from the operations of registration, but the second sub-section gives the Minister power, at any time, to make an order declaring that the first sub-section shall not operate.  That means, practically, that these concerns may at any time under a future Ministry, suddenly become subject to registration as well as milk suppliers in towns and cities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to wholesale regulations to register farmers, because it would entail the setting up of very cumbersome machinery and many new inspectors; an expenditure that would be altogether out of proportion to the benefits that would be obtained, especially as they are already subject to very strict regulations under another Department.  That would practically be in the nature of a bombshell to the dairying industry, in districts where milk is not supplied for human consumption, and in many cases would put numerous people out of the business.  Deputy Corry stated that small suppliers in cities would have to reconstruct their premises.  I admit that if public health officials were sent through the country they would probably declare many byres unfit for the purpose for which they are used, and would propose that the farmers should rebuild them.  If that was done it would put many farmers out of the production of milk.  I do not know if many Deputies really understand how milk is produced.  Farmers may not have the up-to-date cowhouses that are <Col N="203" /> to be found in the cities, with polished walls and other requirements.  These places are not to be seen in country districts because the farmers could not afford them.</P>
      <P>In the county I represent, as a general practice, the cows are not milked in the byres.  They are milked under probably the cleanest conditions known to man, out in the green fields under the canopy of God's sky, where there is no contamination from manure or dirt.  Milk produced under such circumstances is probably much cleaner than that produced in cities and towns.  If the regulation for wholesale registration is to be applied to the country districts it would create a tremendous agitation amongst farmers. It would be something like a bombshell to the industry and would be universally resented.  It is for that reason that I object to the principle of registration being applied to suppliers of milk to creameries.  The bulk of that milk never reaches human beings, because it is converted into cheese, butter and other commodities.</P>
      <P>As none of it is produced for human consumption as milk, the necessity for registration does not apply to such suppliers as much as to suppliers, where milk is intended for consumption in cities and towns.  With that exception I think this is a good Bill, to which there will not be any general opposition.  I ask the Minister to reconsider whether, having met us so far as temporarily to exclude farmers, he could not go the whole way, and make the exclusion of registration permanent or, at least, make it clear that the hammer will not be held over the heads of suppliers, by including here a provision which may at any time be put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Were it not for some remarks made by the last speaker I had not intended saying anything on this Bill.  Deputy Bennett approves of Section 1, but he does not approve of Section 2 which gives power to the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, to make certain premises subject to the provisions of this measure.  Some of the best <Col N="204" /> dairymen that we have had in County Dublin have been put out of business because they had to comply with so many regulations.  There was no evasion for them, as suggested by Deputy Corry, and why?  Because cheap milk, not produced under the same conditions as apply in the County Dublin&mdash;not as good milk&mdash;was dumped in Dublin.  The result was that the local men had to get out.  The creameries in Cork and Limerick, on behalf of which we had speeches from Deputy Corry and Deputy Bennett, are supplying large quantities of liquid milk to Dublin and Cork for human consumption.  Both these counties supply more liquid milk to the City of Dublin than the County Dublin itself does.  If the Minister feels that the same restrictions as regards the condition of cow houses, method of milking, and so on, are not as necessary for the production of milk used for the making of butter and cheese as for milk used directly for human consumption&mdash;if he sees that he can be more lax in the one case than the other&mdash;then I leave that question to him to decide.  In the case of milk used directly for human consumption, no matter where that milk is produced, there should be, in my opinion, a uniform method of control.</P>

      <P>If those competent to judge are satisfied by the arguments used by Deputy Bennett, well, I am. I do say, however, that creameries sending milk to the City of Dublin for human consumption should be subject to the same restrictions as producers in and around the City of Dublin.  I do not think it is any hardship on any man to use concrete lavishly in a cowshed because it pays him to do so.  If there are men who cannot see the economy of doing that, then the Government should force them to practise that economy because work of that kind will pay for itself.  It will tend to make the animals more comfortable, and there is no use in keeping cows if they are not comfortable.  The more comfortable and the healthier the cows are the more milk they will give. People of experience know the difference <Col N="205" /> there is in the supply of milk which cows give during mild weather and cold weather.  I am sure it will be news to Deputy Bennett to hear that we, in Dublin, must keep a wash basin, clean water, soap and a towel in the cowshed.</P>

      <P>Then where is your grievance?  And the milker must have a white overall and wash his hands after the milking of each pair of cows. I think that is a cleaner and a better system than the one Deputy Bennett spoke about of milking under the canopy of heaven.  I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Brennan, Deputy Bennett and Deputy Corry that the expense of this measure should be borne on the Central Fund.  This question of a milk supply is a national one and, therefore, I think the Government should respond to the appeal that has been made.  Speaking as a Dublin representative, I want to say that, in my opinion, this measure, when it becomes an Act, should be made operative over the whole country.  Acts of the Oireachtas passed by this and the previous Government, having for their object the bringing about of an improvement in the health of human beings and of animals are, in my opinion, very well administered by the local authorities despite what Deputy Dr. Rowlette said.  They are impartially and efficiently administered, but it would be most unfair to milk producers in the city and county of Dublin if they were to be squeezed out of the market because milk producers in other counties were not obliged to observe the conditions laid down in this Bill.  Regulations dealing with the production of milk are carried out in a very thorough way in the city and county of Dublin, in Meath and in Kildare, but I think in most counties there is a great deal of laxity.  I regard the Bill as a good one, and I again urge on the Minister to see that no county is given an option as to whether it will enforce its provisions or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>As County Meath supplies a considerable quantity of milk to Dublin, I naturally have some interest in this measure.  I think that it represents a good attempt to solve <Col N="206" /> the problem of providing clean and healthy milk for the people of this city. That, of course, will involve some expense. It is important to have maintained for the City of Dublin not only a clean milk supply, but one that will be uniform in quality and constant. The position to-day is that there is no uniformity about the supply of milk to Dublin.  The principal complaint made by dairymen down in County Meath&mdash; we have at least three distributing centres there controlled by proprietors who convey the milk to Dublin&mdash;is that they constantly find a surplus of milk left on their hands.  They say that is due to the almost unlimited quantities of milk that reach Dublin from all parts of the country.  It comes in spasmodically. During the past few days there has been a shortage again but, during the week before last, there seemed to be a considerable supply of milk coming in from some place.  Nobody seems to know where it came from.  The railways did not indicate any increase.  It must have come through other channels and it left a surplus in the hands of the dairymen, Dublin dairymen included, I suppose.  It is not possible to dispose of surplus milk in a short time.  That state of affairs is a great source of loss and this registration would, to a large extent, obviate that loss if it were insisted upon.  I take it that to insist on registration and on up-to-date methods will put quite a number of small men who have not the necessary capital to change over out of action.  For the benefit of the public-health, they must be put out of action if they cannot conform to the terms laid down by the sanitary authority. A number of farmers have objection to these inspectors and officials coming to their premises.  In general, the real source of the objection is that they have not the capital to make the necessary changes.  It is extraordinary how little money was spent on the supply of milk to children in County Meath.  I made inquiries about the matter.  The money was there to pay for the milk and the children were there to drink it, but quite a number of people who were in a position to supply the milk were afraid to do so lest the public health authorities should come <Col N="207" /> down upon them and compel them to carry out changes in their dairies.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to secure a uniform and clean supply of milk to the city.  The city is paying for that milk.  The price being paid is sufficient to maintain a continuous supply and sufficient to give a profit to the farmers. The fact, however, is that milk in County Meath is sold at 7d., while it is sold here in the city at 14d.  I think that Deputy Belton will agree with me that a price of 7d. or 8d. is not sufficient to enable a producer to keep going. Therefore, in order to ensure the success of this Act something more is necessary.  Financial assistance should be given.  Many Deputies here justly advocated that course.  The price being paid for milk leaves plenty of room for that.  In between the producer and consumer there is great profiteering, or if not there is extravagance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be uncertainty, because the supply is not uniform or controlled, and nobody is able to estimate what it will be from time to time. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied that this form of registration will give the certainty of which the Deputy speaks.  That certainty is necessary. In other words, the producer ought to be able to invest capital in his business with the object of producing the very best milk without being open to the danger of being left with a surplus because of a sudden inspiration to somebody in the country or because somebody avails of a cheap lorry going to town and forestalls him in the market.  The increased supply would, of course, result in reduction of price. It is necessary to pay a good price to get proper milk.  If some steps could be taken to guarantee a market to the producer, and if there were certainty of demand, I believe the stability that is necessary would be created.  If the section which covers registration is worked to the full, it may do that.  I believe it is possible to bring about those results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the real reasons why <Col N="208" /> farmers have not gone into milk production in this country as they should have done, and as they have done in other countries.  They have never been sure that they would not be forestalled on the market.  That is the main difficulty. In Meath, this question of milk production has developed, and we have a new milk distributing station known as the Royal Meath Dairy.  That concern has quite a considerable amount of capital, and is, I believe, installing machinery at a cost of about £4,000. That is a step in the right direction, and every assistance should be given to people who see, from a business point of view, the necessity for providing the city with a clean and proper supply of milk.  At first, these people were afraid to venture upon that because a creamery might have lapsed at no great distance and there was nothing to prevent an increased supply of milk reaching the city.  I understand that they are now about to adventure on that business, and, if they do, I believe it is up to the consumers and to the Government, representing the consumers, to guarantee that they will have a certain market so that they may be able to go on with their business.</P>

      <P>I want to express once again my strong objection to the principle that one man should call the tune while another pays the piper.  A practice has grown up in this State during the past ten years of increasing mandatory services on the local authorities. It is very easy to understand why.  It is far easier to put a Bill through this House unconnected with a Money Resolution than it is to put through a Bill necessitating a Money Resolution.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were obliged to tell us what the administration of the scheme was going to cost, this House would sit up and take notice. But we are going to impose on local authorities what, in my opinion, is going to be an extremely costly scheme. Having imposed it upon them, we are going to tell them that they must find the money.  Everybody in this House is concerned to secure free milk and to prevent the recurrence of diseases which are normally caused by the consumption of impure milk.  But the <Col N="209" /> Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health knows as well as I do that if the boards of health and the county councils meet this Bill or Act in a grudging spirit and feel that it is an imposition upon them, it will be impossible to administer the measure efficiently.</P>

My experience of public bodies is comparatively short, but I must say that I have found that, where the board of health is labouring under a grievance, one does not get that co-operation that makes for efficiency.  The Deputy will remember that, in respect of the appointment of county medical officers of health, many of the boards of health resisted the law for years because they were required to find the money to supply the service.</P>

I am with the board of health as regards the question of expense. That should not be borne by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest doubt that, in due course, the central government will be able to coerce the local authorities into operating the letter of the law.  But we will find that if we want to avoid the spirit of legislation we can very often conform <Col N="210" /> with the letter of the law by constant postponement.  My point is that if this House is sincere in its desire to provide a pure milk supply for the people, the best proof of that desire is to furnish the requisite money.  That money is going to come from the people in any case.  If we distribute the cost of that over all the people of the country, nobody will be able to measure the cost, but if all the burden is heaped upon a small section of the community, that section has to exercise prudent economy.  If it is spread all over the country, no such pressure can be brought to bear in a scattered way.</P>
      <P>In this particular case I object, but on general principles I object to this whole system of coming down on local authorities and compelling them to set up local services and then compelling them to bear the cost.  This House should take responsibility, in my opinion, for the expense.  If the central government feels that the people are responsible for certain social services, this House should also know the cost which such social services will entail on the community.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to see some scheme for the supply of pure milk succeed, but Deputy Rowlette said that he hoped that before this Bill is passed, measures would be taken to secure that every dairy must be inspected at least twice a year.  Now, a dairy, as defined in Section 6 of this Bill, is &ldquo;any farm, farmhouse, cowshed, milk store, milk shop, or other place from which milk is supplied on or for sale, or in which milk is kept or used for purposes of sale,&rdquo; etc.  That means that any farm, upon which milk is produced for sale in its raw state to the consumer, is, for the purposes of this Act, a dairy. Do Deputies realise the magnitude of the task of inspecting every such dairy at least twice a year, and do they realise the expense that would be involved?</P>

      <P>You are competing with your more cheaply-produced milk <Col N="211" /> against us.  Where it is a question of a number of scattered farms, the problem becomes comparatively simple, but where you have an inspector, moving between one district and the other, that is where the expense begins to pile up.  Now, I see enshrined in another part of this Bill a portion of the Bill that seems to me to be extremely obnoxious: and that is where a man applies for and is refused registration, but seeks, under Section 22, to appeal against such refusal to the Minister.  It seems that there is no further appeal in that case.  I can see no reason whatever, so long as we have courts in the country which have a guarantee of immunity against interference, why the appeal should not lie against the authority of the district justice.  The grounds of the appeal must be stated, and I take it that the only grounds upon which the application can be refused are for a breach of some regulation which the Minister has made under Section 30.  Now, the district justice is just as competent to decide on the matter of fact about people who are living in his normal area of jurisdiction as is the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  The applicant can bring the county analyst or some local official as a witness, and, which is more important, can appear in person himself and make his case, whereas, if he comes to Dublin, nothing will convince the people in the country that he has had a fair hearing of his appeal.  Therefore, I suggest that instead of having his appeal to the Minister, there should be an appeal from the local authority to the district justice, and, in the event of the local authority refusing, the district justice should be constituted the licensing authority and have the right to reopen the case and grant a licence if it is thought fit to do so.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is the intention to take down the amendments, which we proposed on the old Bill, to this Bill, or must they be re-submitted?  They must be re-submitted, according to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Well, then, under Section 38, paragraph (a), it is provided that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> If the medical officer of a sanitary district has reason to suspect that any disease... is caused, or is likely to be caused, by the consumption of any milk which is being exposed or kept for sale within such sanitary district, he shall ascertain the location of the dairy... and, if such dairy is within such sanitary district, he shall examine the dairy and, if he so thinks fit, any person engaged in the serving thereof, or resident in the dairy, or who may be resident in any premises where any person employed in such dairy may reside, and shall, if necessary, require the veterinary officer to accompany him and to examine the animals therein.</P>
    <P>I know of no legislation which gives a medical officer of health the right, arbitrarily, to examine medically somebody whether they wish to submit to that examination or not, and I regard it as an altogether intolerable infringement of individual liberty for a man or a woman who is working as a dairy employee, to have to leave himself or herself open as to whether he or she is willing to submit to such an examination on the promise of employment.</P>
    <P>I can quite see that the circumstances here obtaining would justify an Act providing that unless the employee was prepared to submit to examination, or to produce, from a qualified medical practitioner a satisfactory certificate, the medical officer of health could close the dairy or require that person to withdraw altogether until he or she produced satisfactory evidence of good health.  But I warn the House again that, if power is given to medical officers to examine a citizen of this country, with or without his or her consent, they are doing something that is highly undesirable, and that may inevitably develop into further encroachment in the name of public weal upon individual liberty.  I feel so strongly upon this that I may be tempted to use violent language; and I feel it particularly in as much as this examination is to be carried out on persons employed.  The fact that a man is earning his living does not entitle any medical officer, or any other Government official, to interfere with <Col N="213" /> his liberty.  There will be no attempt made to suggest that any general medical officer would be entitled to interfere with the citizens of the State in that way for the purpose of preventing possible danger to public health.  I cannot emphasise too strongly that I am quite prepared to accept a proviso authorising medical officers to examine medically the person himself, or, in the alternative, to be shown a certificate of health from a qualified medical practitioner that would satisfy him that the person was in good health, but I strongly object to giving the medical officer of health power to examine, without the consent of the examinee.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with Deputy Dillon in what he stated about the propriety of an appeal to the District Justice.  After all, the District Justice lives on the spot; he is conversant with the local circumstances, and he has all the facts before him when he pronounces his judgment.  The Minister living here in Dublin has to depend upon a report of an inspector, who is sent down probably hurriedly, and who has neither the time nor the opportunity to inquire into all the circumstances of the case.  On a former occasion when this, or a similar Bill, was before the House, and was withdrawn in order to draft the Bill now before us, I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that he was in favour of such an appeal to the District Justice.  With all the emphasis in my power I ask him again to reconsider the position because he must know as well as any Deputy in this House, that the proper person to deal with questions of this kind is not an itinerant inspector from Dublin, but a person on the spot, who can call witnesses and who can inspect the buildings in reference to which a licence may be refused by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised here that are searcely relevant to this Bill at all. Deputy Brennan talked about the fight against disease in general being a <Col N="214" /> national fight, and went on to dwell upon the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle as being, in particular, a matter that ought to be dealt with on national lines.  This Bill has nothing whatever to do with the cradiction of tuberculosis in cattle. As I said, when the previous Bill was before the House, the question of the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle is one for the Minister for Agriculture, and, I said then, that it was having the attention of the Minister for Agriculture. I have had several discussions with him on the subject before the introduction of the last, and, even, since the introduction of this Bill.  I can assure the House that the Minister for Agriculture is fully alive to the pressing need for dealing with that particular aspect of the spread of tuberculosis.  I believe, in the near future, as soon as the pressure of urgent legislation allows of it, the Minister for Agriculture will introduce a Bill dealing with that particular matter.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of confusion of thought in regard to the position of creamery suppliers under this Bill.  The Bill deals with the production and sale of milk for human consumption.  So far as the suppliers of creameries are concerned, if these creameries are engaged merely in the manufacture of butter and cheese this Bill does not affect them.  The Minister for Agriculture has his own machinery, under the Dairy Produce Act, for regulating and ensuring purity and cleanliness in the supply of milk to creameries for manufacturing purposes. If a creamery sells or distributes milk for human consumption, in the form of milk, then the supplier of that creamery would come within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would let me explain the position it might not be necessary to interrupt at all.  I am not aware&mdash;I may not be completely informed on the subject&mdash;of any <Col N="215" /> creamery that supplies ordinary milk for human consumption.  As far as my information goes creameries that distribute milk for consumption distribute pasteurised milk only, and the suppliers of such creameries are temporarily exempt from the scope of this Bill.  Deputy Bennett complained that temporary exemption does not altogether meet his point.  At any rate temporary exemption will continue until the Minister for Agriculture is satisfied that it would be advisable to extend the full scope of the Bill to suppliers of such creameries.  Such creameries under this Bill when it becomes an Act will be supplying designated milk, namely pasteurised milk, and such creameries will have to comply with the same regulations&mdash;not the supplier but the creameries&mdash;as any other licence holder of special designation milk.  I think that is only reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rowlette, on the subject of pasteurisation, very truthfully conveyed to the House that pasteurisation might be carried out in such a way as to be absolutely useless as a safeguard against the spread of infection, but, under this Bill, regulations having uniform application governing pasteurisation will attach to a licence to produce or sell pasteurised milk, and the special plant or machinery that may have to be used will be prescribed by the Minister.  All these regulations will be laid on the Table of the House, and the House will have an opportunity of discussing them and, if dissatisfied, getting a majority of the House to disagree with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion on the question of the cost of the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act, and many Deputies have advocated very strongly that the cost of administering it should be borne by the State.  Leaving that principle aside for the moment and coming to the probable cost of administering the Bill, I confess that I cannot see that that administration is going to involve local authorities in any considerable cost at all.  The Bill will be administered in the main by the county medical officer of health.  He is already an <Col N="216" /> official of the local authorities, and the State is contributing very substantially towards his salary and travelling expenses.  We have our veterinary staffs already appointed, and I do not anticipate that there is going to be any elaborate machinery necessary at all. We shall certainly have to allocate duties to existing officers under the Bill, but I do not anticipate that it will be necessary to have many appointments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rowlette also complained that we were taking power to inspect dairies under this Bill, but that there was no duty to inspect.  Though he is not in the House at present, I had better deal with the points that were disturbing him in order that his mind may be clear before the later stages of the Bill are reached.  Section 10 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the sanitary authority to enforce the provisions of this Act and of every order and regulation made thereunder ....</P>
    <P>The local authorities in order to comply with Section 10 will have to see that these inspections are carried out and that the conditions attaching to licences and registration are being observed.</P>
    <P>On the question of the dispensary doctors having to administer this Bill in certain parts of the country as medical officers of health, I think that by the time this Bill becomes law, that particular difficulty will not arise at all.  There is only one county outstanding where the necessary steps are not being taken to have a county medical officer of health appointed, and in that one county we are taking the necessary steps to compel that county to fall into line with the others, so that there need be no anxiety on that score.  We will have uniformity.  Deputy Rowlette also expressed anxiety at the contemplation of local authorities issuing special designation licences.  I think that, in the earlier stages, at any rate, until standards have become more or less uniform, it may be considered advisable to have such special designation licences issued by the Minister, but at any rate, the Bill gives power to the Minister to issue such licences, or the local authorities, and as our standards are raised and local authorities realise <Col N="217" /> the necessity of insisting on these standards for special designation licences being maintained, it will be possible, I think, to place without any risk, the responsibility for the issue of these licences on the local authorities, and probably some local authorities who already appreciate the importance of the matter could very well be entrusted with the full responsibility at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have also had a good deal of discussion on the question of providing financial assistance to dairymen in connection with the alterations they may have to make in their dairy premises under the terms of this Bill, and we have had discussion on the price of milk and the whole economic aspect on this branch of agricultural industry. Again, of course, this being purely a public health Bill, these matters are not appropriate to it at all.  They are matters for the Minister for Agriculture and whether he can find any solution along the lines suggested or not, I am not in a position to say.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry complains that the Bill will drive a large number of small dairymen out of the business.  I do not see any earthly reason why it should. As a matter of fact, the provisions that have alarmed some Deputies are statutory requirements already.  The provisions as to the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, drainage and water supply of cowsheds and dairies and the precautions to be taken by persons following the trade of cow-keepers or dairymen are already statutory requirements under the Dairies and Cowsheds and Milk Shops General Order, made under the Contagious Diseases of Animals Act of 1878 and 1886.  Deputies were probably not aware of the fact that these statutory requirements already existed and I suppose they possibly had come to the conclusion that there might perhaps be a more rigid enforcement of these requirements in future than in the past.</P>

But the Minister with his expert advisers would be in a better position to adjudicate on a public health matter than the district justice.  We have heard a good deal of discussion on the subject of costs.  Now an appeal to the Minister would be much less costly than an appeal to the court. I hope it has not any special significance, but I cannot fail to observe the fact that the Deputies who want an appeal to the court instead of the Minister are lawyers&mdash;whether that has anything to do with it or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will deal with that point too.  I am assuming that Deputy Belton is one of the farmers' representatives. Deputy Rowlette seemed to be very disappointed that we did not include in the provisions of the new Bill powers of extra territorial inspection.  The necessity for including these powers in the Bill is not apparent to me in the light of the terms of the present Bill.  It is a matter that other Deputies as well as Deputy Rowlette have been interested in.  I would refer them to Section 9 of the Bill, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A dairyman shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to carry on the business of a dairyman at every premises used by him for the purposes of his business as a dairyman.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person carrying on the business of a dairyman in a sanitary district does not occupy any premises in such sanitary district for the purposes of such business, every vehicle which such person uses for the purposes of such business shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be premises in such district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is not a new principle at all.  Perhaps, the Deputy would, between now and the Committee Stage, look up the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) <Col N="221" /> Regulations, 1929.  On page 9, he will find in Part 3, paragraph 2 (1) this regulation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a medical officer of health has grounds for suspecting that any person in this area who is employed in any trade or profession concerned with the preparation or handling of food and drink for human consumption is a carrier of Enteric Fever or Diphtheria or Dysentery infection, he will report accordingly to the Sanitary Authority, who may give notice in writing to the responsible manager of the trade or business concerned, certifying that for the purpose of preventing the spread of the disease they consider it necessary for their medical officer of health, or a medical officer acting on his behalf, to make a medical examination of such suspected person, and the responsible manager and all other persons concerned shall give to the medical officer of health all reasonable assistance in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that this is not a new principle at all.  To my mind, it is a principle that is very necessary to embody in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer, but in any case it has the force of law. That appears to be the material consideration. Surely, if the medical officer of health has reason to suspect contagious disease such as diphtheria, enteric fever, dysentery or typhoid fever or if he has reason to believe that a particular person who is engaged in the dairy industry is responsible for the spread of any or all of these diseases he should be empowered to make the necessary examination and in the interests of public health he should be in a position to examine the person concerned. It may be a typhoid carrier or a diphtheria carrier, but it is a very serious matter from the public health <Col N="222" /> point of view.  I must say I am surprised at Deputy Dillon's attitude on this matter.  There is no new principle whatever involved in it.  It is an absolutely essential power to give to the county medical officer of health if he is not to be hampered in tracing an epidemic of infection that may be of a very serious character.  I think, on the whole, that the Bill is considered very satisfactory by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>He can.  Dealing with the position of the individual farmer I may say that I am not concerned with the farmer who supplies milk to a creamery or the farmer who habitually or ordinarily sells milk in a town or city for human consumption, but there is a practice in many parts of the country, in rural Ireland particularly, where in a certain season of the year a man with one or two cows that may happen to run dry gets a supply for a temporary period from his neighbours and pays them.  I have been looking into this question with my technical advisers and we are anxious that such a farmer should be excluded because he is not a purveyor of milk in the ordinary sense and, if he were to be subject to the full restrictions of the Bill, it would inflict a hardship on him and probably it would inflict a hardship on some of his poorer neighbours.  If it is necessary to have that position clarified in <Col N="223" /> the definition of dairying, we will have it done at a later stage.  A farmer who is not habitually or continuously engaged in the sale of milk will be excluded from the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In connection with the scheme for the distribution of milk to poor people, I may say that there are many farmers, some of them neighbours and relations of mine who, just to help out the scheme, have been in the habit of giving a little milk to the relieving officers for distribution.  If they were to be brought under the restrictions contained in this Bill a lot of them would cease giving that milk.  They do it voluntarily at the moment in order to help out the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not be in such full agreement, perhaps, when I have finished.  In the second place, it is intended for a class of children who are usually below the normal physically. In the light of these two facts the Deputy will agree with me that it is essential that we should insist that such children will get a pure milk supply. The State is paying for the milk, and I would be very slow to acquiesce in the expenditure of State funds to provide milk for necessitous children if it did not carry with it an absolute assurance that that milk was safe and wholesome and pure.  I will look into that point, but my reaction at the moment is against giving any facilities to that particular type of supplier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not an opportunity of listening to the Minister's statement last evening, and I must rely on the rather meagre reports of the discussion which appeared in the daily papers.  I notice that the Minister started off with the remark that the excess expenditure which he asks for in this Vote is, in the main, due to the greater activity of the Land Commission.  That, certainly, is an interesting statement, and I can imagine the grim smile that must have come on the faces of even some of the Deputies behind the Minister, because the complaints about the slowness in dividing land are not confined to the Opposition Party here. They, in fact, are interested in the question only to a very slight extent. The complaints come mainly from the Minister's supporters.  If the Minister read&mdash;and I am sure he has done so&mdash; the reports of meetings of the Fianna Fáil Executives which appeared in his own paper, the <i>Irish Press</i>, within the last few months, he will realise there is general discontent in the ranks of his own supporters at the delay in dividing land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite easy to understand why there should be so much discontent in view of the promises which were made <Col N="225" /> by the party, of which the Minister is a member, before they were returned as the Government.  We were told at one time that land distribution would proceed four times faster than under the previous Government.  Notwithstanding that promise, we find now that land distribution is proceeding at a slower pace than at any other period since the 1923 Land Act was passed. It is very hard to get reliable figures on this subject.  Figures have been given to the Dáil during the past few months and, when we compare them with the figures published in the Official Report, it is difficult to reconcile them.  I have gone to the trouble of comparing the figures in the two last reports issued by the Land Commission, the reports for 1932-33 and for 1933-34, and I find on an average there were approximately 15,000 acres of land less distributed by the present Government than was distributed by the late Government during the last four or five years of their administration.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will recognise that the first year of his administration was a much better year than the present year is likely to be, because, so far as I can understand, until the last month or so there has been practically no activity whatsoever in the country in regard to the distribution of the land.</P>
    <P>Practically all this money is required for the purpose of improving estates distributed by the Land Commission and the first thing that strikes me about this estimate is the abnormal increase that has taken place in the money usually granted for the purpose of improving estates.  Normally, the figure up to last year was somewhere about £200,000.  This year, including this supplementary estimate, the figure will be £330,000.  At the outset, I should like to ask the Minister what all this money is required for and where and how is it to be spent?  In view of the fact that land distribution is proceeding at a much slower rate than during the administration of the last Government, I cannot understand, and no member of this Party can understand, why the money asked for expenditure on improvement of estates should have increased from £200,000 to £330,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> Normally this money is devoted towards the fencing, draining, making of roads, reconstruction of houses, and building of houses on estates actually divided, and, in addition, I assume, portion of the money is for the purpose of improving these holdings which have already been provisionally vested and which I hope will shortly be vested finally.  So far as I can understand from Land Commission figures and reports, I cannot see that any substantial amount of money has been devoted to the improvement of holdings which are between the stage of provisional vesting and final vesting, so that it is only legitimate to assume that all this money at present is being devoted exclusively towards the improvement of estates which have been divided, or are being divided by the Land Commission. Certainly, an increase of £130,000, in view of the fact that the Land Commission presently is dividing at least 15,000 acres of land less than was divided during the administration of the late Government, requires some explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor in charge of the Land Commission started his career by rushing his inspectors all round the country for the purpose of reporting on the suitability of holdings, whether large or small, for the purpose of acquisition.  The inspectors were sent to these holdings regardless of the existing circumstances or conditions and, in some cases, holdings as low as £20 valuation, and even less, were reported on, with the result that a feeling of insecurity and uncertainty was created.  As a matter of fact, in almost every case in which an inspector was sent to report on such a holding, the owner feels in the same degree of uncertainty and insecurity to-day.  All the farms on the lists supplied by the Fianna Fáil clubs were reported on by the inspectors, I think, during that period and, if one is to judge by the things which are happening in the Land Commission to-day, the Fianna Fáil clubs to a very large extent dictate the policy of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Land Commission inspectors are paid by the State to do a certain very important and very responsible work, but those inspectors have been sent round <Col N="227" /> the country for the purpose of investigating the foolish, mean, and, in the majority of cases, the highly-prejudiced reports sent in by the secretaries and members of Fianna Fáil clubs.  As I said, these men are paid by the State to do very important work, and it is a scandal that they should be made to do the political work of any Minister for the purpose of enquiring into complaints inspired purely and simply by Party motives.  It is no wonder that land distribution is proceeding at such a slow rate when the time of the inspectors is devoted very largely to investigating complaints sent in by the secretaries and members of the Fianna Fáil clubs.</P>
    <P>No matter how ridiculous or how foolish the complaint is, the Minister feels that he must send an inspector down the country to investigate that complaint.  If a person working under a ganger engaged on a work of improvement is seen to be wearing a cap which bears any resemblance to a beret a report is usually sent in by the secretary or a member of the Fianna Fáil club and an inspector is solemnly sent out to report as to the reason why this man is employed and why he should be wearing such a cap. I have heard of one case where a man was wearing a cap which, probably, outwardly had the appearance of a beret, but which was really an ordinary cap with the peak turned inside. Some member of a Fianna Fáil club sent in a report to the Minister that this man was wearing a beret and, naturally, it was assumed he must be a member of a certain organisation which is not popular with the Minister or his Party.  An inspector was sent out to report on what sort of a cap the man was wearing.  One can readily and easily understand why land distribution is proceeding at such a slow pace when the Minister thinks it is his duty to investigate the foolish, mean, and contemptible complaints sent in by his supporters throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is another item here which occurs to me as being somewhat abnormal&mdash;the loss on untenanted land.  I do not know what the actual <Col N="228" /> estimated loss is, but whatever it may be, apparently that loss has been increased according to this Estimate by another £2,000.  I realise perfectly well that the Land Commission did get certain additional powers under the Land Act of 1933 for the purpose of taking over possession of untenanted land before they were in a position to distribute it.  The Minister, I think, must realise by now that such a policy is not a wise one and that if pursued at the present rate it will mean a huge loss of revenue to the State eventually. When the last Government was in power&mdash;and they managed things in a much more businesslike way than the present Government&mdash;there was a reasonably substantial loss on the management of untenanted land taken over before the Land Commission was actually in a position to divide it, and it was discovered that there was no advantage whatever to the Land Commission in taking over possession of land before the scheme was actually ready.  I wonder if the Minister intends to pursue the policy, which he has been pursuing since he got control of the Land Commission, of taking over possession of untenanted land long before the scheme is ready for the distribution of that land.  What happens as a general rule is that the land is let, probably to the man who originally owned it, or probably to some other man in the neighbourhood, but invariably at a loss.  Certainly in the present circumstances of the country, I venture to think that in every case in which he has let land, of that kind, he has let it at a loss.  If he continues that policy, of taking over land in the manner in which he is taking it over, does it not follow quite naturally that the loss in the management of such lands is bound to increase?  After all, would it not be well for the Minister to take a leaf out of the book of his predecessors and withhold taking possession of such lands until such time as the scheme for the distribution of them is ready and thereby save the State a substantial sum of money?</P>
    <P>There is one other item, a comparatively small sum of £300, for the purpose of making provision for the <Col N="229" /> migration of certain people from the Gaeltacht to the County Meath.  I understand the Minister has a scheme in readiness for the migration <i>en masse</i> of a big number of residents of the Gaeltacht to an estate which he has acquired in County Meath.  It was always the policy of his predecessor to relieve congestion in the Gaeltacht but apparently the Minister is not satisfied with the methods pursued by his predecessors and he has embarked on an entirely new method.  I wonder if the Minister has taken into consideration all the factors involved in a scheme of migration such as is now proposed?  It was the policy of the late Government to pick out the big farmers in the Gaeltacht areas and to migrate them to counties like Meath, Westmeath, Kildare and Dublin.  Quite a big number of such farmers were migrated during the last seven or eight years, and on the whole, that scheme worked quite satisfactorily.  It was carried out at a minimum of cost. The Minister apparently has abandoned that method and he now proposes to migrate colonies of residents in the Gaeltacht to an estate or estates which he has acquired in the County Meath.  I assume other estates will be acquired in neighbouring counties in course of time.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister envisaged the possible consequences of such a scheme as that upon which he is now about to embark?  It appears to me that such a scheme will involve a three-fold system of migration, that the cost will be enormous and that there is always the risk, a very grave risk, that such a scheme or schemes will fail.  The Minister has the experience of the Congested Districts Board to fall back upon.  They embarked many years ago on mass migration.  They continued it for a certain number of years but eventually&mdash;and, mind you, these schemes were carried out under far better conditions than those under which the Minister will be able to carry out his schemes&mdash;after a few years they abandoned these schemes of migration because they recognised that they were not, and could not be, a success.  Has the Minister considered <Col N="230" /> the conditions under which the people he proposes to migrate are living at the present time and the conditions under which they will have to live after they are migrated, probably to the very best lands, in Meath, Westmeath or Kildare, as the case may be?  How can any landless man, say, who is half fisherman and half farmer, and who has been accustomed all his life to work and live on the bad land of Connemara, ever be expected to be a success under entirely new conditions on a completely different class of land in County Meath?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had been listening to me he would have heard me explain that it was the big farmers we migrated.  Of course he is always anxious to score a point for his friends. I explained quite clearly that during the lifetime of the last Government it was their policy to migrate the big farmers from the Gaeltacht areas, and to divide the land which they had left behind, amongst the smaller type of farmer because it appeared to us that the big farmer had a better chance of succeeding on the lands of Meath or Westmeath than the smaller man who probably never left his own immediate neighbourhood or at most had only travelled a short distance from it.  The big farmer, on the other hand, was in the habit of attending fairs round the country and even of attending the Dublin markets occasionally. He understood conditions in the eastern counties and there was therefore a better chance of his succeeding when migrated to these counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes migrating not alone the big men, but in addition, to take away the small men.  He will <Col N="231" /> establish them as a colony somewhere in Meath on a class of land to which they have never been accustomed and on which they can never hope to succeed. I agree that something must be done to relieve conditions in the Gaeltacht, but I believe he is pursuing the wrong method, a method which is going to cost this State an enormous expenditure of money, and a method which, it appears to me, cannot succeed no matter what assistance, whether in the way of officials or of money, the Minister is prepared to give these people.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point.  In the distribution of land, latterly, I notice that the tendency is to distribute the land amongst landless men and workers.  Is that the policy which the Minister proposes to continue in future? What becomes of the problem of congestion? After all, land is acquired for the purpose of relieving congestion. There are, in every part of the country, men living on very small and very congested holdings but judging by the manner in which the activities of the Land Commission have developed recently in the distribution of land, it seems to me, no matter how low a man's valuation may be, if he is in possession of any land at all, he is not likely to get any addition to his holding and the land for distribution is to be given exclusively to landless men and workers.  I admit that these men are entitled to land according to the provisions of the Land Acts but I hold also that land should be acquired mainly for one purpose and that is for the relief of congestion.  I wonder is it to be the policy of the Land Commission in future to depart from the principle enshrined in the Land Act of 1923, namely to distribute land for the relief of congestion, and if, in future, they are going to give it exclusively to landless men and workers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Roddy, I think the Minister is entitled to be commended for asking for the additional sum that he seeks in this Estimate, because I assume that all the additional money asked for, under the subhead referring to the improvement of the estates, will be spent in a useful <Col N="232" /> manner.  Whether it is going to increase the expenditure per acre of the land divided, as compared with what was expended when Deputy Roddy had responsibility, is a different matter altogether.  I believe, from any knowledge I have, that most of the money goes in wages to workers for carrying out useful work.  I am certain that if additional money per acre is being spent by the present Minister, it is going to produce better results from the point of view of the productivity of the land later on.</P>
      <P>I have been looking through the returns furnished by the Minister to the members of this House recently, showing the acreages of land divided in all the counties of the Free State in 1925.  On going through the list I find that during the three years prior to the late Government leaving office the acreage divided in Leix was 3,238 acres, which were handed over to 73 tenants.  During two and a half years, 1932-1934, since the present Government came into office, the acreage divided in the same county was 924 acres between 51 tenants.  In Offaly the acreage divided during the last three years that the previous Government was in power 4,518 acres were divided amongst 116 persons, while since this Government came into office, from 1932-1934, the acreage divided was 2,874 acres amongst 87 tenants.  There is something in these figures to show that the progress made since this Government came into office has not been at the same rate as was made by their predecessors.  On that point I want to hear definitely from the Minister whether this is due to the fact that the Land Commission has not had on the outdoor or the indoor staffs the numbers necessary to deal with the situation that exists.  I read a speech that the Minister for Lands made lately at Portlaoighise, in which he indicated that a far greater rate of progress would be made within the next two years than was made during the last three years.  According to the figures quoted by the Minister more progress will be made next year if his promises are fulfilled than was made during the last two and a half years that the late Government was in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> From the information I have received I warn the Minister that if that promise is to be carried out additional staff will have to be provided to carry out the increased work.  It is only fair to the Land Commission staff that if additional work has to be done the necessary staff should be provided.  I am sure Deputy Donnelly can confirm what I say that there is a considerable amount of unrest&mdash;which was not created by me&mdash;in that area, as a result of the failure of the Land Commission to make greater progress than has been made during the last two or three years.  The complaints come generally from the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Strange to say, in a few areas of Leix the agitation in connection with this matter has been created mainly by recent recruits to the Republicans or to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I can quote instances to prove what I am saying in that respect.  I know areas where people were invited to become members of the local Fianna Fáil clubs on the understanding that every member would get land.  I should not feel comfortable if I was in the position of a Minister who had any responsibility for promises of that kind, because I think in a year or two it will be found that probably 10 per cent.  of those who joined Fianna Fáil clubs believed that they would be amongst the lucky numbers when big estates are being divided.  There is going to be a reaction from that, and I recommend Deputy Donnelly particularly to discourage such activity in my constituency. Speaking as a representative of that constituency since this House was established, I say that one of the most dangerous things anyone could do would be to promise people that they would get something that there was no hope of getting.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that there is considerable acreage of land available, but if it is to be divided at the rate of progress expected by some of Deputy Donnelly's supporters an additional staff will have to be appointed for the purpose.  I hope Deputy Donnelly will do all he can to ginger up the Minister on that aspect of the situation. <Col N="234" /> I have read reports of meetings which were held in the constituency, some of which Deputy Donnelly attended.  These meetings were confined largely to those who claimed to be members of the old I.R.A., at which lavish promises were held out that these people would get first preference in the division of estates.  I want the Minister to touch on that matter when replying, and to indicate the nature of the preference likely to be given to those who claim to be members of the old I.R.A.  I should like to have from him a definition of what the old I.R.A. means, in order to qualify for a holding of land in preference to anyone else.  Does membership of the old I.R.A. mean persons who had active pre-Truce service, or is it understood to mean those who were never heard of until the civil war started in that constituency? I want the Minister to make the position clear, so that people may not be disillusioned later on, and perhaps create a good deal of trouble for Ministers and for those who held out such inducements.  I am definitely in favour of giving a decided preference in positions or holdings to persons who had active pre-Truce service.  Many farmers' sons in this State who sacrificed their time and perhaps their prospects of better positions in life are entitled to consideration for these sacrifices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know exactly what the order of preference is to be for people to whom promises have been held out.  I hope the Minister for his own sake and in order to save trouble in future will make the position clear.  I want to know the period and the nature of the service which entitles people to consideration when estates are being divided.  I read a speech that Deputy Donnelly made recently at Abbeyleix. in which he gave the order of preference to be followed in the giving of land to suitable persons.  He seemed to indicate that landless people were to get first preference.  I had a question on the Order Paper yesterday, asking the Minister to indicate the order of preference that was to be adopted towards those entitled to consideration. and the Minister's reply does not altogether <Col N="235" /> coincide with the Deputy's speech.</P>

      <P>I am referring to it because I want the Minister to make the position clearer than he made it in the reply he gave me.  Are those entitled to first preference in the division of land people who lost their employment as a result of the acquisition of estates? Those who lost employment as a result of any Act passed by this House generally received some compensation.  It is hardly necessary, I suppose, in view of the Minister's reply, for him to repeat that assurance. Taking the order of preference for people entitled to get holdings when estates are being divided, I want to tell the Minister that if suitable landless men are to get the consideration to which they are entitled, having regard to their suitability for working land, they must be put in a position to be able to get the necessary capital to work whatever land is given them by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It is quite unfair to a herd, a ploughman or other suitable landless man to give him 30 or 40 acres of land in one of the midland counties and make no provision to enable him to buy a plough or a horse, or other equipment to work the land.  I would like to say&mdash;I hope other Deputies will support the proposal if they believe it to be right&mdash; that it is the duty of a Government, which is proposing to make greater progress in the division of land, to give more of it to suitable landless men and, in addition, to provide loans, free of interest, for, say, a period of three or five years to enable them to stock the land, and provide themselves with farming equipment.</P>

      <P>I understand there are some estates of very considerable acreage about to be acquired in my constituency and taken over by the Forestry Department.  In some cases, as a result of this, a considerable number of men will be deprived of employment.  I was assured recently that on one estate which is to be divided within the next few weeks 20 people lost their employment some two years ago.  A number of these people have no capital.  It has been put to me and to the Minister that in cases where people lost their employment and are going to get a small acreage of land, the Minister should, where possible, give a preference to them as regards any work undertaken on these estates by the Forestry Department.  That is a form of compensation to which these people are justly entitled.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say to the Minister&mdash;I am not sure that it is necessary for me to do so&mdash;that where land is being divided in the vicinity of labourers' cottages a small additional acreage should be given to the cottage occupiers.  I would like to see these occupiers, whether they be road workers or agricultural labourers, having, say, three acres for tillage purposes and two acres for the grass of a cow and a few calves.  I hope, too. that the Minister will make provision for playing pitches for the local G.A.A. clubs.  There is a demand in the midland counties for suitable playing pitches.  The majority of G.A.A. clubs have very little money, and, therefore, I think the Minister and the Land Commission might give sympathetic consideration to any applications they receive for playing pitches in areas where a land distribution scheme is being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also desire to bring to the notice <Col N="237" /> of the Minister the position of large numbers of people living in towns which are convenient to estates that may be divided in the coming years. Steps should be taken to make suitable provision for turbary rights for these people.  There are bogs on quite a number of these estates, and care should be taken to provide turbary rights for those living in towns convenient to them.  On the question of migration, Deputy Roddy referred to the policy of the previous Government on this matter.  If a large farmer, coming from County Kerry or the County Mayo to the Counties of Leix or Offaly or to Kilkenny or North Tipperary, fails to make good under the arrangements made by the previous Government, I cannot see how a small holder, with no experience of working a large acreage of land, coming from the same areas, can teach anybody anything in the new district in which he takes up residence.  I want to express my personal opposition to people from Kerry or the western counties coming to Leix or Offaly until the uneconomic holders and the suitable landless men living in these counties are first provided for. We have had experience of some Kerry people being brought to North Offaly, and I must say that they have been an absolute failure in the working of land there.  They could not teach anything to anybody in that district, and they were not able to learn anything from the people around them.  The policy with regard to migrants that was put into operation by the previous Government was an absolute failure. I think it is only fair to suggest that the deserving landless men and uneconomic holders in the counties I have been speaking of should have first preference of any land that becomes available, and that people should not be brought from other counties and put on that land by leaving the local people unprovided for.</P>

      <P>I would like, first of all, to refer to the statement that was made this evening by Deputy Roddy.  He said, speaking of the policy of the Minister, that until within the last month there had been no activity on the part of the Land Commission in distributing land.  Deputies should <Col N="238" /> remember that the present Minister has only been in charge of this Department for a little over 12 months. Therefore, I do not think that Deputy Roddy had any ground for his complaint. The Deputy further stated that he hoped the Minister would take a leaf out of the book of his predecessors. I have a sad memory of the policy pursued by the previous Government, and, therefore, I hope the Minister will not follow their example.</P>

      <P>The whole thing was lying there for seven years, surrounded by farms of from 25 to four acres.  It was visited at least 100 times by inspectors, so that it was pretty well paid for so far as expenses were concerned. Then, we have to take this migrant from Watergrasshill and transfer him to a little bit of Paradise in Glandore.  With regard to the present Administration, I have a complaint to make.  During the past 15 months, in one parish in my constituency there are 3,000 acres awaiting division.  Those 3,000 acres are in the hands of five persons who make them a paradise for bullocks which are, I believe, no longer in paradise. These lands are surrounded by three parishes of small holders who, in my opinion, are the best persons who could be given land&mdash;ex-I.R.A. men who fought for their country from 1916 onwards.  There are, in many cases, three or four sons on a small holding of twenty acres&mdash;men with experience of land and who, given some machinery and a little bit of capital, would work <Col N="240" /> the land.  I can see no reason why those 3,000 acres should be lying there as a paradise for bullocks.  These lands are giving no employment and the tenants are evading their responsibilities and not paying their annuities.  I should like to know what particular cog in the Land Commission machine I must oil or ginger up to get that part of the country divided.</P>

I consider that the position in Cork County is such that the Minister should take serious notice of it.  Ranches are lying idle and steps are being taken by these gentlemen to get clear of their responsibilities by selling those places so as to be beforehand with the Land Commission and prevent the Commission taking them over.  These small holders are entitled to have this land divided up.  I consider that those farms of from 500 to 600 acres, amounting in all to 3,000 acres, the tenants of which are evading their responsibilities and <Col N="241" /> not paying their land annuities, should be taken over.  I want that matter attended to by the Minister.</P>

The House generally will congratulate the Minister on a forward move in that direction. I am sorry that this additional expenditure on the improvement of estates is not going hand in hand with accelerated acquisition and distribution of land.  I do not think the Minister's record, so far, is such that one is entitled to look upon it with any pride so far as the acquisition and distribution of land are concerned.  I have read some of the recent speeches of the Minister on the question of land acquisition and distribution and, while they are commendable from the point of view of showing good intentions on the part of the Minister, one has got to realise that even land will not be divided merely by the expression of good intentions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very interested to hear it.  The Minister might be encouraged to move forward more rapidly if he adverted to the statistics furnished to the House on the 13th February in reply to a Parliamentary question.  From those we can see that land distribution has been on a much slower scale than in previous years.  On the 28th November, 1934, I was informed by the Minister as to the progress of land acquisition and division in the Co. Kildare.  The information furnished me in reply to a Parliamentary question was of a very disappointing character.  It showed that the whole policy of the Land Commission during the last couple of years in the matter of acquisition and distribution of land has slowed up considerably.  Taking the year 1933-34, we find that 764 acres <Col N="242" /> were acquired and 942 distributed in County Kildare.  One would imagine that there was no such thing as the Land Commission in existence when one finds only 942 acres distributed in a ranching county such as Kildare is. If we look at the national statistics. instead of statistics for individual counties, we find that the record of land distribution, so far, is extremely poor. Whatever the Minister is going to tell us in his report, I hope there is going to be a substantial improvement in the very slow rate of progress in this respect which has so far taken place. The Minister cannot be unaware that there is considerable disappointment throughout the country at the apparent slothfulness of the Land Commission in acquiring and dividing land.  I think that even at the Ard-Fheis of the Minister's Party a resolution was passed expressing disappointment at the activities of the Land Commission in that regard, notwithstanding a gallant effort to defeat the resolution. Deputies who express their disappointment with the Land Commission in this respect are in pretty good company these days, because even the Minister's own Party, whatever else they may say for the Government's achievements in other directions, cannot, apparently, be induced to work up any enthusiasm for the acquisition and distribution policy which is being pursued by the Land Commission.  In the constituency of Kildare, so far as I can discover, there are only two Land Commission inspectors. They are very courteous and helpful gentlemen, and I have no complaint to make against them personally. Rather would I like to see the efforts of these gentlemen supplemented and further inspectorate staff allocated for acquisition and distribution work in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Kildare, there are ranches running into hundreds of acres.  Some of them comprise almost 1,000 acres. Those ranches are scarcely grazed. Practically no part of this land is tilled and there appears to me to be in the existence of these ranches a very fruitful opportunity, not merely to take people off the labour market in the towns and urban areas and settle them on the land but to provide <Col N="243" /> employment for additional people and provide additional food for the nation instead of being compelled to import that food as at present.  We have appeals from Departments to grow more wheat and beet and generally to produce a better balanced agricultural economy.  But when we look at the record of the Land Commission in making its activities somewhat complementary to that policy, we find that very little is being done to encourage the policy of tillage, which is advocated by other Ministers and other Departments of Government.  If the tillage policy is to be a success, it is absolutely imperative that the ranches should be broken up.  It is absolutely imperative that the plough should be put into the broad acres.  In County Kildare, where the broad acres abound side by side with landless men and uneconomic holders, we find very little being done, so far, to break up the ranches and reintroduce the plough to the land.  I hope that the Minister, in the reply which he has promised us, will tell us that, whatever of the past, the policy of the future will be one of much more rapid acquisition and much more rapid distribution of land. If the Minister does that, I think he can be assured of the warm co-operation and goodwill of all the Deputies in the House.  If there is one thing more than another calculated to stop the drift into the towns, it is the settlement of people on economic holdings. A policy of that kind is calculated not merely to stop overcrowding in town dwellings but to stop the glutting of the labour market in the towns. It is calculated to produce a better balanced agricultural economy and also to enrich the nation by producing more food.  The Minister has within his grasp opportunities for improving, on a scale never previously dreamt of, the agricultural economy of the country. I hope that, in the reply he is to give us, he will tell us that the good intentions with which his speeches bristle will be translated into action and that we may look forward to land acquisition and distribution on a much more rapid scale than we have known in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just heard Deputy Norton advocate the dividing up of the land to prevent the &ldquo;drift into the towns.&rdquo;  I am particularly interested in that phrase.  It would be well if Deputy Norton, and perhaps other Deputies, would ask themselves why this drift into the towns has taken place.  It has taken place because there is no living on the land at present.  Farmers' sons, workmen and others have moved into the towns because of the depression that exists in the agricultural industry.  It was not on that point that I intended to speak.  I desired to ascertain from the Minister what the policy of the Government is in connection with the price paid for land.  I have before me a letter to a widow, with five children, who has a small shop in a town.  She has 82 acres of land and the Land Commission have offered her £322 for that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>82 acres ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>82 acres of land for which she has been offered £322 in Land Bonds.  That would be something around £15 a year.  Is that the policy of the Land Commission ? Is it the policy of the Land Commission to take over a farm of the value of about £15 a year?  Speaking of the Land Com mission and the division of land, I know of an estate taken over by the late Government.  A good part of that land was divided, and it was somewhat similar to land that was divided in the past.  What was the policy of the Land Commission ?  A certain part of it was left there in connection with big buildings that were to be erected on it. What the Land Commission are doing now is to plant trees on perfectly arable land.  One would imagine that there were plenty of other uses for it except that of planting trees on it.  These are the points that I am trying to make generally, and I should like a reply from the Minister as to what the attitude of the Government is in connection with what they are going to pay farmers when they take over the land.  I do not want to criticise the Government as to their attitude in taking over land, but I say that, if land has to be acquired, it is only reasonable <Col N="245" /> to expect that those who have been in occupation of it should get a reasonable price for it.  Nobody would say that £15 a year for such an acreage of land is a reasonable price or anything approaching a reasonable price. These are some of the things about which I should like to have an assurance from the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>There is another case that came to my notice recently.  A man bought a farm and paid all the money he had for it.  As a matter of fact, he paid £500 for about 30 or 40 acres&mdash;a little more or less.  He has been in occupation of that land for the last three or four years at least, but the Land Commission has refused to accept him as a tenant.  Maybe he did not have the sanction of the Land Commission before he took the land.  But even if he did not have their sanction for his little holding&mdash;even if he did outstep the law &mdash;I consider that it is an ill-advised step of the Land Commission to refuse to sanction him as a tenant.  What is the attitude they are going to adopt towards such a man?  If that is their attitude they will find that it will prove a very difficult problem.  These are the points that, I think, the Minister should bear in mind when he is replying and I should like some clear-cut decision on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the extra money asked for in this Vote, the information given by Deputy Curran is very illuminating.  He told us that the sum of £323 was paid for 82 acres of, I presume, reasonably good land.  Now, I take up item J of this Estimate and I find that it reads: &ldquo;Advance to meet deficiency of income from untenanted lands purchased under the Land Acts of 1923-33, £2,000.&rdquo;  The original Estimate was for £10,000 and the revised Estimate is for £12,000 for the year.  This £2,000 extra is required to meet the loss on this land held by the Land Commission. I wonder was that land bought at the current price mentioned by Deputy Curran.  If land at such a price, in the hands of such experts as the present Government, necessitates raiding the ratepayers' pockets to make up a loss of £2,000 this year, <Col N="246" /> I wonder whether we are not really wasting out time, in these circumstances, when we talk of the acquisition and division of lands at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton wants to see the tillage policy of the Government a success.  He wants to build a Chinese wall around the towns and cities of Ireland to keep the country people on the land.  Deputy Norton need not be one bit afraid of people wanting to come into the towns and cities, if they can get a living on the land.  In the natural ebb and flow of economic conditions people are driven to the towns and cities owing to the conditions that obtain.  Here we have a demand for more money to plant men on the land when we know they will drift back again, in the conditions that prevail, towards the towns and the cities.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin talked about economic holdings. I would like the Minister for Lands, or some one, to give us a definition of an economic holding at the present time.  At no time in this country, in connection with land legislation was there unanimity as to what an economic holding was.  A holding to be economic must be in the track of trade.  Where is the trade in this country at present to make any holding an economic holding?  I know holdings of a couple of hundred acres of land and the owners are not able to pay the rates and annuities upon them.  Of course, there are armchair farmers who would tell us how that land could be used not merely to make it pay outgoings, but to return a handsome profit.  Let them get into the line and prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as to the division of land, we have had suggestions thrown out in the course of this debate as to the people who should and the people who should not get land.  Of course, I agree that those who have sacrificed some of the best years of their lives to the welfare of the country should not be forgotten.  Unfortunately, many of them have been long forgotten.  But remember when planting men on the land at the public expense it is only sound business to see that such men know their job.  I have not yet seen. <Col N="247" /> either under this Administration, or the past Administration, or the British administration of the Land Commission that they made that an outstanding feature of their policy.  When giving portions of land to men the knowledge at the disposal of the Land Commission should be such that they would expect such men to make a success of the land they got.</P>
    <P>It often struck me as extraordinary that notwithstanding that we have a Department of Agriculture in this country functioning for about 30 years, and that there has evolved, in recent years, a system of rural education, and that evening classes and the county committees of agriculture have been established, the Land Commission does not co-operate with those committees and see that those evening agricultural classes are made a success.  We have several such classes not only in Dublin but in various parts of the country set up at public expense.  Why not develop them?  I do not think the system is sufficiently developed.  Why not take a further step in a practical direction and standardise the knowledge acquired and disseminated in those evening classes, by the issue of certain certificates?  Why not then give these young men who have acquired those certificates plots of land which they would be capable of working?  There you would be offering an inducement to young men to attend these classes and to obtain these certificates.  Who is it that gets a plot of land at the present time?  Let us come down to practical politics.  It is the camp followers of political parties that get them and it is not to-day that that happened.  It happened back in the British time and with what result? Ranches were divided up at public expense.  I saw in many cases myself the cycle concluded, and the land that had been broken up gone back again through various stages to be ranches. I could take Deputies to one district where that happened not five miles from where we are sitting at the present moment.  The land was broken up; it was parcelled out; houses were built on it, but the people sold them and the land is gone back again into a ranch <Col N="248" /> simply because suitable people were not selected on the first instance and given the land.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some co-ordination between the Department of Agriculture, the county committees of agriculture and the Land Commission. Why not evolve a scheme in the Land Commission for the subdividing of land whereby a servant boy who had hired out with a farmer, for a few years, and saved a few pounds, should get a piece of land?  If the amount he had saved was only £20 it would give him heart in his work.  But if you give anything to anybody for nothing the same value will never be put upon it as would be on a piece of property in which one's own money was invested.  I commend that to the Minister for Lands, and to the Land Commission, for their consideration. Get a man on to the land who has put something into it and the greatest incentive to him is to have invested in it some of the money he earned himself.</P>
    <P>I wonder is it the Government's view &mdash; and it seems to be from the case which Deputy Curran has cited here as to the scrap price of land&mdash; that the present market price for land is the price they should give and, if so, do they hold that land now is at as high a value as it will ever be in the future?  If that is their view, it is a sad commentary on their administration because there is really no market for land now.  We have been confronted with the buying of land for labourers' cottages for the board of health in County Dublin, but we do not go upon the present prices because we consider that present prices are not fair to anybody.  They are prices that ruled during a period of abnormal world depression to which is added an artificial depression from other causes, which there is no need to mention. That is not the time for any local authority, much less for a department of the Government, to use the compulsory powers at their disposal to force people to part with their land at scrap prices, at ruinous prices.</P>
    <P>I presume that this land mentioned by Deputy Curran is average land. Everybody knows that 82 acres of land would give a fair living, but what kind <Col N="249" /> of a living will £320 invested, even in National Loan, give?  That is the value of land.  I am sure that land was worth a couple of thousand pounds a few years ago.  If you are going to measure the value of your Administration to the country by that depreciation on land, I am afraid you would not commend yourself as a useful Government. However, I make these suggestions without reference to present abnormal conditions and I suggest to the Minister that the dividing up of ranches must not be actuated by a desire merely for breaking up big ranches, but a desire to plant more people on the land who will make a success of that plantation and to ensure that the whole transaction will be nationally sound, nationally productive and show a national advance.  You must select your people; you must have regard to the quality of the people you are planting there.  Nobody would be more anxious than I to plant an ex-I.R.A. man on the land, but I would not plant him on it unless he was fit for it.  If you want to compensate him for the services he gave the country, compensate him in some other way.  I would not put a round peg in a square hole or a square peg in a round hole, or whatever the phrase is. You would not be doing that man, to whom the country owes something, a service if you put him into something he was not suited for.  He will be a failure in a few years and when he fails, is he in a better position?  Has he improved in the estimation of his friends?  Of course, he has not, and the respect in which they now hold him would be lessened in a few years if you put him into a job in which he will fail.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister will look at that in a business way and that where he has men before him, all equal, all fit to be planted on the land, he will not overlook the ex-I.R.A. man for anybody else.  Generally, I would suggest to the Minister that in respect of migrants and people from the Gaeltacht or anywhere you like, he has a job to do.  He is spending huge sums of money acquiring land, splitting it up and planting people on it to be farmers and it is his job, so far as <Col N="250" /> he can, to make them successful farmers.  Let them show some qualification and aptitude for the job he is giving them and if he does, the future will thank him and appreciate his services.  If he does not look to the quality of the people, but puts them in merely because of political reasons or because they are friends of some friend or something like that, without qualifications or aptitude for farming, he will be wasting public money and he will not improve agriculture nor will he improve the country.  It would be much better to leave it growing good grass, even though it is a ranch&mdash;and I am not a rancher.  It is better to have the land growing good grass than to have it growing weeds and weeds you will have if you put in the weed of a farmer.  I hope the Minister, in order to keep the land from growing weeds. will not plant farmer weeds on the divided ranches.  Again, I would impress upon him, as a final matter, that he should devise some scheme whereby he will get men who have some money of their own.  I will give an example, with permission of the Chair.  The Minister for Local Government knows this to be a fact and my friend, Deputy Tom Kelly, will agree with me in this.  We, in the Dublin Corporation, have built large colonies of houses around the city.  We have let them on the purchase system at an initial loss.  The people purchased them over a number of years.  They had to pay nothing at the start and we sold them on the purchase system at prices lower than what they cost us.  For instance, if they cost us £500, we sold them for £400 on an annuity basis.  There has been a tremendous loss, running into thousands, apart from the initial loss, on those houses, owing to arrears.  On the other hand, we have lent about £1,500,000 under the Small Dwellings Act.  The people were required to have a little money of their own at the start and we have not had .5 of a loss Is that not right. Deputy Kelly.</P>

      <P>I do not say that analogy is perfect, but it gives the House an idea of what I want to convey.  It is not so much a question of the size of <Col N="251" /> the money I should like to see the Land Commission asking for, but a question of helping servant boys who have saved a little money at farm work, and have put their savings into a piece of land. The Land Commission should welcome such applicants, and I strongly commend that point of view to the Minister.  There are also the cases in different parts of the country of the sons of small farmers whose little piece of land is not sufficient to keep them when they grow up.  They go out&mdash;the thing has developed naturally in all parts of the country&mdash;and take a bit of grazing, a few acres for cattle.  Surely that is not ranching.  It is just one of the activities of a small farmer's family in their endeavour to make a living and to develop.  Where small families have shown such activities&mdash;where they have shown such enterprise&mdash;it should be a matter that ought to commend itself to the Minister in their favour.  I am sure that the Minister is not without channels that he can tap to provide him with information about such people.  I would be glad to hear the Minister on that matter.</P>

      <P>On this matter of the division of land and the workings of the Land Commission I would like to say a few words as to my experience in regard to the County Galway.  I have heard a great deal about the slow progress which the Land Commission is making.  But I would remind the House that when the 1923 Land Act was passing through the Oireachtas. Deputies on the opposite benches did everything in their power to insert amendments in the Bill&mdash;amendments which would make land division very much slower than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got the figures of the number of acres of land divided in 1932, 1933 and 1934.  At any rate, we have got sufficient information to know that at least some land has been divided. After all the criticism that has been offered there has not been a single specific case mentioned in which the land was given to an unsuitable tenant. or where it was given because of political preferences.  In Galway County recently a few estates have <Col N="252" /> been divided and remarks have been made in regard to the preference given in the allocation of the land.  As to the system followed, I mention one particular estate, that of the Earl of Westmeath.  On that estate none of the people living in the immediate neighbourhood made any representations to have the lands taken over. That was because the estate was being properly worked by the then owner. But it passed on to another who did not give the employment that had been given on the estate.  Consequently the lands were offered for sale.  Then the Land Commission stepped in.</P>
    <P>On that estate, there were 33 employees, all of whom had experience of employment on an estate worked on a mixed farming system.  Each of these employees was given first preference in the division, after them came the congests within a radius of two miles of the estate.  Amongst the congests who were applying for a part of the estate no one whose poor law valuation exceeded by a few shillings £10 a year was considered. Only applicants under a £10 valuation were brought in.  The people in the area are quite satisfied that the estate was divided quite fairly and that there was no political discrimination. They are satisfied that the people entitled to it got a share of the land. Now, all the employees did not get land, nor are all the employees on other estates that are divided given land. The greatest care is being taken in the selection of the tenants.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission officials, in making their selection, have gone so far as to demand from the applicants positive proof by way of the production of bank deposits, or evidence of the number of live stock they have or things of that kind.  I know of another estate also where congests were provided for and where only two landless men were given land.  Both these landless men were men with experience. They had large families, and I might mention that both were of different political opinions.  As regards the I.R.A. adjoining the Westmeath estate, not one of them got a perch of land. The land was given only to people who came within the terms of reference&mdash; congests and employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> There is one thing that I would put very strongly to the Minister, and that is as regards the valuation of congests. I know some tenants whose poor law valuation is in excess of £10, and I know some of these people have not as much as one perch of arable land.  That land, in the past, was all right for grazing cows and for producing hay when tillage was not as profitable as it is now and as it will be in the future. I would like, if the Minister would allow, in such cases, some discretion to the Land Commission officials who are preparing schemes of allotment, so that these very deserving people may be given four or five acres of arable land. Those congests living in close proximity to an estate about to be divided would have their condition very much improved by a few acres of good arable land.  I can assure the Minister that if he and his officials carry on as they have begun that he need not go to Donegal to be met with brass bands. He will be met in Galway with brass bands and pipers' bands also.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton appealed to all Parties to co-operate in making the division of estates a success. I, too, would like to make the same appeal.  I have always believed that the land is the mainstay of the people of this country.  I quite agree with Deputy Belton that the question of whether a man is ex-I.R.A., or Blueshirt, a Fianna Fáil supporter or a United Ireland supporter should not arise in the division of land.  The question of the applicant's capability is the most important question of all. I think the Minister should look around and examine what has happened in the past with regard to the division of land.  In that way he would find out the success or otherwise of the systems of division followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, portion of which is in the Gaeltacht, there are a great many young farmers' sons and a good many farm labourers who have by their industry saved £200, £300 or £400. These people have probably not got enough money to buy a farm but I am sure if they were invited to take up farms in different parts of the country where the land is available they would be most willing to do so.  I advocated <Col N="254" /> their claims in the time of the late Government.  I know the difficulty the late Government had and I know the difficulties of the present Government in carrying out such a policy.  I know that in a great many cases there is certain to be local opposition.  But, after all, the important thing with us is to see that people are planted on the land who are going to make it a success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Curran has brought to my notice a question that has arisen in connection with afforestation, that is to say, using land for afforestation which is suitable for the planting of people on it.  In my own area, at the moment, I understand that three farms are being taken over for the purpose of afforestation.  In one of those farms a house has been built under the Gaeltacht Housing Act and a loan given to the tenant.  In another case in which I made enquiries I found that one of the farms proposed to be taken over is a farm that used to carry 25 cows and heifers.  I might say that my great-grandmother&mdash;God rest her soul&mdash;was brought up on that farm.  I appeal to the Minister to look seriously into these matters.  We are all aware that there is not sufficient land in this country to meet the demand and I think before embarking upon a programme of taking such land as this for afforestation that we should weigh the position very seriously.  I know there are plenty of people in the vicinity who would be very glad to get holdings. I do not know whether it is the policy of the Government to carry out afforestation.  Probably the Minister will be able to inform us on that subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather sorry to hear Deputy Davin criticising the scheme under which people are taken from congested areas and put on land where it is available in the more favoured districts.  I think that criticism is really unfair.  First of all, if we take the whole system of land division in this country, it is, in conjunction with other systems that come within the range of the different Government Departments, a national affair, and the costs involved are national.  We must realise that those who are living in the congested districts are placed at a great disadvantage. I submit that where, in a congested area, people are forced to live in a condition that is not ordinarily good enough for the purpose of rearing families, where the land is not of good quality and where there is not sufficient of it to go round so as to warrant a fairly decent standard of comfort for those who are bringing up families, there should be national consideration given to the condition of those people and the narrow idea of county limits should not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation is being asked to make provision in a large and generous way for the inhabitants of the congested areas in our towns and cities, for those people who are obliged to live in slums. Very considerable sums have been spent in that connection and towards that work the poor farmers in the congested districts of this country have contributed their share.  They have made no protest.  None of their representatives in the Dáil has, on any occasion within my recollection, made <Col N="256" /> a protest against the expenditure of large sums of money for the relief of the slum dwellers.  I hope that the idea to which I refer does not prevail generally here&mdash;that fairly considerable provision should not be made where land is available for relief of rural slum areas where families are forced to live under conditions which must inevitably necessitate hardship in the bringing up of young children.  We must realise that the system of economy in the congested areas has altered.  For instance, emigration has stopped.  Most of the counties in which those congested districts are situated do not come within the range of the industrial development that is taking place.  My own idea is that the Government should be asked to take this question of congestion into consideration in a more general and generous way than has been the practice up to this.  I hope that will be the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the criticism offered with respect to the delay of the Land Commission in carrying out the transfer of land to the people who require it.  I must pay this compliment to the Minister, that within the last 12 months in my county, where there is not a whole lot of land suitable for division, very considerable improvement has taken place as compared with the work on land division undertaken by the late Administration.  I daresay that the work carried out in Leitrim might to some extent account for the figures that have been quoted in the House indicating the amount of land divided in the last few years as against the land division carried on in previous years.  Officials of the Land Commission had their men operating in a county where the largest farm would scarcely exceed 100 acres.  It would necessitate an enormous amount of work to deal with the type of area such as is to be found in Leitrim.  On the other hand, the actual net result is to my mind unquestionably much more beneficial than if the work were carried out on a larger acreage where fewer people would have their conditions improved.  Let me, by way of illustration, take the case of a 100 acre farm in Leitrim.  The owner is transplanted <Col N="257" /> in another part of the country where land is available.  The division of the 100 acres will perhaps mean the taking of 20 families out of uneconomic holdings and placing them in much better conditions, what would be regarded as good economic conditions.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to be had indicating the necessity for what I strongly advocate&mdash;the transfer to a greater extent of people living in congested areas with the object of improving the conditions for those who are allowed to remain.  In the districts for which I speak the Minister's policy has unquestionably brought about very considerable improvements within the last year; he has succeeded in speeding up the division of land and effected a general improvement of estates.  In the division of bogland where fairly large tracts of turbary are available, it might be more beneficial if the right of cutaway was retained by the Land Commission rather than permit it to be divided amongst adjoining farmers who, in many cases, will not reclaim that land.  In these areas the necessity for land is great and it will increase as the years go by.  Therefore, these tracts of cutaway bog should be retained by the Land Commission with a view to their reclamation later on so that further land may be made available. I wish to compliment the Minister on the special attention he has given to what I consider are the most necessitous areas in the country.</P>

There is one matter I will urge on the Minister and I ask him to consider it very seriously.  It arises, perhaps not directly, out of this Vote and it relates to proceedings under the 1933 Act.

You, Sir, have decided that it cannot be mentioned but, in view of the national importance of the matter, I think it is one to which I, as a representative in this House, should call the attention of the Minister.  I do not want to make a Party matter of it, but I would ask <Col N="261" /> you to allow me to request the Minister to consider the desirability of ceasing to function under that, as the matter is <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question of the improvement of estates already acquired, I should like to ask the Minister whether any of this money finds its way to the County Louth. Possibly we are too well off there or we are rather quiet and sensible.  I have made representations on many occasions as to improvements on certain estates which I understand the Land Commission have accepted liability to maintain, but nothing has been done.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to that.  Several applications have been made to him for the repair of roads on estates but nothing has happened since.  They are some estates in County Louth which, I understand, have been acquired or are about to be acquired by the Land Commission.  Others have been inspected with a view to acquisition and to being divided amongst uneconomic holders there.  While I agree that it would be very useful to speed up the acquisition of these estates, I am quite aware of the fact that the matter of acquisition is very slow work.  The appointment of more inspectors, which has been suggested by many Deputies, would not hasten the acquisition of land by a day. Deputies seem to forget that it means additional expense.  If the Land Commission appointed extra inspectors it would naturally mean that additional officials would have to be appointed in the different offices in the Land Commission dealing with the acquisition of land.  Inspectors have to make reports to higher officials, so that there would have to be an increase of the higher officials as well.  I do not think it would be wise policy on the part of the Land Commission to increase the staff at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the speeches that have been delivered throughout the country on the question of land acquisition contain, in my opinion, a good deal of nonsense.  I think the Minister should pay very little attention to speeches such as those delivered by Deputy <Col N="262" /> Davin, even though Deputy Davin has got to do his stuff as against Deputy Donnelly in regard to the division of land in Leix.  I do not think that the taxpayers of this country should be asked to provide money to suit what Deputy Donnelly or Deputy Davin says.  They should do their own business in a business-like way.  I hope the Minister will pay very little attention to what has been said by Deputy Davin.  There was very little in his whole speech by way of grievance in regard to the manner in which the Land Commission has carried out its duties.  Of course, every man speaks from his own experience of the treatment of people who apply for land, but I can truthfully say that I have found no differentiation at all in regard to the political affiliations of people, whether they support the Opposition or the Government.  I think the Land Commission does its duty in a very conscientious way and I should like to pay that tribute to the officials and inspectors of the Land Commission. I think most of the criticisms that arose in regard to the alleged partiality shown were due to the speeches made by Deputies throughout the country. I think it is very unwise for Deputies to attend meetings of certain organisations and to promise members of those organisations that they are entitled to first consideration in the division of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest I did that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unwise for Deputies to make such speeches, and I think that any criticism to which the Land Commission has been subjected arose from that fact.  At least I have made it a point not to promise people at meetings that I would get land for them.  That is the business of the Land Commission The officials of the Land Commission are the best judges, and, as far as I know, the manner in which they carry out their duties in the distribution of whatever land they take over, commands, in most cases, the general approval of the people of the locality.  Inspectors generally make a thorough examination of the position of the various applicants. <Col N="263" /> They get all the information possible about the applicants, whether they have been connected with farming in the past and what is their capacity to farm the land.  They make their selections accordingly and I certainly have very little to say by way of criticism of the manner in which they discharge their duties.</P>
      <P>This is only a Supplementary Estimate, and there is no use in wasting the time of the House in a prolonged discussion.  We shall have plenty of other occasions to bring up any grievances which we may have, and so far as my experience goes I have only to say that the Land Commission is doing very well, and I would impress on the Minister again that he should not incur any extra expenditure in the appointment of additional inspectors.  There is no necessity for them at the present time.  On the question of the value of land to be acquired, I would impress upon the Minister that fair play should be shown to people whose lands are about to be acquired.  There is no use trying to blink our eyes to the fact that there does exist in this country the opinion amongst a certain section of our people that all they have got to do is to pass resolutions and send them up to the Government, and the Government or the Minister responsible will just simply go out and confiscate the land belonging to certain people. That idea does prevail, and I want to dissociate myself from it.  I want to impress on the Minister that, after all, the old saying, &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy,&rdquo; still holds good, and if the Minister on any future occasion has to acquire land, he should give a fair price for this land&mdash;not an exorbitant price, but a price which, in his opinion, is such as the future tenants of the land will be able to pay on an annuity basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to those people who consider that the Land Commission is slow in acquiring land, I would say that I know of one or two cases in which the late Government, in order to satisfy certain people, purchased land at a price much higher than the price at which they could have purchased it had they waited some time longer.  So you <Col N="264" /> can see that very often it is better to proceed slowly in the purchase of land. Possibly a waiting policy is the best policy.  The Land Commission cannot do everything at once.  There are estates in the country, undoubtedly, which it would be better to acquire in the interests of uneconomic holders in the area, but all that will come in good time.  The work will be carried out in future just as expeditiously as it has been in the past, without the necessity of incurring any additional expenditure by appointing extra inspectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly) Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion and a good deal of suggestion in the various remarks that have been made by the different Deputies.  Some of them are rather elusive, some of them are bordering on the stupid, and some of them are entirely unjustified by the facts.  I should like first of all to deal with the comments made by both Deputies Lynch and Dillon last evening, and to correct certain impressions they sought to convey with regard to the distribution of land and the activities of the Land Commission.  A question was put on the 13th February asking the number of new holdings which the Land Commission had allotted.  Of course, that Parliamentary question had to be answered in the terms in which it was asked, but it seemed to convey to both Deputy Lynch and Deputy Dillon that the Land Commission had completely slowed up its activity.  I could not refrain from feeling a certain amount of cynical amusement at Deputy Lynch's comments on the period when he was Minister for Lands.  Whatever might be said about his Parliamentary Secretary, who worked quite hard in the Department, I think the less said about Deputy Lynch's activity in regard to land the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I should like to clear up before I get to the main analysis of what the Land Commission is doing and has been doing, is the reference Deputy Lynch made to the Parliamentary question which was asked and answered here yesterday.  Deputy Lynch informed the House that Deputy <Col N="265" /> Fitzgerald-Kenney had told him as he went through, that the Land Commission was giving land to landless men as the preliminary step in land division at the moment.  Of course, I would be long sorry to take responsibility for what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney told Deputy Lynch, and if he reads the question and the reply in the official report, he will find that the following statement is part of it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Parties such as herds and labourers who have lost their employment as the result of taking of lands by the Land Commission are considered to have first claim.  Genuine evicted tenants and uneconomic holders in the locality must be provided for and then come the landless men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Land Commission are not going to allot the first land in the division of estates to landless men.  It has always been the practice since I went there, that those who lost employment by the taking over of the estates were dealt with first, then the genuine evicted tenants, and the uneconomic holders. They come in the order mentioned. When speaking of this we might as well be quite clear as to what we mean by genuine evicted tenants.  I have some rather interesting applications from the descendants of evicted tenants from different States and from different towns; some of them obviously long removed from the land.  When we think of evicted tenants, we think of evicted tenants living in the neighbourhood, who have a definite and a genuine grievance, and who are likely to make good on the land, if it is restored to them.  Deputy Lynch stated that we could only spend money on unvested land.  As a matter of fact we have power, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to spend money on vested land, and we often do so.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to the division of land?  Deputy Dillon spoke of torchlight processions and brass bands in Donegal on my visit there during the 1933 election.  I should like to assure him that I was not responsible for that.  I think he said that I brought the torchlight processions and brass bands there.  I should like to assure him again that <Col N="266" /> I am not at all keen on torchlight processions and brass bands.  I happen to have grown up in a generation which rather revolted against the idea of brass bands and torchlight processions, and that equally revolted against the rhetorical type of speech that we get in the pompous manner of the Deputy.  I went, as most of those who were interested in the movement went, but I happened to be sent to Donegal, and I operated there.  But I am neither vain enough nor foolish enough to think that the torchlight processions and brass bands were any compliment to Senator Connolly.  I realise, as I always realised, that the unit counts for very little, and that if people are enthusiastic for a Party that has tried to serve them, they were determined to put that Party back into power.  I will not refer to the actual position either of Deputy Dillon or of the other Deputies who were elected during that election.  The figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have got the figures relating to the actual position regarding land division for the first ten and a half months of the financial year&mdash;which means that we have still one month and a half, or approximately six weeks of the financial year, for returns yet to come in.  I find that already a record figure has been set up for the ten and a half months over any previous year in Land Commission administration, either under the British or the Free State. Up to the middle of February we have allotted over 70,000 acres of untenanted land and, in addition, we have upwards of 20,000 acres divided on Congested Districts estates.  I am quite satisfied that when the year is completed Deputies will be perfectly satisfied that the Land Commission has far exceeded their most optimistic expectations, and has reached a figure which I ask them to believe has only been done by consistent work, day and night.  As most Deputies know, and as Deputy Lynch should have known, seeing that he claims to speak as the former Minister for Lands, there are peak periods in distribution.  There are the periods coming up to October-November, and February-March, which are peak periods for schemes to be put <Col N="267" /> into operation.  We are at the peak period now.  During the last two months 35,000 acres were divided, involving 1,500 allottees.</P>
    <P>Whatever else may be said, I should like, at least, as Minister, to pay my tribute to the work that my inspectors and my staff have done, because they have rendered services during the last year that were never equalled.  What was the position?  What is called the 1933 Land Act was passed that year but certain formalities had to be complied with, and certain regulations and rules had to be passed, so that it was actually the beginning of March before the Act of 1933 was in operation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Land Commission will go on increasing.  Deputy Coburn mentioned that we should not increase the staff.  There is a limit to what we can do, even by an increase of staff.  It has to be remembered that if we have an untrained staff it may be rather a handicap.  We have got generally to assimilate the staff, and to train the staff to work into the organisation.  That applies both to the outdoor and the indoor staffs.  The statement with regard to the amount of land we have actually divided should satisfy even the most unreasonable Deputy.  I do not like to refer to the remarks of Deputy Dillon, but I suggest that he should be a little more careful when talking about hypocrisy and insincerity.  There is a smugness about that that makes no appeal to the people, and I am perfectly satisfied, if I were interested in political reputations, the more abuse of that kind Deputy Dillon proceeds to pour out the better.  I have the keenest appreciation of Deputy Dillon's status, and I may say the more of such insults are hurled by the Deputy the more they will react.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised a question about correspondence.  I will be quite frank about correspondence. The Land Commission is not as perfect in the handling of correspondence as I would like it to be.  It <Col N="268" /> is an extremely difficult business to attend to correspondence in the Land Commission.  It cannot and will not be handled as it is handled in a commercial concern.  Deputies need not expect it, because it cannot be done. The officials cannot have it done.  Consider the position.  We handle at present upwards of 300,000 letters a year, in addition to dealing with close on 500,000 annuitants, with whom we have to have dealings twice a year. The officials are blamed for merely sending formal acknowledgments of letters in many cases&mdash;in fact in most cases&mdash;when they have no alternative. They are asked questions which they are not in a position to answer.  They are asked when a certain estate is being taken over.  The officials cannot say that.  Even I, as Minister, cannot say it.  That is a matter for the Commissioners. The officials are also asked if the Department can arrange that So-and-so is included on a scheme.  It is a definite rule in the Land Commission that a scheme is not disclosed until the day the inspector goes out to announce it and to divide the land. The type of letter that the Land Commission gets is invariably such that it is practically impossible for the officials to give an answer.  I find myself very often in the same difficulty.  However, if the Deputy had any difficulty about correspondence, he knows that he had only to write to me, and I would have seen that whatever matters he is interested in would, at least, have had prompt official attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another question raised with regard to that, and that was the question of intervention in the case of people who claimed that they were unable to pay their annuities.  Deputy Dillon, I think, had one particular case in mind.  At any rate it was suggested by some Deputy that matters such as that could be attended to. The Minister for Defence had stated that sympathetic consideration would be given where there was a case of real hardship.  I get letters like that. We have, as I have said, 500,000 annuitants whose payments are due twice a year.  If I intervened in the case of the Collection Department, I feel that I would upset its whole <Col N="269" /> arrangements, and I do not intervene. If I get a letter in connection with an annuitant who is in trouble, who cannot afford to pay or cannot find the money to pay at the time, I send it to the Collection Department, but I do not intervene with regard to it.  I do not see how I could.  If it were known that the Minister could be swayed I would probably get 50,000 letters.</P>
    <P>It has also to be remembered that the difficulty of being even sympathetic with people who may find it hard to meet the payment of their annuities was entirely vitiated and complicated by the policy of the non-payment of annuities which was carried on.  If things were normal and we felt that people were doing their utmost in every end of the country to pay their annuities, then a much more reasonable attitude might be taken by the Collection Department, but how is that Department to know who really can pay and who cannot, when we are aware that a vicious campaign, a most immoral campaign, was launched in this country against payment, and that by people who, in most cases, could pay.</P>
    <P>A question was also raised with regard to the value of land.  Deputy O'Leary or Deputy Curran spoke of the price that the Land Commission paid, and urged on me that a fair price should be paid.  I have nothing to do with the fixing of the price of land, and I point out that the striking of an average price for land conveys nothing.  We may get an estate of 1,000.  Nine hundred acres of that may be mountain, 50 acres arable, and 50 acres bog.  We get all sorts, conditions and type of land, and such a thing as striking an average cannot be done.  You can take the acreage that we buy in a year, the amount that we issue in bonds, and you can work it out to a decimal point.  That will give you an average per acre, but it conveys nothing.  There are three steps in regard to fixing the price of land. There is first the case where the price is an agreed one: where an offer is made and a price is agreed upon between the Land Commission and the <Col N="270" /> seller.  Then there is the case where land is compulsorily acquired.  The commissioners hold a sitting.  They have an inspection of the land made for valuation, suitability and price. They accordingly publish the fact that they are acquiring these lands and publish the price, but that does not end the matter.  The owner of the land has the right of appeal on the question of price.  No matter how he is circumstanced as regards other provisions of the Act, the owner has the right of appeal on the question of price. Therefore, I do not see how I could go into the question of price.  It is the Commissioners' job.  The seller of the land is fully protected as to the value of the land and the price that is being paid to him.  I have sample cases before me where the average price worked down to £8 10s. per acre.  In another case, where we bought nearly 5,000 acres, the price worked down to £4 7s. 7d. per acre.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy raised a number of interesting questions.  I do not know whether I shall have time to deal with them all or not.  The Deputy mentioned about Fianna Fáil dictating Land Commission policy. Well, he was long enough in the Land Commission to know that no matter how land is divided, no matter how careful officials are, there will always be the suggestion by disappointed people that So-and-so was deprived of land because he was a Blueshirt, and that So-and-so did not get land because he was not in Fianna Fáil.  I am afraid that very often I am accused in the Land Commission of giving land to nobody but Blueshirts.  However, you cannot have it every way.  The Deputy also referred to the item of <Col N="271" /> £300 for migrants and to the various experiments that were made by the last Government in bringing migrants to the eastern counties.  I realise fully the very great dangers and difficulties that accompany any policy of migration, but I do not see any reason why we should not go on with it.  We have got to relieve the position in the western counties, and when there is a fair amount of land&mdash;good land and rich land&mdash;in the east it is only fair, as Deputy Ben Maguire said, that a reasonable attitude should be taken up by the people of these eastern counties in regard to making room for a certain percentage of migrants coming in.  We have taken every precaution.  Every thing that we can do to prevent mistakes is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are putting these new migrants in a colony at Athboy.  We are doing a certain amount of tillage for them before they come.  We are trying to ensure that they will get a good start off, and a reasonable chance of making good.  We have arranged with the Department of Agriculture to supply a first-class agricultural instructor, and we propose to continue this policy of migration from the different counties &mdash;Donegal, Kerry, Galway and Mayo&mdash; and from the different congested areas in order to try and relieve to some extent the congestion in those areas. I feel that it is reasonable that a certain percentage of the large ranch lands that we will be breaking up should go to these people.  It is suggested here that they will not make good: that they have not the capacity for learning agriculture.  It is an extraordinary thing that when these people go out of this country to England, Scotland and America they are able to show that they are as intelligent&mdash;if not more intelligent&mdash;as the emigrants from other countries.  I have no fear about their making good. I admit that it means a drastic change in their lives.  The conditions of agriculture will be different in their new surroundings to what they were in their old, but we have got to make a start somewhere.  We cannot go on leaving these people on the rocks of Connemara and Donegal ignoring <Col N="272" /> them.  That is not my policy and it is not going to be my policy.</P>
    <P>This links up with a matter that Deputy Davin raised.  I want to make it perfectly clear how we try to work out a basis on this migration policy. Naturally, we must try to have a friendly atmosphere in the area to which we bring these people.  That means that we have got to try to solve the problem of congestion in that area. The ex-employees have the first claim on the divided land there, then the people who are on uneconomic holdings, and when we have relieved the immediate congestion in the area we start to use up the spare land to relieve congestion in the West.  That policy is being pursued.  In our colony in Meath, we satisfied all the people in that area who showed any likelihood of being able to make good on the land before we attempted to arrange for the bringing of even one family from the West.  That is a necessary step even for the safety, security and peace of the migrants who would be coming there&mdash;to ensure that they would not be coming into an area where there would be any hostility or feeling of resentment because of their coming.  Deputy Roddy raised the question of the loss on untenanted lands in hands.  This figure has to be conjectural each year.  We do not always know how lands will work out, but I think there is very little to complain about in an additional Estimate of, I think, £2,000 for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin raised the question of the old I.R.A. men.  The pre-Truce I.R.A. men have a definite claim on any Government in this country, and, as such, are considered in the different categories.  Other things being equal, a pre-Truce I.R.A. man would have a claim over the man who was not a pre-Truce I.R.A. man, but the qualifications are always kept in mind&mdash;the likelihood of the man making good on the land and the individual type of character.  If he has a certain amount of capital and is able to supply stock, that is also taken into consideration. I need not go into all the details.  The Land Commission inspectors are naturally intelligent men who know what is needed and who know the peculiar <Col N="273" /> qualities necessary to give a man a chance of making good on the land. It is not our desire to put even one allottee on a holding unless we are satisfied that we have picked, so far as this can be humanly gauged, a reasonably good type of character who is out to make good and who will, in all probability, make good.  Deputy Davin raised the question of grants. Very few grants for stock are now being given.  The Land Commission feel that it is a dangerous type of grant, but we do make grants of £30, £40 and £50 in many cases where a man has no capital or very limited capital.  Those grants are dependent on the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that grants be given.  I suggested that suitable landless men might be provided with loans free of interest for a reasonable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to say anything about that at the moment. Deputy Davin raised the question of the displacement of employees when acreage is taken over for forestry.  He said that every effort should be made to give the displaced men work at the forestry if they were not provided with holdings.  Every effort is made, when we are taking over land for forestry and when former employees on the estate are not being provided with land, to give them employment in connection with the forestry scheme. As regards playing pitches, that is one of the first things we consider in taking over an estate.  Quite a number of playing pitches are being provided and I hope we shall be able to continue to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of County Kildare.  I do not know when he got his reply to the question he quoted here this afternoon, but I <Col N="274" /> can tell him that already over 70,000 acres of untenanted land have been divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also knows that there is still an amount of turbary to be divided.  Deputy Corry referred to 3,000 acres of land in one parish which have been reported to the Land Commission and which have not yet been acquired.  I am surprised that the Deputy did not suggest that if the land had been in a Blueshirt neighbourhood it would have been taken over already.  Deputy Belton raised some points with regard to giving land to men who had special qualifications for the development of land.  I presume that he meant by that men who had had training in agricultural colleges and so on.  We always look for the most capable men, particularly when we are looking for landless men, and, naturally, a man with special qualifications of that kind would be looked upon as the best man. There are some peculiar qualifications in such cases.  In one case you have men with special qualifications for land and in other cases you have what one might call land followers.  It has often struck me that the attitude taken towards the land by a number of people is rather peculiar.  For instance, even in the Seanad you will hear certain Senators say that land is no good&mdash;that it is not a paying proposition&mdash;but the moment we touch the land that they say is no good we have at least five or ten Senators getting up to protest against it, and we cannot satisfy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coburn referred to County Louth.  Perhaps that is because we have a Minister in County Louth and we are doing very little in it.  The Deputy must know, however, that County Louth is a county that we do <Col N="275" /> not look upon as one that affords much scope for additional tillage.  The main thing is that the Land Commission is working at top speed.  The whole staff are working at top speed, and I think it will be found that with the extended powers under the 1933 Act there will be a considerable speeding up in the division of untenanted land and land on Congested Districts Board estates.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, Sir. There were two matters in connection with this Vote.  I understood that one was in connection with Haulbowline Dockyard and that the other was in connection with the building of new offices for the Department of Industry and Commerce on the vacant site of Maple's Hotel in Kildare Street, Dublin.  The purpose of my intervention was to inquire as to whether the appropriation of a very substantial sum of money for the purpose of setting up a new establishment for the accommodation of the Department of Industry and Commerce was justified. It has to be borne in mind that this money is not for the purpose of the actual expense of erecting a new building but for the purpose of offering a prize for a suitable design that might be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might intervene for a moment.  In a moment of weakness, I allowed Alderman Tom Kelly to follow a certain line or argument and, consequently, Deputy Mulcahy was allowed to follow <Col N="278" /> on similar lines.  I do, however, deprecate a resumption of that irrelevant argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only referring, Sir, to Alderman Kelly so that I might be enabled to follow the same line of argument.  He and other Deputies drew attention to the possible use of this money for the erection of a museum or a municipal concert hall instead of using the money for increasing the buildings already allocated to the use of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Ever since the Minister took office bureaucracy has grown and flourished throughout this country and it has become virtually impossible to transact business in this country without going through all that bureaucracy.  I think that this House ought to make a protest against any further expenditure of public money and against any further expenditure for buildings to be set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I agree that some useful purpose might be served by gathering the various branches of the Minister's Department into one building, but I object most strongly to erecting one of the largest centres of bureaucracy in this country for a purpose that I hope may be materially mitigated one day. In order to mark my violent disagreement with the Minister and with his rapidly growing licensing system which tends to create confusion and corruption, I propose to disagree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of items involved in this Estimate on which I wish to say a few words.  The sub-head (I) (3) of £40 in respect of instruction in connection with special land settlement schemes is in relation to a scheme of migration in County Meath under the Land Commission.  With regard to sub-head K (2)&mdash;Contribution to Irish Agricultural Organisation Society&mdash;it was thought that the Co-operative Act might be law before the end of this financial year, but there is no hope of that now, so that a sum of £2,010 will be necessary for the remaining quarter of the financial year.  The sub-head K (4) of £200&mdash;Grant to Royal Horticultural <Col N="282" /> Society of Ireland&mdash;is in connection with the fruit show held in Dublin last autumn at the request of the Department in relation to the campaign for stimulating the production of more and better fruit in the Saorstát. Sub-head M (1) of £100 for miscellaneous work, is for advertising and publicity in connection with fruit.  The sum of £8,500 in sub-head M (5)&mdash; Improvement of the Creamery Industry &mdash;is required in connection with a scheme for a dairying industry in Dingle peninsula.  The completed scheme will cost £25,250.</P>
      <P>The sum of £3,349 in sub-head M (8) &mdash;Butter Purchase Scheme&mdash;is a yearly item where the Dairy Disposals Board purchases the butter available when the prohibition is put on the export of butter about the month of October. Where creameries have butter on hands and are not financially able to hold it over, it is purchased by the Dairy Disposals Board and afterwards released. The sum of £5 in sub-head M (9)&mdash;Purchase and Export of Eggs&mdash;has been put in as a token in order that the scheme for the export of eggs to Germany may have the sanction of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister going to give us no information about that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to have further information I can give it to him.  There is a certain quota of eggs which, I think, would amount to about 100,000 great hundreds for the present quarter.  They are being exported by the Newmarket Dairy Company, which is controlled by the Government.  It is not expected that there will be any loss on them and, as a matter of fact, it will probably be a profitable transaction.  There is, however, some expense on the part of the Government in the administration or carrying out of these agreements, including the agreement for shipping a certain amount of eggs.  With regard to the sum of £850 in sub-head M (10) &mdash;grant in respect of additional sugar beet grown in the Cooley district&mdash; there was a special subsidy given to the Cooley growers of 2/- per ton because <Col N="283" /> the freight from that particular district to the nearest factory was heavy.  The reason why a special consideration was given to that area was that it is a scheduled area with regard to potatoes, that is, they cannot avail of prices in the home market, but must export their potatoes.  They are given special consideration in the growing of beet.</P>
      <P>The sum of £10 in sub-head N (3)&mdash; Horse Breeding Act, 1934&mdash;is required for the payment of travelling expenses of members of the Consultative Council under the Horse Breeding Act.  The sum of £8,000 in sub-head O (9)&mdash; Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933 and 1934&mdash;is required for advances to seed merchants under a scheme of credit for seed wheat.  The sum of £3,500 was provided in the original Estimate but the scheme was availed of to a greater extent than was anticipated and the additional sum is now required.  Also, under this head, there is a bounty on home-grown millable wheat of £5,000.  That is the ordinary subsidy paid to growers.  The original Estimate of £120,000 was also an under-estimate, and £5,000 is now required to make up the full amount.</P>
      <P>The sum of £57,000 in sub-head O (13) &mdash;Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act, 1934&mdash;is required in respect of the purchase of beef for distribution to recipients of unemployment assistance and of outdoor relief or home assistance, which is costing £57,000 more than was anticipated.  The sum originally provided for this purpose was £133,000, but, owing to an increase in the price of beef, it has now been found necessary to bring the total estimated cost of the purchase of beef during the financial year 1934-35 up to £150,000. The sum of £45,000 for the purchase and export of cattle is in respect of the purchase of cattle for export to Germany under the trade agreement with that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the <i>Evening Herald</i> would make a joke on that side.  It is necessary to provide £50 for the travelling expenses of members of the Consultative Council under the Cattle Act.  There are anticipated savings under this Act, of £46,000, which was provided for the factory for canning meat, and which it will not be necessary to spend during this financial year, and of £55,000, which was provided for compensation for animals slaughtered, as the factory that is being provided for old cows will not be in operation this financial year either.</P>
      <P>The sum of £35 under sub-head O (14)&mdash;Tobacco Act, 1934&mdash;is required to provide fees to the valuer and travelling expenses and incidental expenses of the valuer.  The services of a valuer were required to place a relative valuation on the grades of sample loads of tobacco drawn from each rehandling station, and assembled for convenience in Dublin.  The provision of £10 for incidental expenses is principally for accommodation at the bonded stores in Dublin in connection with valuations.</P>
      <P>There is an estimated deficiency of £57,000 under Appropriations-in-Aid. Under sub-head O (13) the registration fees of victuallers' premises is £500 below the estimate.  The sales of tinned beef, meat extracts, etc., are nil as the factory has not yet started and the receipts from the sale of cattle exported on the other hand will come in as an appropriation of £22,500.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have explained that.  There were, as a matter of fact, <Col N="285" /> while preparing for the erection of this canning factory, experiments carried out on certain Kerry cattle.  They were supplied to the Waterford Co-operative Meat Factory at a certain price and the tinned meat was sold. The Appropriation does not represent the price of the meat, but what was paid actually for the cattle to us.  We paid more for the cattle than the Waterford factory paid us, and what was received for the cattle was a sum of £900.  There was an Estimate of £90,000 under sub-head M (7) for a purchase of oats scheme.  There is no expenditure under that heading and there will be a corresponding reduction, as against that Estimate, of £57,000 in the Appropriation-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>It is partly, in this way that the cattle for which £45,000 was paid by the Government will be partly paid for by the end of the financial year.  There will be a couple of weeks' cattle unpaid for at the end of the financial year.  That is the difference.</P>

      <P>One is precluded on a Supplementary Estimate of this kind from covering the whole policy of the Government with regard to agriculture. But here we have a Supplementary Estimate of 12 headings covering a variety of the Department's activities.  One would expect the Minister for Agriculture, when introducing this Estimate, would give some explanation as to the progress of the various schemes which are being administered under these sub-heads.  One would expect him to give some justification for coming to the House for more money than has already been appropriated.  In fact the Minister finds himself in the deplorable position of being able to do no more than read <Col N="286" /> the printed explanations.  I do not blame the Minister.  He has a most appalling job.  His position has been made impossible by his own colleagues and everyone knows it.</P>
      <P>We have, under the first sub-head, here an appropriation for instruction in connection with special land settlement schemes.  What is the nature of these schemes to be?  The mind of the Department of Agriculture, on the question as to what is the best form of agriculture for our people, changes from day to day, from week to week, and from hour to hour.  We are told on Monday the cattle trade is dead, and that it is a good job it is dead. We are told on Tuesday that nobody but a fool or a knave would wish to see the cattle trade dead, and we are informed on the following Friday that a trade agreement is being entered into with Great Britain whereunder we are to get permission to ship an extra number of cattle to Great Britain in exchange for extra shipment of British coal.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to say, when he is sending down his instructors to the people he is putting on the land, what directions he gives the instructor.  Does the instructor advise them to keep live stock, or does he tell them that it is an act of treachery to this country to go into the live stock business?  Does he advise them to grow wheat, or if he does, has he any advice to give them as to the rotation of crops in the subsequent years, and in giving them advice has he any counsel to offer them as to how they are to dispose of the produce of that rotation?</P>
      <P>Surely if we are to vote money in connection with special land settlement schemes we should know what is the nature of the instruction that is to be given.  I wonder if the Minister knows. I venture to suggest that the instruction which the Minister would give to-day is something entirely different from what he will give when the necessity arises.  I think the Minister might have told us what these special land settlement schemes are and what does he hope to see the people whom he puts upon them engaged on.  Perhaps he will tell us before we finish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The next interesting sub-head is M (1)&mdash;Miscellaneous Work.  Under that sub-head we discover that the Minister wants £100 additional provision for advertising and publicity.  I ask the Minister a question in that regard.  If we are to provide money for advertising and publicity, are we to understand that that money is to be used as a blackmailing fund in order to coerce the newspapers of this country to publish only what the Minister wants the people of this country to read and only what he thinks it is proper that they should read?  Are we to understand that if any newspaper in this country wishes to criticise the follies of the present Minister for Agriculture, that newspaper will be given none of the advertising for which we are providing the money?  The Minister recently boasted in this House that the Department of Agriculture withdrew their advertising from a number of newspapers because their leading articles did not agree with the schemes which he desired to advertise.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is <i>bona fide</i> surely he will agree that the very people he wants to read those advertisements are the people who are reading the leading articles criticising his policy.  If he wants to make his case is it not in these newspapers he should publish his advertisements and give cogent reasons for the schemes he is sponsoring? Would not this be a very good explanation of the Minister's attitude: &ldquo;If you are prepared to give us a leg up on the political fence we will be prepared to give you a leg up on the advertising side.  I have got a very nice comfortable fund here which I can employ for the purpose of giving advertisements to well-behaved newspapers. Be careful that you are a well-behaved newspaper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I venture to say that if we in this House vote money for the purpose of advocating Government schemes it is not for the purpose of bringing advertisements to newspapers which state that President de Valera is the greatest man that ever yet appeared in this country.  We are voting money so as to explain to the newspaper readers that the policy of the Government is <Col N="288" /> so and so, that they are pursuing certain lines of action and so on.  I think the Minister should assure us on this matter and he should go so far as to say that the same impartiality will be observed in the distribution of these advertisements as would be observed by a court of law or any other Government Department in giving advertisements to the Press.  It is something new in my experience for public money to be used by a Government for the purpose of advertising highly controversial policies.</P>
    <P>However, I am prepared to admit that once Dáil Eireann sets the seal of its approval upon any policy put up by Fianna Fáil, however foolish, the Government is entitled to use public money to promote it.  But has it ever occurred to the Minister that advertising and publicity would be very much more advantageous to us if used for the purpose of promoting markets for our produce than in being used for the purpose of persuading the people to produce something for which there is no market?  If the Minister wants to appropriate money for publicity, why does he not try to advertise what we have to sell in the market where we could sell it most advantageously?  I think there is enormous scope in Great Britain for advertising the live stock and farm produce of this country.  I believe that there are inherent qualities in what we have to sell in that market that are not available in any other market from which Great Britain gets its imports.  The same may be true of Germany and Spain and Arabia; for all I know the Minister has gone looking there for a market. Surely he must have thought at some time that the real crux with which we are faced at present is not a production crux but a marketing crux.  If the Minister will get us markets the farmers will produce the goods.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is a deep cleavage between our outlook and the Minister's.  We believe that the people ought to turn their land to the best advantage and so to manage it as to get for the greatest number of people the highest standard of living that the land can provide.  The Minister <Col N="289" /> believes, on the contrary, apparently, that inside a Wall of China we are all to sink gradually down to the lowest standard of living at which the Irish people can survive.  Perhaps looking for foreign markets or advertising our goods in foreign markets would not be consistent with that policy but, seeing that the Minister has proved so obliging in other ways when we asked him to change his mind about very fundamental convictions he had, he might consider changing his mind about that and he might realise that the time is ripe now for doing what he has so signally failed to do for the last three years, and that is to provide an adequate market in which to dispose of our produce and to improve the market he has got by advertising the qualities of the stuff we have to offer and so secure for our people the better price that advertised goods can get in a good market.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (8) deals with the butter purchase scheme.  I gather this has to do with some annual arrangement he has with creameries unable to finance their own cold-stored butter.  I do not know whether any of the money is going to be used for selling Irish butter on the German market.  There was a time when the Minister was engaged on large scale operations exporting butter.  I remember asking the Minister for Defence, then temporarily acting as Minister for Agriculture, what price he was realising for this butter on a foreign market and the Minister for Defence replied that he would inform me in confidence.  I told him I did not want the information in confidence, that I wanted it in public; I considered I was entitled to it.  However, it was not forthcoming on that occasion.  Is the Minister now prepared to tell the House what price he got for the butter which he sold in the alternative markets about which Fianna Fáil used to be so proud in the good old days?  Is he prepared to tell us the profit he made on it and why to date we have never had an Appropriation-in-Aid appearing on the Department of Agriculture Estimates in respect of the profits that the Minister for Agriculture made trading in butter in the Fianna Fáil alternative market?  Surely you have been <Col N="290" /> engaged in that trade under the shadow of darkness for long enough.  Sooner or later you are going to render an account to someone.  I suggest this is the acceptable time.  There will be another laurel wreath of achievement on the brow of the Government.</P>
    <P>In connection with the problem of butter production, I suggest to the Government that instead of spending the oceans of money which they are spending and which they have been spending in an endeavour to find markets at the other end of the world for our butter, they would be much more profitably employed spending some money courageously on the promotion of winter dairying in this country.  One of the greatest hindrances to the development of the dairying industry here has been that when butter is at its cheapest we have it for export, but when it is making a good price in the markets of the world we have not got any to sell.  That in itself is bad enough, but anyone familiar with the trade knows that inability to keep up a supply, winter and summer, means that you get a very much worse price when you have the butter in summer because you cannot establish the regular trade connections that you otherwise would have if you were in a position to supply the wholesale distributors with fresh churned butter consistently throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I have seen recently several observations by the Minister in regard to winter dairying, and I should be interested to hear from him now if he sees any insurmountable difficulty in promoting winter dairying, or whether he agrees with me that it is largely a question of explaining to the butter-producing farmers the advantages of adapting their industry to an all round the year production rather than to a grass production of butter and a comparatively dry winter.  I throw that suggestion out to the Minister.  He might redeem his rather shattered reputation if he could go out of office saying he had established winter dairying in this country.  I think I could promise him that the proverbial charity of our people would attach that to his recollection rather than his many misdeeds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The Minister referred to sub-head M (9) for the purchase and export of eggs.  In the course of his references he made a most astonishing statement. I was reading for weeks that German trade delegates had arrived in Dublin, the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce were all gone, that the Department of Agriculture was humming with anticipation and that a great trade agreement to the advantage of our people was going to be signed with one of the alternative markets&mdash; or at least going to take shape.  Our enthusiasm was somewhat damped when we discovered that the agreement took the shape of requiring the purchase of £3 worth of German goods to every £1 worth that the Germans bought from us.  However, half a loaf was better than no bread.  Now I learn, to my astonishment, that the quota of eggs that we have secured in the German market is being exported entirely by a Government-owned creamery.  Are we to understand that none of the advantage of the price that is to be got from the German market for this quota of eggs is to be passed on to the ordinary farmers?  Is it all to pass through the hands of the Government exporter?  Is there no marketing board to be set up under which the sale of the eggs could be more equitably distributed amongst the various producers?</P>
    <P>The Minister will at least agree with me that if I have been led into any misapprehension in regard to the method in which these eggs are going to be exported it is due to the fact that he has withheld all the relevant information.  He told us that this token vote was in connection with an enterprise upon which the Newmarket Dairy Company, which the Government control, was engaged in, in exporting eggs to Germany.  I do not really fully understand what the nature of this transaction has been to date.  I know that the Minister or his colleagues have seized cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, furniture and everything movable, but I have not heard of them seizing any eggs yet in respect of land annuities.  I can think of no other explanation than that in pursuit of <Col N="292" /> some kind of agreement the Government are shipping eggs to fill the quota they got from the German Government. I think such an arrangement is highly unsatisfactory, and the House is entitled to some fuller explanation of what in fact they are doing.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask the Minister in regard to the British quota on eggs, is there any understanding between the Irish Department of Agriculture and the British Department of Agriculture with regard to the British quota regulations on imports of eggs?  Are we in fact shipping to Great Britain at present more eggs than our quota allows, or are we filling our quota, or has any quota been fixed in respect to this country?  I would ask the Minister to give us a full account of any negotiations which may have taken place between his Department and the British Department in that regard.  I suggest to the Minister that that information should have been forthcoming before now.</P>
    <P>I raised on a previous occasion the question of the egg cases in which we were being compelled to ship our eggs. I pointed out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that some of his regulations had resulted in making it virtually impossible to get foreign timber in the shape of battens where-with to manufacture cubicle egg cases. On that occasion the Minister for Industry and Commerce stoutly denied that the use of native timber for the manufacture of cubicle egg cases had any undesirable effect on eggs at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am considered irrelevant the Chair will interrupt me, but in the meantime I would be grateful if the Minister for Finance would keep quiet.  I produced correspondence to show the Minister that some of the leading distributors of eggs in England had informed me that the use of native timber had resulted in the destruction of large quantities of Irish eggs and in the deterioration of very great quantities of Irish eggs in cold storage. As usual, the Minister for Industry and Commerce repudiated that suggestion <Col N="293" /> and said there was nothing in it. I notice that in the conditions laid down for the export of eggs, not only to Germany, but Spain as well, it is specifically required that the eggs shall be packed in cubicle cases manufactured of foreign dried timber and the shipping agents in Dublin will not accept eggs for despatch to these markets unless they are so packed. Have those conditions been laid down with the approval of the Minister for Agriculture, or is he aware that the agents shipping eggs to these centres have stipulated that the eggs should be so packed?  If he is so aware, why does he allow his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to insist on the vast bulk of exported eggs in this country going out in what he knows to be unsuitable cases, in what he knows to be packages which are materially injuring our trade in the best market we have got?  These are questions which I suppose the Minister will not think it even worth while dwelling on, but these are questions affecting the farmers and the agricultural community and depriving them of a large part of what they might legitimately expect to earn in the prosecution of their business.</P>
      <P>Under item M (10), we are going to give a grant in respect of additional sugar beet grown in the Cooley district. It is time that the Minister for Agriculture faced the beet situation. He is supposed to represent the farmers and look after their interests, and he has allowed the Beet Sugar Company to put over on the farmers one of the most damaging bargains that has ever been put over on the agricultural community to date.  These Cooley farmers are going to receive a flat rate of 37s. 6d. for beet without any regard to the sugar content at all.  A situation may develop in which those farmers, who are getting their seed from the beet factory, can be handed out seed which will produce beet little bigger than a carrot with a sugar content of up to 19 or 20 per cent. and get paid for it on a tonnage basis at the rate of 37s. 6d.</P>

The beet sugar factories can control the sugar content of the beet, and a situation may develop in which the farmers will be getting from the factories in Carlow, Thurles, Tuam and Mallow 37s. 6d. for beet that, on the old 30s. basis, bad and all as it was, they would have got 40s. or more, and, on the 39s. basis, they would have got 47s. 6d. or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not possible by the regulation of the seed to provide that the type of beet produced by the farmer will be far less weighty than another type with a far higher sugar content?  Is there not a point where beet ought to be a certain size with a certain sugar content to give men the best possible return on the old 30s. basis?  Is it not possible to swing, by the manipulation of the seed when dealing with it on a flat-rate basis, the scales against the producer?  Does the Minister not know that as well as I do ? Did not the Minister allow the producers to be forced into that bargain by the misery he brought upon them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to realise that if he stipulates, as he ought to stipulate, for a living wage for the operatives in these factories, it is far more his duty to stipulate for a living wage for the men producing the beet. There is one matter on which I should like to suggest to him that he should take the example of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="295" /> and that is at least in making a clamour about getting a living wage for the people for whom he is responsible. The Minister for Industry and Commerce at least pretends to do that. He vigorously denies what he knows to be true, that the sweating and rotten labour conditions such as Deputy Norton has on more than one occasion described&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us find a difficulty in living up to the faith that is in us.  The Deputy opened his speech by stating&mdash;quite correctly&mdash; that in debating a Supplementary Estimate it is not permissible to range over the whole field of agricultural policy.  He is now, however, engaged in discussing the administration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the price of beet throughout the State.  A moment's reflection will convince him that neither of these questions is germane to Item M (10) of this Vote, an item which deals with a special grant for Cooley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to confine my observations entirely to the price of beet in the Cooley area only, so that my observations may be taken as not having reference to any beet farmer outside Cooley.  The analogy I am seeking to establish is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for the industrial population of the country.  He professes to insist on a living wage for these people, and he has frequently declared in this House that whatever legislation may be necessary to secure a living wage for these people he is prepared to put through the House.  The Minister for Agriculture is responsible for the agricultural community and he is solicitous to ensure that the inside beet sugar factory workers will get a living wage.  He is most sympathetic about it whenever any representations are made to him.  But he consents to a price basis for beet in the Cooley area which means that the farmers who are growing it must either go bankrupt or pay the agricultural labourers in that area slave wages.  I say this to him: &ldquo;If you are going to <Col N="296" /> get a living wage for the operatives inside the factories I think you are perfectly right; but do not stand on the threshold of the factory and say that there is going to be a price provided for beet, if you have made up your mind to grow beet without counting the cost, which will provide a decent livelihood for the men working on the production of that crop.&rdquo;  I made that case before and the Labour Benches, which are now empty, chose to twist that into a suggestion that I had exhorted the Minister for Agriculture to reduce industrial wages down to 24/- a week although the members of that Party knew perfectly well that I had pressed on the Minister for Agriculture the exact opposite policy. It is absolutely monstrous that the Minister for Agriculture should have the effrontery to get up here and talk about labour conditions inside the factories where this beet is being manufactured into sugar, and, in the next breath, say that he bases his calculations and costings in the Department of Agriculture on the basis of an agricultural wage of 24/- for a 54-hour week.  That is what I condemn this for.  That is what I ask the Minister for Agriculture to give his attention to, and to change his mind upon, and he should not find it as difficult to change his mind about that as about the cattle industry and the live-stock industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the sub-head, under which the Minister is going to provide additional subsidies for advances to seed merchants under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act and an additional provision for payment of bounties on home grown millable wheat.  I am told that the Government is guaranteeing to growers of wheat an economic price.  I read these advertisements which are given to the well-behaved newspapers, which assure me that, if I want to make my fortune, all I have got to do is to go out and sow wheat.  Is it not a strange thing if that is so, the county committees of agriculture in this country have to bribe the farmers of the country to grow wheat?  This House may be under the impression that the money that is here appropriated to subsidise <Col N="297" /> wheat, and which is running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, is all the money that is being spent for that pious purpose.  But not at all.  There are County Committees of Agriculture in this country who are contributing 50 per cent. of the cost of seed in order to induce people to grow wheat.  In that case we have got some track of the cost but I hear rumours that the Minister for Agriculture contemplates putting the whole cost of the wheat-growing business on the price of flour. I should be glad to hear whether there is any truth in that rumour because if that once happens we have lost all track of what the wheat-growing business is going to cost the country. I think it is very desirable, in order that the wheat experiment should be tried out to its logical conclusion, that the House should have before it constantly what this wheat-growing business is costing the country.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is his intention to finance this enterprise out of the public purse or has he in the back of his mind a scheme whereunder he will transfer the whole cost of this scheme to the price of flour and so hide from the public eye forever the true cost of wheat-growing in this country?</P>
    <P>I have put one question to the Minister frequently: What advice is he to give to his wheat-growing farmers as to what they will do with their land in the years that will intervene between one wheat crop and another? He has never been able to answer that question yet and I do not suppose he ever will be.  I put it to him if we are going to have oats, a root crop and grass, in the way of rotation, what are we going to do with these crops, if we cannot turn them to the only purpose for which they can be properly used, the production of live stock, and if he is going to make it impossible for us to sell live stock on a profitable basis?</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he requires an additional sum for the distribution of free beef.  He told us in one of his lighter moments that there was going to be an increase of, I think, 150 per cent. in the slaughter <Col N="298" /> of beef at the Dublin abbatoir as a result of his distribution of free beef.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said any such thing and the Deputy knows it.  I said that it would be 150 per cent. over 1932 which is a very different thing. I had already pointed out that it was 70 per cent. better than 1932 before the free beef scheme came in.</P>

My recollection was that he was asked whether there would be a distribution of one and a half pounds of free beef for every pound bought beef and that he assented to that proposition.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister if he was paying himself the bounties on exports, and if he was trading on minimum prices in the Dublin market, and he answered that he was not getting any bounties and was not trading on minimum prices.  The bounty system was introduced in order to help farmers, owing to the penal tariffs that were imposed by Great Britain.  The Minister's supporters argue consistently that the bounties go back to the farmers.  Now, we discover that the Minister's agents go to fairs and buy beasts at the lowest penny at which they can get them without being arrested by Civic Guards.  Does the Minister get the bounties and pass them on to the farmers?  Not a bit of it. But if some poor cattle jobber did that, and if he was found out, the Minister said that he would see that such a man did not get another licence to export. <Col N="301" /> We were told that if it was proved any cattle exporter put the bounties into his pocket the Minister would see that he got no more licences to export; while at the same time the Minister is putting the bounties into the Government's pocket.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the <Col N="302" /> farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-35.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Estimates we have had before us are about the best indication that we could have of the position of agriculture, and are better than any speeches that could be made, especially the closing passages, where the Minister thinks that 22s. a cwt. is a good paying price for beef.  He said that when he went into the market he put up the price of beef there.  Good beef was selling at 17s. a cwt. in the market to-day, and more of it went home than was sold.  Previous speakers mentioned places at which the President, on the eve of gaining office, offered derating as a bribe.  One place that was not mentioned was Sligo, where the question was directly put to him and where the President promised derating.  Another Deputy, who is now Minister for Education, laboured the question in long correspondence that appeared in the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> in 1930-31.  Deputy Corry was at one time so enthusiastic about derating that he claimed the authorship of the proposal.  The Deputy is now in the position of claiming authorship of a forgotten movement. When the Deputy goes into Opposition again, I have no doubt he will be a staunch derater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to introduce any new features into the arguments put forward.  The position created by the economic war is entirely distinct from the case for derating before the economic war started.  Summarised, it is simply this, that the local authorities have to strike rates to pay money that is not paid out by the Government.  The British Government collects the duties from the farmers and also collects sums equivalent to the pensions, while at the same time the Government here collects taxes to cover both pensions and local loans. The farmers pay £2,000,000, represented by local loans and pensions, to the British Government, while the <Col N="303" /> Government here collects a like sum in taxes, and has it in the Exchequer, but does not use it for the purpose.  If the Government does not meet the claims for which the money has been collected for a number of years, it is only a question of equity and justice to have it transferred to the credit of the farmers, seeing that they have paid it.  The only stock-in-trade argument that the Government have as a set-off is that there are subsidies on wheat, beet and peat.  The cultivation of wheat and beet and the production of peat is part of Government policy, and that policy should be prepared to stand by itself and should not be contingent on the economic war.  If the economic war ceases that policy must continue. The Government sees every argument, but I dare say they do not want to face the position and that their supporters will vote against this motion.  There are people looking on, watching such consistency or inconsistency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one motion that the Government should accept, in view of their past statements, it is this one.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture has left, but as we have Deputy Corry here I shall be glad to refresh his memory.  Speaking in this House, col. 2178, vol. 37, of Parliamentary Debates, we find the following statement by the President:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We find there is a diminution of capital wealth, a diminution of the farmers' income, and we find, side by side with this reduction in the price which the farmer gets for his produce and with the reduction of his capital wealth, that the prices of what he has to buy do not keep step at all.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the statement made by Deputy de Valera, as he then was, from these benches.  Before I conclude I will quote for the House the prices paid then and now.  On that same motion Deputy Dr. Ryan said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If we were in the position here of being able to say that we were only going through a temporary depression in agriculture and that we felt that at the end of 1931 we would have turned the corner&mdash;the corner <Col N="304" /> about which we have heard so often &mdash;we might have some patience and even some consideration for the Derating Commission, and give them time to present the best report possible and allow the Executive Council to consider it.  There is, however, no time for that.  There is no prospect for farming, so far as we can see.  The prospects for farming were never worse.  Up to last year we thought that things were going to improve, but now we see that they are going the other way and that relief is wanted immediately if we are to keep farmers in production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was not a member of the House on that occasion.  This is what Deputy Corry said on that same occasion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We read a great many statements about the unity of the country. Does anyone mean to tell me that there is a farmer in the North of Ireland who would be fool enough to come into the Free State so as to have the pleasure of paying rates? The farmers in Northern Ireland have paid no agricultural rates for the last two years.  If you are ever going to bring in the North you will have to give them as good terms as they are getting from their own Government.  I maintain that rates on agricultural land are an absolute bar to the unity of this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder what lobby Deputy Corry will go into when this motion is put to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good many farmers members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but, of course, they are conveniently absent when a motion like this is being discussed.  Side by side with these statements I want to quote the prices that prevailed then and now. These are taken from official returns published by the Department of Agriculture. They make very interesting reading.  Take the first item&mdash;calves up to six months&mdash;the price in 1931 was from £2 12s. 6d. to £3 15s.  The price this year is from 6s. to £1 5s. 5d., and in 1931 we had all this talk about the depression in agriculture.  The <Col N="305" /> price of first-class stores, from one to two years old, in 1931 was from £12 to £14 10s., and in 1935 the prices are from £3 to £4 15s.  In 1931 the price for fat bullocks and heifers was from £18 to £24&mdash;the average live weight price per cwt. being 43s. to 45s.&mdash; and in 1935 the price is £7 10s. to £13 10s. as quoted here, while we know they are being sold at from 17s. to 22s. per cwt.  Yet we have Deputies objecting to a motion like this being tabled for discussion.</P>
      <P>Is it not plain, in view of the facts and figures I have quoted, that the present position cannot be maintained? The price of pigs in 1931 was from 68s. to 71s. per cwt. dead weight, and the price in 1935 is 58s.  There is the same variation in butter prices.  These facts make it clear that this situation cannot go on, and that farmers cannot continue to meet even State demands for the payment of rates and annuities. We had a statement made by the President which was quoted the other night.  It was made by him and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1931, and was to the effect that they were committed to full derating.  That was the time when they were talking about the depression in agriculture. Would not many people feel very pleased if they were getting 1931 prices to-day?  Of course some members of the Fianna Fáil Party will stand up and say: &ldquo;We have given you wheat and beet,&rdquo; but as I said before wheat and beet will not solve the problems of the agricultural community, and even if they are pushed to their utmost limits will not enable them to meet the payment of their rates and annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the finances of the public bodies are concerned, I consider that the Government are the greatest defaulters themselves.  Last year they deducted £33,000 from the Agricultural Grant payable to South Tipperary. We do not know what we will get this year.  I do not want to speak at length on the motion, but I think I have given sufficient facts to prove that the Government are bound in honour to give relief to the farmers in their present position.  If this so-called national fight is to go on, there is no <Col N="306" /> reason why the farmers should be the only people who are made to suffer.  I hope in view of all the circumstances that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will give careful consideration to the motion.  It is absolutely necessary, if the local services are to be maintained, that relief be given so that the farmers may be able to meet the payment of their rates and annuities.  I know that, in my own constituency, the rate collection is backward. I have seen that in the Press. That is so notwithstanding that there is a Commissioner operating there.  I am sure that the Minister has had several conversations with the Commissioner in order to obtain information as to the situation there.  I appeal earnestly to the farmer-sympathisers in the Fianna Fáil Party to support this motion.  I think that it is their duty to do so.  They supported a similar motion in other times which were not nearly so bad for the agricultural community. There is no justification for anybody in any part of the House refraining from going into the Lobby in support of this motion.  I have quoted statements made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party from the President down.  The substance of this motion constituted the swan-song of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1931.  I have quoted the prices then and the prices as they are now, and will anybody say that there is no responsibility on the Government to relieve the agricultural community of rates in present conditions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements made by me have been rather extensively used in connection with this motion.  I am anxious, in the first instance, to clear the air.  I was very definitely in favour of derating until I saw the result of the first relief which was given.  I saw how the Earl of Barrymore got in relief of rates about double the amount given to two parishes combined &mdash;the parish in which I live and the parish adjoining it.  I saw the freehold rancher-owners getting relief of rates while the small farmers had still to pay their full annuities.  We had to consider which would give the most relief to the ordinary farmer&mdash;derating <Col N="307" /> in which the estate-owner or rancher would get the largest plum or relief in the shape of halving the annuities, in the first place, and further relief in connection with farms under £10 valuation and according to the amount of labour employed by farmers.  Between these two proposals, neither I nor any other farmer or representative of farmers who had to consider the question, could hesitate for a moment. If the man with a 1,000 acres or the man with the dog was going to get his rates wiped out, while the small farmer of 20 or 30 acres was merely going to get relief in respect of the small amount of rates he was paying on a low valuation, while he still had to pay the full amount of his annuity, there could be only one choice.  Since these gentlemen were in possession of a freehold on which no annuity was being paid and, in the second place, were to be relieved of rates, there could be no hesitation as to what course any person who claimed to represent the Irish people would take.  Those were the two proposals we had to consider.  I, for one, am proud of the decision we took and will be proud of it since we relieve the ordinary farmer, so far as we can, in respect of his annuity and are not giving relief to the ranchers. What claim has a man in my constituency, who has 800 acres and who gives employment only to two herds, to relief of rates?  Deputy Curran has appealed for him.  Deputy Belton has appealed for him and they are supposed to represent farmers.</P>

      <P>I hope it will sink in. A good thing cannot be repeated too often, particularly when we have so many representatives of farmers&mdash;save us from them&mdash;over there.  Deputy Curran quoted prices.  I noticed that he forgot to quote the price of wheat. He did not say what the farmer in my constituency, whose land has been valued as wheat land at anything from £1 to £2 per acre, would get for the wheat he grew on that land of high valuation.  He did not tell us that the price of wheat was £6 per ton at that time&mdash;that if a farmer grew the crop on the production of which his land was valued he would get £6 per ton for it.  He did not tell us what the import of bacon was in the year 1931. He forgot that also.  He did not tell us what the import of bacon was last year.  I am concerned with the market which the Irish farmer has, and the Irish farmer to-day has a market for bacon over and above the market he had in 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy MacDermot will tell us, when he is speaking later, what he is growing on his farm.  The bacon market alone is worth £1,000,000 a year that has been kept for him.  There was close on 90,000 acres of wheat grown last year. That was a market worth about £500,000 to the farmer.  That is close on £2,000,000 altogether.  Let us take the beet market.  That is worth to the farmer about £900,000.  Those are things which, so far as beet is concerned, are subsidised, we are told.  As far as that is concerned, we are preserving here a market for the Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this motion&mdash;I hope I will have an opportunity of dealing with that on the general Agricultural Motion <Col N="309" /> about which Deputy Dillon has been speaking&mdash;but in connection with this motion dealing with the question of derating, I am not prepared to give the rancher any relief whatsoever.  I am not prepared to give the Earl of Barrymore relief from all his liabilities to the community at large.  Nor am I prepared to give relief to any of the other earls or any other of the types who have holdings of from 1,500 acres of land down to 600 acres.  I am not prepared to give such a person any relief whatsoever; but we are willing to give relief to the man of a certain valuation who is working his holding and giving work to the men employed upon that holding according to its valuation.  I believe that such a man, who is giving work to his employees, is entitled to any extra relief that could be given along the same lines, and along the same lines only.  I have a very decided objection to seeing any individual getting land in this country who is not prepared to take off his coat and work that land or to give employment to other people to work that land.  That is my principal objection.</P>
    <P>I am aware that farmers are hard hit. We had a statement in connection with this motion last night from Deputy Brennan.  A surprising thing I found last year was that the patriotism of these gentlemen was their loyalty to the &ldquo;No Rate&rdquo; campaign.  Yet, I found that in the case of the &ldquo;No Rate&rdquo; campaign and those who advocated it, their loyalty was bought for 19/10 of a credit loan.  That was the Opposition.  Their campaign was bought for 19/10.  The whole campaign was smashed last year for 19/10.  In the month of March last year the collectors in Cork were not able to take in the money quick enough.  Last year the whole &ldquo;No Rate&rdquo; campaign, that was carefully fostered and carefully worked underground and overground by the Opposition in order to cripple the local services of this country and to create such a situation as would deprive the unemployed man of home assistance and the farm labourer of his wages, was smashed because they could not withstand or were not prepared to lose, for their loyalty to that cause, the sum of 19/10 of a credit note which <Col N="310" /> brought in something between £80,000 and £90,000 in rates in County Cork last March.</P>
    <P>I have given, as fairly as I could, the reason why I considered that the best interests of the farming community could be better served by a reduction of 50 per cent. of their annuities, plus relief of the first £10 on their valuation, plus relief in respect of the number of men employed on their farms.  I consider that the greater part of the relief in that case would go to relieve men who deserve it, instead of, as in the case that is now proposed, to relieve people who do not deserve relief from the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this motion because I have spoken so many times on motions so similar as to be almost identical.  But the arguments used by Deputy Corry are so remarkable that I am tempted to intervene for a few moments.  First, I think that one of the arguments is somewhat irrelevant.  I am referring to the argument as to whether other kinds of relief that have been or could be given are preferable to this relief or not.  Nobody is proposing to take-away any relief that has been given. The position of the farmers is such, in my opinion, that the farmers need derating, and need it badly, over and above anything else that has been done for them.  The principal argument of Deputy Corry, however, was that he gave up derating because he discovered that freeholders would benefit by it.  Was the state of political thought in the Fianna Fáil Party really at so low an ebb that, prior to their coming into office, they had failed to realise the existence of freeholders in this country, or had failed to realise that derating would benefit freeholders?  Is it a crime to be a freeholder, or is a freeholder to be debarred from his ordinary rights because he is a freeholder ?  Freeholders are not necessarily earls, and even if they were earls, I do not see why they should be debarred from common justice.  Deputy Corry speaks of people escaping all obligations to the community.  Does he not realise that freeholders and even earls pay income tax and that they sometimes pay super tax on top of <Col N="311" /> that?  Now, there is absolutely nothing but Bolshevism in the sort of talk that would deny a man common justice because he is a freeholder.  Deputy Corry speaks of a man getting away with a freehold&mdash;as if there was no such thing as a man achieving a freehold for himself by working hard and saving up his money for years in order to get a freehold. And such men are not earls. Even in his own constituency, Deputy Corry must be aware of such cases, and is there any reason for such men to be branded as traitors to their country because through their efforts they have managed to become freeholders?</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, Sir, my statement was directed principally to the point that by relieving annuitants you were relieving persons who had a double burden&mdash;who had both annuities and rates.  If you relieve ratepayers only, you relieve some individuals of the only burden they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about this.  The annuities are part of the purchase price for the land&mdash;that is the purchase price paid in one form or another by the freeholders.  If Deputy Corry asks why instead of relieving rates, the scheme of halving the annuities was adopted I shall tell him.  The reason why the annuity scheme was adopted was simply because the Government knew they could not collect the annuities.  They had not an earthly hope of collecting them unless they remitted half.  The whole of their policy was threatened with breakdown unless they took that step.  Anyone who went to the meetings of the Fianna Fáil Party, after they came into office, could hear the cheers that would greet the greater part of President de Valera's speeches, but when he came to the part where he told his hearers that the farmers would have to pay their annuities, but that the annuities would be kept at home, that announcement was received in chilly silence.  That being so, no one was surprised when the Fianna Fáil Party decided to collect only half of the annuities.</P>

      <P>When people are discussing what the present Government has done, and ought to do, it is simply pathetic to hear Deputy Corry speak of the wonders that they did and especially what they have done in securing the home market.  The Deputy cannot deny that the markets that they threw away were far more valuable than the home market since prices have shown a calamitous collapse.</P>
      <P>Derating was promised to the farmers by the Party in power.  If it had never been promised by the Party in power it should be accomplished now, because the fact is that agriculture cannot survive without it.  No matter what effort is made to make the minor industries pay, no matter to what extent the taxpayers and consumers are mulcted, no matter what amount of mollycoddling these industries receive, the least the Party opposite can do is to give agriculture&mdash;the queen of our industries&mdash;some chance of surviving.</P>

      <P>I was present last night when Deputy Belton spoke on this motion, and he made some references which I think need some explanation.  One of the questions he asked was why the bounties for this year were increased over other years. He indicated, in fact, that there was a further charge against the Government for having refused to make provision for the necessary requirements of the farmers in years gone by.  I do not believe Deputy Belton was ignorant of this fact: that the British Government found it necessary last year to give a bounty of 5/- to their beef producers in England.  The fact that they did not give that bounty the previous year can hardly be put forward as a charge that they owed them that amount still.  The reason they gave that bounty was because the price of cattle had fallen the previous year to an extent that warranted them making some offer to the farmers to enable them to continue <Col N="313" /> in production.  Deputy Belton referred to another matter.  He said that the amount of money the farmers had lost, through the economic struggle between this country and England, was not at all illustrative of the actual amount they had lost because 50 per cent. of the products of this country had dropped in price and these prices were reflected in the prices at home and that the farmers had to sell their products at home according to export prices.  Again, Deputy Belton must be aware that the price of cattle and sheep at home is not the same as the export price.  The price of these commodities is fixed for the home market at one figure and for the export market at another.  Deputy Belton must be aware that the price of pigs has substantially increased, at home, compared with the export price.  Similarly, with the price of butter, oats, barley, wheat and beet.</P>
      <P>So far as I can gauge, the case made by the Opposition for derating of agricultural land is that this claim should be separated entirely from any Party point of view.  It is put forward as a business proposition, as the pure altruistic mentality of men who promulgated the idea and as showing the minds of Deputies opposite who have advocated it.  It was not political at all they tell us.  If it was put forward on those lines I wonder why they did not try to state the truth.  I wonder why Deputies who made the point I have mentioned went out of their way to misrepresent the situation as it is. If we are to have good business we must have truth and that certainly was absent from the arguments of Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>I certainly assert I am an authority on truth; but the whole point sought to be made by Deputies opposite is a political point.  Let those who say they want a business mentality <Col N="314" /> show there is business and truth in their statements.  Their whole point is to try and bribe the farmers and gather a lot of enthusiasm to their broken cause. What are the points they tried to make?  We know the farmers here are losing like the farmers in the rest of the world.  Are not farming conditions everywhere worse to-day than they were for years past?  Why does the Opposition expect this Government to be able to place farmers here in a better position than the farmers in any other country?  What are the real facts?  Take the position of the farmers here and compare it with the position of the farmers in the Six Counties and see how they stand.  Mr. Rowley Elliot, member of Parliament, and member of the Marketing Board in the Six Counties speaking the week before last in Derry said: &ldquo;The industry is in a state that nothing short of a revolution in agricultural methods will restore it.&rdquo;  What has the Minister for Agriculture in England, who is an expert and a farmer himself, to say as to the present-day conditions? Dealing with the cattle trade he said: &ldquo;Beef prices were unremunerative a year ago and they are even worse to-day.&rdquo;  And he says further that independent of the subsidy to beef the highest prices are 33/3 per cwt. That is paid in England and Wales and fully 5/- less for best beef in the Six Counties.  That leaves the farmer in the Six Counties getting 28/3 for best beef.  The price here is 22/- for export and 25/- for local markets. Take the conditions of the farmer in the Six Counties in respect of milk. The price in the creameries last year and the preceding year was as low as 1½d. a gallon.  The price here was approximately 4d.  Take the price of grain in the Six Counties.  The best price paid for oats in Enniskillen market last week was 6d. to 7½d.  The best price the farmer can get for his potatoes to-day is 3d. to 4d. a stone and compare that with the price the farmer is getting here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputies on the opposite side who say they want to discuss this matter on plain honest business lines do so.  Do they assert that it is within <Col N="315" /> the power of this Government to put the farmers here on a better footing than that on which they are in the Six Counties or in Britain or any other country where farming is carried on?  All this is moonshine.  It is not plain honest business dealing; it is dishonesty, hypocrisy and it is playing for cheap popularity.  If you are honest about this proposition, why come forward solely on this question of the relief of rates on agricultural land?  Are there no other people living in this country for whom you might appeal?  What about the unemployed? Have appeals come from the opposite benches for relief for the unemployed?  If they did, they were belated and again they were hypocritical and they were dishonest because when the Opposition was sitting on these benches, what did they do for them?  What was their attitude to the various schemes we introduced to help the unemployed?  Why do you concentrate on this question of relief of agricultural rates alone? Do you think the farmer has no need of other things?  What about employment for his children?  Have you considered that or have you advocated that?  It is an important item with him.  Have you considered the needs of the shopkeeper?  Have you advocated that he should be assisted in meeting his debts?  Have you thought of the worker and whether his wages might be increased?  Why concentrate on this question of the relief of rates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">

      <P>The only explanation for concentrating on this is because it makes an appeal to the farming community, which Deputies opposite desire as a political issue and not, as they assert, as an honest business deal. Deputy MacDermot, in speaking a few moments ago, did, I think, a very unfair thing to his friends and the friends of his Party.  He made an apology for the freeholder who acquired his freehold as an inheritance. In reply to Deputy Corry, he mentioned that certain freehold lands in <Col N="316" /> this country were bought by men who earned their money, thereby indicating that there was a distinctive difference in relation to freeholders. Are we to assume from his argument that there are people who are freeholders in this country who are dishonestly occupying these holdings?  I should like to hear his explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>He further said that the land annuities were halved because we were unable to collect them and I think that is the entire explanation of this motion for the relief of agricultural land from the opposite benches. They went forth in this country with all the fury and enthusiasm they could gather around them to stop the payment of land annuities and of rates, and, as Deputy Corry says, failure beset their efforts and because they failed in the country in the use of coercive measures and of force and of threats, they now come back a defeated people to talk this question over as an honest business proposition. I should like a better indication of honesty than I have so far seen on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The calamitous drop in all agricultural prices since this Government took over office is a further argument used and stressed by Deputy MacDermot. Again, it is dishonesty.  The calamitous drop in prices is not, as Deputy MacDermot suggests, the result of this Party taking over the control of government, but the result of world conditions, of which Deputy MacDermot is well aware.  I think it is time the Opposition either cleared their own minds voluntarily or had it done for them.  I can assure Deputies on the opposite side that camouflage like this will deceive nobody and they need never think that they will get anywhere by it or get the support of the public by methods of that kind.  I would suggest that if moneys are to be spent for the relief of agriculture they should be spent in some practical way, whereby honest, hardworking farmers will derive benefit, and I suggest <Col N="317" /> to the Executive Council that there is pressing need amongst the farming community and money, if it can be made available, should be made available to them for the drainage of their lands and thereby confer a lasting benefit on the farmer who wants to work his land and improve it to the benefit of himself and of the nation. The Party that advocates, even for the purpose of gaining cheap popularity, giving this money for nothing to farmers who have the privilege of owning their land&mdash;some of them the freeholders for whom Deputy MacDermot makes an apology to-night&mdash; and giving them the benefit, at the expense of the community, of removing the responsibility which property here, so long as we have a Christian State, must bear to the State, will get a very short distance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to get a lecture on honesty from Deputy Maguire and from the Government Benches.  After all, we are not demanding anything unreasonable from the Government, in view of their declarations over and over again to give full derating to the farmers of this country.  The argument has again been put forward by Deputy Corry to-night that it is better to halve the annuities than to give full derating.  It is really shameful for a Back Bencher like Deputy Corry to come into this House and try to discredit the President of this State, the Leader of his own Party, who definitely stated here, before the House adjourned for Christmas, that the farmers of this country had already paid the land annuities to England.  I challenge contradiction on this statement which I quoted here last week and which is on record for any Deputy who wants to be honest enough to read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no pleasure to us, I assure Deputy Maguire and other Deputies on those benches, who have to make our living by agriculture, to have to come here and find fault with the policy of the Government.  As I have said on more than one occasion in this House, it makes no difference to the people of this country what Party is in power <Col N="318" /> if the country is prosperous.  That is the important thing, but I put it to anybody in this House: can he stand up and say that the farmers of this country are more prosperous to-day than they were three years ago?  Let me take Deputy Maguire on the question of relieving the unemployed.  Let us compare the figures to-day with the figures when this Government came into office in 1932.  Nobody in this country will forget the promise they made about finding work for 86,000 additional people in the Free State. But what are the facts?  The most recent figure given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce showed that there were 139,900 unemployed in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Maguire to tell the House what are the wages of the working classes, the farm labourers in this country.  Those lucky enough to have employment are paid half of what they were paid in 1931.  I challenge any Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches to say if their own supporters down the country have not reduced the wages of their agricultural labourers by a very big amount.  Why are they compelled to reduce their labourers' wages?  Is it not because they have not the money wherewith to pay them?  Deputy Maguire talked about employment for the children of the farmers.  What employment are they getting through the Fianna Fáil policy?  The only change in their position is that the Government is demoralising the farm labourers and the small farmers.  They give them 6/- worth of beef, free milk and the unemployment dole, thus inducing them to become idlers and to become for ever a burden on the State.  Deputies have talked about Sinn Féin, patriotism and so on.  Was that the policy of Sinn Fein?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will say that this is not the policy that was advocated by Sinn Féin.  To-day in this country we have the position that farm labourers have actually refused to work on the land.  They have been driven by the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to refuse to accept employment on the land.  Deputy Maguire has talked about relief schemes.  What is the actual position in that regard?  It is that these men who had employment all the year round-these small farmers &mdash;are actually driven to compete with the honest real unemployed for this relief work.  Before the Government came into office, this work was left to the real unemployed of the country. Deputy Corry says he was definitely in favour of derating, but after Fianna Fáil got into power he discovered his mistake, because, as he tells us, somebody down the country is in occupation of 800 acres of land.  Because of that no consideration is to be given to the farmers of the country.  They are not to get the benefits of derating. Deputy Corry is in favour of giving some derating in proportion to the number of workers employed by the farmer.  He has voted already for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned here to-day by a Fianna Fáil Deputy that in one large farm in Galway employment was given to 22 men.  These men have now been put out of employment.  Well, after all, if an occupier of land gives employment to 22 men, surely that man is of some benefit to the people of the country.  Deputies on the Government Benches have talked about the small farmers.  I have made it my business to go amongst the small farmers.  I live amongst them and they are people who could not be described as idlers.  I am prepared to take the Minister for Local Government and Public Health down to my own constituency and to my own parish.  There I will ask him to discuss with the unfortunate people who are being driven to desperation because of the Government policy, the question of the economic position of the people. The small farmers of this country have been deprived of their living.  I am now speaking of people whose annuities are not much more than £2 yearly.  I <Col N="320" /> asked a number of these people some time ago what they got for a dropped calf in 1931, and they said anything up to 50/- or £3.  What would they get to-day?  Practically nothing.  There are people in the city who talk about the farmers as if they had nothing to do but to look around them and to watch things springing up from the ground.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a farmer in my own parish lately and he told me he brought a calf to the market and got one shilling for it and at the same time he sold an old hen for 5d. a pound.  It is no joke.  I make no statement over which I cannot stand. I ask for the setting up of a tribunal to inquire into this question.  I am prepared, before that tribunal, to give information that will enlighten the people of this country.  Another farmer in my constituency told me he took three calves into Macroom and the man to whom he brought them told him he could not take them. However, the farmer said: &ldquo;I will leave them with you and do the best you can.&rdquo;  The next day the farmer went to Macroom and the man told him he could give him nothing.  &ldquo;I had to pay Dr. Ryan a licence fee of 1/- each for slaughtering the animals and I had nothing for myself.&rdquo;  Up to the time when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office these dropped calves would sell at 50/- to 70/- each.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire spoke about the farmers of this country being better off than any farmers in the world. He told us that the live-stock market in the Free State was better than in Northern Ireland.  Well, the people who are smuggling cattle across the Border must be a lot of damn fools so. I am sorry for using unparliamentary language, but the kind of talk we hear from the Government Benches in this House and from their followers in the country is enough to disgust any honest man.  The Deputy talked about encouraging the grain-growing industry.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health said here recently that the Government were making an allowance in the rates according to the amount of permanent employment the farmer was giving and, he added, that he found latterly <Col N="321" /> that the tendency was not to give permanent employment.  The Minister probably does not realise the position he and his Party are creating.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that grain growing does not give as much employment as mixed farming.  Dr. Hennessy, when a member of this House, gave us some figures to show that more employment is being given by mixed farming than by grain growing.  When the farmer sows his grain on the 1st April he locks the gate of his field and that gate remains locked for six months; when the grain is ripe, if it has not lodged, the farmer reaps that with his reaper and binder and gets through the work without any additional labour.</P>
    <P>Deputies have talked here about the prices ruling for our bacon in this country.  We had from Deputy Curran the prices in 1931.  Did not the Minister for Agriculture admit that at all times the price received for the farm produce sold at home is ruled by the price of the exported articles.  We have the fact now admitted that the export prices rule the prices paid at home.  Dr. Ryan had, last Christmas, to admit that for the first time.  There are times when Dr. Ryan shows a little bit of honesty.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the Opposition benches have talked about a no-rate campaign. We never advocated a no-rate campaign.  Before the present Government came into office, Deputy Corry at the meetings of the Cork County Council was continually complaining that the farmers were unable to pay their then rates.  Will the Deputy deny that now?  Will the Deputy deny that he said the first duty of the farmers was to feed their families, and that if anything were left over then they could pay their rates and annuities. Taking all the facts into consideration it should not be necessary for us to press on the Government the acceptance of this motion.  Their own policy before they came into office was definitely a policy of derating.  I will ask them to be just to the people of this country.  They have always boasted that they are determined to fulfil their promises.  I ask them to show their sincerity by accepting this motion, and <Col N="322" /> thereby offer some measure of relief to the people who unfortunately, because of this Government's policy, are unable to pay their rates.</P>

      <P>In the course of his remarks Deputy Maguire asked if there was no other class in the community besides the farmer that needed relief. He pertinently asked: &ldquo;What about the condition of the shopkeeper, and what about the conditions in the towns?&rdquo;  I submit that the existing conditions in our small market towns form one of the strongest arguments in favour of the motion now under consideration. There is no class in the community that has felt the destructive consequences of the economic war more than the town dwellers, whether they are merchants, employers, professional men, or the ordinary rank and file of town dwellers.  The weekly markets in the country towns have been ruined; in some places they have actually ceased to exist.  Fairs have become a thing of the past.  Our country towns used to live on the weekly market and on the monthly fair, and when these went by the board there was no form of industry in any of the towns to help to carry along the wage earning population. These towns acted as distributors for the agricultural community, as the distributing centres for their produce. What are the conditions to-day?  The trade in the towns has ceased to exist and credit in the case of the farmers has to be restricted.</P>

      <P>I merely put it forward, arising out of some remarks made by Deputy Maguire, as one of the strongest <Col N="323" /> reasons why the motion should be adopted.  The Deputy, in the course of his remarks, mentioned some of the things that the Fianna Fáil Government have done for the farmer in the way of subsidies, increased prices for cereals and other commodities he produces, and he pointed out the advantages of the home market.  I find it very difficult to believe that what is consumed in the home market is of any material advantage to the farmer.  For instance, the Deputy mentioned the increased price for oats.  What does it profit a farmer to get a 1/- extra per cwt. for oats if he has to pay 2/6 extra for the sack of meal he buys, that sack containing 15 per cent. of the oats he has previously sold?  He mentioned markets in the North of Ireland and across the Channel.  He said that world markets were depressed and that prices generally were low.  We all know that all over the world people are passing through a bad time, yet this is the very time that has been selected by Fianna Fáil to fire the first shot in a disastrous economic war.  The farmer in Northern Ireland can get foodstuffs for the production of his livestock at least at one-third lower than the farmer in the Free State and in the Free State the farmer is paying for a very inferior article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of our friends opposite have endeavoured to draw a distinction between the small farmer and the rancher.  I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;rancher&rdquo;.  There are very few in the county from which I come and certainly there are none in the constituency I represent.  As a matter of fact, in County Cork nearly one-third of the valuations are less than £4.  The majority of these small valuations are in the western portion of the county. I will give an illustration of the conditions in some parts of my constituency. I happened to be in a market town in the western portion of West Cork.  I was told by the merchants that there had not been a fair for a considerable time.  In fact, the monthly fair had not been held for at least three months. The people had brought in cattle, but there were no buyers; there was no demand for the class of cattle from that <Col N="324" /> district.  Three successive fairs fell through owing to the absence of buyers. I visited another parish in the same district and I took statistics with regard to the conditions of the people. I got the statistics from the parish priest and the local Civic Guard sergeant, who had to do with enquiries arising out of unemployment assistance. I find that in that parish there were 400 houses, all occupied by people of the farming class; there was not what I would call a labouring community there.  In that parish nearly 500 people were in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>One case struck me very forcibly.  A man had nearly 42 acres of land of a kind, and a few cows.  The valuation of his holding was about £16.  He was a particularly good man.  Compare his valuation with the valuations of the bulk of the people in County Cork, which are for the most part under £4 This man was getting 1/6 a week unemployment assistance.  If that amount of unemployment assistance reflects the economic condition of that man and his family, how can he afford to pay any rates on his holding?  His annuity was something less than £2, but his rates would be something like £6.  We hear a lot of talk about halving the land annuities when really they have been paid two or three times over by the farmers.  You are levying what you describe as half the annuity, and it is a very small thing in some cases, but the rates are a much more serious problem for the unfortunate people who have to live under such conditions as I have observed.  If you go through the country you will find that it is a most pressing problem.</P>
    <P>I have been ruled out of order because I was proceeding to refer to the impoverished condition of the towns, the want of employment and the depressed state of trade.  The lack of credit, the great falling off in turnover and the increase in unemployment in our towns and cities form one of the strongest arguments in favour of the derating of agricultural land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Rising at this time of the night after an exchange of views on both sides of the House with regard <Col N="325" /> to derating, one cannot hope to add very much to the arguments submitted with reference to the inability of the farmer to pay.  But there is another side to this question, and I feel that something in the nature of a personal explanation is needed as to my temporarily changed attitude, if you like, on this matter.  I had the honour to be associated with the Derating Commission, which recommended against total derating, a view I have strongly held in normal times, and that I still hold, and I would only support this derating proposal as an expedient in certain very difficult circumstances because I view derating as bringing in its wake the doing away with all local authorities, as one could not conceive local authorities spending money supplied by a central authority.  That would eventually tend to have centralisation of all power here, a position that I do not want to see in this country.</P>
      <P>What circumstances compel me to support this motion, holding views of that kind, still convinced as I am that the sharing and dividing of responsibility, both local and central, is the best way of getting over the difficulties of this country?  They are twofold. One was the statement made by the Minister for Lands on last Sunday fortnight when he said that anyone who did not contribute to maintain local services was helping to bring about a set of conditions in this country not to be thought of.  I hold the same view. I hold the view that if local services, such as home assistance, mental and other hospitals, are not maintained, civilisation, as we know it, will not continue to exist in this country.  Whatever else goes, the local services which our generation demands must be maintained. The other is that in my view the deductions from the agricultural grant, the piling of unpaid moneys on the backs of the few people who are endeavouring to pay, will bring about the collapse of local services and all the suffering that that will entail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to answer one observation made from the other Benches, that there is a campaign for the non-payment of rates.  I am not aware of it.  I have never heard an expression <Col N="326" /> from anybody of responsibility or from any ratepayers that rates should not be paid.  I have heard many claims of inability to pay.  I have met no evidence anywhere of any disinclination to pay rates, but I am aware of inability to pay rates.  If I localise the matter for a moment it might better convey what is in my mind.  We had a deduction made from the Cork County Council in the beginning of last year of £56,000 of the agricultural grant of £559,000 given in 1927.  My opinion is that if the withholding of these grants is to be continued, nothing can save the local services but the taking over of them by the central authority.</P>
    <P>The first £559,000 given has been alluded to as a grant from the Government. That is a misnomer.  It was not a grant.  It was liability formerly shared between the landlord and the tenant and taken over by the British Government under the Act of 1898.  To prove that it was a statutory obligation on that Government, and on the Government which inherited its obligations, I may point to the fact that all properties which have been transferred since then bear on the face of the transfer that a liability for 50 per cent. of the poor rate was accepted by the Government.  Is the Minister for Local Government, at the instigation of the Minister for Finance, now to find himself the victim of circumstances and compelled to go on a marauding expedition to take away that grant?  I am not going to debate whether it is legal or not, but I am quite satisfied that it is an immoral act to tear up an agreement entered into.  What is called a grant in that case is not a grant.  The double agricultural grant given in 1927, from which the Minister for Finance deducted from the Minister for Local Government last year £448,000, was a grant.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister for Local Government, holding the views he does as to the extension of public services and having the public services brought up to the highest pitch of perfection&mdash; views with which I thoroughly agree&mdash; could have consented to that.  As far as the capacity of the country is equal to it I am prepared to support the <Col N="327" /> Minister for Local Government in his policy for the improvement of public services.  I would, however, point out to the Minister for Local Government that that cannot be done while he allows the Minister for Finance to deduct a sum of £448,000 from that grant, as he did at the commencement of last year; to deduct from the Cork County Council, at the end of the year, £46,000, in addition to £56,000 already deducted and to deprive them of £10,000 in probate and death duties; sums amounting in all to £112,000 in one year deducted from that local authority.  I know I shall be met with the statement that some recompense was made by the grant of £300,000 to local authorities as promised by the President.  I admit that we got £24,000 of that; but that was for three years' funded arrears under the Land Act and represented only a payment of 5/- in the £ of the £96,000 deducted from us.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the entire liability for the failure foreshadowed by the Minister for Lands does not rest with the ratepayers of the county.  The morality of the deduction is made for the purposes of the Guarantee Fund.  For what?  The Guarantee Fund is to discharge a purely statutory obligation to pay interest on and provide a sinking fund for the money invested in land stock. That obligation was accepted publicly by the British Government and, therefore, the function of the Guarantee Fund here ceases.  It has been publicly declared that the Guarantee Fund was a statutory obligation accepted by another authority.  There is, therefore, no justification for the existence of a Guarante Fund in this country.</P>
    <P>Then we come to another matter&mdash; the local loans.  I do not know what the levy is for the entire State, but the Cork County Council has to pay an annual contribution of £67,000 to the Local Loans Fund.  It is hardly necessary to point out how these local loans were contracted.  We, as a local authority, borrowed money from the British Board of Works.  That was a purely contractual bargain and we were prepared to repay the sum.  There <Col N="328" /> was no inherited claim by anybody else.  Nobody else had a right to collect that money.  It was a purely business bargain.  We have to pay that £67,000 every year, while the liability is mounting up against us or the State at penal interest.  The Minister for Finance, however, insists that the Minister for Local Government should compel us to pay that.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all these facts, I submit that the Minister for Finance, in depriving the local authorities of the necessary finances, is contributing more than anybody else to the state of affairs referred to by the Minister for Lands&mdash;a set of conditions undreamt of in this country.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy T. J. O'Donovan informed me within the last hour that he intended to raise on the adjournment matters arising out of Questions Nos. 4 and 5 on yesterday's Order Paper.  The Chair is waiving technicalities on this occasion and is allowing the Deputy to raise these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret, Sir, that I was unable to inform you at an earlier stage that it was my intention to raise these matters to-night, but I thought it was understood yesterday that I was to be at liberty to do so.  I put down these questions on yesterday's Order Paper, asking the Minister for Justice why Mr. J.J. Coakley, of Manch, Ballineen, and Mr. Geoffrey Wycherley, of Roscarbery, were arrested and detained in the Civic Guard station and were subsequently released without any charge being brought against them.  I hoped to get some expression of regret from the Minister for the action of the Guards in arresting these decent, respectable men.  I hoped also that the Minister, before making a move such as has been made in County Cork, would have tried to ascertain the characters of the people whom he intended to arrest&mdash;these hard-working, industrious, respectable, law-abiding citizens, who have always tried to <Col N="329" /> uphold law and order in this State and who, I am sure, will always endeavour to do the same while they are alive. They have never done anything that would bring the blush of shame to their faces.  They have never stood behind fences to throw a sod or stone at their neighbours.  I think the least the Minister might do would be to inquire into the characters of these people and their standing in the country before placing them under arrest.  Evidently, he did not worry about that.</P>
      <P>The trouble apparently arose out of the fact that as a result of the policy carried out by his Government, these farmers in County Cork had summoned a meeting of the Cork Farmers Association, a convention, to be held in Cork on January 21st, to discuss their grievances and to try, if possible, to devise ways and means by which they might be able to get over their difficulties. That was a perfectly lawful action for them to take.  On the night of the 29th or the morning of the 30th January, we had wholesale arrests throughout County Cork, particularly in West Cork.  We had the houses of those decent men raided, searched and ransacked from top to bottom, and afterwards these men were arrested and detained in the barracks.  Why was that done?  I had hoped that the Minister, in replying to my question, would say why it was done, but he did not do so.  Why was it done?  Was it because he was afraid that the Cork Farmers' Association was going to shake the confidence of the people of County Cork and the rest of the State in his Government?  I take it that that must be the reason they carried out this act of terrorism&mdash;to try to terrorise the people of County Cork and to prevent their attending that meeting which they had a right to attend, to discuss and debate their grievances and to try to remedy them, if possible.  Well, that terrorism did not prevent the farmers from meeting in convention.  They met and discussed their situation.  Soon after we had the Guards again coming around making further arrests and further detentions, while still no charges were preferred against these men.  Why is that done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> These men met and declared, and they were not afraid to say it, that this Government was the cause of all their grievances at the moment, that the Government had deprived them of their markets, of their means of livelihood, of giving their children an opportunity of being educated, properly clad and properly fed.  Because they dared to say that to the Government, because they dared to say that they had a perfect right to meet in public meeting and to assert that right, and dared to tell the Government what they had done through their economic policy, their houses were broken into and they were lodged in jail, and some in military prisons as well.  If we are going to have a repetition of these actions, if men are to be taken from their homes and families&mdash;even if their business is not worth minding at the moment, at the same time they have an interest in it and they would like to be there&mdash; I say it is most unjust, unfair and uncalled for.  It is most unfair for the Minister for Justice to send out orders of this sort and have these decent people arrested.  As I said before, they are law-abiding men, men who have always upheld the honour and the dignity of this State, who have always tried to observe the law.  When we contrast the action of the Minister in arresting these law-abiding men and allowing others who have gone around our constituencies threatening people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the reason <Col N="331" /> I raised this question in the hope that, perhaps, commonsense may prevail in Government circles in the long run and that these arrests may be discontinued, so that honest, hard-working people may be allowed to do their ordinary business along with their families instead of being taken away and lodged in jail.  I do not want to make any reference to those whose cases are at present under consideration by the Military Tribunal but I think it was most unfair of the <i>Irish Press</i> on last Monday, while these cases were still <i>sub judice</i>, to publish a statement to the effect that an <i>Irish Press</i> representative was informed that the principal charge to be preferred against these men was that they were members of an unlawful association for the promotion of non-payment of rates.  There is no such thing as an association for the non-payment of rates.  We have heard that matter discussed before.  The Party to which I belong have denied it, and I deny it.  There is no such thing as a campaign for the non-payment of rates and it was most unfair of the <i>Irish Press</i> to come out with such a statement while these men are awaiting their trial.</P>

I only want to bring this matter forward in the hope that public opinion will be brought to bear on the Government and on the responsible Minister so that commonsense may prevail in the future and that we shall have no further arrests of this kind in West Cork.  It is the blackguard and gun bully that we want arrested and put in their proper places so that decent law-abiding men will be allowed to carry on their work in peace.</P>

      <P>There has been a great straining of the law with regard to these two men.  They were taken out, at what I would call unreasonable hours, from their homes and taken long distances under very difficult circumstances for men of mature years, as it was very dangerous to their health. There was no necessity for that whatever. These men live quietly, and can always be found in their homes when wanted for interrogation on any point. They are always prepared to account for their movements.  In spite of that Mr. Coakley was taken from Manch, Ballineen, over the mountains to Clonakilty, and interrogated there in a rough manner.  The whole tendency of police activities in that quarter at present is purely political, and is causing grave dissatisfaction and grave ill-feeling and unrest amongst law abiding citizens of that portion of the community, where the people are all law abiding and follow peaceful avocations and are known to be most respectable.  I think it is a shame that the police force, particularly the new plain clothes force, should be used to go to such men at unreasonable hours and to interrogate them in an unreasonable way.  I will not contrast that with the way other crimes went on in this district for which no one was brought to justice, nor even <Col N="333" /> arrested on suspicion.  One man who was murderously assaulted in the middle of the night identified his assailants.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult to deal with the cases of men awaiting trial.  These men are awaiting trial before the Military Tribunal on the charge of being members of an unlawful association, and I suppose it is not fair to say more than that about the cases at present.  The two men, Wycherley and Coakley, were suspected also of being members of that same association.  As a matter of fact, in one case circulars were found which emanated from this association. If Deputy O'Donovan complains of their houses being ransacked and searched, from top to bottom, the police were justified in carrying out searches, because they found circulars that they suspected would be found in this house if a search was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other, too, was suspected of being a member of the standing committee of that association.  The two men, on being interrogated, denied any connection whatever with that movement. They disclaimed any connection with it, and the police decided, for the moment at any rate, not to proceed with the case.  Undoubtedly, the police would have been quite justified in sending these men before the Military Tribunal to let it decide whether they were guilty of an offence or not. Instead of that the police exercised a certain amount of leniency.  Whether that action was taken by the police, from considerations of the good character which Deputy O'Donovan has mentioned these men have borne, whether it was due to mistaken feelings of pity for them or their families; or due, perhaps, to the hope that being first offenders, if dealt with leniently they might not come under the notice of the police again, at any rate they are dealt with leniently and the police action which has <Col N="335" /> now been referred to, shows that such leniency was not appreciated by Deputy O'Donovan or those associated with him here.  Such ingratitude, of course, is always shown where kindness is done, when it is not justified. I do not think I have anything else to say with regard to these cases. These were cases in which the police were absolutely justified in carrying out the searches.  I do not know if Deputy O'Neill is right in saying that the searches were carried out in a rough manner.  If they were, it was wrong.</P>

      <P>Then it is all right.  Any such conduct as that would not be right.  If the charge that the Deputy makes is that the police in that area are administering justice in a political <Col N="336" /> way, that is altogether wrong and should not be allowed by the police authorities.  Deputy O'Donovan stated that these men were arrested because they attended a meeting of farmers in Cork.  It was not for that reason. They are really being charged with being members of an association which I think was dissolved at that meeting and then renamed.</P>
