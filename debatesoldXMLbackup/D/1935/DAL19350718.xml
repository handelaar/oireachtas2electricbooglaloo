    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the collection of the levy on &ldquo;country&rdquo; butter is very ineffective, so ineffective as to prove almost impracticable, and if he is aware that the result is that merchants who specialise in the Irish home trade for butter are finding it increasingly difficult to get supplies for this trade, and if he will take steps to prevent this dislocation of the home trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a provision has been included in the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act recently passed for the registration as from a date to be appointed of producer-retailers and distributors of non-creamery butter and rendering it illegal for unregistered persons to engage in the business of selling or acquiring such butter either for resale or for use in a butter factory.  This provision, when in operation, will make the liability for levy more general and should remove any existing cause for dissatisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> Arrangements for bringing the proposed system of registration into operation are now nearing completion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state if managers of national schools are complying with the responsibility thrown on them under the Workmen's Compensation Act in respect of the insurance of national teachers whose salary is under £350 and who are insurable under the Act.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of the opinion that the conduct of the Ceann Comhairle in the Chair and especially his actions on Friday, July 5th, have gravely infringed minority rights and tend to bring Parliament into disrepute.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy moves this motion, No. 7 on the Order Paper, would you allow me to ask if the motion is in order?  Standing Order No. 47, I think it is, gives the Ceann Comhairle the sole right to decide questions of control and order in the House, and I would like to ask if this motion, for a kind of roving inquiry into the conduct of the Ceann Comhairle in the matter of order, is in order.</P>

      <P>As the motion is directed against myself I would be extremely reluctant to impose any restriction which might hamper the presentation of the case for it.  I might say, however, impersonally, that it does seem to me that a motion of censure on the Chair should deal only with the immediate incidents which are considered to warrant such a motion. I am allowing the motion.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that when there was a precedent here I handed in that motion to the then Ceann Comhairle, and he insisted that we should deal with the specific incident. That was done on that occasion. Therefore, I am surprised that you are allowing it in.  The motion would not be taken from me unless it was dealing with a specific incident.</P>

      <P>We have been <Col N="822" /> frequently told from the Chair that there is one way of challenging the conduct of the Ceann Comhairle.  Of course, it would seem absurd that every time we feel we have a legitimate grievance against the Ceann Comhairle we should put down a motion of censure.  However, you have ruled on that, and, therefore, I do not intend to devote any more time to it. It is not with any great alacrity that we propose this motion.  We do it because we are extremely conscious of the inroads that have been recently made into the rights of Parliament and of the interference with Parliamentary institutions.  So far as this particular motion is concerned, we feel that, especially in the last few weeks, the Chair has helped that particular development.  It is really because we are conscious of the importance of these Parliamentary institutions, and because we are anxious to see that none of the rights that still remain to Parliament should be unduly curtailed, interfered with, or filched away, that we put down this motion.  If the House and the public will bear in mind the tendency that has made its appearance in the last few weeks, practically speaking, to make the Government Party, the majority Party, as it is called, despotic here, and the way in which the Chair has not tried to curb, as I think it was bound to do, that particular development, I think the ordinary public will be convinced that there is sufficient ground for the anxiety we feel in this particular matter.  At a time when the majority in this House is busy proclaiming that, because it has a majority, it can do what it likes, when it likes and how it likes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; is the answer I get from the opposite side.  Therefore, I take it for granted that the charge is acknowledged, and not merely acknowledged but accepted as their programme by the opposite side.  I take the &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to mean that.  Even if I did not get that &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; anybody who has been in this House for the last couple of <Col N="823" /> months knows perfectly well that that is the doctrine and the attitude of the majority Party in the House at present.  Although I am grateful to the gentleman who said &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; apart from that approval that he gives to the charge, the facts themselves bear out the charge.  At a time when that particular development was obviously taking place in this House, I hold that it was particularly incumbent on the Chair to be particularly watchful, more watchful than usual, to see that no serious inroads were made into the rights of Parliament.</P>
      <P>Our attitude towards the Chair has been consistent all along.  There were many times when this Party could not agree with the ruling of the Chair. That is inevitable; I find no fault with that.  But I think the Chair has no reason to complain of our acceptance of his ruling.  We have never taken up the attitude which, I understand, is the official attitude of the majority Party, proclaimed by themselves, proclaimed on an occasion like the present and similar occasions in the past, that the Chair is a Party institution, that the Ceann Comhairle is a Party man.  We have never taken up that line, and we cannot accept that line.  We are quite willing to admit that when a Deputy enters this House, owing to modern electoral conditions, he enters it as a member of a Party.  But we expect a Deputy who is elected to the Chair to act as a non-Party man, and we have always tried to regard the Chair in that particular manner.  Therein I confess we differ from the present majority Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making this protest because we feel, as I say, that undue inroads are being made into the rights, not merely of minorities, but of Parliament altogether.  We are not expecting the Party that takes up the line, and that in the person of many of its prominent members took up the line, that the Chair ought to be a Party function, that the Chairman ought to be a Party member, to agree with our particular point of view, or vote for this motion.  We feel bound, however, whatever the verdict of the House, <Col N="824" /> whatever the vote of the House may be, to make this protest against any further curtailments of the rights of Parliament.  I have no doubt that the stronger the grounds of this kind that can be put forward here, and that could be put forward in other circumstances against any ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, the more they would recommend that ruling and recommend the conduct of the Chair to the Party opposite.</P>
    <P>As I say, we have given every assistance in the past to the Chair in getting his ruling accepted.  I think it was on a similar occasion that it was pointed out that the first ten years of this Dáil were rather important as moulding the traditions which would guide the future actions of this Parliament. What I fear is that in the last couple of years we have seen a process, not of continuous moulding along those lines, but of re-moulding, and we find that that re-moulding is not healthy. The remoulding has taken more and more the form of trying to reduce Parliament to a mere formal expression of acceptance of the declared will of the Government and of the majority Party.  That reduces Parliament to a nullity and a farce.  It is because we feel that the Chair on more than one occasion, especially in recent times, has by his action &mdash; I am not going into motives &mdash; furthered that development, helped to accelerate that development, that we make this protest.</P>
    <P>There may have been errors of judgment on the part of the Chair.  The Chair will be the first to admit that such things are possible.  We can find no grave reason to complain of ordinary errors of judgment.  The occupant of the Chair, like anybody else, is fallible.  It is inevitable that in any Assembly like this there will be conflict of opinion and that members of the House may not find it possible to agree with the Chair, but they will accept his ruling.  However, as I am on the question of error of judgment perhaps I may just recall a piece of advice that good old Baedeker gives to continental travellers.  &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in connection with travellers who intend to leave their hotels early <Col N="825" /> in the morning, it is advisable in this case to get their bills made up the night before as in the hurried departure of the morning waiters are liable to make mistakes in arithmetic and the mistakes in arithmetic are seldom in favour of the customer.&rdquo; Well, Sir, without at all imputing anything except a desire to get on with the business, I feel often that errors of judgment are seldom in favour of the Opposition in this House.  However, these are not serious matters.  I think any errors of judgment there were of that kind were due to a feeling of pressure which, from their own convictions, we must believe the Government, as the majority Party, have no hesitation in applying to the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>There is also the desire sometimes entertained by the Ceann Comhairle to &ldquo;get on with the work&rdquo; and getting on with the work generally means coming to a vote.  I do not think that you, yourself, are conscious of it but there are times when a certain impatience is shown from the Chair, not with the irrelevancy of the discussion but rather with the discussion going on.  In the ordinary way we have not a way of pointing that out to you.  I am sure we could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can understand the position you are in if you intervene merely as a person whose conduct is challenged and I shall try to satisfy you as much as I can. On the other hand if it is merely as Ceann Comhairle at the particular moment that you intervene, then, Sir, I am either out of order or I am not relevant.

      <P>I want to be quite clear, as the Chair will find out before the close of the debate, without going into elaborate detail.  I can only give, as the Chair must know, an impression of repeated instances amongst a number in this House.  I think that is a recognised method of procedure.  I do not think it is the business of the Chair to hurry discussion or to hurry a decision.  I think that unconsciously the Chair has frequently fallen into that particular error.  The Ceann Comhairle is not responsible for the actions of the Government.  He is not responsible for the business of the Government or for the speed or the slowness with which it is conducted.  Then there is another matter on which more than once members on this side have felt aggrieved. That is the question of relevancy. On more than one occasion members on this side of the House &mdash; I speak now from personal experience &mdash; have felt themselves unduly bound by a rather fantastic, narrow conception of relevancy on the part of the Chair.  I can understand members of the Government Party laughing.  They are rarely relevant.  Their leader is practically never relevant.  He has a full right to discuss any matter on any motion in this House.  He has utilised that right to the full as every member of the House knows.  Even the Vice-President can follow him, but only at a long distance, so far as relevancy is concerned. I have found it extremely difficult to conduct anything like an elaborate complicated argument without interference from the Chair on the grounds of relevancy.  More than I have found that very difficult.  We were strictly keeping to the subject.  The argument may have been difficult and elaborate but there was undoubtedly on various occasions too great haste on the part of the Ceann Comhairle to interfere with us in that respect.  These are comparatively minor matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I know, <Col N="827" /> but it is necessary to mention them. They do not raise any particular question, perhaps, that might seem to us to be fatal to the rights of this House.  But there have been a number of things that are not in the same category.  I do not intend to go through all of these.  I shall give a few merely as an illustration.  I am not going back too far, I might say, and I certainly shall not make use of a very obvious <i>tu quoque</i> against the present occupant of the Chair.  But I must mention the closure on the Vote on the President's Estimate in the all-night sitting in June, 1933, after two and a half hours.  The President had made an exceedingly provocative speech and he had indicated clearly a new departure in oppression so far as this country was concerned.  I think that, Sir, was, to put it very mildly, a grave error of judgment on the part of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to more recent times, it is only a few weeks since that we witnessed, a number of us at all events, a quite interesting and instructive display in this House, on the one hand led by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and on the other by Deputy McGilligan.  The House will remember a very elaborate challenge made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a full discussion here in this House on certain matters.  Certainly so far as the use of adjectives and the full use of that excellent and splendid voice he has, were concerned, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, purely in these respects, made a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; case.  He was not interrupted; he was not interfered with. He challenged the fullest discussion. He was allowed to put his case and to put it fully.  But when Deputy McGilligan began to answer! Just ask anybody here on that particular night as to the circumstances and the conduct of that particular debate. Continued interruptions were allowed both from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and from Deputy Briscoe.  That is not so much what I am now complaining of, but after the challenge of the Minister there came a moment during Deputy McGilligan's <Col N="828" /> attack when we saw the sudden anxiety of the Minister to get away from the discussion.  He rose to ask the Ceann Comhairle: &ldquo;Is all this relevant?&rdquo; On the precise thing that was under discussion, on which he had challenged a full debate, he suddenly intervened and tried to stop the debate.  Then on the grounds that a certain lease was not relevant, the discussion came to an end, practically speaking.  That discussion of the lease was not relevant, we were told, on the ground that the Minister said he had not made the lease.  If there was a covenant for a lease by two members of the Oireachtas &mdash; one a member of this House and the other a member of the Seanad &mdash; that in, itself constituted a lease, but in any case it was a matter of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take cognisance.  Yet we had at that particular instance, if I may say so, the Ceann Comhairle coming to the rescue of the Government by, what seemed to us, a very strange ruling.</P>
    <P>It was, however, on Friday, July 5th, at 11.30 at night, that these matters more or less reached the culmination. Let us see what led up to that.  The Government had so conducted their business that they found at half-past ten on Friday morning that they had the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill still on their hands.  Then they moved to sit late, and I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce that made that particular motion.  Now I shall draw attention to the exact form of the words he used, because they are of some importance in that particular connection.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: It is proposed to take the business on the Order Paper, commencing with item No. 7 &mdash; Conditions of Employment Bill &mdash; to item No. 10 &mdash; Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill &mdash; inclusive. Public business will not be interrupted at 12 noon to take Private Deputies' business.  The Dáil will adjourn until Tuesday, the 9th instant, at 3 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that, strictly speaking, I will admit that was not <Col N="829" /> an Order of the House.  But in that connection I should like to point out that such a statement by a person who moves such a motion is regarded as an Order of the House, and very often it becomes that without further motion being made.  It is only in the separate words they differ from an Order of the House.  We may grant to those who oppose this motion that, in the strictly technical sense, it was not an Order of the House.  But in view of what occurred afterwards, at 11.30, it became a grave act of deception.  I am admitting that there was no intention to deceive, but I say that it became a deception, because of what occurred at 11.30, and I think that was a motive which should have weighed very strongly with the Chair in refusing to accept that motion proposed at 11.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed, in this connection, in the defence that was made for a long sitting, up to midnight on Friday night, that of the two Bills mentioned, there was only one put before us as being urgent&mdash;that was the Finance Bill.  In view of the adjournment of the Dáil, and the consideration of the Finance Bill on the Tuesday following, or the Wednesday, no one could take seriously the suggestion that it was urgent that the Finance Bill should go through all its Committee Stage by that week-end.  It was quite obvious that was not so. The whole conduct of the Government, subsequently, shows that they did not believe in the urgency on the ground of which the motion was accepted at 11.30 that night.  For these two reasons, with that discussion, not unduly prolonged, because there were a number of matters then being examined and properly examined for the first time, there could not be any proper consideration by the House of the matter of urgency.  The Government waited so late as 11.30 to make up their minds to hand in this particular motion.  Therefore there could be no discussion on the question of urgency, and the House was unable properly to give consideration to the question of urgency.  The House accepted, like the Chair, the fiat of a <Col N="830" /> member of the Government that there was urgency.  The condition of the Finance Bill should have been obvious to the Government long before Friday morning, 5th July, and they should have taken the necessary steps.</P>
    <P>Futthermore, when we did come to the Committee Stage, still unfinished on the night of Friday, with practically half an hour still to go, there were various courses open to them, other than the one involving the Chair, which they took.  There was no reason why they should have involved the Chair.  They could have put down the motion which they afterwards did, and with no more interference than they were guilty of, with the rights of the House and with the rights of minorities.  They could have put down that motion for Tuesday, and got the Finance Bill through some time on Wednesday, as they got it through.  But the Government preferred the course of carting the Chair, and my complaint is that the Chairman on that particular occasion allowed himself to be carted.  That is one of the particular grounds on which we object to the acceptance of that motion by the Chair.</P>
    <P>The proceedings were reported as follows in the three Dublin papers and one Cork paper on the following morning:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle said the next motion he had was that the Dáil adjourn until 10.30 on Saturday morning.  That motion, he said, was given to him as a matter of urgency as certain Bills had to go through the House within a week. He thought it would be an impertinence on the part of the Chair to decide that the majority of the House could not come to a decision of that sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again we have approval of that particular line.  We want to make clear what is the point of view of those opposing this motion as to what the rights of the Dáil and the Chair are.  The ruling of the Chair, as it appears in the Official Debates of Friday, July the <Col N="831" /> 5th, is slightly different.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An Ceann Comhairle: As regards the motion that the Dáil do now adjourn till 10.30 a.m. to-morrow, July 6th, that motion was handed to the Chair as a matter of urgency, as certain Bills have to get through this House within a week.  I consider that it would be rather an impertinence for the Chair to decide that the majority in this House in a matter of urgency cannot come to a decision as to whether or not it would sit to-morrow.</P>
      <P>What I want to make clear is that on that particular night it became clear to us that the Chair did not exercise its discretion on the question of urgency. He merely accepted the fiat of a member of the majority Party of this House as to whether a certain thing was urgent; secondly, that, in fact, there was no such urgency and it was proved by the subsequent conduct of the Government itself that there was no such urgency; and that it was quite clear that the business could have got through as quickly as it did, and possibly more quickly, if the Government had not challenged, as they deliberately challenged, all precedents and parliamentary rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that in taking the line they did, the Government were still under the sway, and, apparently, still are under the sway, of their old conception of the function of the Chair.  That is not a conception which I, or this Party, share.  That, in itself, was a very serious precedent to set, that, after a definite statement which had always been regarded as binding and which in many cases had been regarded as an order of the House, had been made by the Minister then in charge of business that the House would adjourn at 12 o'clock, until the following Tuesday the House should be summoned half an hour before 12 o'clock that night to meet the following day, when many Deputies would have gone home.  If you take that particular decision by the Chair with the subsequent decision <Col N="832" /> on the following Tuesday on the question of notice and the non-necessity of notice, you will see the pitch to which we are brought.  The majority Party, apparently, can tell the House, and the House in good faith can act upon it, that the House will adjourn at, say, 12 o'clock to-night.  That same majority Party merely, if we are to take the ruling of the Chair, because it says a thing is urgent, can say: &ldquo;We will meet again at a quarter past 12 to-night or even at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It can do that and it can bring up a matter of which no proper notice has been given.  This is done without any atmosphere of crisis and that is what is so serious.  If the thing can be done, so to speak, cold-bloodedly in an instance like this, what is likely to happen in time of crisis or in a time which can be suggested to be a crisis?  The rights of the House can, practically speaking, be swept away.  If the Government sees that it has a more favourable House than usual, it can suddenly move that we continue to sit until after 12 o'clock; that we adjourn for a quarter of an hour and recommence the sitting; and then bring on any matter, no matter how controversial.  Remember, Sir, that the matters brought on on the Tuesday were exceedingly controversial. There was no need for them to have been brought on on Tuesday. No case for urgency was established by the Government, but the one thing that was established is that the fact that they did not bring on the Finance Bill on the Tuesday is an absolute proof of the complete lack of foundation for their plea of urgency. Further, Sir, that same lack of foundation is exemplified by the fact that, on Friday, these same Ministers spent up to after 2 o'clock discussing a Bill which certainly cannot be considered urgent.  It may be important but it was not an urgent Bill, and the state of Government business this week shows that it could have been dealt with now quite as well as at the time chosen by the Government to carry on that discussion.</P>
    <P>If you take these two rulings together, they constitute, in our eyes, a <Col N="833" /> most serious invasion of the rights of the House.  They undermine, it seems to me, the very foundations of Parliament. The Government could have avoided that.  There was no necessity to have brought the Chair into this matter at all.  There are, unfortunately, from the point of view of parliamentary rights, tremendous powers already at the disposal of the Government to see that its business is transacted and there was no necessity to pull the Chair into this at all, but they deliberately went out of their way to do it.  I can understand that attitude on the part of a man like the President of the Executive Council, whose attitude &mdash; I will say this at all events &mdash; is quite definite on this matter.  He is Governor-General, President of the Executive Council and Chairman of this Dáil.  That is his attitude and that is the attitude he took up in other assemblies.  Let him look up Documents A and B and he will find it strikingly exemplified there.  I am glad to see him back. He has not been attending this House very much, and on the few occasions on which he now deigns to visit this unimportant assembly &mdash; it is, after all, his conception of the value of Parliament &mdash; he makes it quite clear that rules of order are not for him.</P>
    <P>The consequences of these two rulings taken together are extremely serious.  If, for instance, the Government is anxious to rush through a particular measure for some reasons &mdash; so that the people cannot act or save themselves before morning &mdash; it can do it as a result of these two rulings and, apparently, it would be an impertinence on the part of the Chair to interfere with the conduct and with the view of the Government.  That is the serious thing &mdash; the failure to exercise his discretion on the part of the occupant of the Chair.  We were told, for instance, when a certain Bill was going through this House&mdash;the Bill for the abolition of the Seanad &mdash; that a certain fraction of this House would be necessary to carry through changes in the Constitution, but if you make these two rulings together, what is to prevent any Government over-riding that in <Col N="834" /> the space of exactly three-quarters of an hour?  Either people are serious in their belief in Parliamentary institutions or they are not.  If they are, then, it is time a stop was put to the development that has been taking place here in the last month and it is because we feel &mdash; very reluctantly, I confess &mdash; that the Chair has not been sufficiently alive to that matter that I have felt compelled to bring forward this motion.</P>
    <P>I cannot take the light-hearted view of Standing Orders that was taken in your ruling, Sir, of Tuesday.  I think they are something more than pious pointers to the Chair and I think that unless they are kept, and not departed from without grave necessity, or only on fairly trivial matters, when the House can have an opportunity of discussing those trivial matters again, it is very serious, not merely from the point of view of the minority, but of the majority and Parliament altogether. It is a very serious thing to break these.  They are not mere petty rules of this House and it is not these rules themselves I am thinking of, but what these rules were meant to protect.  It is because I feel that the institutions and rights which these rules were meant to protect are being filched away that I feel compelled to move this motion.  The electorate elected a majority here, but it also elected others.  It elected the majority to carry through the Government policy.  I admit that is one of the things it did &mdash; not that the Government is carrying it through; but that is quite another matter, quite irrelevant to this discussion.  It is quite true that the majority were elected here to do certain things, and so were the minority.  They were elected to scrutinise very carefully the measures of the Government and they would have been failing in their duty if they did not exercise those rights to the fullest extent.  The Parliament is not the Government.  It is a different institution altogether and there are plenty of opportunities for putting forward the majority views and the majority rights.  The Government puts them forward every day and it <Col N="835" /> is the business of Parliament to scrutinise what is put before it by the Government.</P>

      <P>I can understand that word sabotage is very familiar to the Deputy.  I think I know the country in which it is most used and he is quite familiar with it. It is the function of Parliament not to act as a Government but to consider Government measures and pass them or reject them.  But it must consider them first.  It is because these various things, the developments of the last few weeks, have interfered with and threaten still further, if not properly checked, to interfere with that function on the part of Parliament, that I propose this motion.  The line taken up by the Government Party is that of majority dictatorship. It is because there has not been sufficient resistance by the Chair at a time when Parliamentary institutions were being threatened that we feel it necessary to propose this motion.  It is a question of the majority saying &ldquo;We want this; no discussion on it. The fact that we want it is enough and let there not be examination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In connection with the Finance Bill, and especially with that Schedule that took several hours, that was the one occasion on which a thorough examination was possible.  We had to act partly on the basis of a memorandum that was circulated presumably with a view to a further discussion.  The Government is simply trying to put Parliament aside, to make it a mere registration machine, which is the aim of prominent members in the Government. It is to that we strongly object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies must remember certain stages of the Finance Bill.  We on this side of the House were able to witness a very interesting and, in some respects, lamentable display that was taking place.  We saw attempts made by the Minister for Finance to brow-beat the Chair.  We saw contempt expressed again and again by the Minister for Finance, and this is not the first time attention was called <Col N="836" /> to that.

      <P>We were wondering, when the Minister for Finance threatened that he would leave the House if certain things were not done, what was going to happen.  All of us &mdash;we may be wrong&mdash;thought that that did seem an open determination to force the Chair to do certain things which the Chair ought not to do&mdash; accept closure.  I admit the Chair held out a long time, but it did not hold out altogether, and that is my complaint. My grievance is this: that the Government, having determined to put the Chair in the cart, the Chair went into the cart.  That is the serious thing&mdash;that the Chair fell into that particular trap that the Government had laid.  That is the grievance I have so far as the Chair is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the Ceann Comhairle are wide&mdash;at least they are great within certain narrow limits&mdash;but I think that is all the more reason why judgment should be used in the exercise of these powers.  We feel, as a result of the rulings made on that particular <Col N="838" /> occasion and the whole conduct of business, especially from Friday to the following Tuesday, that there has been a serious interference with the rights of the minority and, what is still more important, with the privileges of Parliament.  For that reason I move this motion.</P>

      <P>You yourself, Sir, I am sure, and everybody else in the House were wondering why it took the Party opposite a full week to table this motion that is now before the House.  You recollect, Sir, when a similar motion was tabled by this Party when in Opposition we had it on the day following the incident with the Chair where our Party thought the Chair was in fault.  On the day following that incident we handed in a motion, and the Chair on that occasion insisted that only a motion in specific terms would be accepted.  I regret that you yourself did not insist on something of the same kind now in this debate. Instead, you have allowed Deputy O'Sullivan to roam over the whole Official Debates in the last few years. The Deputy did so in the futile hope of discovering something in your rulings with which he could find fault. It took him quite a long time to come to the incident on Friday night, 5th July.  I notice that the person who did make the threat about bringing on this motion has not yet turned up. Obviously there was some trouble in the Party which apparently caused delay in getting them to stand by it. That Deputy who made the threat has taken cover between two heavy-weights. He has been sandwiched in between these heavy-weights.  At any rate Deputy O'Sullivan has gone all over your rulings and he has made only very minor points after all.  What is the complaint now in connection with that Friday night?  That the discussion was closured.  Deputy O'Sullivan pretends that they were most anxious to discuss this Finance Bill fully.  The Deputy stated in the course of his speech that we had another way of <Col N="839" /> getting the Finance Bill through in just as short a time as we did.  We are well aware of that.  If we did we would not have given the Deputy eight hours on the following day to deal with the Bill. His grievance really amounts to this, that instead of closuring the Finance Bill we gave him and his Party more time than they were able to avail of. Anybody listening to the Deputies opposite must have been disgusted with the whole thing.</P>

      <P>On that particular occasion we saw a lot of matter in the Press about the Finance Bill.  The <i>Irish Times</i> said that £11,000,000 were passed here in as many minutes, but eight or nine hours were taken up with a discussion of the Bill; that time was taken up by the Opposition, and not a single constructive suggestion was made and no constructive contribution was uttered to the debate.  Still the Opposition complained that they did not get time.  It is quite the reverse&mdash; it is really too much time they got, and that is what they did not want.  What I see wrong in the position is that the Opposition do not realise the changes that have taken place.  They still think they are a majority in the House.  As Deputy Flinn said, they are looking in the mirror and they see themselves still as a majority.  It will probably take them a few years to realise that they are a minority.  I would like to remind Deputies opposite of something said by your predecessor here as to the rights of majorities and minorities in <Col N="840" /> this House.  Speaking on the 5th July, 1928, as reported in Vol. 24, col. 2071, of the Official Debates, your predecessor, in the course of his remarks, said: &ldquo;It has been frequently said here that the Standing Orders are for the protection of minorities.&rdquo;  That is the line taken by the Opposition now. Your predecessor went on: &ldquo;That is only a partial truth.  Standing Orders do afford and ought to afford certain protection for the minority, but the main purpose of the Standing Orders is to assist in the transaction of the business of the House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.  Then your predecessor continued: &ldquo;The Standing Orders do contain safeguards for the minority in certain directions; they must ensure that the rights of the majority will also be preserved.&rdquo;  It all depends on which Party has the majority.  They will quite agree with that when they are the majority.  But when the position changes it will not work at all.  Then the Ceann Comhairle on that occasion continues: &ldquo;What has really to be recognised is &mdash;what is fundamental to the whole thing here&mdash;that the decision of the House itself is all important.  For example, when the House decides the motion &lsquo;that the question be now put,&rsquo; in the affirmative, it is the decision of the House that prevents Deputies from continuing having any further debate and not the decision of the Chair.&rdquo;  That was said by your predecessor in 1928.  I did not always agree with everything your predecessor did, but he was quite sound on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There were occasions when I did not agree with many things he said, but when we did disagree with him to the extent that we did, we were not afraid of putting it down upon paper and putting down the precise points on which we disagreed with him.  Everybody knows that the occupant of the Chair was only human in any case, but there was an idea then that he was more than human.  There <Col N="841" /> is no question about it that the Chair in those days was sacrosanct.  But we realised that the Ceann Comhairle was only a human being, that he was bound to make mistakes, and that he made mistakes, and so does the present occupant of the Chair.  If the present occupant of the Chair has been partial, it is only to the Opposition that he is partial.  That is due to the innate decency of the man.  Mistakes are often made by decent people, and they are harder on their own than on other people.  Unquestionably we proposed a member of our own Party for the Chair.  We frankly recognise that we put a man of our own Party in the Chair.  We expect from him fair dealing and impartial ruling, but we never pretended that the Ceann Comhairle was not a member of our Party at the time he was elected to the Chair.  If his rulings have been partial in any way, it has been on the side of the minority, and everybody knows that the members of the Opposition get from him a better hearing than the supporters of the Government.  Every person in the House knows that.  I have here a copy of an Opposition paper which actually says it.  It has an article here about the Ceann Comhairle, which winds up by saying: &ldquo;He is the right man in the right place; would that there were more men like him in the public life of the country.&rdquo; That is an extract from an article in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of the 12th July.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would rather get a compliment from some other paper than from this.  But that statement certainly expresses the mind not alone of this Party but of every Party in the House, and of practically every person in the House.  There may be a few of the other opinion, Deputies like Deputy McGilligan, who threatened to put down this motion. It took him ten days to persuade his Party to agree to the putting down of the motion.  There are people like him who could never be satisfied.  These are the people who are never accustomed to being pulled up by the Chair. But the leaders of the Opposition have, too, to be kept in order occasionally. You, Sir, have given latitude to them, <Col N="842" /> and that was due, I believe, more to the innate decency that is in you than to anything else.  If anybody or any Party was to put down this motion that is now before the House, it is this Party that should put it down.</P>
      <P>After a lot of beating about the bush trying to come to the point and not coming to the point, we got this from Deputy O'Sullivan that the Ceann Comhairle was asked on that day by two Ministers if there was anything in the Standing Orders to prevent the House sitting on the following day. Seeing that the Government was anxious to give as much time as possible to the consideration of the Finance Bill, the Ceann Comhairle was asked was there anything in the Standing Orders which would prevent the House from meeting on the next day to give further time for discussion. The Ceann Comhairle, having consulted and studied the Standing Orders, decided that there was nothing in them to prevent it.  As a matter of fact, I know of no record of a case in which formal notice had to be given of the adjournment of the House on a particular day.  Look at the Order Paper.  That item is on the Order Paper every day&mdash;the adjournment of the Dáil.  Four days' notice is normally necessary if the Ceann Comhairle thinks there is no urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not knocked on the head.  Your own man, who is now no longer a member of the House, has settled that the House&mdash;the majority if you like, because, after all, when the House comes to a decision it is a decision of the majority&mdash;has the right to decide those questions, and as the Chair said, it would be an impertinence on his part to prevent the House from coming to a decision.  He may not have meant that it would be an impertinence, but, in any case, he felt it was his duty not to prevent the House from taking a decision as to whether or not they would meet to give further time for discussing this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely when there is a majority decision&mdash;even if the majority happens to be on this side of the House &mdash;it is a decision of the House?  Of course it depends on who the majority are before the Party opposite will be satisfied, and they will not be satisfied then either.  We were told then that there was no precedent for the Dáil meeting on non-sitting days without notice&mdash;or at all, I think.  As a matter of fact I have been looking up the records of the House in the early days&mdash;in the days when Professor O'Sullivan told us that the House was growing; in the years when all those precedents were established; as far as I can gather from him there should never be another precedent established after they left office&mdash;and I find that there were at least nine occasions on which the House met on a Monday, which was a non-sitting day also.  One of the members of the Labour Party at the time was objecting to this, and the leader of the Labour Party&mdash;that is, the present Senator Johnson&mdash;took the line that after all the Government knew what business it had to do, and it was only right that in matters of that kind the Government should be facilitated in getting through its business. That was the attitude adopted at the time, and there was no question about it.  On nine occasions in those years, 1923 and 1924, the House did sit on non-sitting days, so that that argument falls to the ground, too.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will deal with that, too.  There is a precedent for sitting until 2 o'clock on Saturday. The only difference is that on this occasion we had some regard for the comfort of Deputies, and particularly Deputies opposite, because they got very worried on the last occasion when we sat all night, and really did not know what they were talking about, so we thought a night in bed would not do them any harm.  On one occasion we sat from 10.30 on Friday until 2 o'clock on the following Saturday, in continuous session, but after the exhibition we had on that occasion nobody would wish to have it repeated.  There is, therefore, a precedent for sitting on non-sitting days both on Saturday and Monday, no extra notice being given. Of course, what really happened was that the wild man, the ex-Minister, Deputy McGilligan, got excited and said some things which he had no right to say.  Deputy Cosgrave, instead of acting the kind father and giving him a good spanking, let the Party be bullied by him into standing over his action on that day.  I think that Deputy Cosgrave should now reassert himself.  He should get those people under his control again, and make them behave themselves.  I do not think that in the whole of Deputy O'Sullivan's Dáil career he ever made a more futile or ineffective speech.  He made no real point at all.  He himself admitted that most of the matters he had to complain of were minor matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, he said they were minor matters.  And the big matter that he had to raise, instead of being a cause of complaint, ought to have been quite the reverse, because, as I pointed out already, it was not a matter of closing the debate; it was a <Col N="845" /> matter of giving further time to discuss the Finance Bill, which had already taken seven times longer than this Party ever took in discussing a Finance Bill.  I can, therefore, find no other explanation for this motion than the one I have given&mdash;that Deputy McGilligan rushed the Party.  I do not know whether it was with the threat of a split; there was a split recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is only because of the pique of an ex-Minister that the House and the institutions of the House are to be brought into contempt.  In order to please him, Deputy O'Sullivan, a University Professor, and the ex-LeasCheann Comhairle, instead of, as I say, helping Deputy Cosgrave to spank him and to teach him manners, fell into the trap and are associated with him in the Resolution.

      <P>If it is any consolation to the Minister, I can assure him that in a short time the sandwich will be complete, and he will probably find that there is a heavy dose of mustard in it also.  The Minister has <Col N="846" /> apparently been delving into the Official Reports of the House, and he gave us the results of what he had gleaned from them.  He laid particular stress on the decision of the House that the Ceann Comhairle had no right to stand between the House, or the majority, in coming to a decision.  It is a pity that when the Minister was going into the Official Reports he did not look at column 1278, of the 5th March, 1930, and read what the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, said on that very point.  On that occasion Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That is the particular point I wanted to make clear.  The debate was concluded by a decision of the House.  The implication is that the Ceann Comhairle was merely the medium by which the proposal of the jack-boot Minister for Finance was submitted to the House.  The Ceann Comhairle knows, and every Deputy knows, that in permitting the closure motion to be moved he was not asking a decision of the House, but a decision of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was not a decision of the House; it was a decision of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party... The Ceann Comhairle is supposed by this section to protect the rights of the minority from invasion by the organised Party majority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As reported in column 1280, the same Deputy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I regret that the Ceann Comhairle should have seen fit to have facilitated the application of the gag to this House by accepting the closure motion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently, as I say, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not come across that.</P>

We are told by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that the Government wanted to give more time to the Opposition to discuss the Finance Bill.  The Government had no option.  The Government found, through their own incompetency, their own inefficiency, and the fact that they were not so able to organise business so as to have the Finance Bill completed in proper time, that they had to get it discussed upon another day.</P>
      <P>Let us have some regard to the circumstances in which the whole matter arose.  I defy any Deputy to produce from the Official Debates from the foundation of this House any precedent for what was done on that Friday night.  Let it be remembered first&mdash; attention was drawn to it in this House and it cannot be denied&mdash;that there was a definite attempt on the part of the Government, and particularly on the part of certain Ministers, to browbeat the Chair.  That was a sustained attempt over three weeks, which, I suggest, culminated on that Friday night, when the Chair was bullied into accepting two motions and two closures at 11.30.  I say that that was a direct result of the tactics carried on, particularly by the Minister for Finance&mdash; clear to every Deputy, and commented upon by Deputies before ever this matter arose&mdash;and, to a lesser extent, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the position?  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told us that we occupied more time than was ever occupied before in discussing a Finance Bill.  We were told that there was more time occupied by the Opposition than the Government Party ever occupied when in Opposition.  Surely that does not say it was wrong.  Surely everybody knows that this year's Finance Bill was such as we have never seen before; that it was a Finance Bill which called for more detailed examination and exposing, if you like, to the public than any Finance Bill that ever came before the House before.  Surely if there was urgency, which I deny, the fact that you were <Col N="848" /> tied up for time was due, not to what happened in the discussions on the Bill, but to the fact that owing to the inefficiency of the Government and their want of proper organisation the Finance Bill was delayed and the Budget was introduced at a later date this year than, as far as I know, speaking from recollection, any Budget was introduced in this House since 1922.  They talked about all the time taken here and that they had to give at least three weeks to the Seanad to consider the Finance Bill.  We know quite well what the Government think of the Seanad and what are the powers of the Seanad with regard to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>On the Friday morning a motion was made that the House should sit later than 2.30, and that the motion for the adjournment should be taken not later than 12 midnight.  There was nothing whatever wrong with that motion in itself.  The Government, if they did not know when moving the motion, certainly knew long before 11.30 p.m., that, owing to the detailed examination of the long schedules imposing new and additional taxes on a tremendous number of articles, they were not going to get the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill concluded that night. It has been proved that there was no reason whatever why the Committee Stage of the Bill could not have been taken on the following Tuesday and concluded on that day.  Further, there was no reason whatever why the whole of that Friday, from 10.30 a.m. until 12 midnight, should not have been devoted to the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Conditions of Employment Bill is an important Bill and it was important that the Committee Stage of it should be got through.  But does anybody suggest that it was essential to get the Committee Stage of that Bill concluded on that Friday morning and that it should be given precedence over what the Government claimed was the most urgent Bill, the Finance Bill?  Let us remember that the Finance Bill was not taken up until 3 p.m. on Friday and that four and a half hours of that Friday, that is more <Col N="849" /> than a whole normal sitting period on Friday, was taken up by the Conditions of Employment Bill, which, while important and while it would be necessary to get it through with the least possible delay, should not, if the Government's claim of urgency for the Finance Bill was well founded, be given precedence over the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Before this happened at 11.30 p.m., everybody had come to the conclusion that the Dáil was adjourning at midnight until the following Tuesday, because, apart from what had been stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, one naturally came to the conclusion &ldquo;that the Dáil shall adjourn not later than 12 midnight&rdquo; meant that the Dáil should adjourn until the following Tuesday.  That was assumed by many members of the House.  It was assumed by every member of the Labour Party that that was what was going to happen. Otherwise, that Party would have been here because, apart from the Finance Bill, there was another Bill in which they were genuinely interested.  It was assumed by members on the opposite side and by members on this side.  That is well known to members in all parts of the House.  My submission, therefore, is that the Ceann Comhairle, having had to withstand intimidation, open and unashamed, from certain members of the Government, and in particular from the Minister for Finance, at last was brow-beaten into accepting a motion which I believe normally he would not accept and could not accept. At 11.30 the Minister for Agriculture interrupted the business of the House to ask the Chair to accept the motion without notice.  There was no discussion allowed on that motion; it was closured.  Then we were told that there was another motion and another motion was moved at, I think, 11.40, and that motion was closured.  No time was allowed to advance a reason for or against that motion, as to whether it should or should not be accepted; and my point is that that was absolutely unprecedented in this House.</P>
    <P>I say further that the Government deliberately refrained from moving <Col N="850" /> these motions until 11.30 in order to compel the Chair, if he accepted the two motions, also to accept the two closures; because there was no point whatever in the Chair accepting these motions at 11.30 unless he also agreed to the closures, as the motions could not have been decided before 12 o'clock and, therefore, would not be effective. The whole thing can be boiled down to that.  I am confining it to this particular issue of the Friday night.</P>
    <P>I might say in passing that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, it seems to me, made the best case, a better case than I could make, for this motion because he said clearly, without any equivocation whatever, that they were the majority Party and that it was the rights of the majority that were going to hold in this House. The Minister certainly says what he has to say, unlike his leader.  He is a very devoted follower of the President but he does not follow him in everything.  There is no difficulty in understanding what the Minister means because he comes out clearly and to the point.  We are told that all this was done in order to facilitate the Opposition.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wanted to know what was the reason for this motion and what was the purpose of it.  It would seem to me that the main reason for this motion, speaking for myself, is to endeavour to have the power and the authority of the Chair in this House upheld even against the Government for the time being.</P>

      <P>It depends on what the Deputy means by &ldquo;produce.&rdquo;  No doubt the Deputy would produce many things.  He has, as a matter of fact. I am suggesting, and I think it is a very complete answer to the Minister, that we waited to consider the matter carefully, to see the Official Report and to make sure that we were perfectly right when we asserted that the Ceann Comhairle had allowed the rights of the minority to be trampled on, on that occasion, by the majority. I assert&mdash;I am giving my personal view for what it is worth&mdash;that it is the main function of the Ceann Comhairle to safeguard, so far as he can within the Standing Orders and in conjunction with the Standing Orders, the rights of the minority.  The fact is that the majority usually can, and do, look after themselves.  If we are going to be faced with the position that the majority Party for the time being in the House can come at any time to the occupant of the Chair and put it to him in this way: &ldquo;Is there anything in the Standing Orders to prevent our moving a motion, any motion at any time&rdquo;&mdash;if that is to be contended, it seems to me that the sooner we carry on without a Ceann Comhairle the better, because the function of the Ceann Comhairle is, so far as he possibly can, to uphold Parliamentary institutions, practice and procedure and to see that minority rights are not trampled on. I say that any occupant of the Chair who accepts two motions and two closures half an hour before midnight on any night fails in his duty absolutely. That is the case as I see it. That is the case that the House will have to address itself to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more in this than an error of judgment.  It was not an ordinary error of judgment.  It is quite easy for any man occupying the Chair to be in error; he is not infallible; he has to depend on his own judgment.  He has to judge things in the particular circumstances and atmosphere of the House.  He does that on his own, frequently without advice.  The real <Col N="852" /> seriousness of this, however, is that it was not an ordinary error of judgment made by the Chair.  The real seriousness lies in the fact that it was a deliberate and sustained attempt of the Government to break down the institution of the Chair in this House. My submission is that they succeeded in that attempt and that as a result of three weeks of sustained intimidation, intimidation particularly by the Minister for Finance, to the knowledge of every member of this House, not only did the Chair accept two motions, but it accepted two closures on these motions without any discussion whatever as to whether the motions were necessary or whether they should be allowed before the House.  The House, we were told, had to come to a decision, and it was not entitled to discuss the motions.  That, again, we were told, was not a decision of the House but a decision of the Ceann Comhairle.  In that way the Chair decided that the Party who claim to have a majority were entitled at that hour to trample on the rights of other Parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the speech made by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan in support of the motion.  Although the Deputy occupied about three-quarters of an hour of the time of the House, and was copiously supplied with notes, I have never listened to a speech on a motion dealing with so serious an issue, containing such a tissue of trivialities as the Deputy tried to mobilise in support of his case.  The Deputy took three-quarters of an hour to mobilise what I suppose he describes as arguments.  In one portion of his speech the Deputy was very much concerned because the Fianna Fáil Party would not listen to arguments.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the Fianna Fáil Party, if they have got to consider the trivialities which the Deputy calls arguments.  The Deputy himself did not believe they were arguments.  It was only by being equipped with a volume of notes that the Deputy was able to remember even the trivial points which he made in support of his motion.  I was rather <Col N="853" /> interested in one line which the Deputy took in support of the motion.  He was concerned that Parliament should not be brought into disrepute and that Parliamentary institutions should be maintained in a dignified manner.  He said that there was a universal recognition by all Parties and by the community of the majesty and the dignity of our Parliamentary institutions.  I am beginning to wonder whether that was not a mock rôle for the Deputy here this evening, because it is not so long since the leader of his Party said that our Parliamentary institutions were un-Irish and should be abolished.  Yet we have Deputy O'Sullivan here this evening taking a line completely contrary to his leader and saying that he wants to maintain Parliamentary institutions, which his leader of another day wanted to abolish because they were completely un-Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surely entitled to suggest that when the Deputy submitted a motion of this kind he has left himself open to an accusation of hypocrisy.  I am surely entitled to say that all this pretended concern for Parliament and Parliamentary institutions, is so much humbug when Deputy O'Sullivan brings in a motion criticising your conduct.  Why, in this particular matter you have shown yourself a very much more faithful champion of Parliamentary institutions in this House than Deputy O'Sullivan or any member of his Party has shown himself to be. Deputy O'Sullivan, of course, made no case whatever for this motion.  He did not seem by his halting and disjointed argument to have any sympathy with this motion.  He seemed to be a substituted mover of the motion and to have very little real concern with its terms.  Deputy Morrissey made a somewhat better attempt to justify the motion.  At all events he justified the delay in submitting it to the House by making it clear that it was the desire of the Party opposite not to do <Col N="854" /> anything in a rush or in the impetuous way that Deputy McGilligan wanted. Deputy Morrissey wanted to wait and see the Official Report.  But Deputy McGilligan, in the rôle of author of the motion, even on Friday, the 5th July, made up his mind that such a motion should be submitted on such evidence as he then had.  Deputy Morrissey's calmer consideration was only used to implement the decision taken in the heat of the moment by Deputy McGilligan on Friday night.  And, of course, all the calm consideration was utilised for no other purpose than to see in what way Deputy McGilligan's view might be supported with some argument advanced in favour of the motion.</P>
      <P>If we are to take Deputy O'Sullivan's speech as a justification for the moving of this motion, then, it becomes quite clear that there is no justification for the motion at all.  Speeches made so far in support of this motion were irrational and irrelevant as Deputy McGilligan's on Friday night was ill-considered. Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Sullivan seem to think that in Parliamentary institutions all the rights lie with minorities and no rights lie with the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the substance of the arguments put forward in the speeches of the Deputies.  I concede, at the outset, that minorities, of course, have their rights.  But in balancing the claims of majorities and minorities the Chair ought not, in any way, to lean towards the side of the minority, or ought not to do so to such an extent as would frustrate the majority will of the people.  Whatever rights minorities have they ought not to be utilised in a way that would prevent Parliament functioning, or in a way that would thwart the will of the people, as expressed at the elections, and in order not to hold up to ridicule and contempt Parliamentary institutions established by the people of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say frankly, a Chinn Comhairle, that I did not like the language in which your decision was couched on <Col N="855" /> the night of the 5th of July.  I would prefer the reasons given were expressed in different language and, perhaps, on reconsideration, you, Sir, yourself, might be disposed to agree with that point of view.  But the language is not a serious matter on an occasion like this.  It is the action of the Ceann Comhairle that we are now discussing, and it is that action that we must examine.  And in our examination of that action we must endeavour to ascertain whether in fact the Ceann Comhairle has, in any way, allowed the rights of minority Parties in this House to be violated.  What are the facts of the case?</P>
    <P>We had Deputy MacDermot, deputy Leader of the Fine Gael Party, in this House, introducing a motion in favour of speeches being limited in duration to half an hour.  Yet when we came to the Finance Bill the Fine Gael Party put up speaker after speaker to occupy the time of the House for very much longer periods than half an hour. Speeches from the Fine Gael Party revealed that there were any number of latent experts in the Party.  Deputy Bennett, who had not distinguished himself by any expert knowledge previously, showed in his speech on the Finance Bill that he was an expert on football cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was here for part of the debate.  I am glad, however, my better judgment assisted me to get out of ear reach of many of the declarations of the Deputy's colleague.  But even Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney must see the humour of Deputy Bennett posing as the football expert of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have been kicking but he certainly was not thinking. Listening to him one would think that the whole future of this country, and its destinies, were to be decided on the question whether a tax was to be <Col N="856" /> put on football cases and golf balls. Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney were very much annoyed because they were not allowed to talk all the week on the question of the taxation of football covers.  It was obvious to anyone listening to the debate on the Finance Bill that the whole object of the Party opposite was to delay the Bill and take up the time of the House.  The same speeches have been made over and over again and, on important matters, two or three times previously.  Many of the arguments put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and which occupied much of the time of the House were not arguments that would commend themselves to anyone with common sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I pass away from that. An effort was made to discuss all big matters in a reasonable period of time, allowing adequate discussion for all Parties and allowing minorities their rights, while at the same time not deliberately throttling the rights of the majority.  If the Opposition wanted adequate discussion they had abundant time for it.  If they had any respect for Deputy MacDermot's view they should have kept their speeches within the ambit of half an hour.  But having being allowed a holiday in one particular week on the matter of talking on the Finance Bill, they found it difficult afterwards to confine themselves to any reasonable discussion. The object of the Government Party was to try and have discussion confined within a reasonable time.  I think every Party in this House, and certainly the minority Parties, had adequate time in which to discuss the Finance Bill; therefore there can be no complaint whatever, no well-founded complaint, that adequate time was not given to Deputies in all parts of the House to discuss every provision of the Finance Bill both on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any complaint that could be made against you, Sir, I think it is <Col N="857" /> the one suggested by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, namely, that you have extended perhaps too much latitude to Deputies in this House.  I certainly, from my own view, would say that if the Chair displayed any bias it was not towards the Government Party and that too much tolerance was extended to the Fine Gael Party.  At the commencement of our business here the House asks that Almighty God will happily end our words and works; but that prayer is scarcely finished until some member of the Party opposite gets up to engage again in a campaign of abuse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>You have had, Sir, a very difficult task in the Chair, and you certainly have not been assisted by some Deputies in this House, and by one Deputy of the Fine Gael Party, in particular, and it ill becomes that Party, in view of the indulgence and latitude which they must know they have received from you and which they must know at least one prominent member of their Party in particular has received from you, to submit a motion of this kind which questions your conduct and accuses you of disregard of the rights of minorities, and of bias in favour of the Government Party in this House.  I think that most reasonable Deputies in the House would wish that the needless heat and uncalled for bitterness which disgrace this House in the eyes of the community, were eliminated, and that there was less raking of the ashes of bitterness and of the ashes of the unfortunate civil war.  If we want to <Col N="858" /> maintain the dignity of Parliament, if we want to maintain the majesty of Parliament, if we want our people to respect Parliamentary institutions, we here in this Assembly ought to set an example to the rest of the community by dignified and decorous conduct.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan told us that the existence of this House was for the purpose of analysing the proposals which came before it; that it was a deliberative assembly; and that adequate time should be allowed for discussion.  Does Deputy O'Sullivan seriously contend that the House has been denied the opportunity of discussing measures which have to pass through this House?  Does he deny that he was afforded an adequate opportunity of discussing those measures, and that he might have had more opportunity of discussing them intelligently himself, if he could have turned off the flow of irrelevant and unintelligent criticism which was directed towards many of these proposals? So far as the Finance Bill is concerned&mdash;and that seems to be the burden of the Deputy's case in support of this motion&mdash;adequate time, in my view was allowed, and it was painfully obvious to everybody&mdash;to the members <Col N="859" /> of the House and to visitors&mdash;that the whole strategy of the Opposition on that Bill was to waste as much time as possible in order to cause as much embarrassment as possible to the Government Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Sullivan seemed to think that democracy consisted of talking and that democracy consisted of allowing a minority to spend as long as it chose in discussing legislative proposals. In my view, that is the very negation of all democracy.  Real democracy surely consists of allowing the will of the people to be expressed.  Real democracy surely consists of enabling the legislative programme endorsed by the people to be carried out.  Real democracy will only continue to exist in this country if the Parliamentary institutions of this State are regarded as institutions through which the will of the people, as expressed in the ballot box, can be given effect to, but if we are ever to consent to a position in which the will of the people, as expressed in the ballot box, can be thwarted by Opposition tactics in this House, Parliament in this country will become a sham and people will look to other methods for a solution of their economic and political differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think no motion has ever been introduced in this House based on such insincerity, on such trivialities, and on such a complete want of any justification whatever as the motion moved by Deputy O'Sullivan this evening.  He has not attempted to show that the Ceann Comhairle has in any way debased the exalted position which the Chair should rightly occupy in any deliberative assembly.  He has failed completely to show that the Chair was guilty of any offence against minority parties in this House on 5th July or any other date.  The Deputy's speech consisted of a tissue of trivialities, and it seemed from the way in which he endeavoured to put them over to the House that he himself for one scarcely believed in half of them.  I think that most people listening to this discussion will realise at once that there was no justification <Col N="860" /> for this motion, and that the attempt which was sought to be made by Deputy O'Sullivan to hang this motion on your action, on Friday, 5th July, has fallen completely to the ground.</P>
    <P>In the Chair, I think you have displayed a propriety which it would be exceedingly difficult to surpass.  I think you have shown regard for the rights of minority parties in this House, and I think you have maintained the high tradition which has been associated with the Chair of this Parliament since 1922.  I think you have shown yourself a fitting occupant of this Chair, and if the Party opposite still pretend to have any regard for Parliamentary institutions, they ought not to have treated us to the degrading spectacle of wasting time in considering a motion of this kind which I say, in the first place, is insincere, and, in the second place, is a hypocritical demonstration of pretended affection for Parliament by a Party which has already indicated that it has no use for this Parliament and no use for the Parliamentary institutions of this country.</P>

Deputy Norton's speech consisted, as to the first part of it, of a mere diatribe against Deputy O'Sullivan. How does that help the House?  Deputy Norton's speech, as it went on further, was an attack upon this Party as being an opponent of political institutions, which Deputy Norton and everybody else in this House knows is utterly and entirely false.  Deputy Norton knows that to be utterly and entirely false.  We have left physical force to the Party opposite.</P>

I say further that when Deputy Norton professes that he was here when the discussions were proceeding on the Finance Bill, the discussions that he describes as irrelevant, he is suggesting what is not correct.  Deputy Norton was not present in the House, as this book shows, so far as divisions are concerned.  It is within the memory of every person here that on Saturday and on the whole of Friday not merely Deputy Norton, but not one single member of the Labour Party was in his place.</P>

      <P>After the Conditions of Employment Bill was dealt with there was no Labour Deputy present.  The division list is the test. Now that I have answered shortly the complete irrelevancies of Deputy Norton, and now that I have answered the very cheap method which the beaten debater often adopts, the cheap method of endeavouring to attack the other side when you have not got a case, I would like to get down to other matters.  Let me come&mdash;and it can be put in a very short compass indeed&mdash; to the pronouncement made by the Ceann Comhairle here.  The pronouncement stands on the records of the House, and it is a precedent for every single person who occupies the Chair for the future, be he Ceann Comhairle, Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Deputy called on to preside over our debates.  Here is the precedent which the Ceann Comhairle has set down, the general ruling he has given, and let Deputy Norton or any member of the Labour Party or of the Fianna Fáil Party who likes say if this is a sound ruling.  This is the precedent laid down, which ought to be followed by the Ceann Comhairle or any occupant <Col N="862" /> of the Chair in this or any other deliberative assembly.  This is no afterthought on my part.  I may say that when this pronouncement was made from the Chair on that particular Friday night I took exception to it there and then.  No attempt was made by the Chair on that occasion to retract or qualify in the slightest degree the general principle laid down for the future guidance of the occupants of the Chair.  Here is the principle laid down.  It is in column 2061, Vol. 57, No. 4:</P>
      <P>As regards the motion that the Dáil do now adjourn till 10.30 a.m. to-morrow, July 6th, that motion was handed to the Chair as a matter of urgency, as certain Bills have to get through this House within a week. I consider that it would be rather an impertinence for the Chair to decide that the majority in this House in a matter of urgency cannot come to a decision as to whether or not it would sit to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the general principle laid down by the Ceann Comhairle, that if the majority Party considers a matter to be one of urgency it is an impertinence for the Chair to come to any other decision or to think for itself. That is a ruling to which we must take exception, that the Ceann Comhairle considers it an impertinence for a man holding the high position in which he has been placed by the votes of this assembly, to use his own judgment or to question a decision which has been given to him by the majority Party.  That principle stands there, and it is not confined to matters of urgency.  Apparently the majority can do anything they like.  The general principle is laid down that it is an impertinence for the Ceann Comhairle to interfere with the majority Party and it is against that we will continue to raise the very strongest protest.  What is the nonsense that is put forward here, that this is not a <i>bona fide</i> motion, the nonsense that our Party and everybody in the House interested in the future of the House are not concerned when the Ceann Comhairle lays down from the Chair a general rule for his own <Col N="863" /> guidance and for future occupants of the Chair, a terrible rule that it is an impertinence for the Ceann Comhairle to interfere with the views of the majority Party?  He takes a particular suggestion of urgency, but it is not confined to urgency.  It would, apparently, be an impertinence for him to hear the Leader of the Opposition. Presumably he would adopt that attitude if the majority Party thought that the Leader of the Opposition should not address the House.  He can prevent anybody speaking and he can do anything he likes if the majority Party consider it right.  This general rule is applicable not merely to urgency but whenever the majority Party wish anything to be done.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle has laid down that general principle in the terrible pronouncement that it is an impertinence for the Chair to use its own judgment against the judgment of the majority Party.  That is the proposition to which we take exception.  It is a proposition to which anybody who is interested in Party government must take exception.  It is a proposition to which any person who thinks there is any future before this House, as I do, must take exception. It is a proposition to which every upholder of democratic government, of which I and my Party are the strongest upholders in this country, must take exception.  If we are going to have a legislative assembly here in which the Ceann Comhairle openly admits that he is simply there to do the bidding of the majority Party and not to preserve the rights of the ordinary members, then this House as a democratic institution cannot carry on. That is the main thing which we have to decide.  What the Ceann Comhairle did has already been questioned and put before the House and I need not repeat it.  I make an appeal to the House to express its views on this matter solely upon the general principle which the Ceann Comhairle has laid down for future occupants of the Chair.  I say that is a principle over which this House should not stand.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary the <Col N="864" /> ability with which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Sullivan have been able to work up a little heat in this debate. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney must have been a very able man in addressing a jury when he could act so well in a debate like this.  Deputy Morrissey quoted the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a debate like this some time ago.  I would like to let the House know what President Cosgrave at that time, now Deputy Cosgrave, thought about the duty of the Ceann Comhairle.  He said: &ldquo;The Dáil must have the transaction of public business and the Ceann Comhairle is appointed to preside over the debates and to secure that they are conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner.&rdquo;  We all agree with that.  He says: &ldquo;He also has the duty of seeing that the business of the House is done.&rdquo;  He still has that duty even though Deputy Cosgrave is not President now.  The Ceann Comhairle has the duty of seeing that the business of the House is done. He also said on that ocasion that &ldquo;the Ceann Comhairle has just as many obligations to the majority as he has to the minority.&rdquo;  Just as many obligations. When people spoke from this side to-day on the motion, they did not go as far as that.  Deputy Norton said that the Ceann Comhairle ought to lean towards the minority.  Deputy Cosgrave when he was President said that the Ceann Comhairle ought to lean just as much to one as to the other, just as far to the majority as to the minority: &ldquo;If the majority of the House wishes to take a decision it is obvious that the Ceann Comhairle has no option.  It would be an impertinence to interfere with the rights of the Deputies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is very laudable.  He said if the majority of the House wishes to take a decision it is obvious that the Ceann Comhairle has very little option.  When Deputy Cosgrave was President, if the Minister or the President wished to put it to the Ceann Comhairle that the House wished to decide in a certain way it <Col N="865" /> was obvious that the Ceann Comhairle had little option but to let them decide.  That was the way with the majority always&mdash;they got their right to decide on a vote of the House what they were to do.  That is how Parliaments have always decided.  That is how Parliaments must always decide by a vote of the House.  If we are deciding on such a vote we are upholders of majority rule and that Party over there, surely to goodness, did enough in this country to uphold majority rule or, at all events, they did enough in the name of majority rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Deputy O'Sullivan when speaking here to-day&mdash;I am not able to deal with him as ably as Deputy Norton did&mdash;spoke about the inconvenience of being kept relevant in a discussion in this House.  He complained that the Ceann Comhairle occasionally called him to order on the score of irrelevance.  The Deputy is, no doubt, very much inconvenienced on that point.  He said it was only a minor matter but still it is perhaps rather hard on the Deputy.  Naturally an accumulation of these small matters might cause one to resent the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.  But built up on these small little annoyances such as being called to order for irrelevancies there surely was quite enough justification for putting in this motion.  These matters culminated on one particular night.  The Deputy mentioned that there was a ruling given in June, 1933. We have had no time to look at what were the circumstances at that particular time.  None of us are prepared to accept the <i>ex parte</i> statement of Deputy O'Sullivan that after a two and a half hours' debate on the President's Vote, a motion was accepted by which the minority were ruled out. Deputy O'Sullivan also referred to a debate between Deputy McGilligan and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which the Ceann Comhairle was supposed to act unfairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made to-day that the Government waited until 11.30 o'clock on the Friday night before taking <Col N="866" /> action.  Why should we not?  When we announced the business here in the morning at 10.30 there were four Bills before the House.  Most of the Committee Stage of the Conditions of Employment Bill had been dealt with and we had concluded a large part of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  All that remained was the Report Stage of another Bill and the Fifth Stage of a fourth Bill.  Although we are not accustomed to underestimate the power of the Opposition to roam around the subject and to talk a good deal of irrelevancies on anything that would arise, we did believe that the 13½ hours would be more than sufficient to conclude that business, especially as we had given more time to the Finance Bill up to that point than ever had been given in this Parliament before for financial business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And more time is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they got very much more time.  We are blamed because we did not ask to sit on Saturday until 11.30.  Take the position.  We had the last part of the Finance Bill &mdash;only the Schedules to be discussed in Committee.  That discussion commenced at 8.30 and anybody would imagine that Schedules which dealt with a matter of only £5,000 out of £28,000,000 would be discussed and dealt with in three hours.  The Government believed that even the Opposition were hardly capable of petering out three and a half hours' time.  We expected there would be sufficient time to conclude that and the other business before 12 o'clock on Friday night.  It was only when it came to 11 o'clock that it became obvious what the Opposition wanted to do.  That was to leave a small portion of the Finance Bill over so that they could say &ldquo;We have beaten you and we have beaten the motion you brought in this morning.  You have not been able to conclude this Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has seen other things.  When the Deputies <Col N="867" /> found that their little game did not work out quite in the way they expected, they got into a temper and immediately Deputy McGilligan said to the Ceann Comhairle: &ldquo;I will put down a motion to deal with you.&rdquo; Deputy Boland said to-day that they took ten days to consider the thing but Deputy McGilligan did not wait ten days before threatening his motion.  Deputy McGilligan objected to the motion to report progress which of course was necessary in order to move the next motion.  He objected to that technically but it was to the sitting on Saturday that he really objected.  I think there were some few minutes discussion on the second one.</P>

      <P>He objected by his vote to the House getting an opportunity of deciding how the business should be arranged.  The Opposition themselves had left no time for anything else.  The motion to sit on Saturday was to enable the Dáil to transact financial business.  The point was made here by Professor O'Sullivan that we could have adjourned on Friday night, and taken all the stages of the Finance Bill on Tuesday, by some kind of closure motion.  I think the Opposition would be quite entitled to object to that sort of procedure&mdash;having a closure on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  We wanted to give the Opposition more time to discuss the Finance Bill.  They are objecting because they got plenty of time to discuss it.  It was proved on Saturday that they were not able to sit for the 12 hours.  They had to give in.</P>

      <P>If we adopted the course suggested by Professor O'Sullivan we <Col N="868" /> could only have concluded the Committee Stage on Tuesday, and would have had to take the Report Stage on Wednesday.  That would not give any time for amendments on the Report Stage.  The Opposition had amendments down for the Report Stage, and what is more they got time to discuss them on Wednesday.  Of course, under Deputy O'Sullivan's arrangement there would neither have been time to put in amendments nor to discuss them.  In that way, they would probably have a much bigger grievance than they have at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle appears to be getting into some trouble because the Minister for Finance asked him for the closure four times, I think it was on Friday.  But the Ceann Comhairle refused.  Surely to goodness if the Ceann Comhairle actually refused to accept a closure motion from the Minister for Finance, it is not to be put to the discredit of the Ceann Comhairle, at any rate, in discussing a motion like this.  I do not really know how the minority can claim in any way that their rights were infringed by giving them an extra day to discuss the Finance Bill, rather than adopting Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion of a closure motion to shut out further discussion, and meet on Tuesday instead.  There was only one Schedule to this Bill remaining, which entailed an expenditure of £5,000.  The discussion on that lasted from 8.30 on Friday night until 11.30, and went on for about four hours on the following day.  There was six hours and forty minutes discussion on an expenditure of £5,000.</P>

      <P>That is quite right.  It is quite evident, I think, to everybody, that the Opposition were obstructing, rather than using the time usefully in dealing with the business here.  The minority evidently claims the right to determine the course of business.  It has always been recognised in this House&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs quoted Senator Johnson, who was leader of the Labour Party here, and it has also been recognised <Col N="870" /> by others when they were in minority Parties here&mdash;that it was the business of the Government to order business, to say what time should be allotted, and so on, or to say when we should meet at any rate.  When we met on that Friday morning the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that there were four Bills to be dealt with.  We fully expected that they would be dealt with by 12 o'clock that night.  When it came to 11 o'clock and the Bills were not disposed of, two Ministers, of whom I was one, went to the Ceann Comhairle and told him that this business was urgent.  We asked him if there was anything in the Standing Orders to prevent the House from meeting on Saturday.  We knew there was nothing in the Standing Orders to prevent a motion going down to closure all financial business on the following Tuesday or Wednesday, but as I said already that would not give the Opposition Party the same opportunity of discussion as meeting on Saturday, so we asked the Ceann Comhairle if there was anything in Standing Orders to prevent the House from meeting on Saturday.  He said he would look up the matter and let us know.  He came back and said he would accept the motion as being in order for decision by the House, and after that the necessary motion was moved.  I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Norton are quite right in their surmise that if this threat had not been made by Deputy McGilligan on that Friday night, this motion would never have gone down.  The motion went down eventually in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Morrissey, along with that of Deputy McGilligan, in order to save Deputy McGilligan's face, but I do not believe that the case which has been made by Deputy O'Sullivan or by Deputy Morrissey has in any way improved Deputy McGilligan's position, or proved that he had grounds for his attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a discussion of incidents which occurred on Friday, 5th July.  The Minister who has just spoken went to some pains to see what was said on the motion of censure in <Col N="871" /> the year 1930.  He has not had time to see what transpired in 1933, being apparently satisfied with having had the law laid down in 1930 on the censure motion which was then before the House.  It is a strange commentary upon the methods which are adopted in dealing with either public business, or procedure, or anything of that sort, that there is an inevitable trek back to see what were the precedents that were established, what were the statements that were made, and what was the opinion that was given expression to by the Minister who was here before, in connection with the conduct of the Chair and the position of the Chair with regard to the House.  The Minister might have gone further. Having read a single speech made on that occasion he might have examined the reasons why that speech had got to be made.  He would have found out that there is a record in connection with the Opposition either in regard to the last Chair or this Chair, which his Party has not got.  The Chair was never called names either in the last Parliament or in this by any Minister or ex-Minister of this Party, and he cannot claim that particular distinction for his Ministry at the moment. That is to be regretted.  Perhaps they are sorry for it.  I hope they are, and I hope that as a result of this particular motion there will be greater respect for the Chair, and greater respect for the conduct of business in this House.  This closure motion arises out of proceedings which took place on that Friday night.  But the start was not made on that Friday night.  The proceedings out of which this motion arose began on the Friday morning, when a responsible Minister, in announcing the business for the day, made this statement: &ldquo;It is proposed to take the business on the Order Paper commencing with Item No. 7 (Conditions of Employment Bill) to Item No. 10 (Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill).  Public business will not be interrupted at 12 noon to take private Deputies' business.  The Dáil will adjourn until Tuesday, 9th inst., at 3 o'clock.&rdquo;</P>

What is the position of a Deputy, no matter what Party he belongs to, who hears a statement like that made on responsible Ministerial authority by a Minister representing the Leader of the House?  &ldquo;The Dáil will adjourn until Tuesday at 3 o'clock&rdquo;&mdash;and the motion put from the Chair is: &ldquo;That the House sit later than 2.30 p.m. and that the order for the adjournment be taken not later than 12 o'clock.&rdquo;  I have longer experience in this House than any member over there and never in the history of the House was the House deceived by a statement by the Leader of the House or a person acting for him.  Was there any deceit practised on the House by that statement?  Who has the responsibility, if there was any deceit practised on the House?  It is either the Minister or the Ceann Comhairle.  The Minister made great play with the question of three weeks.  He said it was absolutely necessary that the Finance Bill should leave this House on the following Wednesday in order to give 21 days for consideration by the Seanad.  What was the Minister's contribution to the discussion that took place on the motion that the House should sit longer than 2.30 o'clock on Friday?  As reported in column 1822 of the Official Debates of 5th July, the Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;The Finance Bill must be law by the 5th August.&rdquo;  That is five days more.  He is pinning it now to 21 days.  But in the case he made for the House sitting late on that day, he put down the 5th August.</P>

      <P>It is on the records of the House in print.  What the Minister had in mind is what any Minister has <Col N="873" /> in mind who understands that the income tax law runs for four months from 5th April.  The reason he gave for sitting late on Friday was that this Bill should be law by the 5th August. Then the Minister, who told us he went with another Minister to the Ceann Comhairle at 11.30, suddenly forgot all about the 5th August.  He suddenly forgot about the five days. He went to impress on the Ceann Comhairle the absolute necessity for having this Bill through the House on Wednesday.  These are the people who tell us they know about their business, and yet they cannot find out the actual date before which the Finance Bill must be passed into law.  It might not even be necessary on 5th August, so far as the provision of money is concerned. It might be necessary on 1st August.  I am prepared to take it that it was necessary on 1st August.  If it were, was it because of an honest mistake that the Government made; was it because they found themselves at 11.30 that night in a fix?  Did they approach any member of the Opposition in connection with the matter at that time and point out the urgency of it?</P>

      <P>They approached the Ceann Comhairle and satisfied him outside this House with regard to the urgency.  What was the urgency on 5th July?  There were still 26 days. As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, they took the Conditions of Employment Bill on that day from 10.30 a.m. until 2 o'clock.  There was no urgency between 10.30 in the morning and 2 o'clock.  There was no urgency in the Minister's mind when he had a month from the 5th July to 5th August to get the Bill through.  Some extraordinary situation must have presented itself to the Minister between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. to change his mind about the 21 days or the 31 days.  There is no use in trying to mislead either this House or the people by saying that there was a case for urgency.  No case of urgency could validate the deceit practised on the House on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> I should like to know what is going to happen in the future if there is a majority in the House, an accidental majority if you wish, by which the Government of the day is beaten.  Is the Ceann Comhairle immediately going to take from the people in the majority any resolution that they think is necessary owing to the urgency of the situation?  Look at the position in which they are placing the Chair and the difficulties that are going to confront the Chair in future.  If it so happened that the tea duty was beaten on a division, is the Ceann Comhairle going to be impressed by representations made to him by a majority in the House regarding that particular state of affairs?  He is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is admitted that he is going to do it.  The Minister will require to reflect whether he is not making a mistake about that, as he did about the five days.  A case has been put up here as to the considerable amount of time wasted on the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill is the most important measure introduced during the year.  For a great number of years the Finance Bill made very little change in the taxation imposed on the people.  Over a period of six or seven years the variation did not amount to more than £1,000,000 or £1,500,000.  This particular Finance Bill imposed enormous taxation on the people.  Are the majority Party in this House, or to use the phraseology of the Ceann Comhairle on that occasion, are the majority of the House to decide what rights any persons in this House, outside of that majority, have got in discussing, criticising, exposing, explaining the taxation, or getting explanations in connection with the taxation that is being imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On examination and on reflection nobody will be less pleased with the results of that Friday night than the Government.  It may be that we are coming to the point where there will be no longer three independent institutions in this State&mdash;the Executive, <Col N="875" /> the judiciary and the legislature.  If the independence of the legislature is gone the sooner the country is told it the better.  While it remains, if there is any vestige of it remaining, if the rearguard action which the Ceann Comhairle has been fighting for the last 12 months or two years has preserved some vestige of it, and if that is all that remains, it is certainly our duty to let the people know that this is a Parliament and not a registering body to validate decrees passed by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>The whole series of legislative proposals, in regard to taxation and otherwise, that have been brought in here within the last couple of years would appear to regard this Parliament as being merely a registration body.  We object to that.  We are not going to stand for that.  If there is no other Party in this country to make a stand for the independence of the Chair, we shall do it.  We have some right to do it, because we have done it before and we made no apologies for it before.  We did not say, as was said by a Minister here to-day, that if anybody should put down a motion of censure on the Chair, it was the Government Party, because the occupant of the Chair leaned more in the opposite direction than he did in theirs.  It is time for us, having shaken off the chains that bound us for so long, to remember that we are in a free country, that we should not always posture and exhibit the slave mind, just as if there was somebody still interfering with us, in our activities in connection with Parliamentary institutions.  It is a matter of sincere regret to us that a motion of this kind has to appear on the Order Paper.  It is a matter of still further regret that in connection with this motion we should have had a speech from the Leader of the Labour Party, who was not present on the occasion.  He knew nothing about it except what he read in the newspapers, heard from somebody or read in the Dáil Debates.</P>

      <P>I am not saying any such thing.  I am saying that I did not hear him say that.  Furthermore, I will say that I did not see him that night. We are not making any <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal for minority rights. We fought for our minority rights against bigger odds than this Government, and we were able to secure them and maintain them.  We are making a case for this motion because we desire to maintain some vestige of respectability about this Parliament and to maintain the authority of the Chair in this House.  We are objecting to the Chair being persuaded outside this House regarding a question of urgency that did not arise.  We object to the deceit that was practised on the House on that Friday morning.  We say that if a responsible Minister states in this House on a Friday morning that the House will adjourn on that evening until Tuesday, no person or no majority in the House has the right after <Col N="877" /> that statement is made to alter that arrangement.  That may be an extravagant view to take.</P>

      <P>It may be, but I would like to hear it urged and developed that it is an extravagant view.  There can be no method of conducting public business if such deceit is to operate.  If the arrangement made that morning was not meant to leave the House under the impression that it would adjourn until Tuesday at 3 o'clock, we should hear what it was meant to do.  Taking the matter on another basis altogether, the House had met that week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 3 p.m.  On Friday it met at 10.30 a.m. and sat until 12 midnight.  The motion that it should sit again next day was handed in and the decision taken at 11.30 that night.  That decision was not rendered necessary by reason of the 21 days' interval.  I am quite prepared to admit that the Ministry had overlooked the necessity of getting the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Bill through all its stages on the day previous, but if they wanted the Finance Bill, they had Tuesday for putting it through.  They could have put it through quite easily on Tuesday, and they would have all the time on Wednesday for considering amendments on the Report Stage.  It would still be in time, allowing for the 21 days, on Thursday.  Therefore, the question of urgency did not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all these proceedings the one thing outstanding is the statement of the Minister on Friday morning that this House would adjourn until Tuesday at 3 o'clock, and the statement afterwards that no such order was made.  Not even the Chair, in all the circumstances, could justify any departure from that order.  An unreasonable attitude was taken up by the Government in regard to all this business. The disturbance, if any, was a very mild disturbance in all the circumstances, considering, firstly, the deceit, secondly, the case that was made for it, which was no case at all, and thirdly, the fact that the House had <Col N="878" /> done its duty all through that week.  It was unreasonable, and it was not in the interest of public business, to ask the House to sit again on Saturday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that Deputy O'Sullivan's speech was&mdash;I do not think I can use a less strong word&mdash;the most hypocritical speech that could be made on this motion. I have got to change my mind after hearing Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Opposition.  He comes in here and lectures this House on respectability. He was present for the last fortnight in this House when certain Deputies gave exhibitions&mdash;I only read of them in the newspapers&mdash;of disorder that were unprecedented in the history of this House and there have been some violent scenes in the history of this institution.  I do not think that in the history of the institution there was ever such disorder and disrespect, and in particular disrespect to the Chair organised and displayed by the Opposition, as was shown by the Party under the leadership of Deputy Cosgrave during the last few weeks.  Then he talks about wanting to maintain a vestige of respectability around this institution.  He had better lecture his own Party, lecture them on respect for the Chair, show a good example in sincerity to his own Party, and not give us the type of lecture, with the tongue in the cheek to which we have just listened.  It comes badly from him, remembering the disorderly Party, he has led in the past few weeks.  I speak with particular reference to some of the leaders of his Party.  There has been vituperation, abuse, vile abuse and scurrility without equal, poured out in this House and inferentially on the Chair itself by some of the leaders of Deputy Cosgrave's Party, some of the front bench members.  Nothing that ever happened in this House has done more to bring the institution into disrespect than these incidents.  Deputy Cosgrave knows, as well as I know, that all that has happened under his leadership during the last few weeks and it is directly and indirectly responsible for the motion put down here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> This is intended to cover up their own disorder and vituperation in this respect.  It is a whitewashing motion put up by members of the Party under the leadership of Deputy Cosgrave.  It was put up in order to try to get somebody among the public to believe that the Party opposite consisted of saints, so far as their conduct in this House is concerned, and that it is the Government, with the assistance of the Ceann Comhairle, who are responsible for the disorder, and to endeavour to attempt, to whatever extent it may be considered in the country, to make people believe that the House and the institutions connected with it have been brought into shame in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised here to-day that there is a complete want of sincerity about this motion.  I think that was evident from the speech of Deputy O'Sullivan.  Some Deputies on the Opposition Benches who followed Deputy O'Sullivan, tried to work themselves up into a state of indignation. They emphasised with heated voice the language they used, and they tried to get themselves to believe, and to get the House to believe that they were sincere in this motion.  In my honest conviction there is not a Deputy in any part of the House who believes that the Ceann Comhairle has been guilty of any unfairness or any injustice to any member of this House. Some of the Opposition speakers said, and it was said from this side of the House, and, of course, it is axiomatic that no Ceann Comhairle could be altogether without fault.  That is true. If we sat here for a whole 12 months and canvassed every member of the House, and eventually, without any Party bias entering into it, put a man into the Chair, he might make mistakes even in the first week of his office.  He might, in the judgment of the House, do an injustice some time or another. That is because whoever would occupy the Chair would be a human being. Probably the present Ceann Comhairle has committed as many faults as any human being might.  I have not much to complain of.  I have been ruled <Col N="880" /> out of order at times by the Chair and, perhaps, I thought I was unjustly ruled out of order.  But that does not matter, but these were the kind of points made by Deputy O'Sullivan. The ex-Leas Cheann Comhairle tried to make a case.  He has knowledge and experience and he tried to make the case that the Chair should not have accepted the motion which he did accept on Friday night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the main motion which is the cause of the trouble.  The motion for the Adjournment could not be put until progress was reported.  Deputy Morrissey admits that the Ceann Comhairle must accept a main motion of that kind.  Any other course would be unprecedented.  The Leader of the Opposition himself not many years ago told the House what the duties of the Ceann Comhairle were, not merely in regard to the rights of minorities.  Not alone, he said, was it the duty of the Ceann Comhairle to regard the rights of minorities, but it was, also, his duty to see that the business was done.  He did not agree that the matter under discussion that day was urgent. Deputy Cosgrave stressed that point and said it was true that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, acting for the Leader of the House read out, when called upon to do so, the Order of Business and stressed the items that were to be got through.  There were several items winding up with the Bill for Widows' and Orphans' Pensions. That business was not got through, and not one half of it was got through, although the House considered that it was necessary to be got through. Any honest person, I think, reading the debate, and seeing the nature of the discussion that went on on the Schedules to the Finance Bill, must admit that there was no serious attempt made to allow the business of the Finance Bill to get through.  It is the duty of the Government to see that business is not obstructed.  There was an attempt to obstruct business. Heat arose because of the attempt to obstruct.  An effort to have the Bill <Col N="881" /> carried over to the following week, so as to further obstruct the business of the Government, was not successful. Language that ought not to be used was used to the Chair by Deputies on the Front Bench opposite.  Deputies opposite got vexed.  I do not know what was in the Ceann Comhairle's mind.  He saw their game, I think, and it did not work.  They got vexed.  Then Deputy McGilligan made a point which his Party did not like and hated to carry out.</P>
      <P>I feel that Deputy Cosgrave believes that the present Ceann Comhairle is as good a man as could be put into the Chair, and is as little likely to be influenced by those sitting on this side of the House, or on any other side of the House, as any man living. Deputy Cosgrave knows that that is true, and he knows that the Ceann Comhairle would not submit to be brow-beaten by anybody.  Deputy Cosgrave knows that.  Yet he gets up, and in a most insincere and hypocritical speech backs up a motion in which he does not believe.  I believe he holds that that motion should not have been put down by his Party at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House, on its part, knows it is true that the Ceann Comhairle has added dignity to this Assembly.  He is an able man, a cultured man, and knows his work and does it fairly and honestly without leaning to one side or the other. Deputy Cosgrave indignantly repudiated craving anything for the minority. I think he is right.  They should not be expected to crave anything.  But they should get justice and I think the House realises that they have got that from the present Ceann Comhairle as well as every other Party has got it.  More they cannot expect, and do not expect, but the condemnation that they propose in this motion is not warranted.  The Ceann Comhairle has done his duty by every Party.  This motion is pure camouflage hypocritically submitted to whitewash the Party opposite who have been guilty of gross misconduct in the last few weeks and done their worst to bring this House into contempt.  No <Col N="882" /> Party could have done more in a short space of time to endeavour to injure whatever credit attaches to this institution.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing Deputy Hogan, ex-Minister for Agriculture, saying once in this House that the majority were damn well right in pushing through any business they wanted. That is the kind of language he usually uses, and that is his mentality. That is not the mentality of the Government and it is not the mentality which the Ceann Comhairle would, at any time, be a party to.  He has treated members of the Government, Cabinet Ministers, in exactly the same way as he has treated every other member of the House, and when they have sought, in their anxiety to get business through&mdash;and some have tried it now and again after listening for 20 hours to a discussion of a motion relating to finance&mdash;to closure discussion, the House has heard the Ceann Comhairle over and over again refuse to be a party to closuring the discussion which he thought necessary.  He has used his discretion.  He is charged by Deputy O'Sullivan and by the Leader of the Opposition with not using his discretion. He has at all times used his discretion, and he used it in regard to this matter, as he always did before, but he did not happen to come down on the side of the Opposition and, therefore, he used no discretion.</P>

The reason why I vote in favour of this motion, and against the Government, is that the President refused to obey the ruling of the Chair and was expelled from this House.  That never occurred in the case of the ex-President, Deputy Cosgrave, and for that reason I will certainly vote for Deputy Cosgrave as against President de Valera.</P>

      <P>Whether this motion is accepted or defeated, it will have this one advantage, that by reason of its being put on the Order Paper it will give the House a chance to pause and think.  There is no doubt whatever that every member of this House <Col N="884" /> appreciates&mdash;and if he does not, he ought to&mdash;the solemn dignity of the Chair, what devolves upon the Chair and the tremendous responsibility which the Chair has to shoulder.  If order in this House breaks down and receives caption lines in the newspapers, not only here but outside this country, a great deal of blame and criticism is escaped by ordinary members and Ministers, but a great deal of blame is levelled at the manner in which the House is conducted.  The criticism is generally levelled by outsiders as to whether the Chair is competent or not, and it is the duty then of everybody in the House, whether Minister, or back bencher like myself, to do all we possibly can to see that the dignity of the Chair is in no way lowered, but that it is raised, if possible.</P>
      <P>Sitting on these benches, I have seen the Chair on numerous occasions make corrections in connection with matters that were out of order and appeals to speakers to keep within order.  I have seen these appeals not receiving the response they should receive, and if I were asked, as an impartial member of this House, and belonging to no Party, where the worst of that has occurred, I am sorry to say that I should have to state that, on the occasions on which I was present it came, in the majority of cases, from responsible Ministers on the Front Bench.  I was here when the Chair called a responsible member of the Government Party to order seven times, and I have seen appeals not being acted on and not being received in a manner which would add to the dignity of the Chair or of the House.</P>

      <P>Wherever the Ceann Comhairle may have gone wrong or wherever he may have been unfair or unjust, I should like, as an humble <Col N="885" /> Deputy of this House, to state that on numerous occasions, there has been sapping and mining going on against him on the majority side of the House, and, through weariness, he has not been able to stand up to the constant pressure that has been exercised by the majority Party in this House.  For that reason&mdash;and I do not believe it can be used as an excuse, but it certainly can be presented as, to some extent, mitigating criticisms of the Chair&mdash;I wish to refer to it.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hold that wherever the Ceann Comhairle has made a mistake, or where he has been unfair or unjust, it was probably due to the fact that, being only human, he was worried by having constantly to deal with interventions by the Party which forms the Government.  If there have been any complaints against this side of the House, I am quite certain we were fair enough to admit our offences.  If this motion does anything it will at least enable us to refer to the Chair, and we can pay our compliments to the occupant of the Chair with dignity. The Chair has to be protected, and, in turn, it protects members.  We ask for the fullest protection of the Chair, because we are a minority Party, and if there is to be partiality shown it should be shown to the minority and not the majority.</P>

      <P>I listened with a good deal of attention to Deputy O'Sullivan and to subsequent speakers up to the time Deputy Norton spoke, when I was absent for some time.  I was anxious to learn to what extent the Ceann Comhairle had sinned last Friday night.  The only evidence I have of the scenes that occurred here is the evidence presented through the agency of the Official Report.  I would not like to <Col N="886" /> give a silent vote on this motion, and, for that reason, I would like to have my position clearly understood.  Personally, I have experienced nothing but courtesy and civility from the occupant of the Chair.  At the same time I hold with Deputy O'Sullivan and the last speaker, that the Ceann Comhairle, and perhaps at times the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, has been driven into a difficult position, much against his better and maturer judgment, by the barrage directed against him, not alone by the back benchers of Fianna Fáil but by some of those who, because of their experience, their training and education should set a better example. Anybody who was in the House for the last couple of weeks and who had to listen to the roaring and bellowing of one Deputy on the opposite benches, and to the deliberately insulting speech made by a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; anybody who had to suffer that humiliating experience would surely feel ashamed of being an Irishman.  On that occasion the Ceann Comhairle called that Parliamentary Secretary to order seven or eight times, and the Ceann Comhairle would not be human&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, let us be clear on this.  This motion refers to the action of the Ceann Comhairle in general, and also on a particular occasion, and it has no reference to the incident the Deputy is referring to; in other words, it is not relevant.</P>

      <P>The date was 5th July. There were numbers of incidents besides the incident of 5th July which have been cumulative in their effects. I think the Deputies who put down this motion were led to do so because of the cumulative effects of various incidents such as the one I have referred to.  It is borne in on me after a relatively long experience in this House that it is a pity some common agreement could not be found between all Parties to elect to the Chair some person who has had no political affiliations with any of the Parties in the House.  That has occurred in other countries, and it is a pity we cannot take a leaf out of the <Col N="887" /> books of some of these countries.  There can be no doubt that the position of the Ceann Comhairle of this House is a political appointment.  I would prefer to be speaking to a motion of no confidence in the Government rather than to be speaking to a motion which concerns the conduct of the Speaker of this House.  I feel the Ceann Comhairle has been merely the agent of the Fianna Fáil Party, the unfortunate agent in this case, translating their policy of hush-hush by means of the closure.  I am aware that even on the occasion referred to in the motion his patience was sorely tried, and perhaps those who most sorely tried his patience were the members of the Government Party.</P>
      <P>Although the main opposition to the closure came from the Opposition Benches, I am sure that some of the other members, those who have even the merest element of fair play, those who have any manliness or decency, will feel inclined to admit that the treatment of the minority Party, for some time back at any rate, was not treatment that might be expected from an institution of this kind, the members of which purport to represent the people of the country.  So long as the appointment of a Speaker in this House is in the hands of a political Party, I fear there will not be that unbiassed view taken by the Chair which we would all desire.  There will not be that impartiality displayed by the Chair that one would associate with older institutions, older in the sense of parliamentary government.  To me it is not an attractive thing to talk of the conduct of the Chair.  I have said that I have experienced nothing but courtesy and civility at the hands of the Chair.  Like the Vice-President, I have been pulled up by the Chair, and I have on occasions found myself aggrieved by the action of the Chair. I believe I was wrongly treated by the Chair on one occasion, but I have always had an inherent regard and respect for the institution of the Chair itself, and I think I hold the record of being the person who has been suspended less often than others.</P>

      <P>There is no intimidation exercised by ex-Ministers as far as I know, because they are not in a position to intimidate.  But the Ministers and some of their back benchers and some of their Parliamentary Secretaries at any rate do come into this House and by every gesture and by every word they utter in this House they seek to antagonise members.  When they, in addition to that, seek to intimidate the Chair, things are becoming very bad.  When that conduct ceases on the part of persons who owe some responsibility to the House, to these institutions and to the people, then we may be in a position to regard the Chair with that respect, almost with the reverence, which we should pay to the Chair of an Irish assembly.</P>

      <P>I am not going to follow the speakers who spoke against this motion, nor will I describe their particular speeches or the spirit that animated them.  But if all they were able to say against the motion is what they said here to-day in this House, there is no reason why they should reject it.  I do not like to call the speech of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs silly talk, nor to characterise the language of the Vice-President when he described the speeches in support of this motion as insincere.  There was no insincerity behind this motion.  It was put down with regret, quite true, but it was put down because we particularly felt that the events specially referred to in the motion are cutting at the roots of <Col N="889" /> parliamentary institutions here.  In any of the speeches against this motion no attempt has been made to deal with that point.  The Vice-President spoke of the conduct of this House during the last three weeks.  The Vice-President was not here at all that time.  He was in Prague, but I suppose he got from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs over the radio the atmosphere which prevailed here.  He spoke of the language used.  He was very careful to refrain from any illustrations of the language he complained of.  I am grateful to Deputy Esmonde that he did quote in answer to the Vice-President one or two of the choice items, one or two of the flowers culled out of the very rich bouquet that Deputy Esmonde referred to.  He could have got many more, as he himself must know, from the members of his Party.  May I point out that no attempt was made&mdash;and that was because they had no interest in the matter&mdash;to deal with the Constitutional issue raised.  Take the action of the Ceann Comhairle, acting under pressure from the Government, starting at 11.30 on Friday night.  Combine that with the ruling that he gave deciding to accept motions without prescribed notice.  Does not that mean that the majority can do what it likes?</P>
      <P>I am quite aware that one of the principal objects of the rules of debate &mdash;the Standing Orders of this House&mdash; is to see that business is done and to see that a decision is come to.  But there is another object as well. Deputies, whether from the Government or the Labour benches, are so obtuse as not to recognise that the principal object does not rule the secondary important object and that is to secure that there is proper and ample discussion.  Because as things are developing in this country unless you have proper, ample and full examination of the proposals in this House you will not be allowed to get it anywhere else.  I think I have referred to that particular tendency and that is why the Chair ought to be most careful in seeing that there is no infringement whatsoever of the rights of the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> If we take the ruling of the Chair it comes to this: at any time a Minister likes he can go to the Ceann Comhairle and say: &ldquo;We agreed at 12 o'clock to-day to adjourn to-night.  We think that after the adjournment at 12 o'clock we should reassemble a quarter of an hour afterwards and at that meeting we propose the following business.&rdquo; Take the two rulings by the Ceann Comhairle on Friday night and on Tuesday.  We are told he had no option.  The Vice-President says he must accept.  That is not so.  He is not bound to do anything of the kind.  I entirely disagree with the Vice-President there.  He has to exercise his discretion and if the Vice-President had followed the debate he would have understood that one of the principal grievances we have against the Ceann Comhairle in this connection is that he refused definitely to exercise his discretion, and threw the responsibility of the question of urgency on the Ministers. That is the reason why we object, that and the very serious Constitutional consequences that followed from these two rulings.  I was challenged because I brought up only a couple of instances.  I deliberately did that.  It was not my business to have all the grievances that we had or imagined we had against the Ceann Comhairle brought up here.  Some of these grievances were quite genuine and well-founded.  In the case of others there was disagreement and I confined myself practically altogether to the events of that evening.  I did so deliberately because as has been pointed out it was the culmination of a pretty long development of these three weeks which the absent Vice-President tells us he observed from Prague.  The Vice-President apparently observed it very carefully.  But we also observed it not at his distance but across the floor of the House.  May I point out to the Vice-President that one sentence to which reference was made has not been quoted fully.  It is no harm to give it in full to the House to show the pressure which was being exercised and which was ultimately successful In the Official Debates we find the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" />&ldquo;Mr. MacEntee: Will you, A Chinn Comhairle, on this the third time I make the request take a motion from me that the question be now put?  If not, I will have to consider my position&mdash;whether I can sit here and listen to these repeated speeches.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the only occupant of the Front Government Bench at that particular moment telling the Ceann Comhairle in no uncertain tones and, I can assure you, in no dulcet tones, that if he did not accept the closure motion from him he would have to consider his position and leave the House.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I think I have made my views clear as to why I strongly object to the action of the Ceann Comhairle in this whole business.  But see the impossible position into which the Government insisted on putting him. I remember an occasion when a Minister fell foul of the Ceann Comhairle, and he had to apologise.  The Dáil adjourned until he apologised. That was not under the present régime.  But what chance had the Ceann Comhairle of resisting a threat of that kind?  He was approached, as we gather now from the Minister for Agriculture, some time after 11 o'clock at night, and told: &ldquo;We want this through; it is urgent.&rdquo;  With all that before him I regret that he gave way.  I regret that he refused to exercise his discretion.  It is because he refused to exercise that discretion which is placed upon him in the House that I think his conduct is censurable.  There were many motions taken.  The closure motion was taken. There was no discussion.  The question of urgency could not be discussed. It may be that there was not time, but who was to blame for that? Surely not the Opposition.  If it was necessary to spring on the House a motion of this kind. in defiance of what was practically an Order of the day, though not technically so, why not at least give time so that the case for urgency could be made to the House?  It apparently was not made to the Ceann Comhairle.  A mere statement was taken as sufficient.  It <Col N="892" /> certainly was not made to the House and no opportunity was given for discussing it.  Is that the proper course in a matter of that kind, which, remember, cuts at the very root of anything like proper parliamentary debate, and gives it into the power of a majority at any moment to decide what will be the next business, and when they will conduct it?  You cannot have business done in that way. Nobody can deny that the Government has the right to do its business, but it must do it with some advertence to the rights of fair play and proper discussion.  It did not do that here.</P>
    <P>I remember an occasion, Sir&mdash;you know I am not particularly given to what I may call <i>tu quoque</i> argument &mdash;when there was a vote of censure, and the question arose of accepting a closure motion after about 20 hours' discussion.  With all respect I think the issue raised on that Friday evening, to anybody who has a sense of constitutional development, which I think those on the Government benches have not and never had, was more important than the position that was then decided after about 20 hours' debate.  This is from the then mover of the motion, as reported in column 1345, vol, 33, No. 4 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Hugh Law, I thought, was rather clever.  He put the proposition that if I were in the Chair as Ceann Comhairle,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say that this is Deputy Fahy speaking, and I perfectly believe this expression of opinion,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which God forbid, for I have no ambition in that direction, and I cannot fancy myself in the position, what would I do?  Well, I say candidly, if I were in that position, as as far as I understood the matter and I had an opportunity to judge it impartially, I would not have allowed the Minister for Finance to move the closure on Friday last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as the rights of Parliament are concerned, I think there was a much more important principle at stake and a more important precedent established on this Friday night which we are now discussing than on that particular <Col N="893" /> Friday night to which that quotation refers.  The Ceann Comhairle, or rather the Vice-President&mdash; they are so fond of usurping your position that I sometimes make a mistake&mdash;spoke of the respect they had for the Chair.  I am not going to repeat what Deputy Esmonde said, but I was not talking without the book, so to speak, when I said what was the view of that Party as to the functions of the Ceann Comhairle, and as to the character of the Ceann Comhairle.  Therefore, I do not expect that any constitutional arguments would have any effect on them.  I am not now going to quote abuses of a previous occupant of the Chair.  It has nothing to do with this debate. What I am going to do is to show their idea of the functions of the Ceann Comhairle.  What Deputy Lemass said then was illustrated by the conduct of the Minister for Finance on the Committee Stage of the Budget, and unfortunately yielded to &mdash;I mean so far as that particular matter is concerned, I am not making any charge of partisanship&mdash;by the Ceann Comhairle.  Here is what Deputy Lemass said and his opinion was not isolated.  I quote it as one of many.  It is reported in column 1275 of the same Volume:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President gave us a brief outline of the powers and duties of the Ceann Comhairle.  He might have added that the Ceann Comhairle is elected to this House as a member of a political Party, and that he is elected to the Chair by a political majority in the House. We have no objection to the Ceann Comhairle acting as a partisan or infringing the rights of the minority, provided that such action is not taken under the cloak of impartiality. If it is to be fairly understood that a member of a political Party, elected to the Chair by a political vote, can utilise the power given to him while in that Chair for the purpose of helping the political Party, of which he is or was a member, then we will be able to conduct the business here with a closer relation to realities than we have been doing heretofore.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> I do not believe that that is the view which the present Ceann Comhairle takes of his position, but I believe it is the view which the Government takes of the Ceann Comhairle's position. I do not believe they have changed in that.  If the long-sighted Vice-President could have clearly seen into this House from Prague, he should have clearly seen that I am perfectly justified in objecting to the way in which they conducted the business of this House through the Ceann Comhairle.  That is their conception of the functions of the Ceann Comhairle. He was a political man and he remains one, and he cannot help it. They have no objection to his being a partisan so long as there is no pretence that he is not.  Can you expect support for this motion from the gentlemen who hold that view?  Can you expect them to have any grasp of the constitutional issues that are at stake in this question?  I can well understand, therefore, the complete failure of their various speakers to deal with the issues that have been raised on this particular occasion.</P>
    <P>We had gibes repeated some 40 times, I should say, between three speakers about insincerity, and so on. I have a vague idea that if you do not use abusive language or do not shout, the Government Party think you are insincere.  That is their only criterion of sincerity.  I know the Deputy Leader of the House holds that view, judging by his actions occasionally, although he is quite gentlemanly on other occasions. As very serious implications follow from the rulings to which I have referred, we hold that there was no excuse for them.  The Ceann Comhairle should have exercised his own judgment and made it clear that he was exercising his own judgment on the question of urgency.  There was no urgency.  That, in fact, was afterwards proved up to the hilt.</P>
    <P>We had really to wait until the Minister for Agriculture spoke to find out the reason for it all.  We thought it was urgency, but I gather that was not so.  What a valuable contribution emerged from the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, who is one of the <Col N="895" /> two Ministers that approached the Ceann Comhairle on this matter! It is the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for this particular business. Apparently, some time about 11 p.m. the Minister for Agriculture, or some other Minister, got it into his head that the Opposition had made up their minds to best the Government on this, and they said: &ldquo;They will not best us.&rdquo;  They went to the Ceann Comhairle and said that this was urgent. That was the only urgency about it&mdash;a sudden determination on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, or his colleague, that the Government would not be bested, and that if the Opposition took up to midnight on the Bill they would have to come back next day again.  It was not a question of urgency.  As is clear from the little contribution of the Minister for Agriculture, it was a question of the Government not being bested.  For that they endangered the whole position of the Ceann Comhairle in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> My objection is that the Chair, unfortunately, accepted that position.  If it is possible for the House to be told at the beginning of business what amounts practically to an Order of the Day, that it will adjourn at 12 o'clock, and if, half an hour before that adjournment, a Minister can go to the Ceann Comhairle and say: &ldquo;We want to begin again at 12.15 to discuss some urgent business,&rdquo; I do not know where the rights of Parliament stand.  It is because no attempt has been made to answer that by any speaker from the Government Benches that we must ask the House to support this motion.  As to whether the particular kind of defence they put up is complimentary to the occupant of the Chair, he is the best judge of that.  Personally, if I were in his position, I should not care for that kind of defence.  From beginning to end, no attempt was made to deal with the serious constitutional issue raised.</P>

      <P>There is this point about it.  The Financial Motion seeks to impose a levy in respect of cattle slaughtered in unregistered premises. The Act, which is being amended, as far as I understand it, made it unlawful to slaughter in unregistered premises.  The whole question as to slaughtering in unregistered premises and the imposition of a levy on it, are very special and different things. Under the previous Act, the levy related to the actual Bill.  This levy seems to be outside the whole scheme of things and seems to have some special significance whereas the Bill itself is to amend an Act one of the principles of which is that it is unlawful to slaughter in unregistered premises.  I think we cannot get the matter clear unless we deal with the two items separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a special section dealing with that question.  That is Section 14 which deals with the levy in respect of cattle slaughtered on unregistered premises.  It would therefore come into the general scheme of the Bill.  However, it is a matter for the House to decide.  I do not want to press my point.

      <P>It is only connected with Section 14.  It is quite true that there are four or five main questions being dealt with in this Bill and that is one of them.  The Financial Motion deals with that section alone, Section 14. I think it would save a considerable amount of time if both were debated together and I do not think that the House would be deprived of an opportunity of coming to a decision separately on both questions at the end.</P>

      <P>This Financial Motion is necessary, as a levy is being imposed under Section 14 of the Bill.  As the House is aware, wherever levies are being imposed, the Second Reading of the Bill must be preceded by a Financial Motion of this kind. It is true, as Deputy Mulcahy has stated, that under the main Act, a person is not legally entitled to carry on the business of slaughtering cattle or sheep for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann unless the slaughter is being done in a registered premises.  The main Act only, however, provided for a penalty on conviction of carrying on slaughter in such premises, and did not provide for a levy at the same time. It is one of the amendments of the main Act that is being made in this amending Bill that in future&mdash;and it is also made retrospective&mdash;where cattle or sheep are slaughtered on unregistered premises, that in addition to the penalties whether inflicted or which might have been inflicted, the levies would be collected at the rate applicable to cattle and sheep slaughtered under registered conditions. It is a simple question: whether there is agreement or not I do not know, but it does not require any long explanation.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be in a position to give us more information as to what he expects to receive in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount is small.  To date it would not be more than a few hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important point.  The basis of last year's Bill was to improve the price of cattle, and for that purpose the Minister proceeded to put a levy upon the butchers.  The levy having been put upon the butchers, it was expected that they would collect it from the consuming people.  This was imposed with a view to collecting money which evidently was not done.  Another question arises, over whether the House should accept this levy proposal now, and it is this: A few hundred <Col N="901" /> pounds are involved in connection with this particular matter, but no one has any idea of what it will cost the State to collect that few hundred pounds.  It may cost the State 50 per cent. of the whole levy.  Officials must be appointed, or officials doing certain work at the moment may have to take up this extra task, and search out those people slaughtering cattle, so that they will pay these levies.  Although not an extensive one, a levy tax ought to be measured by the ultimate cost it is going to entail.  Everyone knows that the easiest tax to collect, although it is regarded as very hard, is the income tax, and the cost of collection is relatively smaller than the collection of 4d. a lb. on tea which may ultimately mean 6d. to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case, if the sum is only a few hundred pounds, we would like to hear a case made for the previous Act.  As we understood from the previous Act, cattle could only be slaughtered in registered premises. Now the Minister has learned that it is not possible under that Act to deal with the problem of having cattle slaughtered in premises not licensed. The easiest way for the Government would be to allow cattle to be slaughtered in premises not registered. During recent years, farmers in a small way slaughtered cattle and sheep, sold them and realised better prices than they would get by selling the animals at the fair.  I expect that it is that type of person that the Minister is trying to get after.  If the sum be negligible we are entitled to know what the cost of collection would be.  The Bill last year was a very extensive one, consisting of nine parts, but there were only two operative items.  One of these was the levy on butchers and the other the distribution of beef.  So far as the remainder were concerned very few inspectors from the Department came along to see that the animal was marked before being sold. There were very few visits from the Minister's inspectors to ensure that the right price was paid.  Here now we have a further imposition.  Surely the House is entitled to know what its ramifications are, apart from what <Col N="902" /> revenue it is going to bring in.  We should be informed what is the actual cost and what are the Minister's reasons for getting after the small number of persons concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. John Flynn Mr. John Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of non-registered premises I would point out to the Minister that so far as rural districts in Kerry and elsewhere are concerned, this system was found to be complicated and people found it difficult to take advantage of it.  I put it to the Minister that there should be some reduction in the levy to these people.  So far as Kerry is concerned, we realise that this levy of 5/- per head in regard to sheep was very detrimental to the producer.  I suggest to the Minister that the matter again be gone into so that the taking off of this 5/- levy should be a first consideration.  It not only affects the County Kerry but it acts in regard to other counties in this way: once people know that the levy is there they do not offer remunerative prices simply because the levy is out of all proportion to the value of the animal in comparison with the grown animal and the better type of sheep.  That is one vital question that affects Kerry. I believe the Minister should go into the matter and thereby assist agriculturists and unfortunate farmers on the mountainside in Kerry who find it impossible to dispose of their animals.</P>

      <P>I want to get this quite clearly, because I think there is confusion.  The question which Deputy Holohan asked, and which I was going to ask, was whether cattle or sheep slaughtered for private use were now subject to the levy, and the answer of the Minister was &ldquo;no,&rdquo; because under the Principal Act he was not liable to the levy.  If the Minister will read Section 14 of this Bill, he will see that the words &ldquo;for sale&rdquo;<Col N="905" /> do not occur.  Sub-section (1) of Section 14 says:</P>
      <P>(1)  Every person who, whether before or after the passing of this Act, slaughters in any premises other than registered premises any cattle or sheep for human consumption in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

What caused <Col N="906" /> the Minister to depart from the original figure of 25/-?  There is another point to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  Under Section 10 the Minister proposes to appear in a new rôle&mdash;the rôle of cattle dealer&mdash;and it is under that Section 10 that the 22/- a cwt. is paid.  Has the Minister made quite sure that the price of 22/- per cwt. will be insisted upon and will in all cases be got?  I do not want to make any suggestions against the persons who may be appointed as inspectors under this section, but is there anything to prevent certain corrupt influences being at work and a person, being only human, going only to his friends?  Under Section 12 very great powers are given to those inspectors to search various premises.</P>

      <P>There are three or four rather major matters dealt with in this amending Bill.  The first is to change from the system of free beef to what might be termed cheap beef.  That change, as a matter of fact, was contemplated from the beginning.  I remember saying on the Second Reading last year that we intended after a few months working of the principal Act to change the system to a contributory basis as soon as we could find out exactly the number of people who would be in receipt of beef and that we would get the Act working smoothly before we asked people to contribute. We felt, if we asked people to contribute at the start, they would be inclined to think they would be entitled to get the beef at that price; but when we were giving it to them on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, if we were not able to meet the requirements they could not have the same complaint against us. That was the principal reason we brought in the free beef first for a trial.  As a matter of fact, it was a scheme that, administratively, worked rather smoothly and there were not very many complaints.</P>
      <P>I think we are in a position now to work on a contributory basis.  Many people have complained, both amongst the Opposition and elsewhere, that it would be better if there was some small payment made for this beef.  First of all, we were told people would appreciate it more and they would feel they were paying perhaps part of the value and that they had a better right to it and would not be regarded as being altogether on relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would bring them back from being paupers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you like to put it that way, but I do not like saying that.  I am outlining the main principles of the Bill first.  The second big feature in this Bill is the amendments which are brought in to try to enforce the minimum <Col N="910" /> price more rigidly than has been done for the last year.  Section 10 will be used in extreme cases.  If it is found that it is impossible to get any particular victualler to pay the minimum price, that he is out to get round the law&mdash;and it is very difficult indeed to frame a law to catch people in some of these cases&mdash;the only remedy left is to say that he must buy from an inspector appointed by the Minister in future at a fixed price.  Another point is that canned beef can be substituted for free beef in certain cases.  There are some districts where it is extremely difficult to get the free beef supply and the reason is that, at the price we are paying for it, it would not be a paying proposition for any butcher to sell the whole beast on this basis.  The victuallers in Dublin who get good prices for the choice cuts can well afford to sell the forequarters and the other parts with the exception of those that are excluded.  We believe they can make the business pay all right.  But it is quite a different matter when we go to an outlying district where there is not very much beef consumed and where the greater part of the beast must be given to recipients.  It is difficult in such cases to make the business pay and it may be necessary to give out the tinned beef instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the big points and, as the Bill is not very long in the hands of Deputies, it would be better if we had a look at it section by section.  The first four sections do not require any definition because they are just merely introductory sections.  Section 5 seeks to amend Section 12 of the principal Act and it looks rather a formidable amendment at first sight, but it is not really so serious as it might appear.  The position there is that the Department of Agriculture have to make an appearance at some District Court in the country and produce evidence from the register.  What is produced is only <i>prima facie</i> evidence and that means that somebody must go from headquarters to prove a document. The change sought here is to make it conclusive evidence, which means that the officer need not necessarily go from headquarters to prove <Col N="911" /> that this document is the document it purports to be.  It is taken to be that document unless it is proved to the contrary.  Our local inspector would appear in court to prove his case.  It is rather expensive to have to send some officer from headquarters to appear in these cases, and it is also, indeed, very inconvenient, because it is difficult to spare officers going on such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that be a departure from the usual precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. As a matter of fact in the principal Act sub-section (3) says &ldquo;that ... under the hand of the officer mentioned ... shall be conclusive evidence.&rdquo;  We are not going any further than making sub-section (2) the same as sub-section (3). At any rate, it cannot be described as a departure from precedent, because the precedent is already in the same section.  Section 6 of the Bill is an amendment of Section 14 of the principal Act.  As the principal Act stands, Section 14 of it deals with the inspection of registered premises and it gives the inspector power to inspect registered premises, the appliances, equipment, etc., and also to inspect all cattle, beef, veal, mutton and lamb in these premises.  It is sought now to include also offals, skin and hides. The object of that is to give the inspector a better opportunity of investigating the number of cattle and sheep that have been slaughtered by the victuallers.  Some of the victuallers know this legislation thoroughly, and if the inspector comes along, not having called in there for two or three weeks previously, and asks the victualler how many animals he has slaughtered he is given the number, but if he tries to verify that number the victualler, as the legislation stands, is entitled to refuse.  This amendment gives the inspector power to see the number of skins, the amount of offals and the number of hides that may be on the premises, and in this way the inspector can verify the figures given to him by the victualler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> Section 7 seeks to amend Section 18 of the principal Act.  It gives the inspector power to examine and inspect the skins, hides and offals.  He is given power to find out any other information that he needs.  It also adds two paragraphs (c) and (d) to the sub-section. These are all in the same direction, giving the inspector power with regard to the inspection of the premises in order to verify the information that the victualler may have given him.</P>

      <P>Some of them are too mean to do that.  Section 8 of this Bill deals with the weighing facilities in registered premises.  Where our inspectors have called in to some premises the registered person gives the number of beasts killed.  He shows his books with the amount of meat sold, and the inspector tots up the two and says that the quantity of meat hanging up is more or less than should be there.  The registered person disputes that, and when he is asked to weigh the meat that is hanging up he says: &ldquo;I have no scales.&rdquo;  This section is to compel the victualler to have scales.  Every victualler in the country had scales until this Act came into operation, but they got rid of the scales in order to evade that question. We want the victuallers to look up those scales and get them back to their places again.  Section 9 gives the inspector power to weigh the meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 requires the registered proprietor to purchase cattle only from the Minister.  That is perhaps one of the principal sections in the Bill.  It is giving the Minister power to serve an order on any registered person that that person must buy his cattle or his sheep in future only from a particular inspector named by the Minister at a minimum price.  The regulations in connection with the minimum prices have been evaded in many ways.  The chief way has been by the third party method.  Before the Principal Act came into operation, butchers were accustomed to go around and buy their cattle off adjoining farmers.  They stopped that, and the majority adopted the practice of buying their cattle from one farmer or dealer, and they paid that one man for the cattle.  This man bought the cattle at any price he was able to get them because he was not compelled to buy at a minimum price as he was not a dealer.  The victualler's books showed our inspector that he had paid a <Col N="914" /> minimum price to a dealer or a farmer who was buying for him.  Whether he paid that price or not was another question, but it is rather suspicious, to say the least of it, that he should have changed his whole method of business since the Principal Act came into force.  He may be acting illegally but as far as our inspectors were concerned they could not make a case against him because the dealer or farmer who sold to these victuallers was always prepared to assert he got the minimum price.  We, however, have our suspicions, and some way must be found to deal with that particular evasion of the Act.  This particular section was suggested by the Consultative Council.  That Consultative Council is composed of victuallers and producers of various kinds of sheep and fat cattle, and at a meeting of that Council it was suggested that this was the best way of dealing with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Suggested by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the suggestion was made to the Minister.  It was suggested by the producers, and every producer present agreed with it.  I do not think that victuallers agreed with it wholeheartedly.  The producers agreed with the suggestion, and I promised to give the matter consideration.  I think it is the most effective method of dealing with that abuse.  It is not proposed, in fact I think it would be impossible, to work this generally all over the country. We are fairly certain that a large number of victuallers are working the Act honestly.  Some of them, as a matter of fact, have complained to the Department that they tried to pay the minimum price as long as they possibly could, but that their competitors were not paying it, and they could not continue to pay it unless everybody did so.  I think that would be true of a large number.  If we could deal with the worst offender in each district, probably we would get them all paying the minimum price without any great trouble, and it would be possible, I take it, for an <Col N="915" /> inspector in an area to deal with two or three or four victuallers on this basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony raised a question there as to whether or not it would be operated fairly.  I am afraid we have to assume, at any rate, that the inspectors will operate it on a fair basis.  We will have to give the inspector, I think, fairly full powers as to the person from whom he will buy a beast for the victualler, while this particular section is operative in reference to any particular victualler.  It would be absolutely impossible to have him directed from headquarters, as to where he should go to buy.  Therefore, I think the inspector will have to have a good deal of discretion as to whom he will buy cattle or sheep from, as the case may be.  Of course, there is no great difficulty in regard to sheep, because no minimum price is fixed, but he will have to have discretion in regard to cattle.  Then, having bought the cattle from the farmer, he would pass them over to the victualler at a fixed price. He would probably have to pay something higher than the ordinary fixed price.  The fixed price will have to be paid to the farmer, and, if there is any expense, of course, the victualler will have to pay that in addition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 and Section 15 are somewhat related.  They deal with restriction of the time of slaughter. We know from experience that our inspectors find it very difficult to call at a victualler's premises in or about the time he might be slaughtering. They have a very good intelligence system in the provincial towns, and as soon as the inspector comes into the town the victuallers get to know of his presence.  If there are, say, four sheep hanging up in a shop, the inspector will invariably find that there were four sheep slaughtered the day before, but not more, as a rule.  Some of them are so very difficult to deal with that it will be necessary that the inspector should be notified of the days and the hours of slaughter.  Section 11 only goes that far&mdash;that is, that they should give 48 hours' notice of the time at which they are going to slaughter. Naturally, if a victualler says that he will slaughter on, say, every Monday and Thursday at 10 o'clock, he need not give any further 48 hours' notice, because that will be held to be his time until further notice is given.  I do not think there will be any great hardship on the victuallers in that way, because as a rule they slaughter on a certain day and at a certain hour.  If they find that they have to slaughter outside that time, I do not think they will have any great difficulty in getting in touch with the inspector and telling him that it is rather urgent that they should slaughter outside that time.  Section 15 makes it illegal to slaughter at certain times.  For instance, they must <Col N="918" /> not slaughter on a Sunday.  We will all agree on that.  Also the Minister may make an order prohibiting slaughtering at any specified time, or during any specified hours.</P>

Others, for instance, have to slaughter on Saturday evenings, at most inconvenient times for the inspector.</P>

      <P>That is a different thing. If an Order is served on a particular victualler he is free to slaughter at any time he likes so long as he gives 48 hours' notice.  On the other hand, Section 15 leaves the initiative with the Minister, rather than with the victualler.  The Minister serves notice on him that he must not slaughter at certain times.</P>

      <Col N="919" /> Section 12 deals with the powers of search for cattle, sheep and so on. It is a long section, but I do not think there will be any difficulty in understanding it.  It gives power to an inspector to inspect the animals and premises and ask questions and get all the information he may require to satisfy himself as to returns and so on.  Section 13 is on a par with a section we dealt with already.  It provides that if the Minister gives a certificate that a certain amount is due, it shall be accepted as sufficient evidence until the contrary is proved. At present we have to send an officer down from headquarters who has actually seen the entry in the register, or account book, or whatever it may be, in order to prove to the court that the document produced is a genuine one.  We are changing that and providing that if a document is sent down under the signature of an authorised officer it must be taken for what it purports to be until the contrary is proved.</P>

All it means is that we need not send an officer to say that the document was sealed by the Minister; that the court will accept that seal as genuine without having it proved. Section 14 is the section we were dealing with on the levy question and deals with cattle and sheep slaughtered on unregistered premises.  I think we have dealt with that sufficiently.  It deals with a small number of people who were unregistered and afterwards became registered.  As the Act at present stands, we are not entitled to take money from them for the cattle and sheep slaughtered before the registration took place.</P>

      <P>It will still be illegal to slaughter on an unregistered premises. If a person slaughters on an unregistered premises, he will have to pay the levy, but he will also be dealt with in the court for committing an offence.  I dealt with Section 15 in connection with Section 11.  Then we come to Section 16.  Section 25 of the principal Act deals with the minimum price and, as the section stands, there is no offence committed unless the person actually <Col N="921" /> buys the cattle below the minimum price.  It often happens when a victualler goes to buy cattle from a farmer that the farmer talks to him after some time about paying the minimum price and then the victualler just sheers off.  In that way farmers who are anxious to bring a victualler to court for not paying the minimum price are deprived of the opportunity, because the victualler does not actually buy.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are unconsciously against the farmers at every opportunity and I am just drawing their attention to it.  I was going on to deal with Section 17.  The change in the wording, regarding the conditions of a manufacturer's licence, is necessitated by the fact that if the Minister himself is in the manufacturing business, he could not revoke the licence unless he suspected himself of having committed an illegality under the Act. That would not be a nice thing for any Minister to have to do and we must change the wording on that account.  Section 18 exempts manufacturers from the provisions of the Act, if that is thought to be necessary. For instance, let us take this new canned meat factory.  It will be necessary to give cattle to the canned meat factory at prices less than the minimum price.  The Minister, of course, may have to pay the minimum price, but the Minister may have to give the cattle to the factory at a loss.  There <Col N="924" /> is no use in trying to collect a levy from them.</P>

      <P>Section 19 deals with the change over from free beef to a contributory scheme.  I do not think it requires any explanation further than that.  As regards Section 20, these amendments look rather difficult and formidable.  There are many amendments, but practically every amendment is concerned with knocking out the words &ldquo;free of charge&rdquo; and putting in the word &ldquo;obtain.&rdquo;  Sections 19 and 20 all lead up to the same point. They deal with the change over and nothing else.  Section 21 gives power to supply canned beef instead of fresh beef wherever it is thought advisable. Section 22 gives power to give contracts for the supply of canned beef. Section 23 deals with the tightening up of the provisions of the principal Act with regard to the supply of beef on vouchers.  There were some evasions there also with which it was somewhat difficult to deal&mdash;where, for instance, a butcher supplied a little less than the correct amount and said to the recipient: &ldquo;We cannot supply beef at this price, but we will give you 4lbs. instead of 5lbs.&rdquo;  We had contemplated the offence of their giving sausages or mutton instead of beef, but we had not contemplated the offence of giving short weight where the recipient agreed to take short weight.  That is being dealt with under the section.</P>

I think I have given a very full account and a very detailed explanation of the amending Bill and shown Deputies the great necessity of this amending legislation.  I am sure Deputies will agree that in order to benefit the farming community, to see first of all that they get the minimum price and also to make the free beef scheme a more permanent scheme perhaps by changing it to a contributory scheme, these things are all necessary and I am sure there will be no opposition to the Bill.</P>

      <P>So far as this Bill would lead to improved prices to the farmer for his cattle, one would like to support it but we had an experience, some of us a rather painful experience, of its predecessor, the original Act.  The attempt to provide stipulated prices, or, indeed, anything near the stipulated prices, under that Act did not succeed.  When the original Act was before the House some of us were not at all hopeful that the price of 22/- per cwt. guaranteed by the Minister would ever reach the farmers.  In practice it turned out to be so.  With some small exceptions on the Dublin market, where on occasion the price of 22/- was paid, the farmer never got that price.  It is common knowledge that in country districts and at the local fairs cattle were openly sold at figures 33 per cent. below the stipulated price.  Cattle were sold openly at 15/- or 16/- a cwt. The Bill does nothing to amend that. There might be a hint that there was collusion between buyers and sellers. There may have been.  I did not see it happen.  I myself was a seller and the only collusion I had was that in attempting to sell my cattle, at the stipulated figure, I did not sell them at all.  We were told at one time that if we would only hold on to our fat cattle for a few months we would get a good price.  I held on up to August and September and up to Christmas, but I did not get that price.  Whether <Col N="927" /> I will be more successful in the second year than in the first, I do not know. I am not a bit more hopeful that this Bill will give me 22/- a cwt. than ever I was.  I do not see any section that will help the farmer to get the full amount.  The provisions in the other were almost as severe.</P>
      <P>Section 10 is rather drastic, I think. Anyway, I think it is undesirable that inspectors should have the power given them under that section.  If I thought it was certain to succeed in getting the farmer a price I would support it.  But, knowing that it will cause serious dislocation in trade, and that it sets up a new principle, in the power given to inspectors, I believe it is rather dangerous.  The inspectors I have in mind are rather decent, respectable men, and most of them know their job.  But I believe there are some inspectors that do not know their jobs as well as men who have worn their teeth at the business. To say that any butcher should be required to purchase in any circumstances, the beasts imposed on him by an inspector is rather a drastic proposal. I do not think it is the Minister's intention to apply this section except in the case of a man known to default and evade the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people deliberately try to block legislation, and evade it, much as one might oppose legislation in this House, one could not say very much for the deliberate evasion of the law.  But if what I have stated is the intention or general purpose of this section I think it should be opposed.  The Minister, in another section, is putting in rather an unnecessary amendment. That is, providing that offals, skins and hides are things that can be examined.  I know the object is to safeguard the inspector in checking, and to see whether the butcher or trader is trying to evade the Act.  If the butcher is mean enough to evade the Act, and is evading it, and is not lawfully selling the number of beasts he kills, he will have brains enough to do away with the skins or offals when the inspector comes to do his checking. If it is to be successful, that section <Col N="928" /> would lead to a duplication of inspectors, and that would be too expensive. As long as the people are human there will be a tendency towards a little evasion of the law, but I do not think the method proposed here will get over it.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the proprietor should give notice of his selling. Under Section 11, the inspector would know what a man is selling, and so the main purpose of the powers given under Section 10 would be unnecessary.  You have all the powers necessary under Section 11 if you can operate it successfully, so that there would not be much need for Section 10. There is a small point in Section 12 to which I would like to draw attention. I do not know whether it is of much account, but it strikes me that it might lead to mistakes or errors.  An inspector is given certain powers as to the examination of cattle and sheep.  He has power to question certain people in charge of the cattle and sheep and to ask them to do certain things.  Sub-section (2) of Section 12 provides that any person who shall do any of the following things, etc., etc., shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £20.  I notice in every other section when the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; is used it is a person in charge of, or having custody or possession of; but in this particular sub-section it means that every person who does any of many things set out shall be liable to be fined.  I am only mentioning that to obviate the possibility that some harmless person who had no connection with cattle or sheep but who, if he did not give a satisfactory answer to the questions put to him, might become liable to the penalty under this section.  I am not legallyminded enough to know whether that particular point of view is correct.  I point it out to show that, at least it seems to me, there is doubt about it.</P>
    <P>A point arises under Section 18 which practically amounts to the subsidisation of the canned meat industry.  To my mind, it really does amount to that.  These particular manufacturers are getting a number of beasts free of levy, and, so far, that amounts to subsidising as against the butcher.  In that particular way, and <Col N="929" /> taken in connection with another section, it makes it particularly harmful inasmuch as these canned factories will be directly competing with butchers in certain ways, that is, in the administration of the free beef scheme.  A later section gives the Minister power to give canned beef in lieu of free beef in certain cases, so that the manufacturers would be directly trading in opposition to the butchers, and the fact that they are allowed to escape the levy means in itself giving them a subsidy.  They have a further subsidy in the fact that, while the butcher is compelled to kill a first-class beast and give the stipulated price for it, in very few cases, as I think the Minister admitted, they will not be required to kill a first-class beast.  They may kill first or second-class stores for canning, so that that is another advantage to them as against the butcher.  I think that section should be reconsidered. It is not advisable that any set of people, whether manufacturers or not, should be given a preference against other traders because that is what it would amount to eventually.</P>
    <P>In the final section, Section 23, the Minister proposes to compel butchers &mdash;and it applies also to the recipients &mdash;to give and accept only the stipulated amount of beef on the voucher. That might be necessary in order to get over the difficulty of giving a lesser quantity than that stated on the voucher, but, in a way, the cure might be as bad as the disease.  Take the case of a country district, where you have one butcher who kills a certain number of cattle on Saturday.  His trade may turn out to be a bit bigger than usual, and when some poor people come in for their free beef on Saturday evening, he has only got a certain amount in his shop and cannot fill all the vouchers.  He may say: &ldquo;I can give you part of it and perhaps give you the rest when I kill again on Monday or Tuesday,&rdquo; or make some such arrangement, but this section now prohibits him from doing that.  It will be a case of the poor recipient coming in on a Saturday to the local butcher's shop, after getting <Col N="930" /> his wages, and being told: &ldquo;I can only give you 4 lbs. because we have only so much beef or mutton in the shop to-night, as we had a big day.&rdquo; He might be a perfectly truthful and honest tradesman, but he is to be prohibited from doing that by this section and there is a danger that the section may, in that way, be harmful to the recipient.  That is the only objection I have to this section.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally gives rather more powers to an inspector than one would like to see in any legislation.  If I had any fear that these powers would be used very drastically or very often, I would have more to say about them, but I do not believe they will.  I believe the Minister is putting in these provisions with the intention of using them only in very exceptional cases. One would like to express the hope that the Bill will be an advance on its predecessor and that the farmer will have some hope of getting something near 22/- a cwt.  I am fearful of it myself, and I think the Bill will require some amendment in committee. The powers in Section 16 rather amuse one.  I pointed out a moment ago that it was very difficult for a farmer to get anything near the stipulated price of his cattle and, in fact, the only thing for which many of us went into the fairs during the last few months was to see whether there was any increase in price or any hope of selling in future.  Half the fun of the fair was in watching the other man making a deal.  The bid, the advance and the split-the-difference helped to keep many a man in merry mood and something was needed to cheer him up, but even that is prohibited now, and we can no longer use the old familiar phrase: &ldquo;Split the difference.&rdquo;  If I ask a man £12 for my beast&mdash;and I would start at £12 if I thought I would get it&mdash;it will be illegal in future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If only to preserve our noted sense of cheerfulness and to leave some of the fun of the fair still existing, I should like to see that section removed.  When there is a little humour left in the world and a little occasion for a display of cheerfulness, it should not be eliminated altogether.</P>
      <P>On the whole, the Bill is an attempt on the Minister's part to remedy difficulties he found in the original Act, but, for my part, I do not see any hope of our being able to enforce anything like the fixed price for the farmers.  The original Bill, when going through the House, appeared to be pretty drastic, so far as the powers it gave to the Minister and the Department are concerned, and in saying that I should like to pay my tribute to the Department's officials.  They did their best to put the Bill into operation, but there are things to do which superhumans would be required.  One of those things is to make butchers and others pay an uneconomic price; and 22/- to the local butcher, when he had to give beef at 4d., was an uneconomic price and he could not do it. The Minister himself rather admitted that in reply to a question on some other section.  He said that there was a difficulty with regard to country districts in that the Dublin butcher was favourably situated because he could sell the dearer parts to good customers, while the country butcher had not got that advantage.  The country butcher, in that way, suffered hardship in being compelled to pay 22/-, and I see a difficulty that, if the Bill is enforced, there will always be a tendency to evade it, if possible.  I believe that, in practice, it will mean that the people in country districts will not get the 22/- fixed in this Bill any more than they got the price fixed in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer once more to the Minister's admission with regard <Col N="932" /> to the Dublin butchers selling the best parts to good customers and giving the rest to voucher holders.  That was rather different from what we were told during the discussion on the original Act.  We were assured, everyone of us, that the best quality beef and mutton was to be given in return for vouchers, and that the man producing a voucher, whether it was free or contributory, as it is now going to be, was entitled to the best.  Now we have it admitted by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting the Minister as saying that, but the trend of the discussion was that the holder of a voucher would be entitled to the better parts.  I would be sorry to see the butchers in Dublin being obliged to fulfil the particular conditions the country butchers are made fulfil.  I know the country butchers are very well looked after by the Department's inspectors.  They are doing their duty very well.  Many butchers have pointed out to me that it is almost impossible to pay 22/- a cwt. and continue to make a working profit.  As long as that is the case there will be men here and there who will try to evade the law. When this happens in one or two instances the effect of it spreads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the principal Act we all found it impossible to get 22/-.  I never wilfully tried to evade the law.  In fact, I was anxious that the Act should be worked and the farmers should get the benefit of it.  The farmers never did get the benefit of it.  It acted against them if anything.  It would be difficult to operate the measure except the farmers could be persuaded to come out in the open and make the dealers and the butchers give the fixed price. The Minister realises the difficulties the farmers are in.  In many areas it is not regarded as an offence for a <Col N="933" /> farmer to take less than the stipulated price.  A good many farmers in bad times, if they cannot get 22/-, will take 20/- and even 17/-.  If the Minister would put himself into the position of a good many needy farmers, he would know that is so.  He would know many a man harrassed for rates and rent and perhaps having to go to the sheriff would be prepared to take 14/- if it was offered to him, and he would not say anything about it either.  I do not believe that in practice it will work out at 22/- for the farmer and in the end this will not be any more successful than the last Act.  It is an attempt on the Minister's part to try to do the impossible.  I, for one, will not vote against it.</P>

      <P>One would think, hearing Deputy Bennett and other Deputies opposite, that this amending legislation was not intended to relieve the producer.  Is it not a well-known fact that butchers throughout the country went all out to evade the regulations, particularly in Dublin, and in a small way in the rural districts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amending legislation will be a boon to the farmers and they will recognise that it is an effort to remedy that state of affairs.  I quite appreciate Deputy Bennett's reference to the fact that farmers were compelled to take less than the minimum price. If the butchers passed on the benefit to the consumers it would not be so bad, but the butchers availed of the conditions prevailing and gave no reduction to the consumers.  The result was that there was wholesale evasion of their responsibilities.  This measure is most welcome in so far as it will go 90 per cent. of the way towards remedying the existing state of affairs. So far as I understand, the farmers are a good deal to blame, because the inspectors in their efforts to remedy abuse of the system urged the farmers to give evidence against some of the butchers.  I cannot say why, but the farmers in any case were reluctant to give evidence and that made it practically <Col N="934" /> impossible for the inspectors to do the work they could have done in remedying the abuses which this legis lation is intended to rectify.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's refer ence to the canning of beef, I would like to urge that the smaller type of store cattle from the Kerry cattle area should be utilised for the Roscrea canning factory.  Great propaganda has been made because of the fact that that type of animal is unsaleable.  It is not the economic war that is the main factor in that respect.  As a result of the operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act passed by the late Government, there were serious reactions in regard to that type of stock.  These cattle have deteriorated because under that legislation the Kerry cattle were scheduled in certain areas, and they have become more or less a stunted type of animal, and are practically unsaleable.  If we never had an economic war that problem would have to be tackled, and any Government in power would have to remedy it. Some appeals were made to the last Government to amend the Live Stock Breeding Act to the extent that it would allow people to revert to the original system which suited these areas, but the then Government did nothing to relieve the unfortunate people.  The position now is that they have those cattle on their hands, and I suggest that they could well be utilised for canning purposes in Roscrea. If such a scheme were put into operation, one of the most difficult problems, in so far as Kerry is concerned, would be solved.  These animals could be disposed of in a similar manner to the uneconomic cows.  In that way the position in Kerry generally would be improved.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of the butchers is concerned, we have had complaints from all over our areas in regard to the working of the system, and we realise that a remedy is long overdue.  The people will appreciate every effort the Minister is making in that direction.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Seán Flynn here this evening <Col N="935" /> is like listening to the &ldquo;heathen Chince.&rdquo;  We heard him talking about the virtues of the butchers of Kerry and comparing them with the terrible butchers of Dublin.  I am afraid Deputy Flynn is speaking like one of the many of that unfortunate class in this country who in order to get one or two breaths of air are prepared to sacrifice other things.  The Deputy is thinking of the unfortunate farmers in the country who cannot get any sort of price for their cattle, and he is taking the mess of pottage, even though that is as far as the proposals in this Bill are concerned, at the cost of opening up an appalling tyranny.  In order to get some small bit of hope for the farmers in the matter of a price for their cattle the Deputy agrees or would be prepared to agree that the Minister should take up with regard to the victualling business in this country the attitude that he will buy the cattle from the farmers himself &mdash; that he alone will buy the cattle when he makes up his mind that he has something to gain by a control over their business and their lives.  Deputy Flinn tells us that there have been serious abuses in Dublin in purchasing cattle under the minimum prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was my hope when he started to speak, but when I heard him ending up by fixing the blame on the Dublin butchers, then I felt that we were to get no more information from him than we got from the Minister. The Minister went through the Bill and treated us to a summary of its various sections.

      <P>There may be Deputies in this House to whom he conveyed a picture as to why it is necessary to take the powers he is seeking but he did not convey it to me.  In November last the Minister, apparently having difficulties about the minimum prices, addressed himself to the exporters and we were told from the Press reports of the meeting that the Secretary of the Department told the exporters that the time had arrived when the cattle exporters must buy their cattle at 25/- a cwt. live weight or else be run out of business.  The Minister's representative told them in explicit language that they would be turned out of business if they did not pay 25/- a cwt. live weight.  He agreed at the time that 25/- a cwt. was hardly a fair price and he agreed that at that price the exporters were going to make nothing out of it; but he conveyed to them that they were going to be run out of business if they did not conform to his line of policy.  We have not heard from the Minister his experiences as to what the developments afterwards were.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister shortly after reduced the price to 22/- a cwt. We have now a Bill here in which the Minister without assembling the butchers and without expounding the situation to them says: &ldquo;We are going to run you out of business, not so much if you do not pay 22/- a cwt. but if you do not pay it in the way in which we expect you to pay it.&rdquo;  The Minister's representative told the exporters at the time that this was now practically the only country in the world where individual exporters were operating in business.  The Minister is apparently going to dictate to the butchers the way in which they are to carry on their business.  His complaint is that where they formerly bought from individual farmers they are now buying through an agent, and he says: &ldquo;Unless you drop the agent and buy from the individual farmers we will step in and make you buy from the Department's inspectors and we will make you pay the Department's inspector more than you would pay the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only complaint that I have seen made in a public and explicit way with regard to the purchasing of cattle under the minimum prices regulations was made at a meeting of the Cork Mental Hospital at the beginning of the year.  The members complained that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was sanctioning contracts for beef at a lower price than the minimum price fixed by the Minister for Agriculture. The line taken up by the chairman of the meeting was: &ldquo;If there are philanthropists amongst our contractors we need not in any way bother our heads about it.&rdquo;  There we had a department of the Government four months after the minimum price regulations were published, sanctioning a contract for beef to the Cork Mental Hospital at a lower price than that fixed by the Minister for Agriculture. <Col N="938" /> The Minister is taking power to put the butchers out of business or to impose on them impossible restrictions. There is a proposal that his inspectors are to be around the premises to seek information with regard to the price, the history, and the pedigree of every sheep and beast on the premises.  This is opening up a new line of Ministerial control with regard to a very important class in the community, and I do not think that any farmer, great as his difficulties may be, should be so influenced by the possibility of what this mess of pottage may be to him, as to be willing to sell to any Department, and particularly to a Department run by the Fianna Fáil Administration, when one considers the spirit of that Administration and its right to interfere with every phase of our manufacturing or commercial life in this particular way.  It seems a most tyrannical abuse of departmental privilege.  There is this other section of the Bill which the Minister says is not giving a hidden subsidy to the Roscrea factory.  The Minister has already loaned £16,000 to the Roscrea factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>I think that if there is any part of it going to be a social service matter, the assistance it gets from the State should be a direct and a calculable assistance.  We should see it in the State accounts.  If there is to be a subsidy to the canning factory it should be a clear and open subsidy.  There can be no reason for the terms of this section except to hide public assistance given to some particular class of institution.  Whether it is a commercial institution, or a social service, we should know what we are spending on it.  The simplest <Col N="939" /> and most honest way to do it is to have the matter brought openly into the Minister's annual Estimate, and our general review of expenditure. As I say, I disapprove entirely of the way in which it is being done. Deputy Bennett says that he would be tempted even to accept those restrictions, and this interference with important trade in the country, in the hope that the farmers may be more sure of getting the 22/-.  I do not think that even the most struggling farmer in the country, when he considers the spirit of the present Administration, should think for a moment of giving the Government these powers, because, when these powers are lightly accepted in respect of one part of our commercial or business life, we are going to have a very definite attempt to force them in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say at the outset that I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, but there are certain sections in it which I think require amendment.  Take, for instance, the securing of the price of 22/- per cwt. for our cattle.  That was a problem which the Minister had in view when he put forward this Bill.  We know that under the last Act which was passed here this 22/- was not secured. Efforts have been made to evade that price.  I do not think the last Bill was supported as it should have been by the different people connected with the sale of cattle.  There is a section in the Bill which gives power to an inspector to buy cattle and sheep for the victuallers.  I do not know whether a big number of the inspectors would have all the necessary qualifications to satisfy many of the victuallers in this country.  I have my doubts about that. Personally, I know only one inspector. He is a good man and knows all about his business, but I do not know what the qualifications of the others may be.  I think they will have their hands full when they are trying to satisfy the butchers as to the sort of animal they will buy for killing.  I think that will lead to a good deal of dissatisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> There is another matter which I should like to refer to in connection with the tinned beef side of the question. Deputy Flynn made references to the Kerry cattle, and said he would be glad if a good many of those cattle could be disposed of in that way.  I know the kind of cattle they have in Kerry; when they have to carry the tax put on them by the British Government it puts any hope of shipping them out of the question.  There are very few cattle in Kerry worth more than the amount of the tax which would be imposed on them when they are sent to England, with the result that they cannot be sold at all.  I know that the price of 22/- would be very far indeed from the cost of production.  I do not see what hardship it would be on the victuallers here in this country to pay 22/- a cwt.  If we had an open market for our cattle the least they would have to pay at the present time would be about 35/- or 36/-.  They are now relieved of having to dispose of some of their beef at 4d. per lb. and are given an opportunity of securing a better price than that.  They should, therefore, be prepared to give a better price for the cattle.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that it will be necessary for the victuallers to have weighing machines to satisfy the inspectors. Of course in every victualler's shop there is a machine that will weigh 30 or 40 lbs., but very few of them have machines capable of weighing half a carcase.  If they have to provide those machines it will mean a very considerable expense to some of the small butchers in the country.  I do not know what can be done to rectify that particular point.  I do not know whether it would be possible for the meat to be cut up into small portions so that it could be weighed on the machines which they have in their shops.</P>
    <P>The manner in which selling is carried on at fairs was also spoken of, I think, by Deputy Bennett.  He thought it would be a pity to have the old system departed from.  I think, whatever the Minister may do in trying to secure 22/- per cwt. for cattle, a certain amount of that bargaining will <Col N="941" /> go on at the fairs and markets.  This 22/- per cwt. does not refer to store cattle; it will refer mostly to fat cattle.  I, too, would be very sorry to see the old method of making a sale at the fairs done away with.  I think it was very satisfactory.  They got themselves into good humour about it, and the transactions finished up satisfactorily for both buyer and seller. There are other sections of the Bill which, I think, will require amendment. What I do say is that it is our duty to give any help we can towards securing the 22/-.  I may say that we are not at all satisfied with that price, but I know that attempts have been made to secure cattle at a lesser price, and that a good deal of cattle were secured at a figure lower than 22/-.</P>
    <P>I have not very much more to say at the present time in connection with the Bill, except to repeat that we ought to give every assistance to the Minister in his intention to secure the 22/- per cwt., although, as I said before, I think it is a terrible price for which to sell fat cattle.  If such a position is to continue, in a very short time there will not be very much cattle in the country to sell at that price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Holohan supporting the principle of this Bill.  I quite agree that the House should give every possible support to the Minister in trying to solve a difficult problem, but I think that the Minister should face up to the realities of that problem.  What is the position? We have more fat cattle than the British quota and the home market can absorb.  The Minister proposes a fixed price for cattle of 22/-, which is a lie on the face of it.  Section 25 (5) of the Principal Act says: &ldquo;When fixing a minimum price under this section the Minister should have regard to the cost of production of the animals to which such price applies.&rdquo;  I am sure Deputy Holohan does not think that 22/- per cwt. has much regard for the cost of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole trouble is <Col N="942" /> that if we have five fat cattle we have only a market for three of them.  How does the fixing of a minimum price relieve that situation?  Personally, if I were in the cattle trade, I would rather take my chance and sell my cattle at any price I could get in order to get them off my hands than get an alleged fancy price for some of them and have the others left on my hands. That is the whole snag.  If the Minister wants to enforce the minimum price there is only one way for him to do it, and that is to grade the cattle and provide depôts where he will take the cattle at 22/- per cwt. or fix a price for the various grades of cattle and let him suffer the loss and the country suffer the loss.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn made a pitiable appeal for Kerry cattle.  Deputy Flynn and the people of Kerry may as well face up to the situation.  They take pride in the fact that at the last election they put five men at the head of the poll belonging to a Party that is responsible for this state of affairs, and Deputy Flynn is one of them. Deputy Flynn got this consideration for the Kerry cattle area &mdash; that while every other part of the Free State has to pay a tax of 4d. per lb. on butter, whether farmer's or creamery butter, the Kerry cattle area is exempted and is getting the advantage of the inflated price of butter, while the other parts of the country are taxed.  If Kerry is such a Republican county it should have repudiated that gesture of the Minister's and say: &ldquo;We have voted for this and we will pay the price and put up with the suffering caused by this; we want no special treatment for our corner of the Free State any more than any other.&rdquo;  Why should they vote for these conditions for themselves and other parts of the country and then want special consideration for themselves?  Is that the patriotism? The Minister says that the price is being evaded.  It has been evaded and, no matter what the Minister may do, it will be evaded.  I do not believe that any man in the country gets the full price, and I question whether Deputy Bennett even is an exception, although he said that he insisted upon getting the full price.</P>

      <P>Every man who has cattle is the victim of conditions, and putting a penalty on men for trying to get out of cattle will not prevent men from getting out of them.  They will find a way for doing it.  I could suggest scores of ways to the Minister that he has not contemplated in this Bill by which people will get out of them. And why should they not?  The Minister should insist upon letting them out. Deputy Mulcahy referred to the statement made last November by the Secretary of the Department of Agricuture in which he told the exporters that they would have to pay the 25/- per cwt. which then obtained.  The Minister was appealed to not to make good the threat of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, but the Minister did make good the threat, with the consequence that the price of Irish cattle went down in the Birkenhead market and Argentine meat was let loose on the British market and fetched a higher price than Irish beef at that time.  Those in the trade appealed to the Minister not to make good that threat, but he did carry out the threat and, as a consequence, the 25/- per cwt., which was the fixed minimum price, had to be reduced to 22/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One solution of the problem is to get a buyer for every beast you produce. Another solution is to get the Government to provide depôts and take the cattle from the farmers at a fixed price.  Another is to shoot all <Col N="944" /> that we do not want.  Any man who would hold on to fat cattle and not sell them, even at 15/- or 16/- per cwt., must have taken leave of his senses. Why should he not let them go for some sort of price?  If he does not turn them into money, what is to be done with them?  I pointed out yesterday that in County Dublin only 411 cattle can be exported out of 5,000 ready for export.  Other counties may not be as badly hit as that; but that is a sufficient example to make the Minister apply it to this Bill and see if this Bill will provide a solution.</P>
    <P>He proposes, where he has a suspicion that a butcher is not paying the fixed price, to tell that butcher: &ldquo;I will not allow you to buy cattle for your trade any longer.  You dare not buy cattle.  I will buy them for you and I will sell them to you and you must sell that beef.&rdquo;  That has all to be done by an inspector.  I do not know what qualifications he may have, but surely a man that may be in a trade all his lifetime would not survive in that trade if he did not understand it?  Some fellow who was not able to build up a trade, who looked for a job last year, who was, perhaps, on the rocks, had no job, and was not able to make a living on his own, is going to be brought in to run a business for the man who did make a living for himself.  The man who is able to climb from the bottom is to be pushed out and the fellow who got a job through political influence, perhaps, in the last 12 months is going to be put in to run that man's business. I never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my life.  He has to buy the cattle.  From whom will he buy them?  Will he buy them from his enemy?  Of course he will!  Is there not a great temptation placed in the way of such a man.  That man is not in a permanent position.  He is a product of the economic war.  He has, if he is fit for his job at all, some little experience of it, but yet the fact that he was looking for such a job shows that that bit of experience he had was not sufficient to enable him to build up a trade of his own.</P>
    <P>What will he say to himself?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" />&ldquo;Make hay while the sun shines.&rdquo; And will the sun not shine! I am sure it will.  It has shone brilliantly in many quarters in the last 12 months.  That is well known, not to the Minister for Agriculture, I am sure, but to everybody in the trade. If the man was found guilty, then there might be something to be said for it, but here is a case where the law provides that a certain act is illegal. Machinery is provided for dealing with that illegality.  Surely that should be quite enough?  This new section goes on the assumption that an illegality is suspected but we cannot prove it.  You say: &ldquo;We suspect a certain butcher of getting round the Act, so we will act on that suspicion and we will take control of his business from him without any proof that he is guilty.&rdquo;  How many people have been strongly suspected of murder? How many people have been strongly suspected of innumerable crimes and yet, when they are tried in court, many of them are found innocent, even though the evidence was sufficiently strong to make the authorities take them into court and charge them with the crime?  Here, without formulating any charge, they are going to take control of the business from the man suspected.  Surely, if there is a strong suspicion, you can watch him, and if you are not fit to watch a man for an offence that you believe he is committing, there is something wrong somewhere.  That whole section should be sufficient to make any honest-minded man turn down the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then there has to be notice given of slaughterings.  A man in these difficult times trying to run a business and pay his way, must be hampered at every twist and turn to give notice of slaughterings and, on the other hand, to take notice of slaughterings.  He cannot run his trade in the way that will suit his business.  He is tied up with restrictions and he must run his business in the way that will suit an inspector.  All for what?  An attempt at the impossible &mdash; to put five cattle into three stalls.  That is the whole object of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>Many of these sections will have to <Col N="946" /> be dealt with very closely in Committee. Under Section 18 the Minister may</P>
    <P>whenever he so thinks proper, by Order (in this section referred to as an exemption Order) made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, exempt all or any specified holders of manufacturing licences from all or any specified provisions of the Principal Act as amended by this Act or of this Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister amplifies that by saying that it will exempt the Minister if he goes in for canning.  The Principal Act provides, I think, that the Minister can give a licence to anybody to go in for the manufacture of meat products.  The way I read that section is that whoever gets a licence is exempted from paying the fixed price for cattle.  This is a back-door out.  I put that position to Deputy Holohan and Deputy Bennett, and I think this is a fair proposal: If they have five cattle, they can sell three out of the five &mdash; you can make that 5,000 or 5,000,000 and 3,000 and 3,000,000 if you like &mdash; at 22/- per cwt. They have two left.  Assuming that everything works out mathematically, these two would be there for the canned industry.  He can give you anything he likes for them.  Do you not think he would be canning you?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are canned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are canned, but we should not subscribe to the canning.  If we are canned by the Minister and his policy, it is bad enough without acquiescing in the canning.  I do not think we should agree to it.  Will he guarantee for the canned industry the full fixed price for the class of beef he will buy for it?  Will he guarantee that he will can &mdash; and it is his funeral to dispose of it &mdash; all the beef that we cannot sell?  If he does that it will be quite easy to work the matter, and the Minister will not want a solitary inspector.  He can put them all out to do some other useful work.  If we are guaranteed 22/6 a cwt. for beef, the Minister can rely upon it that the farmer will insist on getting his price. The Minister need not get any watchdog to look after the butcher in <Col N="947" /> that case; the farmer will do it for him. Guarantee the farmer 22/6 on a 100 per cent. of his meat, and the rest will be easy.  You can pass Acts until you are black in the face, but they will be no use unless there is full consumption for the beef produced here.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if it is still contemplated to make the exporters pay the full minimum price.  Will exporters have committed an offence if they do not pay their 22/6 per cwt. for beef, assuming that price is fixed?  I think both the Act and the Bill are carefully drawn and have stipulated selling to the butcher.  That was my reading of the Principal Act, and I was surprised when I heard last November about Mr. Twomey's dogmatic statement.  I would like the Minister to inform the House if my interpretation of the Principal Act, and this Bill, if it comes into force, is correct: that the exporters will have to pay the full minimum price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are going to other exporters.  And they are not worth anything if they are not tied to the tail or to the horns of bullocks for export.  I think we ought to be clear on this point.  I think the Minister is more or less evading a reply on this question.  The only meaning I take out of his answer is that there will be no obligation on a dealer buying a fat beast in the Dublin market for which there is no export licence.  He can buy him for 15/- a cwt., if he meets somebody willing to sell to him.  I take it that that is the position.  How is that <Col N="948" /> going to help the trade?  According to the Minister's admission there can be no prosecution in that case.  The dealer does not come under the Act at all.</P>
      <P>We have now come to a nice pass. We are allowed another 9,000 odd fat cattle per month.  I have already given the number of fat cattle in the County Dublin for this month and we got licences for the County Dublin to the number of 411.  The position the Free State is in now is that we are sending 9,000 additional fat cattle a month to Britain or Northern Ireland.  The dealer can buy these and we give him licences to get them to Great Britain. He can buy them at any price he likes in Dublin or in other parts of the Free State.  He could go into the Dublin market to-day, or next Thursday, and buy them at 15/- a cwt. if that is the state of the market.  How much better can we expect the state of the market to be when we have in this country about 20,000 cattle for sale this month? I do not think the Minister will contradict that figure.  We have 20,000 and out of that only 9,000 are to go over.  That means that there is over 10,000 of a surplus.  A dealer can buy these cattle at any price he offers and send cheap meat to John Bull in Britain.  If the Dublin butcher buys at that price he may find himself in Mountjoy in a week.  Is not that what the Bill means?  If it is not, I do not know how to read it.  If I do not know how to read it, how else is it to be read?  The Minister leaves no other meaning possible to my mind.  I should be glad if the Minister would explain that matter.  I would be glad to be convinced that even the low price of 22/- which the Minister fixes is the best he can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the least doubt that the Minister is honestly fixing up machinery to get that 22/- per cwt. for the farmer.  I have no doubt the Minister is honest in his intention to get 22/- a cwt. for beef produced by the farmer, but my criticism is that he is attempting the impossible.  Incidentally it is unfair to place conditions and restrictions upon Irish traders and butchers in this country <Col N="949" /> that do not attach to traders outside this country, especially when in trading outside this country they can have the pick of one out of every two beasts they want to buy.  If one of the two beasts is not taken by that dealer there is no one else to take it, and he could get that other beast at any price he chooses to offer.  I would be glad to hear the Minister refute that.  I think the whole scheme, and the whole outlook of the Government in these times of depression of the agricultural industry, is very peculiar.  There is not a single attempt they are making, ostensibly to relieve, that is not accompanied by new taxes in some shape or form.  These taxes or levies are put on ostensibly to help the industry or to try to bridge over a difficulty.  It seems extraordinary to me that those levies find their way into the Exchequer and that in respect of any of them the Exchequer is called upon to abandon, they claim a loss to ordinary revenue.  That was never the intention of the levy, or this House, at least, had no such intention in mind. It was supposed to cover just the expenses of the measure that was being passed through the House.  I know that, since that came to my notice, I felt that any levy intended for the rehabilitation of agriculture should be kept in a separate fund and audited separately for that particular fund and should not be money for the Minister for Finance to use for general revenue purposes.</P>
    <P>I think those would be sufficiently good grounds for opposing this Bill, and I certainly will oppose it, because I can see nothing to recommend it. The Minister has done his best in the circumstances, but, again, it comes back to finding a market.  You cannot fix a price for an article when you have not got the full market for it, unless you destroy a portion of it.  You can do as was done in the prairie wheat districts &mdash; you can burn a certain amount of wheat, or maize, or cotton. Then, you can put up the price, but surely it is ludicrous to talk about fixing a price when you have not a market for all the stuff you have and you expect people to hold that stuff <Col N="950" /> and not to sell it at any price less than the fixed price.  If they cannot sell, will the Minister prevail upon the county councils and on the Land Commission to accept these fat cattle at 22/- a cwt. in payment of Land Commission annuities and local rates? They will not accept them and rate collectors have refused to take cattle, stating that they are no good to them. Yet, if those people attempt to cash those cattle at anything less than a purely fictitious price, for that is all it is in the circumstances, they are breaking the law and rendering themselves liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister, if he cannot get a better quota from Britain that, if he can make any use of canned meat, he should can the surplus. Let him guarantee a price and say: &ldquo;I am prepared to give that.&rdquo; Let him sack all the inspectors and let us have freedom of trade here; let us sell at the fairs and on the markets, at 22/- a cwt., if you like, and let the Minister appoint depôts to which those of us who cannot get that price and who have cattle fat, can drive those cattle and get the 22/- a cwt.  Then, the thing is solved, and I see no other means of solving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very definitely an air of unreality about this debate, and the reason for that is fairly obvious.  It is that there is no one, either on this or the other side of the House, the Minister included, who believes that this Bill is going to achieve its principal object, namely, to secure a guaranteed minimum price for beef sold in the market.  On the very face of it, the Minister, in the Bill itself, confesses that he is not engaged in a genuine endeavour to secure that end.  He states, of course, that his object is to secure that particular price for farmers.  There is a certain number of beef cattle killed here for consumption at home, and there are so many others exported&mdash; and a great number more &mdash; for consumption abroad.  He has the same powers to fix a price for one as he has for the other, and if he definitely wanted to raise the price of all, he <Col N="951" /> would begin by raising the price of the greater numbers; that is, those cattle which are for export.</P>
      <P>We have mixed up in this Bill a thing which appears to me to be a real legislative paradox.  We have the Bill ostensibly designed to raise the price of beef &mdash; to make beef dearer&mdash; and, at the tail end of the Bill, we seek to utilise it to distribute cheap beef.  Surely, if any two things are directly opposite, they are &ldquo;dear&rdquo; and &ldquo;cheap,&rdquo; and you cannot achieve both objects at the same time and through the same instrument. The Minister knows very well that he is merely playing with the troubles of the farmers at the moment by introducing a Bill of that kind.  It is merely one of those futile, silly little rear-guard actions that are calculated deliberately to take public attention off the main front of the economic war and the main cause of all these foolish little Bills.  The Minister knows in his heart that, by legislation, he cannot interfere with the laws of supply and demand, and that if the supply is in excess of the demand, no price fixed by any statute will, in fact, apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have pointed out that it does not pay anybody to sell a fraction of their goods at a reasonable price and to leave the main portion unsold, and that if they are business men, they will sell the whole lot, if they can, at a lesser price and make more money by doing so.  As long as the Minister leaves the big, wide-open doorway of an uncontrolled price for the export market, all the policing and amateur detective activity that can be introduced into a country will not govern the price at home.  It has failed abjectly and miserably so far, and it will fail again under this.  The very serious thing, when you look into it, is that you are forcing people &mdash; traders, farmers and others &mdash; by bringing in foolish Bills that cannot possibly be implemented, to become in a mild way law-breakers, and practically every farmer who has spoken with regard to the original Bill, one after the other, <Col N="952" /> has admitted that he breaks the law every day of the week.  The Minister introduces this Bill because, he tells us, his other Bill was scoffed at by all, and that butchers and farmers broke the law.  It is a mistake for a Government to put people in such a position that they break the law daily.</P>
    <P>I believe further that if the Minister really meant business and not propaganda, if he meant to raise prices rather than to raise political propaganda, he would face up to this problem of the supply being in excess of the demand by tackling it at the real centre, at the real heart of things, by trying to get a greater quota, by trying to get increased facilities into an unlimited market.  And, even assuming that he is over-ridden, or bullied, or intimidated by others in that direction, if he were honestly out even to control the prices at home, instead of play-acting about counting sheep-skins hidden under beds and going out into the fields to count the number of lambs, counting the amount of heads and feet lying in the dung-heap at the rear of the butcher's premises &mdash; if he really meant to try to control a price for the cattle and sheep slaughtered at home, he would begin at the beginning in a bold, honest way, and have a public abattoir in every parish, and he would have directly inside that abattoir a census of every beast killed.  That would not cost a fraction of the amount he is frittering away in trade interference, in shadowing traders, both the farmers and the buyers, in searching premises, annoying the lives out of men in business and in private life.</P>
    <P>This is just another of the types of Bills of which we have had too many of late, a mixture of petty tyranny and an unfair interference with a man in his own business.  We are rapidly approaching the point where no man in business in this country can carry on from one hour to the other without having some unskilled, inexpert Government inspector walking in to interfere with his business, to tell him how it should be done or how some Minister considers it should be done.  That is one side of this particular Bill.  We <Col N="953" /> have hordes of these inspectors, clerks, detectives, call them what you will, spotters, informers, harassing the farmer in his sales and the butcher in his purchases.  You are giving them the right to invade a man's business, his land, to count hides and horns and heads, to interfere with his stock, to visit him at any hour and put a whole litany of questions, and if he has not time to answer these questions in a very meek and humble way, that man is reported.</P>
    <P>And what is the result?  The result is that a man who knows nothing about the business is to become the buyer for that businessman.  Is there anyone who could reasonably be expected to carry on any type of business with an unasked-for buyer buying for him, a man who does not understand the business, a man who has no experience in buying the goods which the other man has to sell?  Would it not be more honest to say you will immediately put that man out of business, you will have his licence withdrawn, his premises closed?  There would be something honest and something decent in all that, but this left-handed way of crippling a man in his business, by interfering with him, by taking the power to purchase for his business out of that man's hands, is a state of affairs that should be regarded as intolerable by all Parties in this House.</P>
    <P>What powers are you giving to these poorly-paid people you have appointed &mdash; these inexperienced inspectors, boys, I suppose, or young men previously unemployed, who sat for a competitive examination and got higher marks than perhaps the cattle man who was not so good at geography or arithmetic? You are giving them tyrannical powers, unequalled in any civilised country at the present moment.  You are giving those inexperienced, newly-made, temporary clerks powers practically amounting to life and death over the whole trade of victuallers in this country.  You are giving them powers to close up a man's business.  You are giving them powers merely by report unverified, not proved in court, without any evidence <Col N="954" /> that any legal man would accept, to paralyse and finish a man in his business.  Not only that, but you are giving these poorly-paid people powers to act as the buyers for the highest butchers in the land.  You are giving them absolute discretion as to whom they will buy from and where they will buy.  You are putting temptation in the way of those men that should not be put in the way of any unqualified lowly-paid officer in any State.</P>
    <P>You are throwing open wide to those people the gates that lead to financial corruption.  The Minister must know that human nature has its frailties and that temporary officers previously unemployed, in receipt of wages of a few pounds a week are going, as Deputy Belton said&mdash;some of them at least&mdash;to make hay while the sun shines.  Imagine the temptation you are putting in the way of those men? Imagine the hundreds of people who will come after these lowly-paid officers and say: &ldquo;Look here, if you buy all you want for so-and-so's business from me I will give you a tenner a week.&rdquo;  The Minister is not inexperienced in these matters.  Every one of us has seen the number of temptations that are put in the path of any person dealing with finance or contracts, but particularly the man who is merely buying for another, not for the State, buying for another who in fact, in the Bill, has put himself, as it were, outside the protection of the State.</P>
    <P>That is the one side of it.  Look at the other side.  Let us say they have other weaknesses.  Look at the power you are giving to these men to break an enemy, to get their own back, to get the better of a private feud, to get their own back on a person with whom there is bad blood.  Look at how the life business of a man who may have been 30 or 40 years in a well-established premises is placed absolutely in the hands and at the discretion of a temporary official, with no court of appeal, no regular tribunal before whom charges must be made.  I think the Minister is trying the Dáil rather far and he is trying even the tolerance of his own Party and the obedience of his Party rather far in asking them to <Col N="955" /> pass a Bill containing sections of the kind we have here.  I think such powers should only be sought by any Minister after a very bad state of affairs has, in fact, arisen in the country and, before the Dáil should vote such powers to any Minister, or to the officers of any Minister, the Dáil should be fully satisfied that there is a very serious set of conditions existing in the country.</P>
    <P>In bringing in this Bill did the Minister come before us looking like a man conscious of a sense of responsibility? Did he come before us in the mood of a man who knows that he is going to ask for very terrible powers?  Did he come as a man who knows that he is going to jeopardise the business and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of decent men but that he considers such powers are necessary because of the really appalling conditions existing? Did he make any case?  Did he convince anybody sitting behind him that such awful powers were required by his Department?  Did he even attempt to do it?  He came in here and seemed as if he were asking for a penny postage stamp, giving it little or no attention, telling us that there were certain irregularities.</P>
    <P>And what is the great crime that the people in this country had been guilty of that brings upon all their heads all the clauses in this Bill?  Merely the natural crime and desire to live, a desire to face the laws of supply and demand whether the Minister is facing them or not.  Those men are going to live as best they can and in spite of all the little political wars and political feuds that the Minister and his colleagues may be experts at starting and inefficients at finishing they will go on trying to live as best they can. Does not the Minister know that all this is paltry, that it is a paltry, petty attempt to do the impossible?  If the prices of beef or any other type of live stock in this country or in any other country are to be raised by putting it back even at a world level, it is only when we are in a position to compete with the world level that this can be done, and if the Minister is the least bit perturbed or the least bit concerned <Col N="956" /> he would know the conditions in which these people are trying to carry on.  He would not start trouncing the seats of the butchers' breeches. He would fight the case with the people who jammed the doors in the faces of the Government and he would risk even his own political fortune in an attempt to reopen the arteries of trade for the country.  I believe this Bill should be opposed by everybody in the Dáil because it is a little bit of hollow humbug. It is side-stepping and trying to divest himself and his Government of the responsibility for settling in the only sensible way cattle and beef prices in this country.  It is an attempt to make scapegoats of the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing this Bill to us put it that he could have got better prices only he did not get cooperation from the farmers.  The farmers are getting hammered from abroad, and the responsibility is over there.  The butchers are to be hammered now, and if it were possible to secure conditions in the Bill to do so, the consumers would also now be hammered.  Is it not time that those responsible for creating the mess, took some of the responsibility for cleaning it up?  Anyone with any knowledge of buying and selling in the country would tell the Minister this: that if he appoints one of his paid inspectors to every butcher's shop, to every market and every fair in the country and if he increases the number and appoints one for every farmer in this country, nevertheless the prices that will obtain will be, not the prices fixed by any legislative enactments, but the prices fixed by the common, natural laws of supply and demand.</P>

      <P>I have no other desire but to be helpful in regard to the question of the Bill now before the House. I would like for two reasons to say a few words on it, first, because I have a personal interest in the cattle business, and, secondly, because I represent a constituency which has a very vital interest in the cattle business also.  I can work up no enthusiasm for this Bill.  This Bill is an amending Bill to <Col N="957" /> an Act passed last year.  Yesterday evening, speaking about the Principal Act the Minister made some claims in respect of it.  I am not fond of interjecting; I do not interject interruptions as a rule but I could hardly restrain myself from interjecting when the Minister claimed that the Principal Act brought benefits.  One of the principal benefits he claims that the Principal Act brought was that it got some cattle of ours to the foreign markets. Now I fail to see what we want a Cattle and Sheep Slaughter Bill for in order to send our cattle to the foreign markets.  We all welcome trade with any country that will buy our stock. How is the Principal Act working out? What has been the position of the country under that Act since last winter? I got two licences for what cattle I had.  The rest had to be sold and not a single local butcher wanted them because they had enough already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the spectacle at our fairs, with the Minister's inspectors going around?  We exposed our cattle for sale.  There was nobody there to give us the minimum price of 25/- or even the minimum price of 22/- and our cattle were remaining on our hands unsold.  We had demands from the Government and threats that if we did not pay what was due to the Government they would take extreme measures against us.  What prospect was there of holding the cattle and getting the minimum prices?  The only thing the farmer had to do was to sell the cattle at what he could get for them and he was glad to get it because the cattle would eat their heads off if kept for three months longer.  What were the inspectors to do?  I never saw a man put in a more humiliating position in my life than the inspector in my district.  He attends the local fairs and if he sees two men talking, trying to make a bargain, he runs over and tries to find out what they were doing and what the price is.  I was ashamed of my country and ashamed to stand up and say that I was a representative of the people when one heard men asking: &ldquo;Is this what you are doing in Dublin?  Is this the pass to which you are bringing us?&rdquo; I have <Col N="958" /> no political axe to grind.  I am not speaking for the Opposition and I am not speaking for the Government.  I am speaking for the country and for the main industry of the country and I tell you I was ashamed of the legislation passed in this House and ashamed of the way in which I saw it being worked throughout the country. The principal thing in this Bill, to my mind, is in regard to the prices and the penalties which are being inflicted on the butcher.  I told the Minister last year when the Principal Act was going through that he was attempting an impossible thing.  I do not impute any dishonest motives to the Minister and I have no desire to do so.  I believe he certainly wants to get the farmers a good price for their cattle. As has been pointed out here by other speakers this evening, when we have such a surplus of cattle what is the hope of getting 25/- a cwt. for them or 22/- for them?  There is no attempt made to face the matter in any way it should be faced.  Surely, the Minister does not ask us to believe that 22/- a cwt. for beef is an economic price. But what hope is there of getting it?  I happen to be a member of the Committee of Agriculture for Monaghan, and I try to do my duty in that respect. We invited applications for licences, and on Monday last we met.  What did we find?  Deputy Belton &mdash; he has now left the House &mdash; is complaining about Dublin getting only 411 licences. We had 1,353 applications for licences for fat cattle, cows and bulls.  We got 19 fat cattle licences and 25 licences for cows and bulls.  At that rate what hope is there of getting rid of our surplus.  Where do we see daylight? Where does the Minister think that we can dispose of the cattle.  We never claimed to be a cattle county, but we are a tillage county which raises cattle, and we bring the two things hand in hand.  We can get on three farms the total number of cattle required to fill the number of licences we got.</P>
    <P>We are speaking here of the pains and penalties which will come on those who do not give the minimum price.  Will the Minister put himself <Col N="959" /> in the position of those of us in the country who are trying to carry on? Our overhead expenses are not reduced, and what have we got to meet them?  We have nothing, except what we are selling, and we must sell to somebody.  I suppose some of the members here will say: &ldquo;Why do you not smuggle them?&rdquo; Well, that may be a way out, and I know that such a thing has been done, but surely this House should not be a party to driving the citizens of the country to do illegal things.  What will happen if the victuallers do not pay the minimum price?  We have got accustomed now to State interference; there are licences for most things we have to do. But surely it is going pretty far when, as a previous speaker has pointed out, raw recruits, with very little experience &mdash; I am sure they are the best the Minister could get, and some of the men may be all right in their jobs, but I know some little bit about the cattle business at both ends, and I know that the victualling business is a highly technical one &mdash; are brought in to hand out to a victualler his requirements in cattle.  Surely, that is a backdoor method of putting him out of business.  There is a lifetime's experience behind such a business. Each man has his own particular type of customer to cater for.  Surely, what we are attempting to do in this House is not in accordance with justice or fair play?</P>
    <P>There are other things in connection with this Bill on which one might elaborate, but I do not want to take up the time of the House.  As I say, our experience of the principal Act gives us no enthusiasm for this Bill. The working of the previous Act has been a by-word through the length and breadth of our country.  We have been asked what it has done.  All I know about the working of the other Act is that the butchers have paid £1 for each beast and 5/- for each sheep they killed, and we farmers are not such great fools as not to know that that comes out of the farmer's pocket, because the other man could not afford it.  What have we got in return? <Col N="960" /> Most of the cattle have been sold at 18/- to £1 per cwt. all the year.  In the face of the principal Act, will this remedy it?  I do not see how it can remedy it.  We are surely men of the world.  We are surely men who keep our eyes open when we go out to the markets.  No power that the Minister has, or no power that he takes, can compel a price to be paid for the surplus we have that the market cannot afford.  If there is anything about the principal Act which would be a recommendation for this one, I would vote for it heartily, but my experience of the previous Act would not induce me to do so, and I think I approach most questions like this with an unprejudiced mind.  What I want to do is to get the most out of our industry.  I want to see people who are willing to work, and are working hard, geting a chance to carry on. This Bill does not give them that chance, and, therefore, I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is replying, I hope he will tell us if 22/- is an economic price for beef.  Where is the farmer who can produce beef at that price, and pay his rates?  We are told that there is an organisation against paying rates.  How can they afford to pay them?  Before the 1932 election, when the Fianna Fáil Party was asking the farmer for his support, I happened to hear a Fianna Fáil candidate making a speech.  He said: &ldquo;You farmers of this district have to sell your cattle for 37/- or 38/- per cwt.  It cannot be done.  Put us into power and I will guarantee that we will find markets where you will not have to take less than 50/- per cwt. for your beef cattle.&rdquo;  We have not found that market yet.  Where is the farmer who can produce cattle at 22/- per cwt. and pay his way?  I am sorry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has left the House.  A short time ago he stated in this House that he told the farmers the British market was gone, and gone for ever; that the British farmer was now going to produce all the beef which Britain required: that the British Government was giving a subsidy of 5/- per cwt. <Col N="961" /> on all home fed beef.  That opened a new market for our store cattle. The time for stall feeding in this country has gone.  We have got to change from stall feeding to stores.  The farmer who finishes one fat beast can bring out three cattle in store condition. Surely if he is getting 3/- to 5/- per cwt. more for his store cattle he is not going to make beef?  It is a great mistake for the Minister or for Fianna Fáil to say that the bullock must go.  I remember a great many years ago when we had not many bullocks, and the farmers in my constituency tilled 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of their land.  They got &ldquo;broke&rdquo; on it.  Why?  They had bad seasons, and they got a bad price for their corn.  We are told by Fianna Fáil to till the land and give employment.  A man can till his land for only three or four years without mixed farming. That is all he can do; he must have rotation.  If he grows wheat he must follow with green crops.  There must be farmyard manure if the farmer is going to grow wheat.</P>

As it is, it will be all unmillable this year owing to the wet season.  I hope the Minister will tell us what market he is going to find for the surplus oats.  At present, in his own county, the merchants are fully stocked with last year's oats.</P>

What market is there for the oats crop unless to feed it to bullocks?  As I am not allowed to talk about wheat, I suppose I will have to sit down, but before I sit down I should like to ask how long a farmer can grow wheat and beet and keep his farm in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recognise that this is mere patchwork and interference.  The Minister has, I think, four Cereals Bill to his credit now.  How many Meat Bills is he going to have?  This is an effort to patch up an Act that lamentably failed &mdash; failed according to the Minister's own confession &mdash; and the failure of which could have been seen with a certain amount of foresight on the part of the Minister.  Yet, with that incurable optimism that he has, he comes along and suggests that this is going to work out all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tried in vain, when he had a similar Bill before the House, to point out that human nature was human nature, and that he would have evasions of the law.  But in connection with that particular Bill &mdash; the Butter Bill &mdash; there was a much better chance than there is here.  Yet, notwithstanding the experience he had under the main Act, the Minister, because, from the point of view of the Bill before this, a certain amount of belief in human nature was necessary, professed that belief in human nature. But here to-day he is most pessimistic about human nature.  Everybody was trying to cheat &mdash; they had become most efficient at it.  The victuallers, especially, were particularly adept in that respect.  Yet, these same victuallers who are so adept in side-stepping any law the Minister can enact, apparently have not sufficient foresight to get rid of a few skins of animals which may be used in evidence against them.  Really the simplicity of the Minister is rather astounding.  What is the reason for these drastic powers that he takes?  What is the necessity <Col N="963" /> for this Bill?  Is it not all due to the determined failure of the Minister to face the real facts of the situation; that he will not realise the condition to which he and his Government have brought the cattle trade of this country? That is really the root of the trouble and the Minister will not recognise that.</P>
    <P>What is he trying to do in this Bill? We have had it from practically everybody who has spoken, men with first-hand knowledge, whether they damned the Bill with faint praise or rejected it outright, that the Minister is trying to compel victuallers to give what is to them an uneconomic price; while the price to the farmers is also an uneconomic one.  Under present conditions it is uneconomic for the victuallers to pay that price, while the price is also too low to pay the farmer. That is really the difficulty which the Minister has to face and that he is not facing.  He is trying to do it by these inquisitorial methods which he has now got so used to that he can quote them as precedents.  If objection is made here that certain things are new he says: &ldquo;Oh no, we have precedents for them in the Principal Act.&rdquo;  That is the line taken up by the Minister.  He does not see that no matter what powers he gets, no matter how drastic in theory, or in words, or in enactment the powers that he gets are, as long as the facts are fighting against him he cannot enforce them.</P>
    <P>If there is a surplus of cattle in the country people will sell at less than the fixed price, and the victualler will pay less.  He urges that to give the minimum price would not pay him, and nothing that the Minister can do can prevent that.  He may have a few spectacular prosecutions, but they will not stop it.  How will he prove it; how can anybody prove it in a satisfactory manner?  If there is a transaction between two men to which nobody else is a witness, how can there be satisfactory proof of that?  It is a case of one statement against another.  Does he think that farmers would combine to make a case against <Col N="964" /> the local victualler who, like themselves, has evaded the law; that they will combine to ruin him, though in reality he comes to their assistance in enabling them to get rid of cattle which, otherwise, they might not be able to get rid of?  Look at the tremendous powers that he gives into the hands of an individual.  He can pick out any persons against whom the Minister confesses no charge can be brought; people who, according to the Minister, are so clever that the Department have to draft a section so that the law may be applicable to them.  He is going to give powers which may break these men in their business. These are the powers which he takes in particular sections in this Bill.  I am sure the powers are bad.  They are inherently unsound and unjust and will not have the effect which is aimed at.</P>
    <P>These are the general remarks I have to make on the Bill.  On the Money Resolution for this Bill, the Minister answered one or two questions I asked, but there are still one or two things that I am not quite clear about.  There is the section which changes the words <i>prima facie</i> to &ldquo;conclusive.&rdquo;  Where is there, in the amended Act, any indication that &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; does mean conclusive, that is, that it cannot be rebutted by further evidence?  The Minister in his explanation put in the words &ldquo;until further evidence is adduced&rdquo; but I do not think that is in the Act as amended.  I should like the Minister to look into that particular point.  We have then all the attempts that he makes, I think in Section 11, to get at people who are bargaining but surely they will be cute enough not to commit themselves until the thing is fixed.  People who are supposed to be as clever as the Minister alleged these men are, are not going to be caught that way.  These are however Committee points and I do not wish to detain the House with them now.</P>
    <P>There is the main objection that the powers given in the Bill will prove useless as I believe.  These Draconian powers are given into the hands of inspectors.  They are supposed even to <Col N="965" /> act as scales or weighing machines on occasions.  The point was put to the Minister that there may be cases where there are no weighing machines available and he was asked who was to decide what the weight of the animal is.  He replied: &ldquo;The inspector.&rdquo; Will an inspector attend all those fairs?  Will he be prepared to estimate the weight of each beast sold or how is he to act as substitute for the scales?  I pass away from the question as to whether he has the authority to substitute for the weighing machine. Even where he has, considering all the inquisitorial and very stringent powers with which the Minister now invests these inspectors, does he still believe that the same number of wholetime inspectors as he has at present will be able to do the work?  He is greatly increasing their work and he must increase their number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much desire to speak at this late hour, but there are a few features of this Bill which I cannot allow to pass without comment.  The Bill proposes to do three things.  The first of these is to put an end to the free beef system. As a matter of fact that is one of the main things which it proposes to do. With regard to the minimum price, we have had that system in operation already.  It has been tried under the original Act and it is admitted that it was a fiasco.  What power is there given in this Bill to remedy that state of affairs?  Section 16 states that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Principal Act is hereby amended as follows, that is to say, (a) by the insertion therein after the word &ldquo;buy&rdquo; in sub-section (2) thereof, of the words &ldquo;or offer or agree or contract to buy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to say, that if a butcher, a registered proprietor of victualling premises, buys or offers or agree or contracts to buy at a certain price, he is guilty of an offence.  Does it occur to the Minister how that is going to be evaded?  Does he not see the weakness of that immediately?  Does he not see immediately how they are going to get round that provision and that it does not strengthen his original <Col N="966" /> section one iota?  That provision is utterly useless.  Deputy Belton and Deputy Haslett have pointed out here that the law of supply and demand will prevail but the Minister says: &ldquo;I have inserted that there and I will stand by it.&rdquo;  Very well, let the Minister go on and try it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I say that this thing is so much waste paper.  You are wasting the time of the country in trying to do it.  What is the object of this Bill?  Is the main object of the Bill to make money out of what is called free beef?  The butchers are going to get 4d. per lb.  Take a constituency like mine.  All the beef sold there must be sold on voucher in the main.  Prime heifer and bullock beef will have to be sold at 4d. per lb. What is going to be the consequence of that?  The Minister knows quite well that a butcher could not buy cattle at 22/- per cwt. live weight and sell at 4d. per lb.  It cannot be done. As a matter of fact I think every Deputy from my constituency received a letter this week intimating that there had been a meeting of the butchers of the county and that they had made up their minds to refuse to supply any more beef on vouchers.  I do not know how they will put that into effect but they say that they cannot do it unless the Minister increases the price of beef to them.  I should like to know if he is going to do that.  I think he will agree that no butcher could buy an entire beast at 22/- per cwt. live weight, and sell it at 4d. per lb.  The recipients of the beef are now to get it on a contributory basis.  The butcher is only going to get 4d. per lb., and he must also pay the Minister £1 levy.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he intends to use this Bill merely as an instrument to collect further taxation for the Minister <Col N="967" /> for Finance.  I suggest that we are wasting time in discussing that part of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the next part of the Bill, power is given to an inspector to do everything in regard to butchers that would make life impossible for any human being. The inspector can go into a butcher's shop and say to him: &ldquo;Take down half of that beast there and weigh it.&rdquo; If the butcher is not as strong a man as the Minister the inspector can say to him: &ldquo;Cut it up in small quantities and weigh it in small quantities.&rdquo;  This may occur on the day that the animal is killed or after it has been killed a few days.  It may be killed on Wednesday, but it may not be wanted for cutting up until <Col N="968" /> Saturday.  Must the butcher cut it up immediately on demand or is he guilty of an offence if he is physically incapable of taking down the beast and putting it on the scales?  Having got it down, if he has no help, how is he going to get it up again?  I think it will be imperative on him to provide scales to weigh large chunks of beef. Why should he be asked to do that? He is supposed to pay 22/- per cwt. live weight for beef and if he does not do that or if he is suspected by an inspector of not doing that, he is deemed to be guilty of an offence.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate accordingly adjourned.</P>
