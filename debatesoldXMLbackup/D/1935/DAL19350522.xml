    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear to the House&mdash;I am sorry we were not able to convince the Minister on the matter&mdash;that we have two principal objections to this Bill.  We think that the Minister could have helped the dairying industry without having to encounter those objections.  Those objections were voiced during the previous stages of this Bill.  Unfortunately, they were not met, and, therefore, we find the Bill, in some of its provisions, exceedingly objectionable at the moment.  I say there are two objections, but they really hang together.  One is the levy on farmers' butter, and the other is the rather drastic powers of inspection which the Minister has or thinks he has under the Bill as it now stands. These two objections hang together because I am convinced that had he dropped the particular method of financing the dairying industry by means of this levy the very objectionable powers of inspection that he has in the Bill would not have been necessary. Again and again, during the debate on these two matters, the Minister was challenged to put up some kind of defence for this method of financing dairy produce in this country.  He was asked what precise advantages the levy system had over the paying of the amount of the levy out of the Central Fund, out of the ordinary tax, in other words.  I think it was common property, and I think there was full agreement on every side of the House, and the Minister did not dispute it, that in reality the levy is a tax quite as much as the sugar tax, the beer tax, the tobacco tax, or any other tax.  It is a tax that has to be paid by the people and by them alone, paid fully, I cannot say in what proportions, by the consumer of butter and by the producer of butter.  Different views may prevail as to the exact proportion in which each of these two classes will bear the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that a certain amount will fall on the producer&mdash; the farmer&mdash;a great deal more, I fear, than the Minister is inclined to allow.  It is quite as much a burden and quite as much a tax on the <Col N="1451" /> people as if he had taken straight out of the Central Fund the requisite amount of money.  Furthermore, he could have done that, and all the objections that have been raised against farmers' butter being subject to this levy and the bad effect it will have on the sale of farmers' butter would have been overcome.  The Minister has not shown that it would cost more.  In fact, it would cost somewhat less, because it seems to me he would require fewer officials to carry out the administration of an Act so financed than the particular measure he now intends to put into operation.  I see only one reason that could appeal to the Government for the adoption of this particular method of financing the dairying industry and it is this: it conceals from the general public the fact that a tax is being paid.  They will feel it in their domestic budget and they will feel it in their expenses, but when the year brings around the annual consideration of the running expenses of this State that particular tax will not appear in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance; he will not have to mention it in his Budget Statement and, as a corollary to that, the number of officials that the Ministry will create under this and other measures like it will not have to appear.  They will be paid by the producer and the consumer, but they need not appear in the annual Estimates. That concealment of taxation, that concealment of the creation of officials all over the country, will assuredly arouse the indignation of the farmers.  That concealment will take place so far as it can be managed owing to this particular method of financing.</P>
    <P>In that connection I might mention another consideration.  There is a great deal of talk, even from the Labour Benches, especially when Deputies there get indignant against other political Parties or even against the other branch of their own Party, about Parliamentary institutions and the necessity to uphold them.  One of the most important things that a popularly elected Chamber can do is <Col N="1452" /> to keep a strict control on State finances and on taxation, and yet this Bill and other Acts that have been passed are outstanding examples of a bad practice in this respect.  What is happening?  Considerable sums of money are withdrawn altogether from the examination of this House.  They cannot be examined and when the time to consider the Budget comes around they do not appear.  Millions in the way of taxes are being imposed on the people as a result of this and other legislation like it and there is no ordinary opportunity given in the annual discussion on the finances of the country to have the matter fully examined.  This House is losing control over the taxation of the country, and for what?  The Minister says it is an easy matter to ask that the financing of this industry should be paid out of the general taxes.  He is paying it out of taxes anyhow.  All he does is to pretend he is not doing it by calling the tax a levy.</P>
    <P>We saw how the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, grasped at that particular method of cutting down the picture of the total sums.  He mentioned £250,000 that he was taking out of the Budget statement, but it was quite clear that he was not taking that £250,000 off the shoulders of the taxpayers&mdash;they were to pay it as a levy on wheat. It is the same with the Minister's methods in this Bill.  The Minister was asked to show the advantages of this particular method of taxation over other systems.  It is quite clear from certain clauses in this Bill, and from certain nominal concessions that the Minister seemed to make the last day, that this must be looked upon by the farmers who produce the butter as a burden.  The concession which the Minister seemed to make to a large portion of Kerry is in itself an admission that otherwise the Bill is a burden.  He refrains, quite rightly, from putting this burden on that particular portion of Ireland, because it has been so hard hit by the policy of the Government in connection with the cattle industry.  On the last day he increased the figure of 5 to 10 lbs. in the Bill in respect of the amount of butter that could be sold without being <Col N="1453" /> registered, under a special licence.  It was merely a nominal concession, because the Minister can vary that figure up or down.  But the fact that he made a concession of that kind to what he called the more deserving class, the small farmer&mdash;that was his own phrase&mdash;is proof that even in his mind the Bill will put a burden on the farmers.  There were several other remarks running through his defence of this Bill, and several remarks from Deputies on the benches behind him, which have a particular significance. The Minister said that when we were taxing people who sent their butter to creameries it was only just to tax those who were escaping&mdash;he thus admits he is imposing a burden. There is not the slightest doubt that the fears widely entertained in the country by members of all Parties, by supporters of the Minister quite as well as by anybody else, are well grounded.  Why else should we have some of his staunchest supporters in Kerry protesting, and vigorously protesting, against this Bill, if it is to be the advantage to the farmer that the Minister suggests?  Why is it that even his own followers are denouncing it?  Does he accuse his own followers of wishing to make Party capital out of it?  If he accuses us of wishing to make Party capital out of it, let him ask himself how could we attempt to do so unless we thought that it was a burden and that the people would feel it to be so.</P>
    <P>As I say, the main objection that we have is the damage that we feel that this particular Bill, which deals with farmers' butter, will do to what the Minister admits is a necessary industry in many parts of this country, especially where they have not creameries.  I do not see how he can escape from the conclusion that, if you put up the price of farmers' butter, you will put it in a worse position from the point of view of competing with creamery butter.  At the present moment, farmers' butter is sold at a price under that of creamery butter.  It has that distinct advantage and, at a time when there is a drive&mdash;I do not say that the <Col N="1454" /> drive has any particular merits; I do not say creamery butter is better, but, none the less, it is admitted that there is such a drive&mdash;in favour of creamery butter I think that, to put the producer of farmers' butter at a disadvantage by increasing the price of that butter in competition with creamery butter, is a practice that, certainly, ought not to get the approval or consent of this House. Furthermore, it is quite clear that you are going to kill, as far as in you lies, what the Minister confessed to be the most remunerative and the best of all forms of butter trading&mdash; that is, where the producer sells directly to the consumer.  I do not see how that practice will continue to work smoothly when this Bill becomes operative.  On the other hand, you will hold out big inducements to something in the nature of smuggling, and, in order to deal with that, you will have to increase the number of officials, and both the consumer and the producer will have to pay for these extra officials, whether these appear in the list of Estimates or not&mdash;hordes of new officials.</P>
    <P>For these reasons we are opposed to the Bill as it stands, especially with regard to the clause dealing with farmers' butter.  We think that any good the Minister intends to do by this Bill could have been equally well done if he had adopted a different method of financing the Bill, and the only reason that I can see as to why he did not adopt that is that the Government wants to conceal from the general public, as far as they possibly can, the amount of taxation it takes to run this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to what the position of consumers of butter in this country is going to be as a result of the passage of this particular Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking yesterday, told us about the very fine price that farmers in this country were getting for their butter.  He did not tell us, however, the reasons for that. The fact is that creamery butter purchased in this country, which is offered for sale on the other side at 10d. per <Col N="1455" /> lb. is being retailed in this country at 1/5 per lb., and that, in order that the farmers may get the price which the Minister talks about, the consumers in this country are taxed to the extent of 7d. per lb., so far as the creamery butter is concerned.  The position, at the moment, is that, so far as great numbers of people in this country are concerned, creamery butter has reached a prohibitive price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I think there is, roughly, about double the quantity of home-made or farmers' butter consumed in this country as compared with creamery butter.  We know that, so far as the workers and the poor are concerned, if they can obtain farmers' butter they prefer it, apart altogether from the question of the difference in price.  They very much prefer it to creamery butter. They say that it is much more economical and that, as the saying is, it goes very much farther.  Of course, there is also the inducement of the difference in price.  When this measure becomes law, however, they will be compelled to pay 4d. per lb. extra for any farmers' butter they may purchase.  That is a very heavy tax on any family, but it is a particularly heavy tax on the working man's family where they probably consume more butter per head of the family than in the case of a family that would be more wealthy.  However, the danger that I see with regard to those heavy taxes upon butter consumers is the danger that either the people will use less butter because of the high price or, perhaps&mdash;what would be almost as bad&mdash;they will be driven away from butter to the purchasing of margarine at a much lower price.  I think that there is a certain danger there.  Let us take the position that they will be forced into when this measure becomes law.  Let us take, for example, what would be a small&mdash;even a very small&mdash;consumption of butter by a household.  Let us assume that they consume 3 lbs. of butter a week; at 1/- per lb. that would be 3/- a week. If this Bill becomes law, that household will have to pay 4/- a week for 3 lbs. of butter.  I think that that is a very serious matter and a serious imposition <Col N="1456" /> on the people of this country.  Coupled with that, you are going to have very heavy expenditure with regard to the machinery which will have to be devised by the Minister's Department to deal with this matter.  There will have to be extra expenditure for the number of inspectors who will have to be appointed to see that the law is complied with, because, I am perfectly satisfied that, unless you have a very good machine and great numbers of inspectors, the compliance with the law will be very slight.  I am satisfied that, even with all the Minister's Department may do, there will be evasion of the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has stated that, apart from the Budget altogether, all these numerous taxes, unfortunately, are leaning particularly heavily on the poorer sections of the community.  We heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce two statements on Monday night when he was concluding a series of speeches from Athlone Broadcasting Station. One statement was that the cost of living had been falling in this country and that it must contine to fall.  How anybody, in the face of the Budget or of this Bill, can say that the cost of living in this country is going still lower, I do not know.  The other statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was that the standard of living had improved and was improving.  It seems to me that, if you are going to make people pay the price of 4 lbs. of butter in order to obtain 3 lbs. of butter, it is hardly improving the standard of living; or they can only use 3 lbs. now where they formerly used 4 lbs. of butter.  It must be remembered that there is only a certain amount of money to be spent by each household, and that amount cannot be exceeded.  To my mind, there is an increase and a very definite increase in the cost of living and I doubt if this measure is going to be any benefit to the creameries, at least not in this form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan after hearing of the manipulation of the levies that have been <Col N="1457" /> imposed not for revenue purposes but for the benefit of a particular industry or section of that industry, and after hearing the Minister for Finance claiming the ownership of those levies and a beneficial interest in them, I certainly will vote against any Bill that is introduced into this House ostensibly to help the industry.  I will vote against any such Bill because I have no confidence, after the revelations over the Budget, that that money which was collected for a specific purpose would be used exclusively for that specific purpose.  It is monstrous that money that should be used to help an industry or a branch of an industry should be diverted to the purposes of general revenue.  If because of new ideas in connection with that industry it becomes necessary to organise it on a new basis, the Minister for Finance becomes a stumbling block to any such reorganisation that may be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is so because of the Exchequer interest he claims that he has in the money levy.  For instance, in the Pigs and Bacon Bill a levy of 10/- per pig was imposed to help the bacon industry.  Nobody in this country thought for a moment or believed for a moment that not one 10/- of that money would go for any purpose except to help the bacon industry.  Notwithstanding that, we had last week the Minister for Finance claiming a beneficial interest in the £250,000 which had been imposed on that industry.  We had that regardless of the fact that the House at the request of the Minister for Agriculture has reorganised the industry and provided for new levies for the purposes of reorganisation.  We have the Minister for Finance informing the House that he reluctantly gave way to the representations made by the Minister for Agriculture.  He said he accepted the principle, but not the abolition of the levy right away?  Why? Was it for the reason for which it was imposed?  Not at all.  It does not matter about that.  But it was to hang on to the money.  Every seller and buyer and dealer in butter has to be registered and to pay a registration fee, and a levy on the butter they sell. All this money is going to be dumped <Col N="1458" /> into the coffers of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is not money that we are considering in this Bill at all.  It is how we will help the butter industry.  Money is an entirely secondary consideration. New ideas may come along.  The Minister may have to change his viewpoints. I have nothing to say against his doing so.  It is a sign he is watching his business and observing the trend of the markets and the trend of production and that he is not afraid to come into this House to suggest a change in his own scheme if he is convinced that owing to the conditions that have arisen or because of having acquired new experience a change should be made.  If the House is going to implement that and to pass legislation for imposing a change, what guarantee has the House that the bulk of the money levied may not be used for revenue purposes?  As Deputy J. M. O'Sullivan rightly said, one cannot find out how much of it has been used for revenue purposes and how much for the industry.  Were I 101 per cent. convinced as to the benefits of this Bill, yet, because of the revelations in the Budget debate about the finances in similar measures already passed, I would vote against it.  I would do so not because of the value of the butter scheme itself, but because the finances would be handled subsequent to this enactment by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill on other counts.  There is one objection especially to this Bill that has not been laboured in this House up to the present. To my knowledge, it has not been mentioned.  I was in the County Louth last Sunday.  Perhaps Louth is the first agricultural county in Ireland.  They produce a great deal of butter there, but there is no creamery in the county.  On last Saturday butter could not be sold in Drogheda market at 8d. per lb.  The butter had to be brought home.  I do not blame the Minister for that.  I do not even, from the butter point of view, blame the economic war for it, though it is clearly a consequence of the economic war.  I blame another point of view for it.  The other point <Col N="1459" /> of view that I consider might have caused it has not been considered by the Minister.  I must say frankly that I did not consider it myself until it was brought under my notice on Sunday last.  I saw clearly the whole position once it was mentioned.  I am sure the House will see it too once it is mentioned here.  It is common knowledge to every Deputy all over the country that there was quite an industry in this country outside the creamery areas in the summer time. People who had a surplus of milk went down to the creamery districts, bought calves there and reared them on their own surplus milk.  Owing to the economic war that business no longer pays.  Never before was there a surplus of butter in Louth.  Now it does not pay to rear the calves.  The people have to choose between throwing out their milk or turning it into butter. They are making butter, but now they have no market for this butter.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill I am afraid the Minister was considering entirely too closely the interests of the few creamery counties and neglecting the interests of the many other counties. What about the County Louth?  I am only mentioning that county as an example, because it was there that this was first brought to my notice.  The same thing prevails in Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon and perhaps Monaghan.  I do not think there is any creamery in the first-named counties.  It was the usual thing for large numbers of dropped calves to be brought up from the creamery counties to the counties where the farmers made their own butter.  These calves from the creamery areas were reared on the surplus milk in the counties I have mentioned, and in a few others as well. That system does not hold now.  The Minister for Agriculture has schemed all the time to bring adequate returns to the creamery counties, ignoring the other counties.  Does not the Minister see that because of the economic war these people are left with surplus butter?  The Minister has taken no steps whatever to help them.  Now he proposes to levy on these people 39/- a cwt. on factory butter.  He recognises <Col N="1460" /> that factory butter is inferior to creamery butter by 9/- a cwt.  I had two amendments down for the Report Stage in this Bill, but I was informed they were not in order for the last stage.  The amendments were dealing with this position that I am going to speak about.  I believe I am right in stating that the central feature of the Minister's scheme is to guarantee for the exporters of butter 102/- per cwt. for creamery butter, and 93/- for factory butter.  On that basis, clearly, the Minister recognises that the public have a preference for creamery butter as against factory butter measured in money to the extent of 9/- per cwt. Clearly it is not fair, even if other things were equal, to put the same levy on butter worth only 93/- as on butter worth 102/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying that everything in the Bill is wrong; but the Bill has got to the stage that it is going through.  In view of that position, I put that argument to the Minister on the ground of fair play for the two kinds of butter concerned.  Is there any reason why the handlers of factory butter in this country should pay the same levy on a commodity that does not fetch as high a price as creamery butter by the margin of 9/-?  I suggest to the Minister to reduce the levy on factory butter by the amount of the difference in quality, if you like, indicated by the price fetched in the same market.  In other words, have a levy on factory butter of 30/- when the levy on creamery butter is 39/-.</P>
    <P>That will help to some extent those areas in which the market for milk heretofore was the rearing of extra suck calves.  That market has been wiped out.  The corresponding market for milk in the creamery districts was for the making of butter.  That market has been seriously damaged; we all admit that.  The Minister wants to aid that market and is endeavouring to do that in this Bill, as he did in previous legislation.  But he may not, under the Bill, aid districts in which the market for milk was the rearing of suck calves, and he should give them a little consideration in the levy.  I can see a certain amount of equity in the levy; but if we are going to deal with <Col N="1461" /> it on the basis of equity, we must have equity all round and consider the value of the product that is being dealt with. That product must be dealt with on an equitable basis.  Therefore, while there is something to be said for the equity of the levy, and the strong case that the Minister made, I suggest to the Minister that those areas where the factory people buy their fresh butter are the areas where they formerly reared suck calves.  I, therefore, suggest that he should give them the advantage of 9/- less in the levy on their butter.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the farmer's butter proper&mdash;those areas where the butter leaves the farmer's premises in a finished condition and is consumed in that form.  In such areas the sale of butter is very often in small quantities. In framing these amendments that were disallowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that he should consider these suggestions when the Bill goes before the Seanad?  Anyway, the objection I have to the Bill in its present form is that the factory people have to pay a uniform levy with the creamery people; also that farmers, who make butter on their own premises and dispose of it in small lots, will have to pay a similar levy to the creamery people.  In view of the fact that they have lost completely the market that existed for their surplus milk heretofore, I consider that, after accepting the principle of the Bill, it would be better if the levy were no more than 2d. per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement made by Deputy Belton that the Bill has reached a certain stage and that it is going through, it is questionable if it is really necessary to have any debate on the Bill at all.  I should like, however, to refer to the statement of Deputy Belton with regard to the levy on farmers' butter, factory butter and creamery butter, and the differential prices which the Minister has stated for creamery butter and factory butter.  I should like to say that it is far more expensive to turn milk into butter in the creameries than it is to turn milk into butter in the farmers' homesteads.  They can do it very much less than it costs the creameries.  In view of that, I do not think that there is really any reason <Col N="1463" /> why the levy on farmers' butter should be a different one from that on creamery butter.  The policy of the Department since its inauguration under the British Government by Sir Horace Plunkett has been to back up the creameries and put down farmers' butter&mdash;at least to turn all the milk into the creameries.  That has been found impossible, although it has gone on for 50 years.  If the farmers got anything like the same assistance from the Department as the creameries have got, I do not think the creameries would be in existence at all.  But the farmers did not get the support of the Department.  It was the creameries got it, and we have arrived at the stage in which we have a tremendous amount of capital sunk in creameries.  Of course, the Department are perfectly right to endeavour to get them going.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have stated that the farmers will have to pay the levy, but Deputy Morrissey said a few moments ago that the consumers will have to pay.  They cannot both pay; only one of them will pay.  He also stated that the price of butter would go up to 1/4 per lb. from 1/- and that poor families who are consuming 3 lbs., of butter a week would have to pay 4/- instead of 3/-.  I do not think that is so either.  I believe what will happen will be that the price will come down to a figure at which butter will be sold with a levy of 4d. per lb.  That will be something about 10d. or 11d. per lb., and that is not a bad price considering international prices.</P>

      <P>We had Deputy Morrissey saying that people prefer farmers' butter to creamery butter.  Some of us do and some do not.  The great bulk of the working classes do not prefer <Col N="1464" /> creamery butter.  I remember 15 or 16 years ago when the food control under the British Government was transferred to the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture compelled us all to keep a certain proportion of our butter for the use of working-class people during the winter.  At the meeting of the Department under Sir Hugh Barrie, who was President at the time, we who packed farmers' butter and also packed factory butter suggested that they should permit us to ship all the factory butter, that there was no market for it in this country, and that we would buy an equivalent quantity of creamery butter to hold for the winter.  We were refused permission and the trade lost hundreds of thousands of pounds as a result.  The Department of Agriculture did not give us any assistance whatever to try to get back from the British Government what we should have got at that time. Having made the mistake they stuck to it and did not give us any help to get the money back from the British Government; and we might have got it back.  So that it is not correct to say that the people prefer farmers' butter. Some of us do, but we prefer it when it is good and fresh.  It certainly is more palatable and appetising than creamery butter when it is good, but it is not always good.</P>
      <P>Last evening, in the Budget debate, Deputy McGovern, speaking of butter, referred to the fact that you could buy butter in Northern Ireland at 6d. per lb. less than you could buy it retail in the shops in the Free State.  It is just as well to recognise the facts of the whole position in this country and in all countries.  There is no country in the world except Great Britain and Northern Ireland where the retail price of butter is not as high and higher than in this country.  So that the working classes or other people are not paying any more for butter here than in Denmark, one of the biggest butter-producing countries which last year shipped 50,000 tons of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Siberian butter is sold at 7½d. in the English market.  There is a good deal of ignorance or pretended ignorance on the part of the Deputies opposite as to what the levy and the bounty are for.  The levy is to create a pool out of which the penal duties can be paid.  The Australian farmers several years ago created what they called the Patterson scheme. They put a voluntary levy on themselves of 1½d. per lb. on all butter manufactured in the country, and out of that they created certain markets. They gave a bounty of 4d. or 4½d. per lb.  The penal duty on our butter at the present time is about 20/- a cwt., a little over 2d. per lb.  The bounty and subsidy paid to farmers last year in the Free State went up to 80/- per cwt., or perhaps a little bit more.  What was the 60/- over and above the 20/- for? It was to help the farmer to continue in his industry and get a price for his milk that would enable him to carry on.  The Opposition is continually pretending <Col N="1466" /> that that extra money does not go to the farmer.  Any levy that is made on the farmer goes back to the industry as a whole.  I do not say it goes to the particular farmers who may be getting an extra price for their butter and who now will have to pay or have deducted from the price they receive for their butter, a levy of 4½d. per lb.  They may not get it back, but the industry as a whole gets it and it helps to make the industry pay where otherwise it could not be carried on. If you had to take the price on the British market to-day and deduct the charges from it, no creamery could pay more than about 2d. per gallon for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there anyone here connected with the farming industry who would say that it would pay him to rear cows, feed them, attend to them, milk them, and get 2d. a gallon for the milk?  Now it is just as well that the people would get very definitely into their heads&mdash;the Opposition might also try to grasp the fact&mdash;that the money which is being taken in the way of levies is going back to the farmers on pretty well all their goods.  Certainly in the case of butter it is going back to the farmers, and they are getting, in addition to that, a good deal of money that is taken from the consumers by charging an extra amount over and above what they have to pay in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  While Great Britain and Northern Ireland have got to pay a considerably lesser price, all the countries in the world&mdash;even Denmark&mdash; have got to create in some form or another some fund by which their farmers can carry on the main industry of all these countries, agriculture.  If they did not create these special funds the agricultural industry in all those countries would go down.  In those circumstances England might be in a very bad position so far as her supplies from other countries are concerned, and probably would not get her butter and other things so cheaply.  As I said when I started, I question whether, in view of the fact that this Bill is going through, it is advisable to say anything on the matter, but it does seem to me that whether the money is a tax, as <Col N="1467" /> Deputy O'Sullivan says, or whether it comes out of the Central Fund, it is going back to the farmers, and in those circumstances I do not consider that the Opposition should have a tremendous lot to say on that point.</P>
    <P>There is just another point which was discussed already on one of the amendments last week, that is the right to search.  I have not seen the Bill, but I believe that in the Butter Stabilisation Bill which was brought in by Deputy Hogan there was some such provision. If there were, I cannot see that there should be any cause on the part of Deputies on that side of the House to kick up such a furore about this right to search, because anybody with any sense will know that it will not be used in any way which will cause trouble to anybody who is not committing a wrong.  Anybody who is, of course, will have to put up with it. The only point which I want to stress again is that the Opposition contend that the farmers pays.  Deputy Morrisey contended that the consumer pays. Well, one or other should pay.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that Deputy Dowdall is not Minister for Agriculture. Mind you, I should like to see him Minister for Agriculture.  It is not the first time that we have had some instance of Deputy Dowdall's honesty in dealing with matters which relate to business or politics.  I remember quite recently reading a statement from him in which he said that as far as tariffs were concerned he was going to make the most of them.  Quite right.  That is exactly what they all do, and there is no use in pretending they do not. Deputy Dowdall comes in to-day and he tells us that the farmers can make <Col N="1468" /> butter at very little cost, and that the costs of the creameries are much greater.  Consequently the man who makes the farmers' butter at home must be taxed in order to make up for the other man.  There is a certain amount of inconsistency about some of the statements made by Deputy Dowdall, or at least if he is not inconsistent it is possible that he is not very well informed on some of the matters.  I am not saying that with regard to butter exactly, but with regard to the creation of a fund out of which the duty would be paid.  We thought that was the case with pigs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowdall tells us we ought to be perfectly satisfied that this levy is all coming back to the farmers and to the butter makers.  We are not.  The Minister for Finance has denied that as far as the pig carcase levy is concerned, it came back to the farmers.  He says he must make that go to the Exchequer until the Pigs Marketing Board is going to give us a levy again in another form.  This artificial forcing up of prices is definitely a bad way to do business, but it is the Government's method of inflicting, if you like, a certain amount of taxation without showing that it is taxation.  My objection to the Bill is that the Minister has not told us&mdash;and I do not think he could very well tell us; I do not think there are any statistics which would show it&mdash;what is the relative amount of butter manufactured in the farmers' homes and in the creameries.  I do not think we can get that, nor the amount which is consumed at home, but there is, of course, no doubt that the amount of farmers' butter exported is very small in comparsion with the amount of creamery butter.  I have here a publication issued this year by the Department of Industry and Commerce, Agricultural Statistics, 1927 and 1933.  It shows the numbers of cows supplying milk to creameries, and the numbers not supplying milk to creameries.  There are only ten counties which are creamery counties.  In five of those the number of cows supplying milk to the creameries is in excess of the number not supplying milk to the creameries. In the other five the majority of cows are not supplying milk to creameries, but the numbers are pretty level.  The <Col N="1470" /> remaining counties all over the country &mdash;the other 16&mdash;have no creameries at all.  We have in the Saorstát, according to those figures, 702,000 cows not supplying milk to creameries, and 519,000 cows supplying milk to creameries.  As a matter of fact, we have 50 per cent. more cows not supplying milk to creameries.</P>
      <P>My case is that this levy upon farmers' butter is to assist the creamery districts.  I maintain that it is unfair and inequitable.  In districts other than creamery districts we have mixed farming, a good deal of tillage. Take the counties of Galway and Roscommon. There are no creameries in Galway to my knowledge, but there are quite a few in Roscommon.  There is in those counties a pretty large business done in farmers' butter, particularly as regards sale to private persons.  The amount of creamery butter sold in those places is very small.  It is manifestly unfair to put a tax on these people, or on a mixed farming industry, in order to benefit other districts.  The effect of this Bill will be largely in keeping with the effect of many measures passed by the present Government.  In my opinion, it will tend to kill thrift and industry and initiative as far as the home is concerned.  It is manifestly unfair to ask a farmer's wife, who has been endeavouring to assist her husband in finding the necessary money to feed and clothe the family and keep things going, to pay 4d. a lb. on the butter she makes at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall said that if the farmer losses the customer cannot also be losing, but he might to the extent of half-and-half and I think that will happen.  There are many people supplying private customers, relatives of their own, probably brothers or sisters, people in a small or a large way of business in the towns and villages, and a farmer's wife in such cases will not like putting on the full levy and, in fact, will not put it on and, in the circumstances, it is quite possible the levy will be shared.  In any case it is unfair and it is going to make for a certain amount of fraud. There is no doubt people will endeavour to evade the law, and they will evade the law, and anything that tends <Col N="1471" /> in that direction is bad business.  I think the Government ought to feel the effects of that type of legislation already.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that some years ago under the previous Administration, when butter was fetching a better price than now, farmers even then did not increase the number of their cows.  The Minister was endeavouring, I think, to lay the blame for that at the doors of the then Administration. It is evident, of course, to any person who troubles to think about the situation, why the farmers did not increase the number of their cows.  The reason was that they made money more easily by feeding calves.  They probably found that so far as the butter market was concerned it was already overstocked and in any case cattle were then a paying proposition and no human being will endeavour to make money out of an industry of any type or kind if he can make it more easily in another way.  That is human nature.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the possibility mentioned by Deputy Belton will arise all over the country&mdash;there will be more farmers' butter than ever before for the reason that people are not rearing calves, the cattle trade being in its present deplorable position because of the effects of the economic war.  I do not think that the Government are treating fairly those farmers, and particularly the smaller farmers, who have been endeavouring to meet their obligations. I do not think those men ought to be regarded as beggars on the threshold of the Department of the Minister for Agriculture when they ask that whatever bounty is to be paid on butter ought to be paid by the Government out of taxation.  Those men have already contributed much more than their quota to taxation.  Since 1933, the Government have been collaring the annuities and putting them into the coffers of the Exchequer.  According to a reply which was given to me in the House, at the beginning of this year the Government had benefited to the extent of £7,100,000 from that source alone.  It almost all represented annuities.</P>

      <P>A portion of the £7,100,000 was composed of grants for county councils.  When the farmers have made that contribution indirectly I think they are entitled to some consideration, and they should not be asked to pay a further levy upon their butter.  I do not agree with Deputy Dowdall that there is in any other Act previous to this a clause which entitles an inspector to go into a house and exercise the same powers as are being given in this Bill.  It is an infringement of the rights and liberties of citizens that farmers and their wives should be open to this type of annoyance. Perhaps those powers may not be carried out in some places as strictly as they might be carried out, but I have a fair idea what inspectors are and everybody knows that you will get types of individuals who will endeavour to satisfy their curiosity by going into houses to find out what is going on.  It is unfair to have that particular section in the Bill.  On the whole, this is rather a mean, cheap way of making either the farmers or the consumers pay something which they ought not to be asked to pay.  If they are entitled to a better price for their butter the Government are getting enough out of the farmers already to increase the existing price without putting on such a levy as this.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the attitude of Deputy Brennan and others who come here pretending to claim that they are speaking for the farmers is, to use Deputy Brennan's own words, mean and contemptible. This Bill endeavours to give the farmers something towards the cost of production.  Deputy Brennan gave us some figures.  He said there were 702,000 cows not supplying milk to creameries and 519,000 cows supplying milk to the creameries.  Is Deputy Brennan prepared to follow that up by showing that all the butter made from the milk of the 702,000 cows was consumed in this country and the butter made from the milk of the 519,000 cows was all exported?  I would like to hear <Col N="1473" /> from Deputy Brennan, since he gives the figures so glibly, what proportion of home-made dairy butter is consumed here and what proportion is exported.  I would like to know what case he can make why the farmer who is lucky enough, on account of the Butter Price Stabilisation Act, to get up to 1/2 and 1/3 a lb. for his butter&mdash;I know farmers getting that&mdash;should not contribute some portion of the 1/2 or the 1/3 to assist his neighbour who has to export his butter and sell it for 8d. or less than 8d.</P>
      <P>Looking at the position for the past few years here, we have seen Deputies over there, who realised the position and who knew the position, absolutely breaking away from the wing of Deputy Brennan and the rest of them, and walking into the Lobby of Fianna Fáil to vote, because they realised that, only for the action of the Government in stabilising the price of butter in this country, there would be no butter here at all.  No man will keep a cow or make butter if he can only get 2d. a gallon for his milk, and that is all that they would get if the Government had not taken action.  Instead of that the price has been bolstered up in this country, and this is the means that has been adopted for bolstering it up, but when it was found that there was a certain proportion of farmers in this country who were getting 1/2 and 1/3 per lb. for their butter, as against other farmers who were only getting 6d. and 7d. per lb., it was thought only fair that the farmers who were being protected to such an extent that they could get 1/2 and 1/3 should contribute something out of that in order to help the farmer who was only getting 6d. and 7d.  That is the meaning of this Bill.  Deputy Brennan, I suppose, says that this proportion of the farmers who are exporting their butter to the English market at the present moment should put up with anything.</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions in Public Gallery.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If their comrades in the Dáil had the same pluck as their dupes in the Gallery, we would do far batter.  However, that is the position that Deputy Brennan wants to endeavour to bolster up here.  I consider that the Bill the <Col N="1474" /> Minister has introduced is the only way of meeting that loophole, and I expected that, when it was introduced here, it would receive the support of every Deputy in the Dáil and that they would not endeavour to turn it into an absolutely Party matter. However, it seems that every Bill that is brought in here has to be turned into a Party matter and that, whether it is good or bad, it has to be opposed and every possible loophole found for opposing it.  Apparently, that is the attitude that has been adopted with regard to this Bill.  This Bill, undoubtedly, will confer a benefit, and a large benefit, on a large number of farmers who are home butter-makers and who, unfortunately, have not that very handy market that their neighbours have for selling their produce and who have to export it.  That is the object of this Bill, and I am rather surprised at the attitude that has been adopted towards it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry said that this as a measure to give the farmer the cost of production.  Does it do that?  I think that there is general agreement in this House that something had to be done for the dairy industry, but where we differ, and materially differ, is as to the ways and means by which that should be brought about.  We say that the levy of 4d. or 4¼d. per lb. is not the way in which that should be done.  Everybody here &mdash;or, at least, Deputy Corry and a good many of the farmers here&mdash;knows something about the dairying industry. I was amazed at Deputy Dowdall saying, a while ago, that, when this Act would be in working order, 10d. per lb. would settle it.  If you take the 4d. off that, what is the producer getting?  I remember the present Minister for Agriculture stating here in this House that it cost 5½d. to produce a gallon of milk.  I have said in this House before, that around about 4d. would be an average price down through the country, and it has been suggested by some of the Minister's supporters that they were not getting quite 4d.  Now, it is idle to suggest&mdash;and I think it has been spoken about somewhat in this House <Col N="1475" />&mdash;that it is for the benefit of the creamery districts that this Bill is being introduced, so far as the tax on farmers' butter is concerned.  There is one thing that I would say, as representing a cereamery district, and that is that if we have to be benefited at the expense of the people who produce farmers' butter, we certainly do not want it.  If we cannot be benefited in any other way than by taxing the small farmers of the country who make a few pounds of butter every week&mdash;if that is the only way in which the dairying industry can be bolstered up, I must say that it is not much of a boast for anybody.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister on a previous occasion that, if he wants to help the dairying industry, he only has to look across the Border at the situation which obtains there at the present time where milk is from 5d. to 7d. a gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>How are you doing everything?  How are the institutions of the State being run except by taxation through the Central Fund?  In my opinion that would be the way in which the dairying industry could be stabilised.  I wish to refer only very briefly to the other sections of the Bill which are particularly objectionable.  I refer especially to that section of the Bill which gives power to an official of the State to enter a farmer's premises any time he likes.  That ought not be necessary in this or any other Bill, and especially in the case of a Bill connected with the dairying industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained when this Bill was last before the House why it was so urgent.  That was because it will have to operate from the 1st of April, and it would be rather inconvenient for people who are dealing in butter to have to pay up for the back time.  The Opposition on Friday last asked to have the discussion on the Fifth Stage put back until to-day.  I wonder what they gained by the delay.  Was it for the sake of what was said here to-day or what was said elsewhere that the discussion was put back?  In my opinion nothing was said on the floor of the House to-day as to why this Bill should be delayed or put back for a week.  That delay has put the people in the creameries to much inconvenience. It shows the little concern the Opposition have for the dairying industry in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy O'Sullivan has said, but at any rate there were speeches from the Opposition Benches, particularly on the last day, in which there was talk of 4½d. per lb. coming out of the producers' pocket. I have not taken any powers in this Bill that were not in the Dairy Produce Act of 1932.  When I brought that measure in here it was opposed, but the working of the Act subsequently met with general approval.  I know that the Front Opposition Bench voted against it that time, but they have spent the following three years denying they did so whenever they were accused of having done it.  I thought that when we were bringing in a Bill with the same provisions we would not meet with any obstruction such as we have met with in this Bill. Under the 1932 Act we have power to levy on creameries, the distributors, and the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the necessity for this Bill, so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the 1932 Act expired on the 31st of March.  That is the necessity for the Bill, and the Deputy ought to realise that before now.  We brought in this measure because from our experience during the last three years we found it necessary to change some administrative details. One of the biggest changes was not to collect a levy off the butter that is exported, but only to collect the levy off butter consumed at home.  The second change was that under this Bill everybody is liable, whereas they were <Col N="1478" /> only liable under the old Act where notice was served.  We only serve notice where new people were dealing in butter.  We are asked now why not pay the expense out of the Central Fund.  Naturally farmers would like to get more for their butter.  I would like to see the Opposition Deputy who would say that farmers are getting enough for their butter.  Would it not be delightful to see a Fine Gael Deputy who would say that the farmers are getting enough?  If the farmers were getting 2/- a lb. for their butter, is there a Deputy here who would say he was getting enough?  They would all want to give the farmer as much as possible.  Deputy Curran said that the cost should be taken out of the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>If Deputy Curran were here on these benches I wonder if he would vote against the tax on tea or the tax on sugar, or the tax on tobacco, or against any tax.  The farmers of Tipperary would, I am sure, like if they were given a better price for their butter, but coupled with that they would say &ldquo;Do not tax us.&rdquo;  Deputy Curran wants to have it both ways, and he will not have it either way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Both ways, like the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not like the Minister. Every Deputy here on this side is agreed that it must be done in this way.  Deputy Morrissey agrees with me that the small farmer gets nearly as much for his butter as is paid for creamery butter.  I agree, for the very reason that he gave, that the farmers' butter is as good as creamery butter.  Some people will pay as much for it as for creamery butter and, in some places, they are prepared to pay more.  Is it not just to tax the people who are buying farmers' butter when it is as good an article as the creamery butter?  There will not be very heavy administrative expenses under this Bill.  There will be no necessity for them.  There will be only eight or nine inspectors.  One <Col N="1479" /> would imagine from Deputies opposite that the inspectors take such a delight in searching people's houses that they would do it for nothing.  But we will pay them.  Deputy Belton and Deputy Brennan raised the question of where the money is to go and whether the Minister for Finance can get hold of it.  It is disappointing to have to instruct Deputies upon the provisions of the Bill.  If they would only read the Bill they would save a lot of time.  Deputies can see under Section 41 that every single halfpenny collected must be paid into the Stabilisation Fund.  It would be illegal to pay it to the Minister for Finance. It would be illegal to pay not only the levy but also the registration fee which is an innovation because these fees are usually paid to the Minister for Finance.  But, under this Bill, the registration fees and the levies must be paid into the Stabilisation Fund.  Apart from the cost of the inspectors nothing can be paid out except they improve the scheme of marketing for butter, so that under this Bill, whatever Deputies opposite say, there is no possibility of doing anything with the money collected except to pay it into the Stabilisation Fund and there is no possibility of paying anything out of that fund but this money to which I have referred.  Deputies ought be able to see the difference between this and the excise duty on bacon which goes into the Exchequer Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That excise duty was put on bacon to enable me to give a larger export bounty on pigs and bacon.  In the beginning of the financial year 1934 we had voted a certain amount for export bounties on pigs and bacon. During the year the curers came to us and said they wanted a larger bounty. We put it to them in the Department of Agriculture that they were getting a much better price at home than for their exports and that, therefore, we could exact a levy on production and give it to them on their exports, and they agreed.  That is being continued. The export bounty is still on the high level and the Bacon Bill will not come into operation until <Col N="1480" /> September.  Whatever Deputies Bennett and Brennan may think about that position it is quite a different one from this butter stabilisation arrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton talked about butter at 8d. per lb. in Drogheda and asked why that was.  In the first place, there is no doubt from many of the letters we have received in the Department of Agriculture that people all through the country have been frightened and their position made insecure by the speeches that they have read from Opposition Deputies, because they were beginning to believe that we might go back to the 1st of April and collect the 4d. per lb. from them, which is not true.  When it was explained to them what the provisions of the Bill are, the market settled down in these various towns. In the second place, the price of butter the world over is very low. Deputy Belton talked about benefiting the creameries.  We are not benefiting the creameries.  Deputy Morrissey said creamery butter was selling at 10d. per lb. in Great Britain.  If we were free from the economic war and the levies and bounties and the tariffs going into Great Britain, and if our creamery butter was being retailed at 10d. per lb., what would the creameries get for it?  The present price on the British market is 76/- per cwt., and the cost of production has to come out of that. That will give an idea of what the farmers would be getting if there was no Bill or anything else.</P>
    <P>We will, however, leave that aside and take this Bill and see what is going to be the position of the creameries and the farmers under the Bill if passed as it is.  The creameries are getting 100/- per cwt. on an average for butter.  The average working expenses of a creamery are 20/- per cwt.  That means 80/- to the producer; which is 9d. per lb., roughly, Under the Bill, I was calculating, and Deputy Belton accepted it as the basis of his argument, that factory butter would realise 93/- as against 100/- for creamery butter.  The working expenses of the factories are only about 9/- or 10/-, as compared <Col N="1481" /> with 20/- for the creameries.  Taking 9/- or 10/- off 93/- you get 83/- or 84/- per cwt., which is as good a price, and even a better price, than the factories can give to the producer, than the creameries give to their producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Is 9d. per lb. a fair price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not; but I am saying that we are as fair to the farmer who is going to the creamery as to the farmer who is not going to the creamery.  Deputies have the idea, evidently, that the Department of Agriculture have been trying to favour the creameries under the Bill.  That is not true.  Under the Bill the producer of farmers' butter will be left in the same relative position as he would have been if there had been no Bill.  That is the long and the short of it.  He is getting the same bounty and paying the same levy.  The price of creamery butter is going to average 100/- per cwt., and factory butter about 93/-, and that is really putting the factory butter in a little better position than it would be if there was no regulation at all, as compared with creamery butter.  The result is that is producer, whether of factory or creamery butter, is getting about 9d. per lb. for his butter.  That is the net result of the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose we were to listen to Deputy Belton and say we must collect a smaller levy from the person producing farmers' butter, would it not be arguable also that we should pay a smaller bounty then?  That would leave us again in the same position.  I do not think that any Deputy can honestly argue that, under the Bill, we are benefiting the creameries in any way as against the producer of factory butter.  I should like to ask any farmer&mdash;Deputy Curran, for instance, who, I think, supplies a creamery&mdash; does he think that it would pay him better to bring his milk once a day to a creamery and get the same price, as it would to make his butter at home and bring it once a week to the market. I think he would be better off making farmers' butter than bringing his milk to the creamery every day.  I think, if <Col N="1482" /> anything, we are giving the benefit to the maker of farmers' butter and the butter that passes to the factory.</P>
    <P>I do not see how this Bill is going to make for fraud, as the Opposition has pointed out&mdash;that we are going to encourage people to evade the levy.  If people are anxious to evade responsibility in that way, we will try to get after them; and, if we succeed, perhaps we may be able to collect almost 100 per cent. of the levy.  I think we will get after them.  It is rather a poor opinion to have of the people of the country, that they are going to evade the levy.  It is also a poor opinion to have of the officials, that they will take a delight in searching people's houses from curiosity merely.  I do not think the Opposition believe that.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Opposition believe that the suppliers of butter would be so depraved that they would try to evade the responsibility of pay ing the levy; or that the officials would take a delight in searching people's houses for no other reason except curiosity.  In conclusion, I should like to stress the point, because it is necessary to have it stressed, as the Opposition have created a false impression in the country as to the effects of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Opposition are only concerned with seeing that the markets are brought down so as to discredit this Government, no matter what the small farmers may suffer.  I want to tell the small farmers that they are entitled to get as good a price for their butter now as ever they got, because this Bill is not in operation yet as far as they are concerned.  I think the Opposition ought to let the small farmers get what they are entitled to and not try to create this impression throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I want to get some assurances from the Minister in regard to some of the provisions of this Bill. There appears to be a good deal of doubt in the minds of many persons who have sold motor lorries and persons who have bought motor lorries. A number of these persons have purchased these motor lorries on the instalment system, and many of the persons who sold the motor lorries, because of this Bill, are now in the position that they cannot get paid for them.  Most of those people who purchased lorries were of a very enterprising turn of mind, and many of them are now of the opinion that, on account of the operating of certain routes, which are now being served by the <Col N="1485" /> railway company, they will be put out of business altogether.  They have asked me to put a question direct to the Minister to find out from him how they are affected under this measure. Again, I would like if the Minister would make some inquiries into increased charges which are being made in the case of the operation of the various transport Acts.  It appears that in some areas where charges were relatively moderate for the conveyance of merchandise, from one point to another, in the last month or two greatly increased prices are charged for freight for merchandise from point to point in certain areas.</P>
      <P>All those places are not served by the railway company, that is to say, by railway coaches.  The railway company may, of course, run lorries in connection with their railway services, which I believe they are doing, but there are still some remote areas not served by either the railway company or by an efficient lorry service.  A number of those people are in some doubt as to their position.  They do not want to run the risk of a prosecution, and they would like an assurance from the Minister on the points which I have just raised.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise also the position in regard to beet haulage under this Bill.  The farmers who grew beet for the first time last year found that the transport system afforded by the railway company was absolutely inadequate, in the first place, and was, in regard to the type of vehicle supplied, absolutely useless in the second place.

      <P>If the Deputy will look at the Title of this Bill he will see from its content that the matter to which he is now referring is out of order on the Fifth Stage.  I might inform the Deputy that amendments dealing with the matter to which he now refers were not allowed to be moved on the Report Stage.  The Bill has nothing to do with the transport of beet.  If a question like that were raised, other Deputies would be entitled to discuss the carriage of <Col N="1486" /> wheat, turf, or other commodities which would be equally irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The special reason I am raising it is that I understand the Minister has power under this and the previous Act to refuse permission to the railway company to take over privately-owned vehicles.  From experience, we find that where the railway company takes over vehicles they do not afford the same facilities to farmers, particularly in regard to the carriage of beet.</P>

What I am anxious to do is to urge on the Minister that, in regard to those privately-owned lorries which were used last year for the carriage of agricultural produce, he should not allow those lorries to be taken over by the railway companies, because if he does it will only lead to the complete messing up of transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what point Deputy Anthony is trying to elucidate when he refers to persons who might undertake the provision of transport services in particular areas only they are afraid they might be prosecuted, or to persons who have bought motor cars which they do not know whether they are entitled to use or not.  No person is entitled to engage in the business of carrying merchandise for reward unless he has a licence.  Any person who carries merchandise without a licence will be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my point clear.  I was referring to persons who had purchased cars on the hire purchase system before this Act was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who was engaged in the business of carrying merchandise for reward before the Act was introduced is entitled as a right to an existing carrier's certificate and a licence, provided he applied within the period specified in the Act and altered by subsequent amending legislation. Any person who was not so carrying merchandise during the qualifying period before the passage of the Act, or who did not apply within the specified time, cannot get a licence, and consequently is not entitled to engage in that business except under special circumstances, when a licence might be issued for the carriage of a particular type of merchandise or the carriage of merchandise in a particular area where the railway companies had intimated their unwillingness to undertake that kind of business.  It is true that there have been increased charges for transport since the Act came into operation. The whole purpose of the Act was to enable those increases in charges to be made, because prior to the enactment of the legislation the whole transport <Col N="1488" /> business in this country was uneconomic.  Everybody engaged in it was making a loss. and transport services were being maintained upon a basis of remarkably low wages.  By the eliminiation of uneconomic competition it became possible to charge economic rates and of course in so far as services are now being provided by the railway companies, they are, because of their nature, obliged to pay rates of wages to their workers which are generally recognised, contrary to the practice of many of those smaller independent operators who frequently paid rates very much less than the standard rates.  Where those charges are unduly high there is machinery provided for their rectification&mdash;the machinery of the Railway Tribunal, which is a court constituted for that purpose, and to which any person interested in the operation of transport services has the right to appeal.  The court has the authority and powers of the High Court, and nobody except it can give a decision upon those matters. Once its decision is given it is binding. The regulation of charges is not the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is the function of the court of the Railway Tribunal.  If there is any part of the country where transport is not being provided by anybody, then it is open to any person to apply for a licence to provide transport in that area.  If the railway company indicates formally that they do not wish to provide transport in that area, then a licence can be issued to that person, which, when issued, is irrevocable.</P>
      <P>So far as the transport of beet is concerned, if I am in order in dealing with it at all I merely want to say that no licences confined to the transportation of beet have yet been transferred to any railway company.  The question of whether we will, in fact, transfer to railway companies beet transport licences has not yet been decided.  It is quite possible that such licences will not be transferred for some time to come, and that persons interested in the carriage of beet and beet only will be allowed to continue in that business without interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sure he is correct in that&mdash;that in no case have the railway company been given a licence to transport beet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstood me.  The railway companies, of course, are all licensed to carry beet by road or rail.  Certain persons had licences to carry beet for reward and these licences have not yet been transferred to the railway company.  Very few merchandise licences have as yet been transferred, but the question as to whether these licences confined to beet will be transferred is still an open one, and it is very probable they will not be transferred until the railway company have got wider experience in the business of road transportation and are better equipped to undertake it. It must be remembered that they have only come into this business on a large scale quite recently.  Last year they had to supply themselves with substantially increased equipment, but they did not succeed in time in providing the equipment that would enable them to deal with all the business that offered, particularly during the beet season.</P>
      <P>The existing licences for the carriage of beet are mainly confined to the area around the Carlow factory.  The other factories were established only last year and, of course, prior to that there was no carriage of beet in these areas.  The question of issuing new licences for the carriage of beet in these areas other than to the railway companies is under consideration. Deputies may be assured that whatever transport facilities are necessary in any area will be provided.  If they are not provided by the railway companies then there is power to license independent operators to provide them.  The purpose of the whole scheme is to insure that in every part of the country there will be provided that type of transport which is most suitable and economic and which will best serve the needs of the area concerned, subject of course to the general intention that all that transport should be under unified control.</P>

      <P>The amendments tabled by the Minister to this Bill raise a certain difficulty for the Chair.  The established practice has been to confine amendments on Report Stage to matters arising directly out of proceedings in Committee, whether arising from actual amendments offered for that stage or as a result of undertakings given by the Minister.  In this <Col N="1491" /> instance it might be contended, and the Chair would have considerable sympathy with the contention, that the Ministerial amendments do not come within that category.  They do, however, arise directly out of the subject matter of the Bill and merely qualify in certain respects the powers proposed to be given under Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill.  The Chair is allowing the amendments, but reiterates the view previously expressed in connection with the Moneylenders Bill, 1933, that amendments such as these should be submitted on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The remarks of the Chair create a certain difficulty for me in moving the amendments, because I am advised, and believe, that in fact they effect no change in the Bill at all, that they are merely drafting changes designed to make clear that the sections of the Bill give to the Electricity Supply Board power to lay lines above ground.  The view I hold, and the view held by people advising me in these matters, is that the amendments are not necessary, but the Electricity Supply Board are of opinion that they want to have all possible doubts removed.  I think it is desirable that they should be removed by the insertion of these words which do not, in fact, create any change in their powers, but merely make it more explicit that they have these powers.</P>

      <P>In cases where increased numbers of poles and better poles and better overhead wirings have been erected by the Electricity Supply Board, these have been valued at a very much higher rate than the valuation on the poles or way-leaves of the private companies that were taken over <Col N="1493" /> by the Electricity Supply Board.  The position is that the local bodies are debarred from getting any additional rates out of the increased valuations. They can only get the rates on the valuation of the old undertakings and that position is likely to cause great hardship.  In some towns the new valuation is placed on the books but there is no power to get the increased rate.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government will back me up in trying to help local authorities to get relief in this matter.  I think it was a terrible oversight in the original Act.  Perhaps the Minister on some future occasion will consider the position of local authorities in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill arises from opinions expressed in the Supreme Court regarding the powers which the Minister for Local Government was enabled to assume under Section 15 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923. The words of the section are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister shall have with respect to all persons now employed or hereafter to be employed by any local authority in any office or employment to which this section applies and with respect to the accounts of such persons all the same powers as he now has by law with respect to officers of boards of <Col N="1494" /> guardians of poor law unions and the accounts of such officers respectively.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall apply to such offices and employments as the Minister shall from time to time by order prescribe.</P>
    <P>In February, 1923, when the section (then known as Section 14) was being discussed by the Dáil, the Minister who was in charge of the Bill made it clear that the intention was to acquire in regard to all local authorities the powers which had, up to then, been exercisable only over poor law guardians.  The powers of the Minister over officers of boards of guardians were to regulate their appointment and continuance in office and removal.  In addition he had an initiating power to prescribe their qualifications, duties, modes of appointment, the amount, time, and mode of payment of salaries, the districts in which they work, and the security they should furnish for the satisfactory discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>The debate on the section (pages 1810-1834 inclusive&mdash;Vol. II, Parliamentary Debates, 1923) shows that there was no doubt whatever that the section was drafted with the object of enabling the Minister to take by statutory order a supervisory power over the decisions of local authorities in regard to all classes of officials or employees supplanting any power specific or otherwise which they possessed up to then.  The power subsequently assumed by such statutory order was, however, limited to technical and professional, clerical and supervisory classes as well as persons remunerated by way of annual salary.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which this Bill is intended to repair arose as follows: In 1930 the then Minister for Local Government, acting on the powers assumed to have been granted to him under the Act of 1923, issued an order under seal assigning the duties of the vacant position of solicitor to the Kerry County Council to the county secretary.  The validity of this action was challenged by the county council.  In the first instance the High Court held that the Minister <Col N="1495" /> acted within his jurisdiction.  An appeal, however, to the Supreme Court indicated in effect that if competent prosecutors had been before them this decision would have been reversed.  The court were, apparently, of opinion that the order was invalid on the ground that the general power conferred by Section 15 of the Act of 1923 did not abrogate the specific statutory power given to county councils in relation to officers, and that if the intention of the legislature was to take away such specific powers, the Acts in which they were contained should have been named and specifically repealed in the new measure. The reason, it will be noted, is a general one and applies to other local authorities possessing similar powers.  Since 1923 many cases have arisen in which Ministerial control was exercised and to which the general principles of the Kerry judgment apply.  The court also expressed a view that Section 15 of the 1923 Act might be considered to be confined to enabling the Minister to carry with him in regard to his control of the new poor law authorities, i.e., the boards of assistance, the powers he previously possessed over staffs of their predecessors, i.e. the boards of guardians.</P>
    <P>From these pronouncements, particularly the last-mentioned, arises, therefore, the position that the intentions of the Minister in 1923, expressed clearly in the debates by the Dáil, and accepted as having the widest possible meaning, may be open to challenge on account of a technical defect.  One effect is that the sanction of the Minister is not necessary to decisions of local authorities on matter of the appointment, removal and remuneration of staffs other than those engaged in poor law services.</P>
    <P>The present Bill deals with this situation by laying down specifically that the powers conferred extend to all offices, and employments whether engaged in poor law administration or otherwise, and that such powers are paramount to any possessed by a local authority.  In addition it validates past actions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The measure which is merely a safeguarding one should not be one for controversy&mdash;it does not necessarily represent the permanent outlines of the relations between the central authority and local authorities in regard to staff matters.  When it was before the House in 1923 the Minister responsible for it, in stressing its temporary character, stated that permanent legislation would, in course of time, be introduced to replace it. To a certain extent, effect has been given to this intention in the Local Government (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, which deals with the filling of higher posts through the Local Appointments Commissioners, but there are other aspects which have been allowed to remain in the position of 1923 on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>The inappropriateness to present conditions of the poor law regulations adopted originally in 1882 in the light of the conditions of the time is manifest.  Those regulations which are the basis of the existing Ministerial powers have not been changed&mdash;otherwise than in the scope of their application&mdash;for over 50 years, and now need revision.  There are matters in respect of which representations have been made; for example, the desirability of bringing the present local superannuation code into line with that followed in the Civil Service and the necessity for giving clearer definition to the retirement age of officials.  The whole question is being looked into at present and it is hoped to put before the Dáil in the next session a comprehensive measure which will set out clearly the relations which it is considered for the future should exist in regard to staff matters between the central and local authorities.  Such a Bill, unlike its predecessor, will be dissociated from poor law legislation and will be presented as a general local government measure drawn in such definite terms as will give the Dáil every opportunity of considering its implications. For the present however, there is no alternative but to preserve existing powers until such time as new proposals are submitted.</P>

      <P>It is necessary, of course, that the Local Government Department in itself should have powers and duties of this type, and my only regret is that, in bringing the matter forward, the Minister did not bring in the other matters to which he referred, such as the matter of superannuation and other questions which, for some time, have been talked about and which are matters that have been crying for attention for some time.  The powers of the Local Government Department &mdash;supervisory and otherwise&mdash;are in absolute necessity.  While the local authorities may occasionally complain of red tape and perhaps complain that the lines are drawn too straight between what they are expected to do and what they are not expected to do, the position is that very wide powers must be retained by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Consequently as far as we on this side of the House are concerned we are quite agreed to the acceptance of the measure.  It is only clarifying the powers already in operation and I have no objection to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to add much to what I have already said on this Bill.  I want to add only one or two comments.  When speaking on the Bill on the last day I gave it a very hearty welcome as being a step forward in the direction of social legislation. The Bill has its limitations and its defects.  It has a few drawbacks, but on the whole it is a step forward. It is quite natural to expect, in what I regard as an experimental step in the direction which has been indicated by the Minister, that there might be some defects.  The Minister, when speaking on the Bill, said he intended at a later date to introduce what we might call legislation that would be a corollary to the present Bill.  I can quite understand some defects arising in some of the sections which provide for an eight-hour day.  I am sure that the Minister, in conjuction with representatives of employers and workers in such works as ready-made clothing and similar factories, may be able to arrive at a solution.  In some <Col N="1499" /> cases a five-day week is worked.  That is a growing custom or practice in many of these industries.  The Minister, I think, will have to vary the section dealing with working hours in order to meet that particular section. I want to be as helpful as possible, with regard to getting this measure through the Dáil.  Any point or any suggestions I offer will be offered with that intention.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Minister is implementing many things, which by political action trade unionist workers have advocated for a long period of years in connection with annual holidays, is an advance, and an advance along proper lines.  To some extent at least the position of persons in industry who are already in receipt of a fortnight's annual holidays in addition to public holidays will not be adversely affected by this measure. Provision is made for persons who are enjoying short working weeks so that they will not be affected by a reduction in wages, if they have to work less than a 48-hours week.  As regards the section dealing with the registration of agreements, I think it is a very important section indeed.  There may be an objection raised, but I am not raising it as an objection because I intend on the Committee Stage doing something more practical than making a suggestion.  I feel at the same time that the Minister should make it clear what he means by &ldquo;association&rdquo; in the section.  He provides that consultations and conversations may take place between representatives of the workers on the one hand and representatives of employers on the other hand. It might easily happen, and it has happened already in this country, that a number or group of disgruntled people may get together and appoint themselves into a so-called trade union.  These people will give a good deal of trouble here and elsewhere.  They may be revolutionary Communists or anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the dangers that the Minister should guard against in this Bill.  I would make the suggestion to <Col N="1500" /> the Minister that he should regard as a trade union body any group of persons affiliated with the Irish Trade Union Congress.  The Irish Trade Union Congress is really the Parliament of Irish labour.  It speaks for the vast bulk of organised labour in this country. When I say that he should regard the Trade Union Congress as a body which has been able to speak for the workers in general, I might mention that it does happen too that there are many old established and genuine trade unions that are not affiliated to the Trade Union Congress.  But these bodies cannot be said to be political revolutionaries or Communists.  I would suggest to the Minister that he himself might put down an amendment embodying what I have just said.  I do know that even to-day there is in existence one or two bodies who call themselves representatives of the working-class people of the country.  They are really no such thing.  This is what I would like to guard against in any future negotiations that may take place between representatives of the workers and employers.  I certainly consider this section dealing with the registration of agreements the most important section in the Bill.  Those who have given any considered thought to the position of the labour movement or the workers movement generally in this country must agree that for very many years it was the idea behind the minds of the greatest of those men that whilst much could be achieved and a good deal can be achieved by industrial activity and industrial action, at the same time unless that trade union activity and working-class activity generally was implemented by some political action the persons clamouring for better social conditions, etc., might as well be crying to the moon.  I have advocated myself that it was quite necessary for the working-class movement to have a political wing.  Now I can see in these particular sections of the Bill a good deal of what was asked for and agitated for in the past.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on having introduced a measure which will bring a good deal of happiness to many workers.  Thousands and thousands <Col N="1501" /> of these workers have never known what it was to have an annual holiday.  Many thousands of them, of course, had too many holidays at their own expense when unemployed.  This Bill is now making provision for that class of worker who never was able to have a holiday without paying very dearly for it.  It confers upon those workers a very great privilege, and marks a very good step forward in this kind of social legislation.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, as I said, some weaknesses here and there in the Bill. I have already mentioned one or two of them, but in a most friendly and helpful spirit.  The point I wanted to stress is that I feel the Minister must further strengthen this section by introducing an amendment, and if not I shall endeavour to do so myself, which will provide for the proper representation of the workers themselves, because I do not think there is much fear of the other parties to this potential agreement, namely, the employers in the various industries, having any person speaking for them who is not entitled to speak for them.  On the whole, this Bill will be welcomed by thousands of working class people, and, as I said, it is a good step forward in this kind of social legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very interesting Bill, and, in many respects, a novel Bill; but, as the <i>Irish Press</i> said in a leading article on the Bill recently, it is in no way a revolutionary Bill.  Many of the things contained in the Bill are already in existence. Many of the benefits which it purports to confer upon workers are already enjoyed by them, and these conditions have been won for the workers as a result of trade union action.  But there are many provisions in the Bill which will be welcomed.  There are many sections of workers who will have good reason to welcome the provisions of the Bill.  For instance, there are employers who still continue the soulless practice of exploiting juvenile labour and employing female labour.  There are employers who continue to pay notoriously low rates of wages and are unblushing in confessing that they have no intention of paying any higher rates <Col N="1502" /> of wages.  There are industries existing only because of the fact that they pay very low rates of wages and do not observe decent conditions of labour.  These particular industries and these particular employers are a menace to all attempts to establish reasonable rates of wages and decent conditions of labour and a menace to every well-established industry.</P>

The Deputy might remember that there are a number of persons employed there from 17 to 19 years of age who are paid the magnificent wage of 5/- per week, and the application which they had to sign for employment in that industry, if it can be called an industry, bound them to accept the wholly illegal provision that they could be dismissed at a moment's notice without cause assigned.</P>

      <P>Later on in the course of the interview, Mr. Milroy &ldquo;expressed regret because the Bill did not contain provisions to impose a drastic control on factories in regard to ventilation, heating, sanitation and general suitability.  This would have dealt with many of the back-room factories.&rdquo;  Later, in the course of the interview, Mr. Milroy, referring to the question of granting workers a week's holiday, said: &ldquo;It is excellent, however, that this whole matter should have been brought into being as a result of these proposals. On many occasions the Federation have had to bring to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce bad conditions in factories.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think I will be accused of any exaggeration in quoting Mr. Milroy, the President of the Federation of Saorstát Industries, on this matter, and I am sure Deputy Minch will exonerate Mr. Milroy from having any bias towards the Labour Party. We can leave it, therefore, being satisfied, I think, with the statement of the President of the Federation of Saorstát Industries that there are back-room factories, bad employers and underpaid workers, and that the Federation was out to do away with the low rates of wages and bad conditions of labour in many of these factories and were compelled to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <P>This Bill breaks new ground in some respects in the fixation of maximum working hours in industry.  And, in considering the question of a reduction prophecies, then have turned out to be no harm if, for a few moments, we were <Col N="1505" /> to think of the general development which has taken place in the matter of the reduction in working hours.  Some time ago I happened to be reading proceedings in the British House of Commons and in the British Press of the period containing statements of persons whose names were then something that one might look on with respect in economic, social and industrial matters. At that time a Bill to fix a maximum working day of 12 hours was going through the British Parliament, and some people of the period who had a high reputation in industrial and subsidiary economic matters said it was the end of Britain.  An effort to limit working hours to 12 per day was the end of Britain!  Its arms had been triumphant on many battlefields; its navy was feared and respected throughout the world.  In face of the fact that Britain had then reached the zenith of her military and political power in the world, these well-known economists, as they would be described, said that this concession would put Britain out of existence.  They said that any attempt to reduce working hours to 12 per day was going to mean scarcity and poverty because of the scarcity, and was going to bring to an end the great British Empire which was then so triumphant in the military and naval sense.  That was the viewpoint of well-known people of the period.  That was the viewpoint of many people who then thought they were authoritarians in respect of social and economic matters.  But the whole course of development since the 12-hour day was introduced in Great Britain has falsified all those prophecies. Instead of a scarcity there has been plenty; instead of there being a shortage there is an abundance, and we have now, in the year 1935, in spite of all those prophecies, reached the stage of economic development when poverty is an absurdity.  We are at the stage when there is an abundance available for all to consume, and an abundance capable of being made available for more to consume if only we have the capacity to organise the world on the basis of making available the abundance to all who need it.  Those earlier prophecies, then, have turned out to be so much waste and foolish talk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> To-day we have reached the stage when the whole problem before the world is that of distributing the deluge of production with which the world is faced so as to satisfy the needs of those who require it.  In recent times there has been perhaps a more definite emphasis on the social and economic value of reducing working hours.  Following on the war, and as part of the process of making the world fit for heroes to live in, representatives of various nations met at Washington and adopted the Washington Hours Convention.  That was in 1919.  The object then was to introduce a maximum working week of 48 hours in all industrial undertakings.  And in recent years the International Labour Office at Geneva has endeavoured to secure the adoption of a draft convention for the application of a working week of 40 hours in industry.  Both these ideas, and much of the public demand for the reduction of working hours that has come from many Governments, have been born out of a recognition of the fact that the workers are entitled to share in the benefits which have been produced by the mechanisation and rationalisation of industry.  The Minister could have told us, in introducing the Bill, that there are many European Governments which, as a matter of economic necessity to assist in the provision of work for additional people, have found it necessary to introduce the 40-hour week in many schemes of public works, and generally there has been a recognition by many European Governments of the value of limiting hours of work in certain industries and undertakings which they can control in order to assist in the absorption of additional workers in industry. I do not say, of course, that the reduction of the working hours will automatically solve the economic problem. None but a fool would say so.  What I do say is that the reduction of the working hours will help to contribute towards the solution of the unemployment problem, by bringing additional workers into industry.  Learned authorities on this matter at Geneva, I think, will be able to supply the Minister with their considered views on that subject.  But, aside from any <Col N="1507" /> contribution which a reduction in working hours may make towards the solution of the unemployment problem, there is everywhere growing a recognition of the fact that workers are entitled to participate in the benefits of mechanised and rationalised industrial effort.</P>
    <P>I am glad, therefore, that our legislation takes the form of fixing a maximum working week in industry, but I would be more pleased if the Minister had seen fit to break new ground and, as it were, to enter the vanguard of socially enlightened nations in the matter of reducing the working week something below the 48-hour week.  I would like to have seen the Minister break new ground and introduce a 40-hour week as a statutory maximum working week.  I am sure the Minister realises that in practically all the undertakings, if not all, covered by this Bill, there is already a maximum working week of 48 hours and in many cases the working week is less than 48 hours.  In earlier statements in the public Press, I think the Minister committed himself to a declaration that this Bill would contain a provision for the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention, but I am sure the Minister realises that this Bill does not cover all the classes referred to in the Washington Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one class of person not referred to in this Bill and not engaged in mining, although possibly engaged in some form of transport.  I refer to the workers in the Post Office service.  At present many of those workers are working 48 hours a week, which is the new maximum <Col N="1508" /> prescribed by this Bill.  The Government, however, apparently, hopes that it will be able to negotiate agreements for working a week of less than 48 hours, because in his speech on the Second Reading the Minister said: &ldquo;A 44-hour week has been instituted in other industries by agreements between employers and employees. There is no necessity to amend those agreements in consequence of the passing of this measure; in fact it is not improbable that immediately upon the passage of this measure arrangements will be made to bring into consultation in accordance with the Bill the representatives of workers and employers in particular industries, with a view to having arrangements made for the enactment of regulations prescribing a shorter week than 48 hours in respect of those industries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I assume that the initiative in that matter is going to be taken by the Minister's Department.  I suggest to him that his representative at a conference of that kind will feel in a rather invidious position if, when he is urging employers to reduce their hours from a 48-hour week, he is open to the rebuff that he himself, as a member of the Executive Council, continues to employ persons for 48 hours per week. I am sure the Minister is sympathetic towards putting his own house in order.  I am sure that in respect of those particular Post Office employees he is anxious that whatever general social legislation benefits workers generally should be made applicable to them.  I hope, before the Minister's representative meets those employers and workers, he will be able to assure his representative that he is in the happy position of knowing that no counter-attack can be made on the Government in respect of the hours per week which it requires its own employees to work.  If the Minister does that, I think he can enter a conference of that kind assured, at all events, of the good will of the Labour Party and of the good will of the workers who would be represented at a conference of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should prefer if this Bill were <Col N="1509" /> being discussed in this House with the other Bills which I understand are to come.  I gathered from previous statements made by the Minister that it is intended to introduce a Bill dealing with the position of shop workers; that it is intended to introduce a separate Bill dealing with the transport service; that it is intended to introduce a Bill dealing with mines, and probably with hours of night work in bakeries; but one of the difficulties which confront members of the House on this subject is that in seeking to move amendments on the Committee Stage of this Bill they may be moving amendments to matters which may be contained and automatically remedied in the other Bills which are likely to be introduced.  I should like, further, if the Minister could give the House any assurance that those other Bills will be ready at an early date, or that they will be circulated before the Committee Stage of this Bill is reached.  If we could have that assurance I think we would be able to see this Bill in the proper perspective, and be able to co-relate its provisions to the provisions of the other Bills which are to be introduced.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions of this Bill, on which I heartily congratulate the Minister, is the provision by which the hours of young workers will be reduced to a maximum of 40 per week. However, there is a provision in the Bill which enables the Minister to extend the hours of young workers beyond 40 per week if it can be shown that the conditions in the industry would require the continuance at work of those young people.  I dislike that section intensely, because I think the Minister will be bombarded with requests from all kinds of industrialists to the effect that it is imperative that their young workers should work 48 hours per week.  I am sorry that the Minister did not set his face hard on the subject of reduction of working hours to a maximum of 40 per week, and deprive himself of the powers to extend the employment of any persons beyond 40 hours per week.  I can, for instance, imagine clothing manufacturers coming to the Minister and <Col N="1510" /> saying that it is impossible for a clothing manufacturer to continue in operation after the young workers have left, and that consequently they must have an extension of the young workers' hours of employment.  I can also imagine hosiery manufacturers coming along and saying that they would be seriously inconvenienced if their young workers were to work a maximum of only 40 hours per week, and that their whole business would be disorganised.  I can imagine perhaps sweets and jam manufacturers and confectioners making an equally feasible plea to the Minister, showing that they would be seriously inconvenienced if their workers were required to cease work after working a week of 40 hours.  I think all that clamour would not be healthy, and I hope the Minister will give the House an assurance that while this provision is inserted in the Bill it is to be used only in very exceptional circumstances and that we are not to understand from the Bill that a mere application from the employers concerned will automatically ensure a permit to employ young workers for a period in excess of 40 hours per week.</P>
    <P>Here again I think I must raise the case of the Post Office classes.  There are in the Post Office quite a number of persons employed for 48 hours per week.  They are persons under 18 years of age.  I should like to know from the Minister whether those people are to be treated in the same way as any workers employed in an outside industry. I should like, for instance, to know whether a boy messenger in the Post Office, or a store boy employed in the Post Office factory or for work in connection with the Post Office factory, is to be treated in the same way as a person similarly graded in outside employment.  It would seem to be an obvious anomaly if the State were to employ persons under 18 years of age for 48 hours per week, while at the same time the Minister was engaged in a kind of social crusade, asking employers to agree not to employ their workers for more than 40 hours per week.  That is a matter which I should like the Minister to look <Col N="1511" /> into.  I hope we can have some assurance from him that in this respect the State is going to lead by good example and by showing employers generally that it is above the reproach of lagging behind in the matter of conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes provisions for holidays for all workers.  It also makes provision for payment for Bank Holidays to all workers affected by the Bill.  In some respects that will be a considerable advantage to many sections of workers. Of course, as the Minister knows, the workers in many of the industries referred to in this Bill are already allowed holidays, but there are many employers who do not concede holidays to their workers.  There are many industries where no holidays are allowed to workers, and there are of course many employers in the country who think that holidays are the privilege of the employer and the well-to-do classes, and that it is evidence of the insubordination and indiscipline of the age if the workers dream of asking for holidays so that they might recuperate from a year of industrial toil.  I am sorry that the Minister has not fixed a higher period of holidays than is provided in the Bill.  Six days holidays are, of course, much better than no holidays, but the Minister will hardly contend that six days holidays, after 51 weeks of grinding industrial toil, are sufficient to enable workers to recuperate from that strenuous ordeal.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a more enlightened view nowadays on the value of holidays.  Most good employers and the State itself recognise that holidays are advantageous from a health point of view, that they are advantageous from a national point of view in giving us a healthier population.  Broad-minded employers realise that the granting of holidays to their workers with pay has the effect of producing more efficient and more contented workers, and to that extent, an employer himself shares in the general benefit which accrues to the workers as a result of obtaining holidays with pay.  I hope the Minister <Col N="1512" /> will not resist an amendment on the Committee Stage to increase holidays substantially above the figure specified in the Bill.  If the Minister is agreeable he will find that most good employers will assent to the proposition and even those who might not be converted to the value of holidays at the moment would, I think, in a very short time realise that there were obvious advantages from a national and an industrial standpoint in conceding workers holidays for the purposes of recuperation from toil, so that they might become even more efficient workers.</P>
    <P>The section of this Bill which is most important is Section 42, which deals with the wages agreements register.  I read very closely the speech which was made by the Minister when he was introducing the Bill.  If this section is to be used in the way indicated then by the Minister, I think it is a good section, but when the Act is in operation it will not be the Minister who will be interpreting its provisions; it will be the courts that will be interpreting the provisions and the Minister's intention on the Second Reading will be of little avail if any flaw is subsequently discovered.  This section, in my opinion, will need very careful consideration.  I have observed in the Press that there is a controversy on this section raging between the Minister, speaking here, and the Traders Union Congress, speaking outside.  I think the Minister would have been wise if he had consulted the Trades Union Congress in connection with this particular section.  Indeed, I think he would have been wise if he had consulted them in connection with the whole Bill.  It is said&mdash;I have no evidence of the truth of the statement&mdash;that the Federation of Saorstát Manufacturers were consulted during the preparation of this Bill.  I do not know whether that statement is true.  I find it difficult to believe that the Minister would consult the employers and not the trade unionists. I mention the matter for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of denying a statement which <Col N="1513" /> has secured widespread circulation. I think, on the whole, the Minister would have been wise if he had consulted the Trades Union Congress and then one would not object if he consulted the employers.  I think it would have been an advantage to the Minister if he had consulted both sides.</P>
    <P>In respect to Section 42, I think the Minister has committed a serious error of judgment in not consulting the Trades Union Congress.  Reading the section, one can see clearly that it is intended to provide for a situation where the employers and the workers come together and negotiate an agreement for a minimum period of 12 months.  That agreement can be subsequently registered in the wages agreements register which is to be kept by the Minister in the future.  Once the Minister is satisfied that the workers and the employers are substantially representative of the industry in the particular part of the country concerned, or in the whole country, that agreement thereupon becomes binding on the employers generally.  I have considerable sympathy with the viewpoint expressed by the Minister when he said that one often find cases where 80 per cent. of the employers and 80 per cent. of the workers are prepared to negotiate an agreement providing for the payment of certain wages and the observance of certain conditions of labour; but the continuity of that agreement is imperilled by 20 per cent. of the employers representing, perhaps, a very small minority of the article in production saying they are not prepared to observe the agreement and consequently they enter into a fierce cut-throat competition with other employers who are prepared to pay better rates.</P>
    <P>If this section enables an agreement to be made between the workers and the employers, both substantially representative of the industry, and that agreement is to be binding on the remainder of the industry, one can understand the obvious advantages of an arrangement of that kind.  The fear expressed by the Trades Union Congress is that this particular section, as <Col N="1514" /> drawn, is intended to anchor the workers to fixed conditions and is intended to put into the hands of the employers a weapon by which the existing rates of wages will be legally enforceable, and where the power of the courts may be invoked to prevent a worker withdrawing his labour in certain circumstances.  I would like to know from the Minister what meaning he attaches to this section.  Is this section intended to be an instrument by which, once a wage agreement is in operation in a particular industry, the employer can go to the courts?  Let us say a strike is threatened in that industry because, in the opinion of the union or the workers, the employer has offended in some respect, or let us say a strike takes place because of sympathetic action by the workers in that industry with the workers in another industry.  I would like to know from the Minister if it is within the power of the employer to go to the courts and say that there is an agreement in operation which had not been terminated and consequently any attempt by the workers to withdraw their labour while that agreement was in operation was something which was an offence under the section?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether this section, in his opinion, can be construed as compelling the workers to work in this industry, once the rates of wages referred to in the agreement are paid?  That is a very important consideration, because the trade union movement in this country is naturally anxious to ensure that nothing will be done by any side-wind to invade the natural rights of the workers to withdraw their labour.  The right to strike has always been conceded to be a natural right.  Theological and ecclesiastical authorities have always conceded the undeniable right of the worker to withdraw his labour if he feels he is not securing a just reward for his efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if any effort is made in this section to interfere with the right of the workers to withdraw their labour, then the Bill takes on an entirely new aspect.  So far as this Party is concerned, we would not stand at all for a Bill which attempted to invade the right of the workers to withdraw their labour, and I fear that that is a possible interpretation of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to subsection (4) of Section 42.  If the Minister looks at the last few lines there, he will see that a certain set of circumstances are envisaged by which, I think, it is possible, as the section stands, actually to reduce the rates of wages of certain classes of workers. If, for instance, employers in a certain industry concede to certain classes of workers in that industry, certain <i>ex gratia</i> payments in respect of the work they are doing, and if an agreement were subsequently made affecting the whole industry, it seems to me <Col N="1516" /> that, if the subsequent agreement provided for rates of wages less than the special rates which were enjoyed by that section of the workers, they would, under that section, lose the additional benefits they had enjoyed hitherto.  My reason for saying that is that it is provided in the section that the rates registered are &ldquo;legally enforceable by any such employer, to any such worker, and shall be enforceable by any such employer or any such worker in any court accordingly, notwithstanding any contract or agreement between such employer and such worker to the contrary or inconsistent therewith.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister, during the Committee Stage, should amend that section in order to ensure that nothing will be done, either by the registration of the agreements, or by the enforceability of the rates of wages, to affect in any way the right of workers to obtain rates of wages higher than the rates registered in the agreement.  Furthermore, I think that in respect of the whole section, the Minister should make sure that what is provided for in these agreements, in respect of minimum rates of wages, will not also hold with regard to maximum rates.  In that way, I think that he would remove from the section what I think is a blemish, and a serious blemish, not alone on the section itself but on the whole Bill.  On the whole, and provided that the matter to which I have referred is satisfactorily explained and that there is no interference with the right of the workers to strike, I think that the Bill has many advantages.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that other Bills, cognate to this matter, will be introduced in due course, and I hope that he will endeavour to ensure that these other Bills will be circulated before we reach the Committee Stage of this Bill.  If the Minister does that, I think that we will be able to see this Bill in a very much better light.  Finally I appeal to the Minister to defer the Committee Stage of this Bill for at least three weeks so that the ramifications of this highly complex measure may be properly considered and so that all Parties may have an opportunity <Col N="1517" /> of considering the amendments they propose to submit on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill had even the one effect of putting an end to the exploitation of juvenile labour, that has become so prevalent in recent years, it would commend itself to me for that reason alone.  I think it is generally accepted or, at least, it is very much a matter of common rumour, that very many of the industries that have been started as a result of the high tariffs imposed have gone in largely for juvenile labour.  I consider that that is both unfair to the youngsters employed and also to the existing Irish industries; and I was glad to hear Deputy Norton quote the President of the Federation of Saorstát Industries showing that, apparently, they are becoming alive to the fact that their interests are being injured by this practice.  Personally, I think that the age of 14 is too low an age to fix as the barrier.  I can see, of course, that that is the school-leaving age and that, presumably, the Minister has been guided by that fact in taking it as the minimum age at which persons may be employed in industrial work as it is defined in the Bill.  With regard to employment of young persons, Deputy Norton expressed his pleasure that there was a limit of a 40-hour week for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I said a limit.  I think, personally, that that is rather on the high side.  Young persons are defined in the Bill as being between the ages of 14 and 18.  At that age boys and girls are growing up, and I think that 40 hours per week is rather on the high side.  With reference to Section 34, where power is taken by the Minister to extend the hours of employment, I was wondering whether or not the provision in that section, giving power to deem such young person as an adult worker for the purposes of the Act, would mean that they would still be paid as juvenile workers.  I was wondering whether or not it meant that, if they were to be kept on for a 48-hour week for the <Col N="1518" /> special purposes of this Act, they would be paid an adult rate of wages.  I think that the Minister should refuse to give an extension, in the case of a juvenile worker, to a 48-hour week, unless the employer guarantees to treat such worker entirely as an adult worker and pay him an adult rate of wages.  That will prevent employers attempting to get more than a 40-hour week out of persons to whom they are only paying a considerably low rate of wages.</P>
      <P>Everyone, I think, will agree that, in the year 1935, it is time that there should be some provision for holidays for persons engaged in industry, and, personally, if Deputy Norton were to put down an amendment to make the holiday period 12 days instead of six days, I would certainly support it.  I think that Irish employers have already realised that, and that the usual holiday they have been in the habit of giving their workers has been in the neighbourhood of a fortnight.  I know also that in certain industries which are now being brought under the provisions of this Bill, it has not been the custom to give holidays at all, and I quite admit that in such cases, as Deputy Norton says, a holiday of even six days would be a godsend to such workers. I do not think that the employers themselves would suffer if there were an extension of that holiday from six to 12 days.  The value that they would get in increased efficiency and the better health of the workers and so on would make up for the extra six days' wages that they would have to pay for the longer holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us have been circularised by a trade union which is not affected by this Bill.  We understand from the Minister that this particular trade union will be considered in a Shop Hours Bill.  I have been circularised from every town in my county by a branch of the Distributive Workers' Union.  I had not heard previously that they were organised at all in Kerry. At all events in the last couple of months they have wakened and bombarded us with resolutions about shop hours and hours for clerks.  I do not know when this Bill that the Minister has promised will come along or <Col N="1519" /> whether we will get it this session or not, but it will be a relief to the Deputies when it does come along.  If the Bill succeeds in preventing the present exploitation of young people that I am informed is going on, I would certainly be very strongly in its support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody with whom I have been speaking about this Bill so far, I welcome its introduction. I welcome it particularly from the standpoint that Deputy Norton has so ably put up.  There is no necessity for me to go over the ground covered by Deputy Norton.  We have heard from the Labour Party on many occasions as to the conditions of labour in the new factories.  I am sure it is in the interests of everybody that those conditions should be rectified.  I would like to know from the Minister whether the Class A factories which exist at present will be the standard to which other factories will be expected to conform?  I am told that in addition to the Class A factories we have Class C2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, though we have not had it definitely from the Minister, that the Bill covers the activities in the building and contract trades.  These trades, to my mind, create a difficulty which will have to be dealt with later in the Bill, because you will be making regulations for full-time employees which will have to extend to casual employment. That is one of the unfortunate things in the building trade, that employment in it is casual.  The building trade is a very good trade for employment and its conditions are good.  It has long associations and long-standing rules with the trades unions.  But it is casual employment.  It will be difficult to deal effectively with the points that will arise on this Bill in connection with the building trade, which is a very important trade in every country, and is certainly a very important trade in this country at present.  It will be very difficult to bring this trade into full harmony with full-time employment in factories.  The transport industry is apparently excepted from this Bill. <Col N="1520" /> That again creates a difficulty.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that transport is closely linked up with all employment and particularly with employment in the building trade into which transport enters very largely.  If we have a Bill which will regulate all the conditions of employment outside transport, then the position arises that if transport is still left unsettled, it will cause a difficulty for the building trade.  In that connection, I would like to support the matter that was raised by Deputy Norton&mdash;that we should, as far as possible, have a picture of the succeeding Bills which the Minister has mentioned, before the Committee Stage of this Bill is dealt with, so that matters can be harmonised.</P>
    <P>The broad view I take of this Bill is that if it is a Bill that would be successful in its working, it will meet the hearty co-operation of all trades unions.  But, on the other hand, if it is a Bill that is put in such a way as something to be avoided as far as possible, it will create great difficulties. That is particularly brought home to my mind in the matter of holidays.  If holidays are to be of any use to the working man and if the conditions of the working man are to be benefited many difficulties will have to be solved first.  Is the man to work for 12 months before he gets his holidays? That will create a great difficulty.  On the other hand, if the employers and workers would like to have something equivalent to the Glasgow Fair Week, it would create a difficulty in regard to portion of the men's time particularly in the building trade which, as I have already said, is a trade of casual employment.  That Glasgow system may somehow qualify him and perhaps help to get over the difficulty that may arise.  These difficulties will be got over, I expect.  I would like to know from the Minister whether it will be a six-day holiday or a 12-day holiday. Deputy Norton says that six additional days should be added to the six days in the Bill and Deputy Lynch suggests 12 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, six days in the Bill, but Deputy Norton pleads for six more; that would be 12 days to be paid for as holidays.  In any examination of the Bill by employers and others with whom I have got in touch, we noticed that the Bill provides for the six-day holiday except in cases where the six-day would include Sunday or a bank holiday.  I take it the Bill provides, as it stands, for six days paid holidays in the year.  Of course, the Minister has taken a note of the cost of this Bill in connection with housing.  I need not give him any figures in regard to that.  He is acquainted with that side of the matter himself, but it will add a definite extra cost to building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overtime in factories and in the building trade is a matter that will need very careful and sympathetic consideration by all interests.  Quite recently, I have had to deal with considerable factory work of which the Minister is aware.  It was necessary to carry through certain works during the factory holidays and during very rushed conditions, in order that the factory could restart again after its normal holiday.  That is a matter that can be provided for by application to the Minister, provided the information is available in time.  We have had a rather striking case of overtime work in Dublin lately, consequent with enormous advertisement to the Hospitals Sweep and to the contractors engaged.  That was a case where a big fire occurred.  I take it the Minister can make provision to meet such cases, but the difficulty would be that it would not admit of the week's delay or anything of the nature of the delays that occur in other directions in the Minister's Department.  Immediate consideration of the overtime conditions would be required, and the facilities should be given at once without any delay.  In some of the factories of which I have knowledge and with which the Minister is friendly in the constituency that we both represent, there are certain processes of manufacture which necessitate overtime.  That applies to a very small proportion of the factory workers but it is an essential portion of the <Col N="1522" /> manufacture.  I take it the Minister will carefully consider these matters and not put any great handicap in the way of dealing with the factory work.</P>
    <P>There are also rush periods in factories.  In factories in Dublin we get a Christmas rush.  You cannot stock perishable articles beyond a certain limit which covers a very few days, and when the rush comes you will not be able to supply the goods to the people unless facilities are given to cover this.  It does not seem to me to create any great difficulty, because the workers on overtime will be working under proper conditions, at the proper hours, and ample provision will be made for holidays at other times.</P>
    <P>In all factories the question of repairs to machinery is a very serious item.  A break-down in machinery may be easily dealt with and the factory kept efficient the following day by the employment of overtime.  That, of course, is a matter of efficiency and I am quite sure the Minister has it in view and will deal with it on proper lines.  Of course, it would be an appalling thing if the fitters in a factory could not work overtime to enable the staff to carry on work the following day.</P>
    <P>I think the matter I have already raised as regards the inclusion of Sundays and bank holidays in the period of six days, which I think is the provision in the Bill, is not quite fair to the workers.  If possible, a worker should be able to take the advantage of, say, Easter Sunday and the following day in his holiday and get the six days in addition and thus get a reasonable holiday.  Therefore, I think that the Sunday should not be included in the holidays and that the six days' holiday agreed upon should be paid for, if it is decided upon, but that it should be possible for the worker to get a better holiday by leaving on the Saturday and getting the Sunday and the Monday.</P>
    <P>A peculiar case was put to me and I put it to the Minister as it came to me: will it be possible for a worker to take six days' pay instead of taking the holiday?  That has already been applied for by some workers.  It is quite conceivable that it would be a <Col N="1523" /> godsend for the worker who had a sick family to get an extra week's wages.  If his work is outdoor work, he may not require the holiday if his health is good, and it may be a godsend to him to have facilities for dealing with that in another way.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take special note of the question of the partially continuous process.  I think he has already been written to in connection with it.  There is also a difficulty in some factories with regard to the meal hour.  When some processes are started, it is essential that they should go through the whole day shift continuously. That is met by sending out the employees at different hours to their meals and I take it there will not be any objection to that under the Bill.  It is an essential thing in the factory that the running should be kept up continuously for the whole day's work.</P>
    <P>There is also a point in connection with the building trade which is very important in order to make this Bill a success.  It is not intended, I take it, by any Party to put a hardship on any section of the community in the carrying out of the Bill.  In cases where contracts have to be made 12 or 18 months ahead it is essential that an adjustment should be made and that the extra cost involved should be considered and dealt with.  Some contracts run into two years.  If provision is made for dealing with this matter there will be no hardship involved, but if no provision is made a very serious tax will be imposed.</P>
    <P>The most important matter I have to mention on this stage of the Bill is that referred to by Deputy Norton, and that is allowing sufficient time to elapse so that those engaged in industry may get in touch with the Minister or with their representatives in this House in order that the House will have a true appreciation of the difficulties that may be met with and decided upon the best way of getting over those difficulties.  I do not put this forward in any spirit of creating difficulties for the passage of the Bill, which I have no doubt will pass, but <Col N="1524" /> if the Bill is to be 100 per cent. efficient, all the information should be before the House, and the matter should be dealt with in this House in as permanent a way as possible, rather than letting it go to the other House and discovering difficulties which eventually will have to be met.</P>

If there had been in that factory in its initial stages bad conditions.  I am happy to announce that those conditions seem to have gone.  I visited the place the other day and those conditions no longer apply.  This employer has brought in tons upon tons of heavy machinery and is giving work, I believe, to 40 men.  I would be glad if Deputy Norton would visit the place himself.  This employer has asked me to invite him.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to go with him.  This Bill apparently has the sympathy of the whole House. Although it is a simple Bill, it is probably the most difficult that this House has been asked to consider.  Its ramifications are extraordinarily wide. Probably it will have a very big influence in bettering the conditions that exist in industry, but it is wrong to say, as Deputy Norton said, when he started like a howling storm, that every industry in this country conducted business more or less under conditions that were a scandal to the country.</P>

      <P>One would gather that from his opening remarks.  Deputy Davin should keep quiet.  As he came to the end of his speech, Deputy Norton said something kind of the employers.  Deputy Norton can understand that an interest in labour is not confined to the Labour Benches.  There are others who have the social welfare of labour as much at heart as many of the Deputies on the Labour Benches.  Not only do they show that by giving good employment and by trying to bring about good conditions but in their spare time, when they need not do it, they show an interest in labour.  I challenge Deputy Norton to come to any part of Kildare and to meet me on any platform on that question.  I hope in future we will get on better in this House when it comes to a question of labour and employer or business and industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton seems to have got great credit from other speakers.  He seems to be the one bright spot so far as regards this Bill.  In the beginning of his speech he took us back to the days when the 12-hour day was introduced in England, and said that it was thought that England, with her battleships and victorious armies, was lost, that the power, stability and strength of Britain would be weakened by the introduction of the 12-hour day.  What all that had to do with this little green piece of paper I do not know.  By degrees we were taken to Washington, and then to the Bureau of Labour at the League of Nations.  Then we had references to rationalisation and mechanisation of industry.  We did not get very far in that.  Back we came to the question of over-production and under-consumption, and the explanation that all these new laws and regulations to bring about proper conditions in industry ultimately brought about a condition of affairs where we had over-production to such an extent that the world was not able to consume as much as was produced.  Instead of the improvement we have a lot of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> However, if this Bill is to go into the question of the stabilisation of production by means of which industry is to be so controlled that equality of brains is to be found and equality of brawn is to be supplied and every single industry will produce just enough to meet consumption, I congratulate the Minister on having achieved a miracle. But, unfortunately, all those pious hopes with which Deputy Norton started his speech were tailed off.  The Deputy drifted away and the howling storm became a very small breeze indeed. The first thing I would like to ask the Minister is as to the question of the agreement that will be made.  It would seem that some previous speaker suggested that in the event of an agreement made and solemnly entered into between employer and worker and being disputed by one side or the other it would be taken to a court of arbitration for decision and that decision need only be binding on one side.  In other words, Deputy Norton would seem to want it both ways.  The Labour Party know very well that, even with the best organised labour, where you have an agreement duly signed, sometimes they themselves cannot get men to carry out that agreement if they choose not to do it.  I was wondering how the Minister intends to carry out an agreement where men, whether organised or unorganised, intend to cast aside the award of arbitration&mdash;how he can enforce the decision and get the men to return to work.  It cannot be done.  I would like that the agreement suggested in this Bill should be more fully explained. I would not be so foolish as to say that that is a general habit.  On the contrary, it is not, but I know that it exists.  The whole crux of this thing is, how you are going to get good, efficient and happy labour, men who will not strike and who will take an interest in their employer's business and help him in competition.  I hope that this Bill is not going to bring about socialisation of business, where initiative is to be destroyed and nobody will enter into private competition because of rules and regulations. If that was to result from the Bill, <Col N="1527" /> then it would be one of the worst measures ever introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting it is a section, but I am suggesting that if these conditions are brought about it would do a lot to stultify private enterprise and to kill private initiative.</P>
      <P>Labour in this country deserves well of this House, and deserves the fullest consideration from the members of all Parties.  It should be the desire of Deputies to give all the help they can to the Minister and his advisers to improve the Bill; to make it as good a one as possible for labour.  In order to do that it is not necessary that anybody should come into this House in the name of labour.  Those who are not here under that name are, I am sure, quite prepared to fight for labour, if necessary.  I hope that the House will consider this Bill in a non-party spirit, and that Deputies will act fearlessly and courageously in putting forward suggestions that will result in making it a really good Bill, suggestions which, I hope, the Minister may see his way to accept.  Members of the House in doing that will be doing a good turn to the workers of the country.</P>
      <P>I desire to repeat what I said earlier, that the vast majority of employers in this country are a fine body of decent Irishmen.  They deserve every encouragement.  I am quite satisfied that Mr. Milroy, the Chairman of the Federation of Irish Industries, who was referred to in the course of this debate and of whom it was said that on some occasion or other he referred to the scandalous and unhygienic conditions that prevailed, to juvenile labour, and to wretched rates of wages, had in mind, if he ever made such a statement, very few employers indeed.  I am sorry that the statements that he is supposed to have made were not put before the House more clearly, and that some of those employers he was supposed to be referring to were not named.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles underlying the Conditions of Employment <Col N="1528" /> Bill, which has been introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are such as to command the support of everybody.  We all want better working conditions for everyone.  Every liberal man in public life in any country of the world desires to see social services improved, but in that connection, above all other connections, I think hypocrisy is loathsome.  We are all summoned here to fall down in adoration and to proclaim the Minister for Industry and Commerce as the greatest and most liberal man that has ever come to the country because he introduces the Conditions of Employment Bill at this stage; because he goes on record as believing that conditions which the Trade Board Acts envisaged 20 or 30 years ago are to be put into operation and a Bill is to be introduced here to save working conditions and the rates of pay for a limited section of the community.  That far we are all with him, but the astonishing thing is that at that juncture he stops.  We are all meant to forget that the same Minister, who is introducing legislation of that character, is a member of a Government which, by its policy, has reduced 80 per cent. of the people to conditions of slavery that no trade board that ever was set up would tolerate for half an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate object of this Bill is to provide a 40-hour week for working men at trade union rates of pay.  It is an objective dovoutly to be desired by everyone who has the best interests of the country at heart, but how can you expect to get the enthusiasm behind a scheme of that character which is necessary to make it a success from men who themselves are working 14 hours a day and 16 hours a day on the small farms of this country, and are not even getting a trade union wage, or a living wage, out of it: men who are going home hungry, and when they go home find the bailiff on their doorstep prepared to take away their furniture, their cattle or whatever they can get, and who are told, if they complain of that, that they are playing England's game and are sabotaging the State. Anyone who dares to raise his voice in this House or in the country in <Col N="1529" /> their defence is told by the President of the Executive Council with a brazen-faced impudence that is characteristic of the man that they are sabotaging the country.</P>

      <P>We are asked here, as I have said, to join in a pæan of praise to the Minister for Industry and Commerce inasmuch as he is providing in this Bill better conditions for the working classes of this country, while at the same time we have tens of thousands of men in the country working 12 and 14 hours a day for 21/- a week and less, and we do not hear a word about them.  If we do venture to say a word about them, or about the concatenation of events that brought that situation about, we are told by the President of the Executive Council, with a brazen-faced audacity which is characteristic of the man, that we are sabotaging the State: sabotaging the State because we try to point out to men who can be guilty of the folly of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been guilty, that if they proceed along the present lines they will destroy the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No man in this House is so foolish as to imagine that we can improve the conditions of workers in any branch of industry, whether it be agriculture or the manufacture of elastic or hosiery or anything else, unless the wealth of the country is conserved, and unless the purchasing power of our people is maintained.  We are deliberately building up in this country social services and the amelioration of working conditions which, if the present policy continues, we will be unable to maintain, and what I am trying to point out to the Minister and to the House now is that it is absolutely worthless to be enacting legislation of this character unless we can put it into force and, having put it into force, unless we can keep it in force.  All of us are glad to see a Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, an Old Age Pensions Act, a Blind Persons' Pensions Act, shorter hours of work and higher standards of pay, but are people so blind or so foolish as to imagine that we can maintain these things in this country if the <Col N="1531" /> whole economic structure of the State is to be torn down about our ears?</P>

      <P>I do not desire to argue with the Chair.  The Minister, in introducing this Bill, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I present this Bill to the House for acceptance because it is desired.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We all agree with that.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I introduced this Bill to the House because it is practical and the machinery will work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We all agree with that.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that the State can and must afford it; if there is to be industrial development, we want it to be of the right kind; there is no use in having industrial development under slave conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say is: Yes, the Bill is desirable, we have no doubt your Department will be able to operate it; we know that if you would only conduct yourself like a sane man, the country could afford it but we warn you that you are depriving the people of the benefit of this desirable, practical legislation by destroying the means by which it can be put into operation. I am arguing that it is a travesty and a fraud to pass legislation of this kind unless we sincerely and honestly mean to put it into operation and can see our way to do it.  We cannot put it into operation if we have not the means to do so.  Surely, I must argue with the House that if this is all of a piece with the other social legislation which we all are anxious to see put into operation, with the other Bills which the Minister has adumbrated and which are to deal with shops and a variety of trades, it is madness to be putting up <Col N="1532" /> a scheme of this character if we do not, at the same time, make prudent provision for its financing.  The Budget debate has revealed that our resources are dwindling.  Every honest man in the country knows the reasons why our resources are dwindling.  It is because a dummy sits there as Minister for Agriculture and an active politician occupies the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Whenever the interests of the farmer or the farm labourer are at stake, the Minister for Agriculture sits like a dummy and allows himself to be kicked here and there by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the President of the Executive Council or whoever desires to do it.  These gentlemen fondly imagine they can continue to do that and, at the same time, build up a better condition of things for that section of the community for which they are responsible. They cannot.  They thought they could do that for the old age pensioners.  They thought they could do it for the unemployed.  The Labour Party thought they could do it, too. Now, having co-operated with the Government in building up what they believed to be a most desirable system of social services, they have discovered that they allowed the sources of revenue which were to finance these social services to be destroyed.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity that Deputy Dillon did not participate in the discussion on this measure earlier, as he would have saved a great deal of wasted effort.  I am sure that the Minister would have withdrawn the Bill without more ado on being warned so seriously and so solemnly by Deputy Dillon, and that he would not waste the time of the House or the country by going forward with the measure. Previous to Deputy Dillon's arrival, the measure was welcomed by every section and every interest in the House.  Constructive suggestions were put forward by people who had studied the measure in the hope of improving it and making it more workable and more suited for the purpose for which it was designed.  With the arrival of Deputy Dillon, we were swept clean away.  He raised his voice, following the example from the Gallery which was too good to be lost.  He showed how he could raise his voice without the least relevance to the motion under discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon attacked the Minister simply because he introduced reforms which were anticipated 30 years ago by the trade boards. There is nothing, he said, at all in them to shout about and there is nothing in them on which the Minister should be lionised.  Deputy Dillon forgot at first, but discovered later, that the Bill brought some advantage to the workers and his natural antipathy came to the top.  The Deputy sometimes poses as the workers' friend. May the Lord save the workers from friends like Deputy Dillon.  We know something about friends of his ilk.  We had another contribution from Deputy Minch, who hung on patiently to get an opportunity not of helping the measure but of getting after Deputy Norton because he dared to refer to <Col N="1535" /> one industry in Monasterevan which was not being carried on on lines that could be justified by any decent employer.  Deputy Minch assured us that, since his recent visit, everything was all right.  We are only awaiting the declaration of the day when Deputy Minch, Norton &amp; Co., will go down on an excursion to Monasterevan to see the happy conditions of the workers there.  I am sure we shall all be glad to accompany them.  Deputy Minch accused Deputy Norton of raising a &ldquo;howling storm&rdquo; about this matter, but Deputy Norton's &ldquo;howling storm&rdquo; faded into a gentle zephyr before the onslaught of Deputy Minch.  His one fear is that Deputy Norton is going to introduce a socialisation of industry which, he prophesies, will be the ruination of the country, from one angle, just as ruination from a different angle has been prophesied by Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>He would much prefer, I am sure, to allow the existing condition of things to obtain where each and every employer would utilise his advantages and opportunities to exploit the unfortunate workers in unfair competition with fellow-competitors in the trade.  Because this measure definitely stops that, and puts employers on a fair and level basis and ensures a decent standard of employment when tendering for contracts in that particular form of industry, Deputy Minch is afraid of his life that there is going to be a system of socialisation introduced which will have a deleterious and paralysing effect on the country. Such suggestions are certainly not very helpful.  Useful suggestions were made by Deputy Beckett, a man who has given study to the question, and is deeply interested in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter and that is in connection with Sunday being introduced as part of the holiday.  I do not think I read the section as Deputy Beckett did. From my reading I think the intention is that when Sunday or a public holiday intervenes in the six days, it does not count as one of the six days. If that were not so it would be a pity.  I think it should not be <Col N="1536" /> included.  Another point is in connection with the leaving out of the Bill of the transport industry. Clause (c) of Section 3 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;warehousing goods in any warehouse in which mechanical power is used for the movement of goods or in which goods are lifted by any mechanical appliance whether such appliance is or is not actuated by mechanical power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the transport industry as a whole is not included I can visualise great difficulties arising in railway depots where cranes and mechanical appliances are used regularly when lifting and handling goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will apply to railway employees other than the traffic grades.  It will apply to railway workers employed in railway shops or doing any other form of work.  It is only people engaged in traffic operations are not covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was on.  The people I am referring to are goods porters engaged in traffic operations and the handling and loading of waggons.  They are distinct from shop workers and, naturally, fall into the traffic category.  In goods stores and places of that kind the traffic employees of the railway are engaged in such work and I see an anomaly arising if the position is not cleared up.  In some stores there will be no mechanical appliances and goods will be handled on different conditions to those obtaining in other places.  I should like the Minister to look into that position.  I think Deputy Norton has fully covered the ground from the point of view of the Labour Party.  We welcome this Bill as a definite indication of the Government's intention to advance, improve and standardise the condition of the workers in industry.  We do not think it has been introduced too soon. If anything it is belated but, having regard to conditions, we welcome it now.  I believe that if the Minister gives attention to the points that have been placed before him, as to conditions and the effect of registration of agreements, and allows time for <Col N="1537" /> consultation with those who have given the greater part of their lives to the work, including the members of the Trades Union Congress, I am sure the measure will meet with a general feeling of agreement in the House, and will be a welcome boon to employees and to the country when worked in conjunction with the further measures that are promised. We are not dismal or gloomy about the forebodings of Deputy Dillon. We think the country will stand the strain if it is given a fair chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

      <P>So many Deputies have spoken and dealt with this Bill that very little remains to be done except to say that if the provisions of the Bill are carried out it can do some good, in so far as it improves the conditions of people in some industries, and in making certain employers observe decent conditions and pay a decent rate of wages.  Although Deputy Dillon has been severely criticised as being unfriendly to the provisions of the Bill, as a worker accustomed to hard work, I would issue a warning to the Minister, to members of the Government, and particularly to the members of the Labour Party, that the Bill is not going to be the heaven-sent thing to working men that they are trying to make out it will be.  In fact, I am afraid it will be like the Apprenticeship Bill which set out grand conditions and provisions for work that does not exist.  We were then told grand things about working conditions for work that does not exist.  When speaking on a Bill of this nature we must take into consideration the general conditions prevailing not only in the industrial sphere but in every other sphere in the country.  You, Sir, have ruled Deputy Dillon out on one point and I am not going to pursue that any further.  I repeat with all the emphasis I can command, as one who really knows something about working conditions and hard work, that whilst this Bill will be welcomed in so far as certain industries are concerned, it is going to have very little effect in regard to the solution of one of the great problems that <Col N="1538" /> is engaging the attention not only of this Government but of every Government, unemployment.  It has been stated that a reduction of working hours is going to relieve unemployment and provide good conditions and everything else.  In my opinion that is a fallacy.  It has been proved a fallacy in other countries.  I am sure it will be a fallacy here.  However, as the Bill has been introduced I will support the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>I am not enamoured that many of the sections will carry out in full the intention the Minister had in framing them, until everybody recognises the fact that we are a small country, and that there is no use introducing Bills for the purpose of creating work or making grand conditions for work that does not exist.  It reminds me of a person who invites one to dinner and puts silver spoons on the table while there is nothing but red herrings on the plates.  It will be found that it will be like that in a great many things here.  We will have lovely rules for everything.  It is work I want to see, work for the thousands of men who now are unemployed.  Although he was ruled out of order, that was the point behind Deputy Dillon's speech to-day.  Grand conditions and grand arrangements for men who are in constant work but nothing about men who are unemployed!  That is what I want Deputies and everyone in the country to face up to.  While the introduction of Bills of this kind may be good in their own way, they are not going to have any effect on the one great problem, unemployment.</P>

      <P>There is very little necessity for me to say much at this stage arising out of the discussion on the Second Reading.  Most of the <Col N="1539" /> points that Deputies referred to relate to particular proposals in the Bill which can be discussed more adequately on the Committee Stage.  I am naturally very gratified by the reception it has received from all Parties in the House and from Deputies representative of various interests.  It will help us to mould the Bill into shape, so as to make it the basis of additional legislation for the regulation of employment, to know that it has received that good-will from all sections.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been a difficult one to prepare.  It appears simple in its framework, but, naturally, there are many points at which its administration and application to present day conditions are going to create difficulties, and we will not be able to guard against dangers unless we get the combined wisdom of persons representative of the trade union movement and persons representative of employers brought to bear upon it.  I am, therefore, fully agreeable to the suggestion made by Deputy Norton, and supported by Deputy Beckett, that we should have at least three weeks between Second Reading and Committee Stages. I am willing to move that the Committee Stage be taken at the commencement of the week three weeks from this.</P>

    <P>So far as previous consultation with interested parties is concerned, the Trade Union Congress and other organisations were aware that legislation of this kind was in contemplation. There was, however, formal consultation with neither the Trade Union Congress nor the Federation of Saorstát Industries or any other body, although the Trade Union Congress, alone of the interested bodies, did in fact submit in memorandum form a series of proposals indicating the provisions they would wish to have embodied in the measure.  The measure does not in many respects conform to these proposals, although in many others it does.  The particular memorandum submitted by the congress covered matters that do not properly come within this Bill, but which will properly come within the Factories and Workshops <Col N="1540" /> Bill, to be introduced in this session.</P>

No doubt, I am going to get them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>To clear up the point, would the Minister say whether the provisions of this Bill were discussed with him, formally or informally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither.  It is true that in some respects the provisions of the Bill will not automatically effect a change in the conditions under which many industrial workers are employed. To a great extent, the measure is largely an enabling measure and is intended to confer power on the Department of Industry and Commerce to effect these changes after the consultations provided for with the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the workers.  I think it would be very bad policy to provide in the Bill for a maximum working week of forty hours, or any other <Col N="1541" /> maximum working week, which would involve an immediate change in every industry, when it was not possible for us to examine the conditions of each industry, to estimate the effect of the change upon the prices of the commodities, upon employment, upon the importation of goods into the Saorstát, and upon any other factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with matters of this kind there are many things that have to be taken into consideration, and we can only do that industry by industry, in consultation with the parties who have the intimate knowledge of the industry which will be necessary when regulations are being framed.  Therefore, the scheme of the Bill provides for the fixation of maximum hours of work on the lines of the Washington Convention, with provision for the making of regulations in respect of particular forms of industrial work with regard to lower maximum hours and other alterations of working conditions. It is true that there are bad employers; it is true that there are undesirable types of factories; and it is true that there are bad wages paid; but it is not true that these employers or these types of factories are representative of Saorstát industry as a whole.  Deputy Norton was in a bit of a difficulty in speaking, and I sympathise with him.  He had frequently spoken here about the bad conditions prevailing in industry when it was in the interest of his Party to do so. In the case of this Bill, it is in the interests of his Party to say that it does not go far enough and that he wants the terms of it improved.  In order to put himself into a position to say that, he had in fact to take the line that it does not alter the conditions of employment in industry to any substantial extent.  He cannot be right both ways any more than Deputy Dillon can be when he started his speech by saying that there was nothing new in the Bill and that it only tried to do something which the British Government thought of thirty years ago, and ended up by saying that it was going to produce a catastrophe and a number of other terrible things which he was beginning to <Col N="1542" /> enumerate when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle suppressed him.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say definitely on what date the other Bills will be ready.  The Bill for the condification and amendment of the Factories and Workshops Acts is in course of drafting at the present time and I hope to have it introduced in this session, but I could not give any undertaking that it would in fact be introduced before the Committee Stage of this Bill is taken.  Apart, however, from that Bill, there is nothing in any of the other measures that are contemplated that need affect this measure.  This measure is complete in so far as the classes of workers covered by it are concerned.  The purpose of the other measures, apart from the Factories and Workshops Bill, will be to effect somewhat similar provision in respect of other classes of workers, such as workers employed on transport, in mining, in bakeries, or in commercial occupations.  The need for having separate Bills to deal with these other occupations arises from purely legal considerations.  We have to relate these Bills to Acts which are at present passed and it has happened that mining and transport, for example, have been the subject of separate legislation from the general factories and workshops code, and, consequently, must continue to be dealt with in separate legislation by us for convenience' sake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill affects State employees in so far as they are engaged in the processes set out in Section 3.  It would not cover such persons as the Deputy mentioned&mdash; messengers in the Post Office and persons engaged in commercial work. It relates only to persons engaged in industrial work as defined in the Bill, and so far as State employees are engaged upon industrial work of that kind, they come within the definition in Section 2, which sets out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;industrial undertaking&rdquo; means an undertaking in <Col N="1543" /> which industrial work is carried on by way of trade or for the purposes of gain or for the supply of any public service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will automatically do so.  I do not know if I will have to prosecute the Minister of any other Department in order to enforce the terms of the Bill.  I have no doubt that if any such dispute should arise an amicable settlement can be arranged.</P>
      <P>A number of very useful points were raised by Deputy Beckett and will require consideration.  Whether persons employed in transport work in factories are or should be included in the Bill is one of those points.  The question of provision for the adjustment of contracts is another, and the circumstances that will arise in connection with casual workers in respect of many parts of the Bill will also have to get attention.  In so far as overtime is concerned, the general policy of the Bill is to discourage the working of overtime as a regular policy, but to permit of the working of overtime where special emergency circumstances necessitate it, or where the seasonal nature of the particular trade makes it necessary.  In such cases a week's notice of the intention to work overtime is provided for in the Bill, and I have some doubts as to whether that is a practicable arrangement. There are two things to be provided for in that connection.  One is the convenience of the employer who may have to work overtime unexpectedly in order to deal with an emergency situation, and the other is the administrative arrangements which have to be made in the Department to ensure that the provisions of the Act are being complied with.  That is a matter which can be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton made, and Deputy Lynch supported, a proposal that the annual holidays period should be increased from six to 12 days.  I <Col N="1544" /> should be somewhat hesitant in doing that without full examination of the consequences of it.  We are making a beginning in the giving to workers of a legal right to annual holidays.  That is going to mean holidays for the first time for many classes of workers.  For example, the workers in railway shops mentioned here have not got holidays under their existing agreements.  They will now become entitled to a week's holidays, with pay, for the first time. That is going to mean a fairly substantial additional charge upon many industries, and although the general view might be in favour of an extension of the holiday period &mdash; I personally am in sympathy with it&mdash;I think we should go forward in that direction only when we are satisfied as to what the consequences are going to be.  Perhaps we could consider an amendment to that particular section of the Bill to provide that the week's holidays, at some subsequent period, might by agreement be extended without the necessity for fresh legislation.</P>
    <P>If we are going to proceed along those lines I think we must know precisely what the consequences are going to be.  The six days holidays provided for in the section must be six consecutive days.  If a Sunday or a public holiday should occur within the six days it simply does not count. The six consecutive days would be six days not counting the Sunday or public holiday, so Deputy Beckett's suggestion is a practicable one&mdash;release the worker on Easter Saturday; his holidays start from the Tuesday and continue into the next week.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the worker from taking a week's pay instead of holidays, in so far as the enforcement of his right to six days' holidays is left to himself.  I am not so sure whether it is desirable that it should be left in this form, but that is a matter which might, perhaps, be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I think that those are the only points which need to be <Col N="1545" /> referred to at this stage, except to mention that in one statement Deputy Lynch seemed to imply that the employment of juvenile labour in factories or industrial work in the Saorstát was a recent development consequent on high tariffs.  That is not correct.  Juvenile labour has been employed for many years, not merely in this but in other countries.  In fact, our statistics show that the proportion of juveniles to adults in insurable employment has not increased, but, on the contrary, has shown a tendency to decrease in recent years. I am not quite clear what Deputy Dillon intended to convey in his remarks.  He said that the Bill was a travesty and a fraud.  I presume, therefore, that he will vote against it. If he does not we must regard himself as a travesty and a fraud.</P>

      <P>The President intervened in this debate last night.  His speech was distinguished for unnecessary heat and the importation of a good deal of unnecessary vigour into a discussion from which, so far, those disturbing qualities have been absent. I rather think that the President was needlessly peevish in the manner in which he took exception to Deputy Davin's statement.  I do not know what it was in Deputy Davin's statement that irritated the President, or whether his irritation was due to the fact that Deputy Good had blessed the Budget.  Nothing that Deputy Davin said seems to me to supply the meaning for all that irritation and peevishness, and I must, therefore, come to the conclusion that Deputy Good's benediction in respect of this Budget is the sole thing which has disturbed the President.  Of course he had good reason to be disturbed by Deputy Good's praise of this Budget.  Deputy <Col N="1546" /> Good, in the course of his broadcast speech on the Budget, said that while business men might object strongly to some specific taxes which had been imposed, it could not be denied that the Minister had succeeded in distributing taxation over a wide field. Of course, Deputy Good was perfectly right when he said that.  The Government has succeeded in distributing taxation over a wide field.  It has succeeded in putting taxation on people who are incapable of bearing it, and it is for that reason that Deputy Good, representing the particular viewpoint which he does represent, finds it possible to make a broadcast speech in which approbation is pretty thickly distributed.  Of course the whole philosophy of Deputy Good in respect of this Budget, and in respect of taxation, comes out in a later portion of the Deputy's broadcast speech.  He said that most business men who are in favour of sound finance would have to compliment the Minister on having the courage to tell the people that if they wanted certain services they must pay for them.  In other words if old age pensioners are to continue getting the old age pension they must have a tax on tea, on sugar, on flour, on bread and on coal.  Deputy Good goes on to say that the Minister had the courage to impose all-round taxation to emphasise the fact that those services must be paid for.  I do not know whether the Minister takes Deputy Good's references to his courage as bouquets.  I do not know whether the Minister takes it as a bouquet that he has felt it necessary to impose taxation on tea, sugar, wheat and coal, in order to impress on old age pensioners and the recipients of unemployment assistance benefit that they must pay for the services which they get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President complained because Deputy Davin said that old age pensioners and recipients of unemployment assistance benefit had to bear a burden under the Budget.  It is perfectly obvious to everybody that the recipients of unemployment assistance benefit, or those who were denied the receipt of unemployment assistance benefit because of the Budget provisions, <Col N="1547" /> and potential claimants for old age pensions will in future have to bear a burden.  Not only will they have to bear a particularised burden in respect of unemployment assistance and old age pensions, but they will have to bear a burden in respect of various other imposts which are made in this Budget.  The saving of £100,000 in respect of old age pensions looks to me to be a measure of economy rather than a measure of curing abuse.  If there were evidence of any widespread abuse there might be a case for dealing with the abuse; but this proposal to save £100,000 is introduced at a time when we are told it is absolutely necessary to raise the money this way for budgetary purposes and not for the purpose of curing any abuse.</P>
    <P>In respect to the Unemployment Assistance Act, there is a naked confession in the Minister's statement as to how the money is going to be saved.  In his statement the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As employment upon relief works financed out of public funds in whole or in part will be confined to persons entitled to receive unemployment assistance, and as, since the Estimate was prepared, two Employment Period Orders have been made, and as it has also been decided to introduce amending legislation affecting various changes in the Unemployment Assistance Act, the combined effect of which will reduce expenditure, I have decided, with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the figure for unemployment assistance may be reduced by £300,000, that is from £1,600,000 to £1,300,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us examine the significance of this statement.  It is clear that the giving of preference to persons on relief schemes is not going to reduce expenditure to any great extent in respect of unemployment assistance benefit, because that preference was there last year and it will be there this year and these factors will be common to both years and no special reduction may be looked for in that respect.  But there are going to be two Employment <Col N="1548" /> Period Orders in respect of two periods of the year during which persons formerly entitled to unemployment assistance benefit will not be able to get that benefit.</P>
    <P>We had a statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce here recently that these Employment Period Orders were imposed willy nilly, that there was no special investigation made to ascertain whether in fact employment would be available for the persons concerned, that the Minister had no evidence that such employment would, in fact, be available and that the Employment Period Orders were imposed in order to deprive those persons of benefit, the belief being that the employment might be available or that they might be able to get employment on the land. I think before the Minister imposed these Orders there ought to have been a much more thorough examination of the problem and the circumstances existing in the years to which these Orders would apply and there ought to have been a much more close and sympathetic examination of the needs of the persons affected.  However, the Employment Period Orders are going to contribute a saving in respect to unemployment assistance and the amending legislation which is to be introduced, and which many people thought would be utilised to improve the rates of benefit, is put into the Minister's statement as one of the factors which will make a contribution to the saving of £300,000 on unemployment assistance benefit this year.  Is it not patent to everybody that there will be £300,000 less for unemployment assistance benefit?  Can the Ministry say they have made any examination of the unemployment assistance problem such as would justify them in stating that there will genuinely be a lesser demand to the extent of £300,000 for benefit this year than existed last year or than exists at the moment?</P>
    <P>If Deputy Davin required any corroboration for his statement that old age pensioners and recipients of unemployment assistance benefit would have heavy burdens placed upon them, and if he wanted to make a general statement that the body of workers in <Col N="1549" /> the country would have new burdens placed upon them, surely the Press of the last few days has supplied convincing evidence in that respect?  We have the sugar tax, which has resulted in the price being increased.  Not only will sugar be increased, but all the commodities, including jam, of which sugar is an essential part, will also be subject to an increase.  We will have a rise in tea prices, and the tax on wheat has already begun to show itself in the form of an increase in the price of the loaf.  The coal tax of 5/- is going to remain.  Some time ago it was admitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the price of coal on board at the city port was 17/- per ton.  That was before the coal-cattle pact.  The present price of coal delivered in similar circumstances is 22/- a ton, and on that coal a duty of 5/- per ton is imposed, so that in respect of the consumption of British coal the consumer is paying 10/- per ton more than before the coal-cattle pact.</P>
    <P>No reference to the tax on coal imports would be complete without a reference to the circumstances under which the tax was first imposed.  In the first instance that tax was imposed to keep out British coal, and at that time an alternative supply of coal was made available to the people.  The effect of making available to the people that alternative supply was to give them coal at a price not higher but in some instances less than they paid for British coal.  Now the Ministry have changed their whole policy in that respect.  They are now giving a 90 or 95 per cent. preference to Britain in respect of all our coal imports.  The alternative source of coal supplies is cut off, and we are now only permitted to import coal which is subject to duty of 5/- a ton.  What was put on in the first instance to keep British coal out of the market is now being utilised as a penal tax upon the only coal which the people can consume.  It is very unfair that a tax imposed in certain circumstances should be utilised as a revenue raising tax now.</P>
    <P>We have another novelty in the Budget by which houses are to be <Col N="1550" /> valued in future for income tax purposes at five-fourths of their present valuation.  I would like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that many of these houses built in recent years, especially in Dublin City, are being purchased on the hire-purchase system by the tenants.  All of these houses which have been erected in recent years have been valued in the light of modern circumstances and conditions.  It is obviously unfair to ask the occupants of a house which was erected during the last ten years and which was valued under modern circumstances to consent to a revaluation based upon five-fourths of the existing valuation for income tax purposes.  In any case the whole method of valuing houses in a Budget statement is, in my view, a questionable novelty and the Minister might not have prejudged the issue of imposing an additional valuation on the houses for income tax purposes in the manner adopted.  If houses are not bearing a proper valuation at present let us have an inquiry into the valuation; but to anticipate the result of the valuation in this manner seems to me to be unfair in principle and to rule out the possibility that some of the houses may be reduced in valuation under any examination that may be instituted.</P>
    <P>Let us take stock of these imposts&mdash; a tax on sugar, a tax on tea, a tax on coal, a tax on wheat, as well as the reduction in unemployment assisttance benefit, and more stringent regulations, based upon the needs of the Exchequer rather than on known cases of abuse, are to be applied in respect of old age pensions.  If we examine the effect of these imposts on old age pensioners, on persons in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit, on persons in receipt of 24/- a week under minor relief schemes, or on the forestry workers referred to by Deputy Davin yesterday, we will find that these are the people who are going to bear the heaviest burdens in respect of these new imposts.</P>
    <P>Speaking yesterday, a Deputy on the Government Benches laid down this philosophy in respect of the taxable <Col N="1551" /> capacity of the country.  He said that he would define the taxable capacity of the country as the amount of the total income over the income which was required for the subsistence of its population.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that 24/- a week is a subsistence level for any citizen in the community&mdash;although, of course, everybody knows that it is far from being a subsistence level&mdash;but let us assume, for argument's sake, that it is the subsistence level and that it has been regarded as a subsistence level: What will be the effect of these new imposts on a person who is compelled to tolerate that standard of subsistence? The obvious effect of imposing a tax on tea, sugar, tobacco, coal, flour and bread, will be to drive that person down below the subsistence level; and if, as was suggested yesterday, you have a subsistence level, and if you invade that subsistence level by imposing new taxes on the people who are compelled to exist at that level, then the result, inevitably, will be to force them down below that level.  It will mean that every person in receipt of a small income, on which he is barely able to subsist at the moment, will have a still smaller income when these new burdens are imposed.  Every person who has had, in existing circumstances, to subsist on that small income, will find it harder to do so.  He will have to face more burdens and more hardships as a result of these new burdens and there will be less food for his family.  That is the inevitable effect of imposing this new taxation on small incomes which are at present inadequate to provide decent subsistence for the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made what I think was a heroic effort to explain the Budget the other evening.  He talked about the Government's industrial policy and about all the additional people who were being put into employment as a result of that policy.  While I concede that additional people have been put into employment and, while certain towns and cities may have derived certain benefits from an industrial policy which has resulted in <Col N="1552" /> new sources of employment being made available, we have got to remember that there are a great many places in the country where no benefit has been derived as a result of the Government's industrial policy.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in the rural areas, one finds it difficult to produce any instance where rural areas have benefited by any policy of creating new industries, whether by means of tariffs or by any other means.  What, then, is the effect of this Budget on these small towns and the rural areas?  They have not felt any benefit from the industrial revival but, apparently, they are still expected to make a contribution in the form of additional taxes in order that the Government may pursue an industrial policy which, at any rate so far, has conferred no benefits on them.  Can anybody doubt that the imposition of these new duties on foodstuffs and coal will have the effect of still further depressing the standard of living of the workers in the small towns and the rural areas?</P>
    <P>In my view, the difficulties referred to by the Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget statement, and the difficulties referred to by other speakers from the Government Benches, in respect of the balancing of the Budget this year, arise mainly, if not solely, out of last year's spectacular gesture in cutting income tax.  Last year we had a dramatic gesture from the Minister for Finance in cutting income tax. Obviously, the Minister must have thought that he would be justified in doing so without recourse to taxation of food this year.  Instead, however, we find that the Minister who, last year, cut income tax, finds it necessary this year to impose fresh taxation on food. I want to ask the House, and the members of the Government Party in particular, to look at the remarkable swing to the right which is evidenced in this Budget.  One would think that the Minister for Finance had had long conversations with the banks.  In 1934 income tax was reduced and the tea duty was abolished.  In other words, there was a levelling up and, perhaps, a wider distribution of benefits.  The rich were to have income tax reduced <Col N="1553" /> and the needy section of the community were to have the tea duty abolished. Now, look at 1935!  We find now that the duty on tea is to be restored, while the reduction in income tax is to be continued.  In other words, this year the poor are going to pay more than those who are able to pay income tax.</P>
    <P>In that very change this year, you have clear evidence that the Government, in taking the choice between increasing income tax and putting a tax on the foodstuffs consumed so generally by the poor, have definitely voted in favour of taxation on foodstuffs and leaving the income taxpayers in the position in which they placed them last year.  In a choice between these two alternative forms of taxation, we might well ask ourselves who is the more capable of bearing the burden&mdash;the income taxpayers or the unfortunate people who will be compelled to bear these taxes on food and who are finding it difficult enough already to meet their obligations on their present sources of income?  I should have imagined that, faced with a situation of that kind, the Government would have placed the burden on the back that was broadest and most capable of bearing it.  We had good reason, in any case, to believe that that was the policy of the Government.  Speaking in this House on the 29th April, 1932 (Col. 909, Vol. 41, Parliamentary Debates) the President spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our purpose as a Government is to see that these burdens rest heaviest on the shoulders of people who are best able to bear them and rest lightest on the shoulders of those least able to bear them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1932, shortly after the Government came into office.  The whole philosophy of the Government at that time was to put the burden on the shoulders of the people best able to bear it and to put the lightest burden on the shoulders of the people least able to bear it.  Let us try to reconcile that philosophy with the way things are being done now. Deputy Good has told us that the burden of taxation is being distributed <Col N="1554" /> over a wider field so as to emphasise that certain people must pay for the social services that are to be made available.  In other words, while the President says that he would put the heaviest burdens on the shoulders of those best able to bear them and the lightest burdens on the shoulders of those least able to bear them, we find that by this Budget burdens are being put on the backs of old age pensioners, on the backs of lowly-paid workers, on workers receiving 24/- a week, on old age pensioners and even on forestry workers referred to previously by Deputy Davin.  All these classes are going to have these burdens put upon them.  Are these the best backs to pick out for the imposition of new taxation?  Are these the backs best entitled to bear the burdens?  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to reconcile the philosophy of the President's speech with the burdens imposed by this Budget.  I think the Minister will find it extraordinarily difficult to do so.  Every member of his Party will likewise find it extremely difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>The President's speech last night looked to me as if he wanted to imply that the Labour Party were restricting the development of social services. Lest anybody should hold that misconception I want to say now very definitely and positively that we are anxious that the existing social services should be continued.  We make no apology to anybody for demanding an extension of the existing social services which at present can in no way be described as liberal or extravagant; nor will we make any apology for asking, as the President asked in 1932, that the cost of maintaining these social services, necessary as they are under our present system of society, should be placed on the backs of those most capable of bearing them.  In his statement defending the Budget last night the President said that there was no way in which they could bring up taxation to their expenditure except by the methods suggested by the Minister for Finance, and that if those burdens were extended to all sections of the community it was not because <Col N="1555" /> the Government wanted to put them on, but because they must do so. While there are other Deputies to speak on this debate to-night&mdash;and I understand that the debate is to conclude to-night&mdash;there is one aspect of the President's statement on which I want to speak.  On his statement I want to say that I do not believe it was necessary to impose burdens.  I believe that the money could be found elsewhere.  The introduction of his Budget is a confession of inability and a confession of failure on the part of the Government.  They should have brought in a Budget that would make the wealthier classes pay their contribution towards the cost of government. The President said that it was necessary to tax the food of the poorer classes.  That, in effect, is what the Budget states.  I say I do not believe it was necessary to tax the food of the people by imposing new taxation.  I do not believe it was necessary to raid the Unemployment Assistance Fund. While we as a Labour Party are anxious for progressive, national, social services and that a progressive social policy should be put into operation in this country, on the other hand &mdash;and I speak for my colleagues of the Labour Party in that respect&mdash;we are not going to vote to place burdens on the poor and needy sections of the community while there are other sections with broader backs more capable of bearing these burdens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting to find that this debate should have almost concluded before Deputy Norton decided that he would give his views of the Government's taxation proposals for the year.  It is rather amazing to me to find Deputy Norton after having so often asked for the present scheme for economy into which he has led and is leading the country under Fianna Fáil auspices, now complaining of the taxation needed under that scheme.  He has a scheme of his own&mdash;but he will not now tell us what it is&mdash;for carrying on the affairs of the country.  The Deputy has never thought fit to tell us what that scheme is.  One hates to talk of the plan. <Col N="1556" /> That word has indeed got attached to it a sordid sort of history.  It only occurs now in connection with dishonest promises set forth in the most disgraceful and sordid way in order to cajole not only the Labour Party, but that sort of intelligentsia of the Labour movement.  The Deputy talks of a progressive policy.  To-night, he has found himself making a request for more social services.  He has not faced up to the question of how these social services would be provided if he himself were in office.  He has not thought fit to tell us whither the particular new type of economy, that we are told is to be produced here, is likely to lead the State or whether these social services are to be provided by the very wealthy section of the community only.  It has been said that there is a happy period in a man's life.  It has been said that when a man is going down so quickly and when he has burned so many of his boats that the burning of still another will not affect him in any way.  That is the position of Deputy Norton.  He finds himself swimming in a cold sea of disillusion at the present moment.  But Deputy Norton must remember that he himself helped to put these taxes on the people.  The Deputy told us to-night about the injustice of the coal tax.  But Deputy Norton voted for the coal tax.  The Deputy could go to his unfortunate constituents and say: &ldquo;You are always going to pay a little more for your coal.  For that I can only call you a patriot.&rdquo;  Now he admits he was a complete fool for leading them into that.  The same thing may be said of the tax on sugar. The Deputy did not think of the deprivation caused to the old age pensioner by the tax on his tobacco.  He did not think last week that this deprivation caused by the sugar tax, the tea tax and the tobacco tax in the case of the poor, made it worth his while to vote against the Government.  The Deputy voted last week a couple of times for these taxes.  Deputy Davin was not here to help him in voting for them.</P>

      <P>Very well; the Deputy, however, did not appear here to make any complaint against the coal tax, the bread tax or whether the butter that the poor are sometimes able to put on that bread is to be taxed.  Except that the Deputies will make an odd speech in the House they are doing nothing to prevent the imposition of these taxes on the people. But Deputy Norton is now going to have more than the Post Office Vote in which he can exhaust his energy in belabouring the Government in his speech and then supporting them in every one of these duty impositions. We cannot expect more from Deputy Norton.  I remember when the tax on coal was put on he went to his constituents and when asked for a justification, he said he wanted no justification. It was a thing he had learned in his cradle.  There was no need for him to justify the nationalism that he had about him in his cradle.  His economics were also economics that he had learned in his cradle&mdash;&ldquo;cry and you will get enough.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have purged myself of anything wrong that I said previously and that everything is now right between us.  Let it be remembered that the Labour Party as a group are responsible for the condition of things now brought about.  Have the Labour Party an economic scheme on which to found their social policy?  We know that they have a social policy, that is to ask for more social services. Have they any scheme to make this country better able to bear the burden of social services?  Because, if so, in the dearth of schemes that the Government find themselves suffering from, and in the interest of the country, it is time to have it brought forward.  If one half of the community, the agriculturists, are reduced to the point where they cannot buy as much as they bought before, and if, in addition to that, through a system of tariffs, the prices of manufactured goods in the country go up beyond what they used to be priced at, is it not clear that the town workers inevitably must suffer by the combination of these two circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have on occasions heard Deputy Davin state that there was not as much money circulating amongst the farming community as previously and, therefore, there is not the same purchasing power&mdash;and they represent more than half the community.  I have heard <Col N="1559" /> Deputy Norton say with regard to certain tariffed items, if not all of them, that their costs have gone up.  Let the two of them join in conference outside this House and put these two ideas together and rattle them together and they will certainly come to the conclusion that in the circumstances this country is not getting richer.  They brought that situation about.  They have supported this Government in the economic war.  They can wave the cradle of nationalism in regard to that, but they will not face up to the facts. In the third or fourth year, when the results are now becoming clear and apparent to anybody, they content themselves simply with bemoaning that in an emergency, and a great emergency, which is on the Minister he has found it necessary not to draw any longer from a small group of people, the income tax payers, who are, in fact, in the main, the producers of this country; but that he has to go looking for small sums from a big number of people out of which he is going to get more revenue than by putting a large tax on a relatively small number of people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton is not the only, one who has burned his boats.  The President recently paid a visit to that scheme for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not think it was right to accept responsibility, and attributed it to the fertile brain&mdash; I query the word&mdash;of the Minister for Defence&mdash;the turf business.  The President thought fit to give the industrialists of this country, and through them the people as a whole a lecture.  Listen to this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have not much experience as a people of widespread commercial activity.  We have not any long industrial tradition.  Peoples that have these traditions know that there is no such thing as getting rich quickly.  If they try to do that they are going to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  It is only by strict honesty, keeping to bargains, scrupulously fulfilling contracts, and being on time with orders that we can succeed in business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> Excellent teaching.  We will see the practice in a moment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I were to be asked what is the greatest benefit that can be given to our people by our schools, I would say that it is by teaching the simple virtues of truth, honesty and fair dealing, one with another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We want truth, honesty and fair dealing, one with another, and it is only by scrupulously fulfilling our contracts and keeping to bargains that we are going to succeed.  Let me produce what I call one contract&mdash;the Plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter to be laughed at.  I am dealing with this from the angle of truth, honesty, fair dealing and scrupulously keeping contracts.  We were told about all the things the Fianna Fáil Government were going to do.  I will come to employment later; I will come later still to the agricultural end of it. But, in this plan, there was a definite statement that full derating was going to be given to the people of this country.  Let us think all the time in terms of scrupulous adherence to contracts, and honesty and fair dealing as between ourselves.  I am not going to confine myself to the advertisements.  On the 7th May, 1931, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As Deputy de Valera said, this Party has committed itself to carry out a scheme of full derating.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about what that meant.  The President himself was quoted in this House under date the 27th March as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The overhead charges of the farmers are too heavy for them and must be lightened.  One of the heaviest of these charges is the payment of local rates.  We propose to derate agricultural holdings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have it six or seven times repeated, not from the President only, not from the Minister for Industry and Commerce only, but from the group that are now the Government.  Previously, on the relief of agricultural land debate <Col N="1561" /> the Vice-President told us that there was never a promise to derate, that it was only a phrase used with this meaning: if we save, and we can save, the money from England, there will be available for derating £2,000,000.  He stressed the phrase used in one of the advertisements: &ldquo;Derating can be done for £2,000,000.&rdquo;  That is not what was said precisely by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the President previously.  They promised full derating.  Last night the President said that was not promised. The President, who preaches to the community in the bogs that we want honesty, truth, and fair dealing, last night told us that there was no such promise.  There was this promise: that £2,000,000 would be made available.</P>
    <P>Again let us think in terms of keeping scrupulously to contracts.  The President pretends that that promise to give £2,000,000 to the farmers&mdash;let me leave derating aside&mdash;has been carried out.  The President made that statement last night and was interrupted, and I propose to continue the interruption made last night.  There has been no remission of £2,000,000 to the agriculturists of this country.  The situation at present is in this way different from what it used to be.  In the old days, the farmers paid something like £3,000,000 in annuities.  At the present moment, on their produce in the main, there has been levied, not £3,000,000, but very nearly £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to that £5,000,000, the present Government in this country collects another £2,000,000 or tries to collect another £2,000,000.  So far they have succeeded in getting about £1,330,000.  And the man who definitely promised derating tried to wriggle out of it by saying that he promised that £2,000,000 would be allocated to the relief of the farmers.  He pretends to believe that £2,000,000 has been allocated.  The fact of the matter is that the farmers to-day are paying every penny of the moneys and we hear it gaily said there would be no difficulty in paying the £2,000,000 the Government collects from them or tries to collect from them.  Last night&mdash;again I want to roll this up into the atmosphere <Col N="1562" /> of honesty and fair dealing, truth in statement and propriety in action&mdash;I referred to the President's attitude on this question which can very easily be decided.  Are we or are we not at this moment paying the land annuities to England?  The President said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  For one person I say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I do not think there is any querying of the figures that have been given in the House of Commons, and about which questions have been asked here and replied to affirmatively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not say they were paid.  They said they collected tariffs equivalent to a certain sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is honesty and fair dealing.  This year the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England said that at one time they set out to get the equivalent of the moneys that were withheld and that they expected to get in the year 1935-36 £500,000 more than they set out to get.  Deputy Donnelly will, I suppose, sit and ponder over that and awake to say still that the British are not collecting the moneys.  The Deputy made a useful intervention.  He says they are not collecting these moneys, but are getting something on tariffs. Remember that was foreseen and we were assured that it could not happen. The Minister for Finance told us, on the 14th July, 1932, when this thing was starting:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every organ of economic thought in Great Britain has stressed the fact, that whatsoever the temporary inconvenience caused to Irish producers may be, the tariff whether it be 20 per cent., 40 per cent. or 100 per cent., if they chose to erect it as high as that, would be paid inevitably by the British farmers and consumers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am glad to say, for the sanity of this House, that a member on this side of the House used the word &ldquo;question&rdquo; on that point.  The Minister for Finance continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Moreover the trade relations between this country and Great Britain are such that for every penny piece which she robs from us by a <Col N="1563" /> tariff on our agricultural produce we can recoup ourselves by a tariff upon her manufactures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That wheel has moved around.  Let us see the gyration.  We were not going to pay.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the people who told the country that the British would put on retaliatory tariffs were talking nonsense.  The present Minister for Finance told us that even if they did he could get alternative markets.  And the <i>Irish Press,</i> in its editorial columns, told us that we were the strongest bargaining nation of the world because we had the trade of this country to offer to every nation outside and we could get bargains.  And so we swung into the economic war with England.  The British are in fact collecting the moneys that we said we would withhold. The Minister for Finance told us that if those circumstances did arise the English farmers and consumers would pay every penny of it.  Would he still say that?  He told us further that even if that fond hope was blasted we had another weapon; we could levy off the British manufactured goods as much as was levied off our agricultural products.  Are we doing that? Is there truth and honesty and fair dealing in the people who said all those things?  It is necessary to stress that point, because the one way in which people can still be flogged into a little bit of enthusiasm, when they are thinking mournfully of the tax on tea, sugar, and butter, is by talking to them about Ireland and the great fight that is on.</P>
    <P>Last night, in a debate about which Deputy Norton has passed the proper remark, that it should have been conducted without heat, the President raged about maintaining the national position.  And this Budget, apparently, is in some way fortifying us in our defence of the national position.  Public memories are short.  Let us get back to what the national position was.  We withheld the land annuities.  The British retaliated by tariffs.  There were various movements towards a settlement, and Deputy Norton helped, at any rate, by going to London and <Col N="1564" /> in the end, on a suggestion made first from this side, an attempt was made to have negotiations.  We sent representatives to London.  They came back and it emerged that the suggestion had been made that there should be a negotiating body consisting of two from each side.  That was accepted, and two from each side, without prejudice to the position, were appointed. They were sent to negotiate, and then an awkward crux arose.  This is history and recent history, and people should be clear about it.  The British said: &ldquo;Pay us the money that is in dispute.&rdquo;  And our Government said: &ldquo;No, we will keep it in a suspense account for you.&rdquo;  The British said: &ldquo;We will hold it, and if negotiations result in your favour we will remit the moneys.&rdquo;  The answer here was: &ldquo;We will keep it in a suspense account, and if you win we will pay it.&rdquo;  The British retort to that was: &ldquo;Very good, keep the money; we will keep on the tariffs and we will negotiate.&rdquo;  We refused, and we refused on a ground in which no national position is involved.  There is only that point of <i>punctilio</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not a matter on which there should be any heat.  It is either right or wrong.  If it is wrong it can be refuted.  But I stand over that statement, and I think it will awaken the memory of many people listening to me, that it is perfectly accurate as told to us.  There is the situation.  We had got locked up in this terrible struggle over this point. We would keep the money.  We have not kept it in the suspense account, but we were going to keep it.  The British said: &ldquo;Very good, you keep the <Col N="1565" /> money; we will try to get it by tariffs, while we will negotiate.&rdquo;  But our pride or at least our sense of national position was going to be destroyed and would not allow us to accept that bargain. So we drifted along till last Christmas.  Then suddenly we found there was a coal-cattle pact negotiated, and revealed to this House.  That was done while tariffs were on.  Not merely that, but it proposed the continuance of the tariffs, and not merely that, but a change of a tariff, which had been a retaliation against British coal, in favour of British coal and, apparently, our national pride was not humbled; apparently, our national position was not jeopardised.  But God knows our economics were sadly weakened by what was done.  I would like Deputy Davin, if he chooses to incline in the end to vote for tobacco, to explain to the people whose tobacco he is increasing in price that it is all for their good and it is because there is that horrible dilemma of the national position.  The President turned his back on British negotiators because their attitude was: &ldquo;If you are going to keep the money we will keep on our tariffs,&rdquo; and on that alone, as far as the public have been allowed to know, does the struggle rest.  That is the general outline of this matter of the land annuities.</P>
      <P>As far as the people of this country were concerned they were promised, first of all, that it was going to mean no retaliation.  They were promised, secondly, that it was going to mean great benefit, and the benefit was precisely stated&mdash;full derating.  They were told that even if the British did attempt to retaliate they would pay in the end themselves, and that if they did not we would make them pay through the goods that came in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two arguments taken together meant that this country was going to be far better off by keeping these moneys than if it paid them.  Now the President rages because anyone dares to say that these moneys are being paid, that not merely is derating not being granted but that the farming community are paying the full £5,000,000 of which they used only to <Col N="1566" /> pay three-fifths, and are paying an extra £2,000,000 gathered by the Government.  The President rages, further, if you say that in fact it means we might as well pay a cheque across to Britain.  We would be more profitably occupied, if we paid that cheque in one lump sum to Britain, if we could get trade relations back again with her.  In the absence of any real answer to that all we get is talk about the national position.  If I am wrong about what the breach occurred over, let us hear clearly what did bring it about and let us then see what the strength of the national position is, instead of the present position which is certainly not a position of strength or a position that anybody can take pride in.</P>
    <P>The details in this Budget, apart from their reflection of the worsening effects of the economic war in which we fired the first shot, are interesting in themselves.  I cannot gather from the very few speeches that have been made from the other side any attempt at support of this Budget.  What is the real support for it?  I know this, that never did I see such a complete wall of silence grow up among the members of this House sitting on the back benches of Fianna Fáil as has been brought about by this Budget. There is not a chirp out of one of them in connection with it.  There is not one back bencher to be found brazen enough to stand up and defend it.  There is not one man there able to tell us why £100,000 must be taken off the old age pensioners, and there is not one man over there able to say that he approves of it.</P>
    <P>That is one item.  When I think of all they said about the poor, about the humble little homes, the tables that never saw anything but necessity, and how they wept over that, then you begin to think not exactly of the pleasure but of the chastening effects it must have on them to be forced to walk into the Lobby and, from these tables on which nothing but necessity appeared to subtract something by way of a little bit extra on tea, sugar, bread and butter: to take a little bit away from the household in the way of <Col N="1567" /> an extra tax on coal, and to take whatever little there may have been in any of these humble homes in the way of pleasure by taxing tobacco with Deputy Davin's permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the first to suggest it to the President, I said almost a year and a half ago that the tax had reached saturation point and I propose to prove it before I finish. <Col N="1568" /> There have been one or two attempts to defend this Budget.  They are not satisfying, any of them, but they do, at any rate, show some argument here and there.  We have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, more than by anybody else, that the reason for the increased taxation is because of the wonderful increase in industrial activity that he has brought about in this country.  That is putting it paradoxically, but it is his argument. We used to derive some of our taxation from taxes on imported goods.  The factories are now so numerous and goods are turned out in such profusion that there is no necessity to buy from abroad.  Therefore, there is not the same amount of goods being brought in and not the same amount of tax levied, so by a peculiar twist of the wheel of the Minister for Industry and Commerce you find that greater industrial activity in this country leads to more taxation.  It may, but I suggest to the Minister that there is another explanation of the reduced imports into this country.  I suggest to him that he, with the Labour Party, should think over what I previously said: that our agriculturists who form at least half our community are not getting anything like the prices that they used to get, and that, in addition, the price of manufactured goods has gone up beyond what it used to be, the net result of the combination of these two things being that less goods are being purchased at the moment.  The Minister, in a return that he has published, shows that to be the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister founds himself on one argument only.  You take the figure of importations into this country of any manufactured article at the moment and compare it with, say, the figure for 1931.  You subtract the one from the other, and immediately there is only one possible explanation that rushes to the Minister's mind.  It is: that the difference represents increased industrial activity in this country. I suggest that this conclusion should not be immediately jumped to.  There is another possibility&mdash;I put it no further than that&mdash;that it may be that <Col N="1569" /> people have not the money and, therefore, cannot buy as much.</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced figures in relation to what is called a census of production.  They were produced in 1931, and they are also here for 1933. You get there in both years a statement of the imports and the exports, and from that it is an easy calculation to get at the net imports.  You get in each of the years for which a census was taken the gross production at home, and if you add these two things together you ought to get the total consumption at home.  In 1931 the total consumption in clothes&mdash;this is covered by the return dealing with apparel, men's and women's clothing, men's and boys' ready-made clothing, shirts and miscellaneous apparel, including that worn by women and girls&mdash;in this country was £3,989,000. If you add together the same set of figures for 1933, you find that the total consumption is a little above £3,000,000. The decrease is over £800,000 and that represents 20 per cent.  I do not know if that figure is to be bitten in on, but if people in this country are only purchasing apparel to the extent that these figures reveal, and if the returns are correct, then the purchase of apparel is down by 20 per cent. in two years.  We know how and when money is spent on clothing and that particular item, which is a good test, certainly does not shout aloud that there is increased prosperity in the country. Suppose that is true of some of these other returns, does it not bear out what we all know is happening in the country&mdash;that there is less money being made even though there is a fierce amount of money being pumped into forced circulation.  There is less production and there is less money for expenditure.  There is less call for goods to be made and, therefore, Deputy Davin ought to realise that there is no reason for putting a tax on incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the proper time &mdash;on the Income Tax Resolution.  When sixpence was put on incomes, it was not confined to unearned incomes.  It was a tax on incomes.  If profits in the country are going down, that will be revealed in the amount of money you get in from any particular tax on income.  Surely everybody recognises what income tax is.  It is a tax on the income which people enjoy.  If, in a certain year, owing to some peculiar circumstances, income swells rapidly, the tax, being the same in two years, will bring in much more money in the period of prosperity than in the period when relatively there is not so much prosperity.  I have stressed, I am stressing, and I shall continue to stress the point, until some attempt is made to answer it, that that is the biggest sign of failing prosperity we have. That is why President de Valera said last night that there was no sense in asking for an increase of sixpence in the income tax&mdash;because it would not yield anything.  It might salve Deputy Davin's feelings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And hurt yours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not hurt mine very much.  At any rate, I have not to go in a white sheet to the people and explain why I put a tax on milk, tobacco, sugar, tea and all the other items.  I do not require excuses.  If sixpence had been put on the income tax, it would have resulted in a far bigger showing up of the financial position than we have got at the moment.  These are figures which cannot be denied.  In 1934-35, according to the official returns, the revenue from income tax was £4,200,000.  The tax was 5/- and 6d. was taken off.  There is always a lag of half the amount in any year.  That is the equivalent of an effective rate of 4/9, and it brought in £4,216,000.  The old revenue calculation on which all the Budgets in this House were based was that every 6d. added to the income tax brought in half a million pounds.  In 1928-29, the amount of money brought in was £3,700,000.  The tax was then 3/-.  I <Col N="1571" /> take that year rather than that which I took in my speech on the first Resolution, because then the full effect of the 1/- reduction was apparent.  Add 6d. to that rate and you add half a million pounds to the yield.</P>
      <P>On the results of 1928-29, a tax of 3/6 would have brought in £4,200,000. A tax of 4/9 last year brought in only £16,000 more.  Why?  Last night the President attempted to answer that question by saying that the present factories had not got under way yet, and that you cannot expect dividends immediately.  Neither do we.  Leave the new factories out of consideration. Why is not the country as well off as it was before the new factories were started?  Are we to take it for granted that the elevation of these new factories, wherever they may be, inevitably means a decrease in wealth? The President waived aside this argument last night.  He said the new factories had not been long enough in operation.  Let us leave them out of the calculation altogether.  Apart from them, the income tax is yielding so poorly that last year a 4/9 tax brought in only the equivalent of what in our time would have been brought in by a 3/6 tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three sets of income tax payers in this country.  There are the mass of the people who draw fixed salaries or salaries from the State. They must pay regularly and must pay what is demanded of them.  That set has not changed.  There is the second set&mdash;the people who derive their incomes from investments outside the country.  Most of the investments outside this country are in England. Last year, in England, the return from income tax was so great that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was able to announce this year that he got the same return for 4/6 in the £ that he used to get on 5/-.  We get a lot of dividends from English securities. These dividends are going up. Despite the fact that they are going up, our tax of 4/9 last year brought in only what used to be the fruit of 3/6.  The third lot of taxpayers are the industrialists&mdash;the people who are <Col N="1572" /> producing wealth.  Whether the factories are under full way or not, we are told that there is a new era of prosperity in the country.  We have not had the confession that there has been a going backwards.  If one of the three sections who paid income tax in this country is paying the same as before; if, so far as another section is concerned, we are getting more dividends from investments, how does it come that we can only get £4,200,000 on a 4/9 rate of tax when previously a 3/6 rate used to bring us in the same amount.</P>

      <P>That can be weighed up.  There is the fact.  Surely it ought to answer the Labour complaint about putting 6d. on the income tax.  Quite a good deal has been put on the income tax&mdash;more than the Minister has said. One of the points to which I directed my attention after this Budget was brought in was as to what provision the Minister had made to meet obviously falling revenue from certain sources.  I think I know two of the hidden taxes.  We are told that, through this Budget, there is going to be taken from the old age pensioners £100,000.  Does anybody here believe that a group of people so politically astute as the present group would touch such a dangerous matter as the old age pensions for the sake of £100,000?  Who is going to supervise the tightening of the supervising machinery to get £100,000 from the old age pensioners?  Who is going to say stop at the moment that £100,000 has been got?  Do the Labour Deputies, who complain of this £100,000 being taken from the old age pensioners, know anything of the administrative machine or how it is controlled?  Do they think that the present Government would have touched the old age pensioners merely for a return of £100,000, which could be got by some other tax easily enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will keep his eye on the administrative machine.  He has not stopped at grinding to the extent of getting this £100,000.  The Deputy has no control over it any more than he had over the Budget proposals.  The hidden taxes, undoubtedly, will appear next year on the income tax.  We will see the decline that is going on steadily taking another turn.  We will have to get the figures later.  Does anybody here credit that raising Schedule A taxation on all the property assessed for income tax now is only going to bring in £60,000?  Have we come to the point that the property assessable for income tax now is only bringing in £1,000,000? Have Deputy Davin's colleagues reflected that, when talking of income tax, that in fact, this year the Minister for Finance is completely withdrawing all the advantages that he purported to give income tax in his first Budget? By putting 25 per cent. on house property he will put above income tax level many men he proposed to have exempted.  When the income tax returns come out it will not be the yield on 4/9 or 4/6 but on the new additions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factories, according to the President, are not producing dividends.  I wonder what they are producing.  They are not producing employment.  They are not producing returns in income tax.  They are not producing any great decline in the moneys we have to give for the reilef of unemployment.  They are not putting the Unemployment Insurance Fund in any better paying condition than it was.  If there are any advantages to be derived from the factories, if they are there at all, we should be told more about them.  We can deal with the unemployment figures on the Minister's Vote.  Let us take one item.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="1574" /> and Commerce told us that the real test of employment in this country was the income of the Insurance Fund.  We are thinking of the difference between the financial year 1933-34 and 1934-35. That is the year in which we saw this decline in the yield of income tax.  We were told that the fund in 1933-34 received £8,800 and that in 1934-35 it received £16,000, a difference of less than £8,000.  Calculating that a man is in employment 50 weeks of the year, the stamps amount to £4.  That represents less than 2,000 people put into occupation in the last financial year. These are the Minister's own figures and that is his own test applied to the figures.  It is a good test.</P>
    <P>In the last financial year, on that test, these new factories upon which we founded all hopes have put 2,000 new people into occupations.  That was the year that the Minister boasted 21,000 people had been employed directly in building.  That was the year in which the calculation was made.  But 16,000 of the 21,000 were new entrants to the building industry. We have only 2,000 new people in the whole of industry.  The factories are not producing dividends.  Apparently, this last year there was a lowering of the number of people in gainful occupations. Yet, that is what we have to found our hopes on; that these factories will so develop and raise the wealth and the employment in the country; that what 3/6 on income tax produced in 1928-29, £4,300,000, it takes 4/9 to do now.  How can anyone pretend that there is prosperity in the country in face of these facts?  The farming community closed last year with 31 per cent. of the rates unpaid. In addition, they closed last year with £716,000 out of £2,000,000 annuities unpaid.  One-third of the rates and one-third of the annuities could not be collected.</P>

Does Deputy Donnelly and that great <Col N="1575" /> shining light of the Fianna Fáil Party, the man who stands for law and order, Deputy Geoghegan, know that Westmeath closed with the worst collection? Let us keep to economics.  The farming community has discounted this campaign. One-third of the halved annuities could not be collected; one-third of the rates could not be collected, and that after all the levyings, police forces, flying squads, bailiffs and secret buyers.  The farming community last year did not meet the rates by one-third and did not meet 50 per cent. of the land annuities by one-third. I wonder will Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin agree that a worker of the present day receives the same wages as he received three years ago and is able to buy as much as he used to buy?  Does Deputy Davin think that an employee receiving the same wages is in as good a position financially as he was three years ago?  I wonder if Deputy Davin has cast his eye over the returns given in the Census of Production.  If he will look at the last item he will see that whatever extra employment was supposed to be given in industries the average wage is less than £1 a week.  Does Deputy Davin think £1 a week in the new conditions, with a tax on tea, sugar, the bit of bread and butter, with coal and tobacco costing more, that money is as good in the hands of a man now as it was two or three years ago?  Will Deputy Davin say that he rejoices at the situation in which agricultural wages are now, when they are supposed to be so much below 22/- a week, that the Parliamentary Secretary told us that the man who proposed to take the 22/- from them for relief work would be torn limb from limb? Who is gaining in this business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told about a campaign. Three of the banks this year reported that a tendency had been observable of people withdrawing their little deposits in order to maintain their lives.  That is with regard to individual depositors.  People do not withdraw their little deposits to live upon them, or in order to keep up the pretence of not being able to pay, but in order to keep the wolves of <Col N="1576" /> the Government from coming down on them with these forced seizures. Apart from individuals, we have returns that show that for the country as a whole, the investments we held abroad are lowered, that there is less to the credit of our people abroad than there used to be.  That might be a good thing in other circumstances. Merely withdrawing money from abroad in order to locate it profitably here at home would be good.  It is equally as bad to be forced to withdraw money located abroad in order to live on it here at home, but if we do withdraw money from abroad in order to invest it profitably here at home, surely the profitable investment would have shown itself and would have shown itself in two ways; firstly, that the income tax yield from the same tax would be better, and secondly, that there would not be the same necessity on the people of this country to purchase from abroad what used to be purchased from abroad.</P>
    <P>We have here a combination which is terrifying when both sides are looked at together, in that we find our resources abroad being dissipated &mdash;whether being brought home as a means of livelihood or for investment we do not know, but if it is for livelihood, it is clearly waste and if for investment, we have this, which somebody has to answer, that our adverse trade balance is rising as our foreign investments are being depleted.  We are losing the position we once had, a position of considerable strength, in that the adverse trade balance was balanced by dividends we withdrew from abroad, and we are going through that process of eating into our capital. That is why it is futile in these circumstances for people to be so blind to facts as to demand that the taxpayers of the country, the people who pay on their incomes, mainly derived from productivity, should be taxed still more, when the fluctuations of the tax to date show that it has reached saturation point and that there is no longer any great wealth in this country to be taxed.</P>

      <P>If the Government would accept the Deputy's challenge and put on 6d., we would have to live a year to see the results but the results are written on the papers presented to the House already.  There would be no yield and it would only be a further showing up of the weakened state of the country, demonstrating it clearly.</P>
      <P>Last night, I was surprised to hear the President state something about calls for a national Government.  I do not know who called for a national Government.  I know that the Minister for Finance called for a national Government at one point&mdash;that we should help him to get a proper conversion operation in regard to the First National Loan next December.  I think the Minister will only get his proper return on that proposal, when it comes forward, by being frank with the people; and I do not regard myself as doing the credit of the State any harm in putting out arguments here&mdash; in the deliberative assembly of the country &mdash; which the Minister can answer, and, if he has a case, can make his case in respect of them and can, therefore, show a great position of strength and so assist himself and his Loan.  I do think it is the duty of anybody who has the views I have here, and has the facts and documents to prove those views, to state&mdash;even if it is for the purpose of having them answered&mdash;how those views present themselves to him.  The Minister must tell us, first of all, what the country is going to save by this conversion operation; what amount of money is involved; at what, when he changes from a certain rate of interest, is he likely to borrow again; and on how much are we to count the reduced interest payment.  Then we will know what the amount in question is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot go blindly to the public as he did in respect of his Fourth National Loan.  The Minister cannot go to the public, which definitely whether he likes it or not, has come to regard the bounties as a normal item appearing yearly in our <Col N="1578" /> Budget, when they know that he is borrowing to meet these normal items of expenditure, and he certainly cannot go to them with any hope of success if he presents himself as borrowing that disputable item on an equally disputed fund.  If the Minister has a case with regard to these matters which is capable of being set out in precise terms and the figures produced, the intelligence of the people should be appealed to instead of this nonsense about the national position and jeopardising the situation.</P>
    <P>I will stand no criticism from any member of the present Front Bench, nor will any person on this side of the House, when an allegation is made with regard to sabotage.  This Party was never guilty of sabotage.  There was never an act&mdash;and, mind you, there are many acts and monuments to those acts left throughout the country for what you people did in the way of sabotage&mdash;and never even talk or wild statements from this Party, such as the present Minister for Industry and Commerce thought it right to utter on the morning of the flotation of the 1930 Loan, when he announced, without an argument, without stating a fact, or without going through the figures, that this country was travelling fast towards the bog of bankruptcy.  Would the Minister for Finance allow me to use that phrase on the morning on which he goes for his conversion, and will he give me the pardon the Minister for Industry and Commerce now thinks the people ought to give him for that wild utterance? That was not the only one.  The gun was not heavy enough for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It had to be double-barrelled, and the Vice-President fired the second barrel on the same morning: The prospect was as black as night.  We went for the Third National Loan with the present Vice-President saying that the prospect was as black as night, and the present industrial hero of the country telling us that we were wallowing in the bog of bankruptcy.  Those people can sit and applaud when the President, guilty of more sabotage than any other individual in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;preaches at us about refraining from any acts of sabotage. This is the Budget occasion.  It is the occasion upon which the finances of the State should be considered; it is the occasion upon which such items as the yield of income tax, national income and the drain on it for Government services, should all be brought out, and it is making a farce of this place as any sort of deliberative assembly, if, because people criticise and seek to expound their views, they are to be told that they are guilty of sabotage.  The Minister has his platform in the Finance Bill, and in all the Resolutions, to get quite clear to the people of the country what is the financial situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his two Votes, can get down to these figures he has given to us and tell us clearly and distinctly where is the new productivity in the country.</P>
      <P>I talked about truth and honesty and fair play at the beginning.  This is the sort of thing we had to put up with when we were a Government.  Mr. de Valera, speaking of unemployment at the Ard-Fheis&mdash;it is not dated&mdash;tells us&mdash;and this is, of course, a scandalous comment and it was from the President, who so often preens himself on not being guilty of any unworthy conduct, although his back benchers may have been guilty, with his connivance, and guilty of a lot:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Can it be that the people are deluded by these politicians and journalists who are always turning imaginary concers on the road to an illusory prosperity&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has turned three corners in the last three years and the prosperity is still far off.  Listen to this as criticism from a man who was going to be President of this country</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;and by the parade of the motor races, the pageants, the banquets and the tattoos organised to beguile us into the belief that all was well?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was&mdash;may I use a vulgar expression?&mdash;a <Col N="1580" /> dirty comment, but it was a good political comment.  It was going to excite a certain amount of envy in which this country is rich, and the men who could sit under that do not scruple now&mdash;and they are perfectly right not to scruple&mdash;to organise the same banquets and tattoos and Easter Week celebrations.  We do not know whether it was for the purpose of beguiling us into the belief that everything is well and that we are on the road to prosperity.  I do not criticise the present Government for having those banquets and tattoos.  They are part of the machinery of government and are a necessity in certain circumstances, but that is the way they were presented to the people in the middle of an unemployment discussion.  The man who said that, if he pays any attention at all to truth, honesty and fair dealing, should come into this House and say that his experience during the last two or three years has been such as to show him that that was an unworthy comment.  The Minister for Finance ended his Budget statement by telling us that around us is a world that has been possessed by madness; that every unit of it is claiming for itself more and more of what should be the common stock of mankind.  When I first read that I wondered if he meant it.  The world is being possessed by madness. What is the madness?  Economic nationalism&mdash;the Fianna Fáil programme, fortunately only a programme and not an achievement.  The Minister this year could say what we often said to him, that there was a lesson to be learned from the outside world, when you regarded the world and all the nations that had hurled themselves into their own territory and decided to cut off exports and imports.  We told him that a lesson could be learned, because in those countries you could see increased unemployment and a lowering of the conditions of life, and it was clear to anybody who had a thought in his head that if what is the common stock of mankind is not freely distributed on equal terms the population of the world is going to live at a lower rate.  The Minister has now decided that this economic nationalism is madness. <Col N="1581" /> Possibly the Labour Party will help him to some better degree of sanity in that regard.  They have got the first lesson this time; they have got the first shock of consciousness of what is bound to develop in those circumstances. They see that you cannot continue to exact taxation from a small party or community; that when you are really getting to the end of your tether you have got to get down to the mass of the people, because even a small amount of money gripped from each one of a large number will give you more than trying to grip a whole lot from a small crowd.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin and Deputy Corish know well that not merely agricultural labourers in this country but the workers in the towns are having their standard of living steadily reduced, are having less money given to them with which to buy things.  They have got the first shock of taxation.  They see it is only from such things as are taken by the mass of the people&mdash;sugar, tea, butter and bread&mdash;that you can gather in any big store when you have come to the point of exhaustion on such taxes as a tax on incomes. They must realise now, if they did not realise it in their cradles, that this sort of economic madness must come back on the people.  They now show some resentment at being asked to put upon the people some little burden with regard to one or two taxes.  If matters go as they are going at this moment Deputy Davin will not be complaining next year of even putting on a sugar and tea tax; it will be just as much a necessity then as it is now.  Remember the economic nationalism.  First of all, if there were no economic war, it is part of that Party's programme, and you are helping to put it on foot. In so far as it is not part of their programme it is the result of the economic war which they started, and that economic war is for the national position as I have explained it, that we will not negotiate while tariffs are on, although we did that with disastrous effects to the people of this country last Christmas.</P>

      <P>The speech to which we have just listened to is one of the tragedies of which we have frequent examples in this House, because it is a tragedy for this country that a Deputy of Deputy McGilligan's searching and acute intelligence should waste the time of this House and the time of the people in making the sort of speech to which we have just listened. On Wednesday, the Deputy told us about the habits of certain mosquitoes. They bite, he said, not to give pain but to live.  I think that those who have listened to the vain effort of Deputy McGilligan to attack this Budget in any significant or vital particular must have thought of the simile of the mosquito and the battleship. There was not a word about the Budget in his speech.  The first part of it was a criticism of the attitude of the Labour Party.  In the next part he referred to newspaper advertisements, now three years out of date. When the Deputy produces those advertisements we all know what he is going to say, because we all know the fixation complex which possesses the Deputy.  It would be a good thing for the Deputy, and for the Party of which apparently he is an important and influential member, if he would have himself psycho-analysed in regard to those advertisements. The latter part of his speech was a protestation of what they had to suffer when they were in office and we were in opposition, but on the matters which touch the lives of the people of this country there was not one helpful suggestion, one sound or salutary criticism.  I regret that, because, as I said, the Deputy is a man of great abilities, with which he ought to serve his country better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did make one or two passing references to some aspects of the Budget.  He referred to the position in regard to income tax, and he repeated&mdash;not in precisely the same words as on a previous occasion&mdash;what he had to say in that regard.  On Wednesday last he declared, as reported in column 882 of the Official Debates, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain was able <Col N="1583" /> to say that on the 4/6 income tax rate he got more money than he previously got on the 5/- rate.  To-night the Deputy has mended his hand a little. I am going to refer to this because the Deputy has made a great parade of figures here in the House from time to time, particularly figures dealing with the condition of employment in the country.  In regard to those figures, he has asked the House to take his interpretation of them, his examination of them, and, on his good faith, certain conclusions which he has drawn from them.  On Wednesday last, as I pointed out, he said that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, on a 4/6 rate, derived more from income tax than he had got on the 5/- rate in the preceding year.  To-night he said that he derived as much.  I was rather interested in the statement of the Deputy, and I took the precaution of looking up the British official returns in this regard.  I find that for the year 1933-34, when the British rate was 5/-, the amount of income tax collected was £228,932,000, and that for 1934-35, when the rate had been reduced to 4/6, the amount collected was £228,877,000&mdash;practically the same, but not the same, and certainly not more.  Yet Deputy McGilligan, in order to make the point that the economic condition of this country was worse in the year 1934-35 than it was in 1933-34, attributed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a statement which I do not believe he made, but a statement in any event which is not borne out by the British official figures. The Deputy is fond of metaphors relating to cardplay.  I wonder when he made that statement what cards he was bidding with&mdash;was it knaves or lower?</P>
    <P>Then, he continued his examination of the question of income tax.  He mentioned 1928-29, and once again we can see how the Deputy changes his position in the course of the debate.  When he opened the debate on Wednesday last the year upon which he relied was not 1928-29, which he mentioned to-night, but 1927-28.  His statement is in the official record here.  In column 882 he is reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> In 1927-28, when income tax here was 3/- in the £, it produced £3,600,000, and the calculation on which we worked, and which was always borne out by facts, was that an extra 6d. brought in an extra £500,000.  Suppose we had a 3/6 income tax in these years, we would have got at that rate £4,120,000; but here, with an income tax which last year effectively was 4/9, ... the Government got in £4,216,000.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make here is in regard to the figures for 1927-1928 when, according to Deputy McGilligan, the tax was 3/- in the £.  When the Deputy was speaking he did not disclose to the Dáil that the rate of tax for the year 1925-6 was 4/- in the £ and for the two years previous was 5/- in the £.  Moreover, he withheld from the Dáil this very significant fact, of which he must have been, since he was a member of the Executive Council at the time, aware, that during the year 1927-28 not less than £1,600,000 of the tax collected in that year was in respect of the year 1926-7, when the tax was 4/- in the £, and that about £430,000 was in respect of 1925-6 and earlier years.</P>
    <P>A much more accurate idea of the yield of income tax in 1927-8 is given by Table 77 of the Revenue Commissioners' Report for the year 1929.  I presume that Deputy McGilligan is not going to tell the House&mdash;he is not here to tell them, which is so characteristic of Deputy McGilligan&mdash;that he was unaware of the existence of this Table.  It shows the net produce of the income tax from assessments actually made in 1927-8 was £3,020,000, or a cool £580,000 less than Deputy McGilligan on Wednesday last proclaimed to have been the fact.  Moreover, even this figure is increased to some extent by the fact that it includes the proceeds of the additional assessments made in 1927-8 in respect of earlier years, when the tax was 4/- in the £.  Here is an attack on the Budget&mdash;because Deputy McGilligan's first speech on the first Resolution was a considered attack on the Budget&mdash; which is based largely upon two false premises, two erroneous statements regarding facts which were within the knowledge of the Deputy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> We had to-night a further instance of the Deputy's unreliability in matters of this sort.  He stated that it was a matter of historical record that the negotiations, the conversations, between us and the British representatives regarding the matter at issue between us had broken down upon what he called a punctilio.  When he was challenged for his authority for that statement he referred to the newspapers. What is the most significant statement that has appeared in the newspapers in relation to the whole question of this dispute?  It was a statement of Mr. Chamberlain, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he disclosed very frankly&mdash;and confirmed what the President said last night&mdash;that these conversations had broken down, not on any point of punctilio, but had broken down on a question of national principle regarding the national status, had broken down because we were required to accept a stricter interpretation of the Treaty and the Treaty obligations than even the Government of which Deputy Mulcahy was a member was ever called upon to accept.  But Deputy McGilligan comes along here and, notwithstanding Mr. Chamberlain's statement, declares that these negotiations were broken down on a point of punctilio and that therefore the whole of this economic dispute has been waged around insignificant minutiæ.</P>
    <P>Then, again, we are told that there is a tariff on British coal which has been changed into a tariff to protect British coal.  The Deputy is a master of language and can be precise enough when he wishes to wound or hurt or sneer or gibe.  The one thing, as a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, he ought to be aware of is the difference between a quota order and a tariff.  The tariff is not put on to protect British coal.  Those who buy British coal have to pay the tariff, but there is a native fuel available to a good many householders that is being protected to some extent by that tariff. Apart altogether from the fact&mdash;which I do not deny&mdash;that the tariff produces very useful revenue, if there is any person who wants to deny the <Col N="1586" /> Exchequer that revenue he can buy Irish peat and Irish coal, too.  Therefore as regards the tariff, whatever else it may have been imposed for, its primary purpose was not to protect British coal and it does not protect British coal.  Deputy McGilligan, who complains about misstatements made by the former Opposition, has alleged here, with all the authority that he should carry as the principal speaker for the Opposition in closing this debate, that we have put on a tariff to protect British coal.</P>
    <P>Then we have this question about the land annuities, which have been so often mentioned during the course of this debate.  He tells us that the British are collecting the land annuities, and it would be much better if we were to pay these directly. Deputy McGilligan says that on Wednesday 22nd, but on Thursday 16th listen to what Deputy O'Sullivan said in connection with the tariff on sugar:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The consumers have to pay more... They have to pay something like 21/- per cwt. on imported sugar, and on the sugar produced at home something like 4/6 per cwt. to the Exchequer...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sugar, however, is an import into this country, just the same as cattle is an import into Great Britain.  When we tax foreign manufactured sugar, Deputy O'Sullivan gets up and tells us we are making the consumer pay more, and I admit that the consumer has to pay more; but when the British put a tax on cattle going in there, Deputy McGilligan gets up here and says that Deputy O'Sullivan, on Thursday last, did not know what he was talking about: that the position is the reverse: that, when a tax is put on an imported article it is not the consumer who has to pay more, but the producer.  There is a certain element of truth in both of these views, but certainly each of them is not 100 per cent. true.  Midway between the two is the point of veracity.  In any event, one thing is clear: that we are possibly paying some part of the British tariff on cattle, but that certainly the British consumers are paying the other part. <Col N="1587" /> Otherwise, the tariff would be entirely ineffective to raise the price of home-produced beef in the British market. I hope that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Sullivan will meet and resolve this difference between them as to whether a tariff on an imported commodity is paid by the producer or the consumer, because, obviously, there should be some reconciliation of the statements from the Opposition Front Benches.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his statement to-night, referred to the fact that we were borrowing for some part of the export bounties and subsidies, and, in that regard, he pointed to the fact that I have stated here on occasion that, in addition to the ordinary provision which we are making by way of the normal sinking fund to redeem any borrowings from the Exchequer which we might make on that head, we also have, as an additional security for the Exchequer and for the future taxpayers of this country, an asset in the way of the funded annuities.  He said that I was borrowing against these funded annuities which amount to, approximately, £4,600,000, all told, but that this year, out of a total collection of a little over £2,000,000, we only collected about £1,300,000 and left about £770,000 of annuities in arrear.  Now, the Deputy, quite naturally, tried to make the most of that fact.  He is quite entitled to extract whatever polemic advantage he may get from the fact that there is a considerable accumulation of arrears of land annuities, and I am quite prepared to agree that regard should be had to that and that the £4,000,000 of funded arrears which we regard as an Exchequer asset ought to be written down accordingly.  Very well.  That is precisely why we are insisting that a large part of the export bounties and subsidies must be found out of taxation.  If the collection of the land annuities were proceeding normally; if this campaign to prevent their payment, which is now being localised in the area represented by a portion of Tipperary, Waterford, Cork and Limerick, were once broken, we could, quite <Col N="1588" /> justifiably and without any abuse of the canons of prudent and careful finance, borrow a larger sum for the export bounties and subsidies and relieve the taxation by that amount. When we have, however, a carefully organised and well-planned campaign to prevent the collection of annuities, the Exchequer must ensure itself against the contingency of the success of such a campaign&mdash;remote as that contingency may be&mdash;and accordingly must cover that danger by increased taxation.</P>
    <P>However, it will be a source of hope and comfort to the honest taxpayer and the honest farmer to know that that campaign is rapidly breaking down.  Less than four months ago the arrears of land annuities uncollected amounted to £1,200,000, but inside of four months that amount has been reduced by almost £500,000.  If the honester and wiser attitude, which now appears to prevail amongst that section of the farming community who have hitherto been misled with regard to these payments, is to continue, we shall be able to reduce our expenditure on police and other things which have become necessary for the reasons to which I have referred.  If this honester and wiser attitude prevails, I am not without hope that we may be able eventually to lighten the tax burden considerably.</P>
    <P>When Deputy McGilligan was talking here about the burdens we had cast on the local authorities and expressing the opinion that, by the operation of the Guarantee Fund, we had deprived the local authorities of £770,000 of local taxation grants which had been impounded in the Guarantee Fund and passed to the Exchequer to make good the deficiency in the collection of the land annuities, he might also have told us that the people principally responsible for that are Deputies who have been in this House for most of this debate; who have been very vocal in this debate, and who, last night had the ill manners to snarl and sneer at the President of this State, the man elected by the majority of the people's votes to be the head of this State. <Col N="1589" /> The men responsible for that are the men to whom Deputy McGilligan refers as honest and broken-down farmers.  Deputy Bennett was here last night.  I am sorry that he is not in the House at the moment.  Deputy Bennett is one of the men who are leading this campaign and who are giving those who are trying to be dishonest the encouragement of their example and their exhortation.  He said that when his cattle were being seized he could have paid his annuities if he had wanted to do so. Then we have Deputy Holohan who sits over there&mdash;not unconnected with a certain demonstration here to-day&mdash; who, for the last three years has not paid his annuities until the sheriff came along to his door to seize his cattle; but then out came the cheque-book of this honest and broken-down farmer and he paid not merely what was due in respect of the annuities, but the sheriff's expenses as well.</P>
    <P>Then we have Deputy Fagan.  Last October, I think, his cattle were being sold by the sheriff down in Mullingar, and on that day Deputy Fagan had a horse running for a valuable stake in the Curragh, a horse which, I think, finished second.  He could not pay his land annuities, but the Deputy could afford to keep racehorses; that is the poor broken-down farmer of whom Deputy McGilligan talks.  Then there was Deputy Wall.  Only a fortnight ago, when the sheriff's men were out collecting in his district from people who had failed to pay their land annuities, they called on Deputy Wall.  The Deputy did not allow his cattle to be seized however.  His neighbours had their cattle seized on the same occasion and they were knocked down by the sheriff later for what they were worth.  But Deputy Wall took out his cheque book and bought in his cattle. These are the four men for whom Deputy McGilligan is so full of sympathy.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite are now to go down the country telling the people that we are putting taxes on them.  The people are to be told that we are putting taxes on bread, tea, sugar and <Col N="1590" /> tobacco.  I have not the slightest doubt that Deputy Bennett will tell the country people that we are also taxing butter, though he voted for that himself. He disobeyed Deputy Mulcahy's Whip in helping to impose that tax.  But when they go down the country and tell the people that they are being taxed in these things&mdash;just as they some time ago tried to disorganise and bankrupt the finances of the local authorities by inducing people to withhold the payment of their annuities that are justly due to the Exchequer of the State, even when by doing that they increased the burden of the local rates upon the honest men&mdash;let them tell the country too that they have also increased the burden of taxation upon the honest people.</P>
    <P>We have this campaign from Deputy Bennett, Deputy Holohan, Deputy Wall, Deputy Fagan and other Deputies who are not so vocal as these. But though not so vocal they stealthily and secretly incite people, telling them not to pay their annuities.  They should tell them also that when they keep them from paying their annuities, not merely do they help to increase the burden of rates, but the burden of taxation as well.  If taxes to-day are higher than before, it is because of this campaign led by these Deputies who can say: &ldquo;We are the people&mdash;Wall, Holohan, Fagan and Bennett&mdash;who are responsible for that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Budget has been attacked from the Labour Benches also.  The principal criticism which Deputy Norton had to advance against the Budget was the alleged absence of a provision for the relief of the unemployment problem.  In matters of this sort I think we ought to have some standard to go upon.  In case Deputy Norton should have forgotten what the position was less than four years ago and what the standard was, I would refer him to the information, which was included this year for the first time, in the comprehensive statement issued in the Volume of Estimates.  I would ask him to examine the provision which was made for such relief from 1926 to the end of 1929.  In 1926 <Col N="1591" /> and 1927 the expenditure on relief schemes amounted to £30,448.  I may mention that the expenditure on old age pensions that year was £2,549,000. To-day, even after allowing for the economies which we hope to secure by a stricter administration of the Act, the expenditure will be £800,000 more than it was in 1926-27.  I am afraid Deputy Davin has been, to some extent, induced to forget the benefits that the poorer section of the community are receiving at our hands.  It is the nation as a whole that is paying for these things, but, at any rate, we had the courage, when we were told that everything ought to be pared and pruned down, to say that social services should receive attention no matter what the cost.</P>
      <P>In 1926-27 the expenditure on relief schemes was £30,448.  To-day, including the full provision which we are making in order to set the workless man at work, the figure is £500,000.  In 1928-29, the figure was £27,408.  In 1929-30 there was not one penny provided for relief works.  That was a year which was fairly comparable with this year, because it was the third year of the last Cosgrave Administration. 1930-31 the provision was £121,000.  In 1932 the provision was £156,000, while this year we are providing for relief works £500,000 or three times as much as in 1932.</P>
      <P>Can it be with reason contended, as Deputy Norton has contended, that from the taxpayers' point of view we are not making a very serious contribution to the relief of unemployment? But the matter does not end there. I have already pointed out that in 1926-27 the total expenditure on old age pensions was a little over £2,500,000.  To-day it is £800,000 more than in 1926-27.  There was no expenditure on unemployment assistance then.  To-day there has been provided a sum of £1,300,000 for unemployment assistance.  I may assure the Deputy that no man will go hungry in this country if it should be found that the requirements of that service exceed £1,300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1929 the proposed expenditure on public works was £685,000.  This year it is proposed to expend £200,000 more <Col N="1592" /> than that figure.  In 1926-27 there was nothing included in the Budget for providing those in receipt of unemployment assistance with cheap beef.  In 1926-27 the allowances made for the purpose of closing down redundant creameries was £361,000.  To-day the item in respect of creameries is £998,000, just £2,000 short of £1,000,000. If we take housing, relief schemes, afforestation, new building works and improvements of estates we find that in 1929-30 the total was £859,000.  In 1930-31 it was £898,000.  In 1932-33 the figure was £934,000.  In the present year the corresponding figure is £2,230,000, which is almost equal to the total expenditure in the three years I have mentioned.  If the members of the Labour Party or any other person who is seriously concerned with the social welfare of the people will study these figures carefully, I fail to see how they can maintain the argument that we have not made, so far as our means permit, proper and adequate provision for the relief of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also criticised our attitude in regard to unemployment assistance and the reduction which we think can justifiably be made in the provision required by that Vote.  There is a figure of £1,300,000 in the Estimates for unemployment assistance. Again I must repeat these figures, because Deputies should become familiar with them; if they were familiar with them I do not think we would hear so much of the criticisms in this House that we have heard on the Budget.  These are the figures: £1,300,000 for unemployment assistance; £500,000 for relief schemes; £335,000 for the purchase of cheap beef for distribution amongst the recipients of unemployment assistance. These three items together make £2,135,000.  Then we have, under various sub-heads in the different Estimates, increases over last year's provision of £142,000 for the building of schools and Gárda barracks; £80,000 for improvements on estates; £100,000 for afforestation; £235,000 for housing grants; and £100,000 for the building and equipment of industrial alcohol factories. <Col N="1593" /> When we add the increases under these various provisions to the £500,000 which is now being provided for relief works, we have a sum of £1,065,000 approximately for additional relief works alone.</P>
    <P>I think that the mere fact that this expenditure is contemplated and will be undertaken is sufficient justification for any reasonable man anticipating that there would be a substantial saving on the original provision for unemployment assistance.  To any Deputy who criticises us for taking a reasonable view of this and writing down the provision required in that Vote by £300,000, I put the question: What was the alternative?  If we did not write it down by £300,000 we would have had to provide that money by additional taxation; and we might not have had, and I believe we should not have had, to use that money, and we should have been carrying it forward into next year as a very substantial surplus.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the issue comes down to this, that you have either got to write down your estimate in the light of the facts that you have before you when you come to prepare your Budget, or you have got to impose taxation to the full amount of the estimate.  Which would any Deputy on the Labour Benches have chosen? Would he have said: &ldquo;We thought we would require £1,600,000 for unemployment assistance, and, whether we are going to require it or not, we are going to take it out of the people; and whether there is justification for spending it or not upon people who are in need or in want, we will distribute that £300,000 to some people who, we are satisfied, will not really require it at all&rdquo;?  That was the dilemma which we were in, and I think we have chosen prudently and well, and that we have acted in the best interests of the poorer section in the country in refusing to budget unnecessarily in order to provide moneys which we did not think we would require.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also criticised the proposed tightening up of administration in regard to old age pensions.  I wish to make clear what I have already <Col N="1594" /> stated in the Budget speech in this regard.  Deputy Davin listened to Deputy McGilligan with a great deal of patience.  It is very difficult to listen to Deputy McGilligan with patience, but it is more than usually difficult to listen to Deputy McGilligan when he starts talking, as he did to-night, of the poor and humble little homes, the poor and scantily-furnished tables from which we were going to take the bread, the butter and the cheese.  The amount of the reduction which we hope to make in the provision for the old age pensions is £100,000. It is less than three per cent. of the total.  Surely, on any estimate, when, as a rule, the allowance for overestimation ranges between two and three per cent., we would be quite entitled to anticipate that we would secure a reduction in that particular Estimate of possibly three or a little more than three per cent.  We would be more than justified because of some facts which have come to my notice, in any event.  I have made it quite clear that no person who, so far as we can interpret the intention of the Dáil when this Act was going through, would be entitled to a pension is going to be deprived of a pension.  We do know this: that advantage is being taken of the provisions of that Act to carry through, in some cases, assignments which have not been genuine assignments, fictitious assignments merely, in order to get this pension.</P>
    <P>I had under my notice one particular case in which a farm of over £100 valuation, well-equipped and well-stocked was assigned, and the man who owned that farm and his wife both claimed the full pension. That sort of thing has been going on over the country.  We are quite anxious that the small holdings of people who are old and past their labour should be passed on to those who will till and cultivate and work them properly; but when we see an assignment like this taking place, and when we know that not one tittle of real authority over the goods of that household passed with the assignment from the man who originally owned the farm, then we are quite entitled to say: &ldquo;Surely <Col N="1595" /> a son who gets a valuable holding like that is not entitled to pass on to the State the duty and the obligation of maintaining his parents in their old age.&rdquo;  Yet that sort of thing has been going on and it is tending to grow.  I am merely saying that out of that one source alone we shall probably save a considerable portion of that £100,000.  I am sure that no Deputy in the Labour Party who is listening to me will get up and say we are not justified in trying to put an end to that abuse and taking credit for the saving which we hope will thereon ensue.</P>
    <P>A large part of the criticism of this Budget has related to the manner in which decreases in the revenue returns from some commodities are being made good.  There again, I think that those who have spoken on that head have not had due regard to the facts.  In the Budget speech I showed how, as compared with the year 1931, the revenue from the sugar duties had declined by over £500,000, and that there had been correspondingly large decreases in the revenue from imported wearing apparel, imported boots and shoes, imported sugar confectionery, and cocoa products, and some other tariffed articles, which formerly provided a large part of the staple revenue of the State.  Where has this revenue gone?  The Exchequer has lost it, but some section of the community must have derived some benefit from the Exchequer's loss.  In the case of the sugar manufacturing industry, the £510,000 which the State has lost has been distributed entirely between two sections of the population&mdash; between the rural population who grew beet and the semi-industrial population who converted it into sugar.</P>
    <P>The State has provided all the working capital for the factory and, as yet, has not received one penny on its investment.  The debenture holders and the preference holders between them have put £1,000,000 into the factory; possibly when they come to get their dividends on that amount, they will draw not more than £50,000. They may be taken to be an income <Col N="1596" /> tax paying element in the country, but they do not wholly represent them. A large number of these debenture holders are trustees, holding stock for widows and orphans.  A large number of the preference shareholders in this company are very small people indeed, national school teachers and members of the Gárda Síochána.  I have had an opportunity of looking at the shareholders lists.  They do not by any means represent the whole of the taxpaying community.  At any rate, out of this, after raising £1,000,000 capital, they get £50,000.  The rest is distributed to those who work the factory, making the sugar or growing the beet.</P>
    <P>It is the same in regard to other industries.  What the Exchequer has lost has gone to the general mass of the people for by reason of the additional purchases which the original recipients make, the whole of this loss to the Exchequer has been distributed to the community at large.  When, to make good that loss of money derived from indirect taxes which were distributed generally, money which now has been redistributed, owing to the success of our agricultural and industrial policy, the Exchequer goes again to the whole of the community, is there anything inequitable or anything unjust in making good to the Exchequer out of general revenue what has been distributed to the community as a whole?  That is, at any rate, one ground upon which this system could be defended.</P>
    <P>But there is a much stronger ground even that that.  It is frankly this: That no Minister for Finance or no Government is justified in imposing taxes unless they feel certain that the taxes are going to produce a commensurate return.  There are considerations in regard to the rate of income tax in this State which will always make it a very injudicious and very doubtful matter indeed for any Minister for Finance, no matter what his ideas about the social ethics of taxation may be, to raise his tax above the British standard rate.  He may defeat the very purpose for which he imposes the taxes, and not only may he lose the fruit of the increased rate but he may lose it <Col N="1597" /> for a very considerable time, for a period of time so great that in the future any subsequent Government would consider the loss irreparable.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the whole burden of this attack on the Budget has come to this: why did not you go to the income-tax payers?  I think it is time for us to realise that, after all, the income-tax payers are not public enemies.  Last year out of £23,500,000 which we collected, £8,500,000 was collected from what may be described as income-tax payers, not an inconsiderable contribution from a very small section of the community.  What we collected from them paid for old age pensions, unemployment assistance, primary education, secondary and technical education. Therefore, I do not think that even if taxation were to be regarded merely as a salutary punitive measure&mdash; which is of course unthinkable&mdash;a Minister for Finance, apart from other considerations, would be justified in going after the income-tax payers first of all.  I can assure Deputies that if I felt income tax in this State would stand an increase, I would have less compunction in increasing it than I would have in increasing taxes on tea and sugar, but when you are up against the plain, hard facts, when you have got to consider every section of the community, as even the Labour Party when they come to occupy these benches will have to do&mdash;they will have to face up to the same considerations as we have&mdash;you will have to do justice to the community as a whole.  Our social services are provided for very generously.  The poorer sections of the community may not have everything that we desire. At any rate, they are immensely better off than when we took office, and we have had to endure the odium of imposing taxes on everybody in order to bring that position about.  I can assure the Deputy and his colleagues that so far as I am concerned there has been no predilection in favour of one class framing in this Budget.  It would be, I repeat again, extremely injudicious and unwise to increase the rate of income tax over that of the British.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his speech, referred to investments which we hold abroad.  He made the point which had previously been made by Deputy MacDermot.  He said that the fact that there had been a decrease in the excess of our external assets over our external liabilities indicated that our people were living on their capital and were eating into whatever resources they had.  That was a very facile statement, based upon a very casual consideration of the figures which have appeared in some of the financial papers recently.  The excess of external assets over liabilities of our banks on 31st January, 1932, was £80,275,479.  On 31st December, 1932, they had risen to £91,886,000.  Let Deputy MacDermot, Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan cast their minds back and recall the speeches which they were making towards the end of 1932.  If I were to produce those figures and, on a mere citation of them, say there was clear proof that the economic position of this country was improving, I know there is no person who would more strenuously deny the truth of what I had said than would Deputy McGilligan or Deputy MacDermot.  On 31st December, 1933, those assets had fallen to £81,066,000.  They are still almost a million over what they were on 31st January, 1932.  When we find that, at the end of 1934, they have further declined to £73,638,000, Deputy MacDermot gets up and says that ruin has come upon us, that, our external assets, that the substance of the people is being squandered by the wild economic policy of this country.  But he does not look for a more reasonable explanation of the figures than that.  What are the facts?  If he read the &ldquo;Economist&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Statist&rdquo; he must have seen one fact which was mentioned in these papers, and which has a very important significance in this connection.</P>
    <P>The one fact is this: on the 31st January, 1932, the rate of exchange of the dollar to the £ was 3 dollars, 39 cents.  There was a considerable amount of uneasiness in America during 1932 and 1933.  In 1932, when the rate of exchange was 3 dollars, 39 cents, what <Col N="1599" /> is known as fugitive money left America and was transferred to our banks here.  If Deputy MacDermot cares to-morrow to see one of the directors of any of our banks and to ask him if what I am saying is true I am perfectly certain that he will be able to get confirmation of it.  A large part of this fugitive money came over here because the people in America, with the dollar at 3.39 could buy a pound sterling, and at that time the people in America were not too certain as to what was going to be the future course of events there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that makes any difference, but the fact is that the rate of exchange was approximately the same then.  In 1934, the position was reversed.  The pound had appreciated in terms of dollars, and whereas sterling had only been worth 3.39 it is now worth 5.12, and, what is more important still, recent pronouncements over the past three months would seem to indicate that the dollar is going to be stabilised at its present value.  Therefore, the people who shifted this fugitive money to Ireland and Great Britain in 1932 and 1933 are now shifting it back again in order to make a profit on the transaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Another factor influencing the change is that there has been a revival in the London stock markets, and our people, considering the size of this country, are very big operators there.  Money that has been lying <Col N="1600" /> on deposit in our banks is now being taken out of them for the purpose of investment in the rising market in London.  A further explanation is that quite a large portion of our money is now being invested here.  These three factors account, mainly I believe, for the decline which has taken place in our external assets over liabilities.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point in conclusion. In the course of the Budget speech I pointed to the fact that we were hoping this year to carry through a conversion operation.  I did not ask for a coalition; I did not ask for a national government.  The British carried through their conversion operation without a coalition, though they had the second largest Party in the State in Opposition: a Party that polled almost as many votes as the combined votes of those which constitute the National Government.  They carried through that conversion operation; they carried it through by the co-operation of all Parties in the British House of Commons, whether they were in the Government or whether they were in Opposition.  Now, I am asking the co-operation of the Opposition here.  I am asking them to assist us in carrying through this conversion operation, because it is as much their duty and responsibility as it is mine. We are in office and immediately in charge, therefore I felt that it was my duty to ask for this co-operation.  I am perfectly certain that the responsible members of the Opposition will feel that it is their duty to give it, because when this operation goes through there will be, we all hope, a reduction in the rate of interest.  I am not in a position to predict what the new rate of interest will be.  When Deputy McGilligan was speaking to-night I could not discover what exactly was the point that he wanted to make, because at one moment his attitude seemed to me to be this: that if the saving was going to be sufficiently great, then he was not going to help; and, on the other hand, if it was not sufficiently great he was not going to help either.  It was a <i>non possumus</i>, a dog in the manger, attitude, which I am perfectly certain is not the attitude of the more serious and less partisan members of his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> I want to say now that we are in control of sufficient resources to make this operation a potential success.  I am asking the Opposition, and everybody in this country, to co-operate in order that we so raise the standard of our credit in the eyes of our people that we may be able to reduce the rate of interest and secure substantial tax reductions not merely in taxation at <Col N="1602" /> the moment when we are in control of the country's finances, but a reduction in taxation of which any administration which succeeds us will also have the benefit.  I refuse, notwithstanding Deputy McGilligan's speech, to believe that the Opposition will be so shortsighted as not to give that co-operation.</P>

      <P>Roger Delaney, Coolquill, Killenaule, County Tipperary, is the holder of a qualification certificate on which his weekly rate of means is assessed at 8s. per week.  Mr. Delaney <Col N="1449" /> is a single man with no dependants and the scheduled rate of unemployment assistance payable to such an applicant in the district in which Mr. Delaney resides is 6s. per week or less than his weekly rate of means by 2s. In these circumstances unemployment assistance is not payable to Mr. Delaney.</P>
      <P>Mr. Delaney has appealed against the rate of means assessed in his case and his appeal has been referred to the Unemployment Appeals Committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that John Marnell, Kickham Street, Mullinahone, Co. Tipperary, applied under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, for a qualification certificate on the 22nd March, 1934; that the certificate was granted on the 19th March, 1935; that no payment in respect of this claim has been made to date, and if he will state the reasons for the withholding of this payment.</P>

      <P>John Marnell, Kickham Street, Mullinahone, County Tipperary, applied for a qualification certificate on the 22nd March, 1934.  His application was refused by the Unemployment Assistance Officer under Section 10 (3) (c) of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  He appealed against that decision and as a consequence a certificate was issued in his favour on the 12th March, 1935.  Mr. Marnell made application for unemployment assistance on the 19th March last.  At the time he lodged his application it was not clear that he fulfilled all of the conditions for the receipt of assistance and certain inquiries had therefore to be made into the circumstances of his case before payment of assistance to him could be authorised.  These inquiries have now been completed and payment of assistance for which Mr. Marnell has qualified will be made to him this week.</P>
