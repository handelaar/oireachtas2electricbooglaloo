      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he has refused to issue any licences for the importation of &ldquo;shredded wheat&rdquo;; whether this article is being manufactured in the Irish Free State and whether he has given any firm a monopoly of its manufacture or importation.</P>

      <P>I have refused to issue licences for the importation of shredded wheat.  So far as I am aware this commodity is not manufactured in the Irish Free State at the moment but the manufacture of a similar article will be commenced in a few weeks' time.  I have not given any firm a monopoly of the manufacture of shredded wheat or of its importation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be sure if that is the fact, because I imagine that the industry to which the Minister is referring is the one advertised by Brown and Polson, whose plant is designed for wheat flaking, and that is not the same thing at all as shredded wheat, as I am informed.  Is the Minister aware that shredded wheat is an article in a biscuit form and that it differs very materially from <Col N="1094" /> the article proposed to be produced in Dublin?  If the Minister finds, on investigation, that that is correct, will he undertake to reconsider his decision to refuse to issue licences for the importation of shredded wheat?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether a separate fund is being maintained wherein to segregate receipts in respect of the Land Commission annuity arrears funded under the Land Act, 1933, and whether he can can state the total amount of the funded arrears and the total receipts in respect of each gale which has fallen due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>A separate fund is not being maintained wherein to segregate receipts in respect of the Land Commission annuity arrears funded under the Land Act, 1933.  The total amount of such funded arrears was £4,689,093. In accordance with Section 21 of the Act and the Land (Finance) Rules, 1934, funding annuities are consolidated with purchase annuities, and it would require the expenditure of an undue amount of time and labour to segregate the total receipts in respect of each gale which has fallen due between funding annuities and purchase annuities as reduced under the provisions of the Land Act, 1933.</P>

      <P>In view of the figure the Minister has given, is he prepared to stand by the figure that was given on the 6th June, 1934?  That is the first supplementary question that I want to ask.  The second supplementary question that I want to put to the Minister is that, if he is not maintaining a separate fund wherein to segregate <Col N="1095" /> receipts in respect of arrears of Land Commission annuities, how can he purport to borrow £1,500,000 or £1,250,000 for subsidies on the security of the arrears of the annuities fund, when, in fact, no such fund exists and when the receipts in respect of arrears of annuities are, according to the Minister's reply, being taken into the Exchequer's receipts and being treated as revenue and expended as revenue in the ordinary way?  Is the Minister in a position to answer that?</P>

      <P>(1) Arrangements are being made for the distribution of cattle export licences by county committees of agriculture acting through sub-committees appointed from their members.  It is expected that the first such distribution will be made about the middle of July.  (2) The question of the number of members to serve on each sub-committee is a matter for the county committee concerned.

While these imports show a progressive decline from 1930 <Col N="1097" /> to 1933, inclusive, they took an upward turn in 1935 and the figures available for imports during the period January to April of this year show that this tendency has been maintained.</P>

    <Title>Cork Fever Hospital Bill, 1935&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time. The object of this Bill is to enable better facilities to be provided for the institutional treatment of cases of infectious disease <Col N="1098" /> occurring in Cork City and in the South Cork district.  The principal institution at present available for the treatment of cases of infectious disease from the City of Cork and the adjacent rural area is the Cork Fever Hospital and House of Recovery, which was established in pursuance of the Hospitals (Ireland) Act, 1818.  This institution is maintained by annual contributions from the Corporation of Cork and the Cork County Council, and by voluntary subscriptions.  It is administered by a Committee of Management composed of representatives of the Corporation, of the County Council and of the voluntary contributors.  The South Cork district is also served by fever hospitals controlled by the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.</P>
      <P>In connection with an epidemic of diphtheria in Cork County Borough and its vicinity a few years ago, it was found that the accommodation available for cases of infectious diseases in these institutions was far from satisfactory, and the medical superintendent officer of the City of Cork and the county medical officer of health of the county, reported that considerable and costly alterations would be necessary to render the existing institutions efficient as regards the treatment of patients suffering from infectious disease.  It was considered uneconomical to expend large sums of money in renovating these old buildings, and it was accordingly decided that a modern fever hospital should be provided to serve Cork City and the South Cork district, and that the existing institution should be closed.  The Committee of Management of the Cork Fever Hospital and House of Recovery who obtained a substantial grant from sweepstake funds to improve that institution have agreed to co-operate in this proposal and to contribute towards the cost of the new hospital the unexpended balance of that grant, at present about £60,000.  The agreement of the local authorities concerned has also been secured on the basis of the provisions set out in the Bill for their representation on the board of management of the new institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> It will be noted from the provisions of the Bill that the representation of the Committee of Management of the existing fever hospital is to be gradually eliminated according as their first elected representatives acting on the new board of management resign, die or are disqualified.  The chargeability of the cost of maintenance of the new institution has also been agreed upon. The overhead expenses will be payable in equal parts by the Corporation and the South Cork Board of Public Health and each of these bodies will defray, in addition, the cost of maintenance of patients sent from their district to the institution.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains the necessary definitions and prescribes that all approved expenses incurred by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the operation of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Part II authorises the Corporation of Cork to submit a scheme to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the erection and establishment of the new fever hospital.  If, within two years of the passing of this Bill, the scheme is approved by the Minister, with or without modifications, and a suitable grant-in-aid of the carrying out of the approved scheme is made from the Hospital Trust Fund, the Minister shall by Order declare that Part III of the Bill is to come into operation and he shall fix a date for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for the immediate transfer to the Corporation of Cork by the Committee of the Cork Fever Hospital and House of Recovery of any unexpended balance of moneys already received by that Committee from sweepstakes funds and deals with the disposal of these moneys.  Section 7 requires that the Corporation shall, within such period as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may fix, erect and establish an infectious disease hospital to be known as the Cork Fever Hospital in accordance with the scheme approved by the Minister. Section 8 prescribes how the cost <Col N="1100" /> of carrying out the scheme is to be defrayed, while under Section 9 provision is made for the fixing by the Minister of an appointed day on which the new fever hospital is to be regarded as established.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 17, inclusive, deal with the constitution and election of the Board of Management of the new fever hospital which is to be styled the Cork Fever Hospital Board.  It will be noted from Section 11 how the representation of the committee of management of the existing Cork Fever Hospital is to be gradually eliminated.  Sections 18 to 21 deal with the procedure in regard to meetings of the new Cork Fever Hospital Board and their power to make contracts.  Sections 22 to 24 authorise the appointment of a resident medical superintendent of the new fever hospital and of such officers as may be required to carry out the necessary duties in connection with the new institution. Sections 24 and 25 apply certain enactments to the new board for the purpose of conferring on them the powers of local authorities in regard to officers and certain other functions.  Section 26 prescribes that the new institution shall on the day appointed by the Minister be transferred from the Corporation to the Cork Fever Hospital Board.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 to 29 empower the new board to make improvements in the institution from time to time with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Sections 30 to 32 deal with the management and control of the new institution and the class of patients to be admitted for treatment therein.  Provision is made for the reception of patients from Cork City and the South Cork joint district, and also for the admission of infectious disease cases from other districts by agreement with the sanitary authorities concerned and on such terms as may be arranged.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 to 36 deal with the chargeability of the cost of the new institution and provide for such cost being classified under two heads, namely, establishment expenses and patients' expenses, the former comprising any capital expenditure and the <Col N="1101" /> general cost of maintaining and operating the hospital, while the term patients' expenses may be summed up as relating to the cost of the provision of food, medicines, treatment, etc., required for patients individually.  The establishment expenses are to be charged in equal shares against the Corporation of Cork and the South Cork Board of Public Health.  Each of these bodies is to defray, in addition, the patients' expenses in respect of cases admitted from their administrative area.  Section 37 confers borrowing powers on the board of management of the new institution.  Section 38 deals with the procedure to be observed in regard to the accounts of the Cork Fever Hospital Board. Section 39 arranges for the dissolution on the appointed day of the corporate body established under the Hospitals (Ireland) Act, 1818, for the existing fever hospital.</P>
    <P>Sections 40 and 41 provide for the transfer on the appointed day of the property and liabilities of the above-mentioned body corporate and of the committee of the existing fever hospital to the board of management of the new institution.  Sections 42 and 43 authorise the transfer of the officers of the committee of management of the existing fever hospital to the new Cork Fever Hospital Board.  Under Section 44 the latter board is empowered to manage the existing fever hospital until such time as it can be closed and the patients transferred to the new institution.  Section 45 prescribes that on the appointed day the committee of the existing Cork Fever Hospital is to be dissolved.  Section 46 authorises the Minister to make regulations in regard to certain matters so as to facilitate the carrying into operation of the powers granted by the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Seeing that the provisions of this Bill have been mainly based on an agreement arrived at between the local bodies concerned and there is urgent need for the provision of a new infectious disease hospital to serve Cork City and the adjacent district, it is hoped that the measure will commend itself to members of this House, and <Col N="1102" /> that its passing into law will be facilitated.</P>

      <P>I understand, Sir, that you ruled the amendment out of order on the grounds that because the amendment, if accepted, would require the State&mdash;not as the State, but as an employer&mdash;to pay the contributions of certain of its lowly-paid workers, it is deemed to impose a charge on State funds.  I submit to you, Sir, that this amendment seeks to impose an obligation on employers generally to pay the contributions in respect of this Bill for their workers whose wages are less than £2 per week.  It is not seeking to put any specific charge on the State as the State, but merely imposes an incidental charge upon the State in its capacity as employer.

It was eminently an amendment which should have been offered in Committee, and is, in fact, an extension of an amendment offered on that Stage.  The fact that it only indirectly imposes a charge does not bring it into order, <Col N="1104" /> because the imposition of an actual or potential charge would prevent the amendment from being moved.

      <P>On the Committee Stage Deputy Norton moved an amendment to Section 45 to add certain words, which would cause the report of the actuary, together with any observations of the actuary in relation thereto, to be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas.  The principle of that amendment was accepted by the Minister, and the amendment was inserted in the Bill as it appeared on the Order Paper.  On further examination it was considered desirable to redraft the amendment, and to omit the words: &ldquo;together with any observations of the actuary in relation thereto.&rdquo;  I think the principle involved in the amendment was to secure, at any rate, that the actuarial report would be laid on the Table of both Houses, but if the words proposed to be deleted were to be retained in the Bill I am advised that it would involve the laying on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas all correspondence, and, in fact, the complete files in relation to this matter, and I think Deputy Norton scarcely had that in mind.  I take it that his point will be met by securing that the actuarial report will be laid on the Table of both Houses.</P>

      <P>Do I understand that when the report of the actuary is laid on the Table it would include such observations as were made by the actuary in the course of his report, and that, for instance, the actuarial examination would not be detached from such observations as the actuary submitted?</P>

      <P>I would not undertake to indicate very clearly what would be laid on the Table of the House in addition to the actuarial report, but it would be obviously undesirable and, in <Col N="1105" /> fact, impossible to have all the correspondence laid on the Table of the House.  As to where observations should begin and end I cannot get a clear conception at the moment. Written observations might, possibly, pass between the Minister and the actuary either before the investigation had taken place, during the investigation or, perhaps, subsequent to it.  I do not think Deputy Norton would contend that such communications should be laid on the Table of the House.  The full actuarial report will be placed on the Table of the House and, I think, that is really what Deputy Norton has in mind.</P>

      <P>(1) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in respect of any period a public assistance authority has granted relief, otherwise than in an institution, to or on account of a person who, though entitled to a pension, is not at that time receiving payments on account thereof, and</P>

    <P>the Minister may reduce the arrears by an amount not exceeding the amount of the excess and shall, in such case, pay to such public assistance <Col N="1106" /> authority out of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund a sum equal to the amount by which the arrears are so reduced.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment necessary to prevent the possibility of a double payment out of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Fund in cases where a public assistance authority did not put forward a claim until after the arrears of pension had been paid to a pensioner.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Boland) (for Minister for Local Government and Public Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;That the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) (No. 2) Bill, 1935, be now read a Second Time.  Last December the Minister outlined to the Dáil the provisions of a temporary Bill dealing with the agricultural grant for the financial year then current.  It is now necessary to make provision for this year's grant, and the <Col N="1108" /> purpose of this Bill is to fix the amount of the grant for the present year, to allocate it between the local authorities entitled to participate in it and to provide for its application to the relief of rates.</P>
      <P>The total amount of the grant this year will be £1,870,000.  The actual provision to be made now in order to bring the grant to that figure is £370,000, the sum mentioned in Section 4 of the Bill.  This, when added to the £900,989, the amount of the supplementary grants already included in the Estimates and the original grant of £599,011 charged on the Central Fund, makes the full total for the year.  The total is £100,000 less than last year, when the final addition to the grant was £470,000.</P>
      <P>Except that the amount of the grant has been altered, the Bill is substantially the same in its provisions as the Act dealing with last year's grant which was before the Dáil six months ago.  It provides that relief shall be given by way of a primary allowance on the first £20 of the valuation of land held by each occupier or on the occupier's whole land valuation if less than £20.  In addition to the primary allowance there will be, as there was last year, two other allowances, namely, an employment allowance and a supplementary allowance.  The employment allowance can be claimed by occupiers whose land valuation exceeds £20 where men were at work on the holding, whether as relatives or employees during the whole of the year 1934.  No allowance is to be given in respect of casual employment.  For each man at work an abatement will be made at the primary allowance rate on £12 10s. 0d. valuation if the occupier has so much additional valuation above £20.  The primary allowance rate will be the same as last year, that is, it will be the total rate of relief which occupiers of land not exceeding £10 in valuation enjoyed in the year 1933-34.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of the allowance in each county has been set out in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Certificate) Order, 1935.  These rates vary from 8s. 8d. in the £ in County Kerry to <Col N="1109" /> 4s. 8½d. in the £ in County Meath. As neither the primary allowance rate nor the employment allowance will be altered, it follows that the only occupiers who will be affected by the reduction of the grants will be those of holdings above £20 valuation who either have no men at work or give employment to an extent which is not sufficient to cover the full valuation of their holdings, allowing £12 10s. 0d. for each man.  The part of the valuation that does not rank for employment allowance will be reckoned for a supplementary allowance and this allowance must of necessity, owing to the reduction of the grant, be at a lower rate than last year as the balance of the grant available for supplementary allowances will, it is reckoned, be about 25 per cent. less than last year in every county.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allocation of the grant&mdash;as set out in the Second Schedule&mdash;last year's allocation has been reduced in each county by a sum equivalent to 25 per cent. approximately of the cost of the supplementary allowances last year in that county. The sums in that Schedule, together with Dublin City's share in respect of added areas, make up the full grant.</P>
    <P>The other parts of the Bill call for little comment.  There is a slight change proposed with regard to credit notes.  Every county council that wishes to do so will be in a position to make all the allowances by means of an abatement shown on the demand note, and there is no obligation on any council to give relief otherwise.  There was, however, a strong desire in some counties to continue the system of credit notes and a provision is included which allows each council to utilise credit notes to a limited extent.  The maximum amount that can be allowed by means of a credit note is about £2, half of which will be allowed on the payment of each moiety of the rate. It will not be open to any council, as it was last year, to give the employment or supplementary allowances by means of credit notes.  The first part of the credit note, if issued, will expire at the end of next October, and the second part at the end of March, 1936.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> No change is proposed on the method of dealing with urban districts that are entitled to get a share of the grant from county councils.  They will get what they got in 1933-34, together with whatever addition may be necessary to bring the urban rate of relief on the first £20 up to the county rate.</P>
    <P>A promise was made last year to consider a suggestion to admit employment allowance claims in certain cases in which the employee was in occupation of land of £5 valuation or over.  It was urged that in Mayo, for example, where employees are sometimes themselves small farmers holding land more than £5 valuation, the condition in the Bill prevents their employers receiving an employment allowance in respect of them.  It must be remembered that under the Bill the occupiers of £20 valuation and under get the maximum rate of relief unconditionally and that there is no employment allowance in respect of holdings of £20 valuation and under.  A small holder who has a relative or employee at work on his farm gets no more relief on that account.</P>
    <P>It may sometimes be the case that it is more profitable for a man with special skill who himself holds a fair sized farm to work for another and allow his own farm be worked by someone else.  We think, if his land valuation is £5 or more, having given him relief as a rated occupier, we should not give relief to another occupier for employing him, and for that reason the suggestion made to us does not find a place in the Bill.  It would, in any case, be difficult to make sure that an occupier who was employed by another did not, in fact, also work on his own farm.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like its predecessor, is temporary, because we do not think the time has yet come to deal with more than one year ahead.  Since 1930 the grant has varied every year&mdash;some years downward, some upward.  The amount we are providing this year is, as I have said, less than last year's, but it is more than the year before and is more than three times the original grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very true for the Minister to say that the Ministry change every year with regard to the amount of relief that they are giving the agricultural community in respect of rates on agricultural land.  The Minister truly says the amount they are providing this year is £100,000 less than last year, but he says it is greater than what was given in the preceding two years.  It is very interesting to see that the amount is less by £78,022 than in 1931-32.  In fact, the Government's attitude with regard to the amount this year is a very great reversal of their former attitude.  It has been repeatedly pointed out here that the attitude the Fianna Fáil Party had to rates and the incidence of rates on agricultural land before they came into office and the attitude they now take up are totally different.  It has been recalled already that the President, on the 24th April, 1929, told the House that, in his opinion, the pressure of rates was particularly severe on our farming community. &ldquo;If we take into account,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the fact that they have to compete with rivals in Great Britain and Northern Ireland who are relieved of that burden of rates, we realise what a severe handicap exists and will remain on the farming community.&rdquo; That was the burden.  There have been various renderings of very plain statements in black and white, election promises that derating will be carried out.  Different glosses have been put on those statements by various members of the Fianna Fáil Party at various times both outside and in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now dealing with a year that on the face of it is going to be a very critical year for the local bodies, and it is very well worth while seeing how the local bodies stand with regard to their finances.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that the local bodies ended up the last financial year with £1,034,551 arrears.  Some of us anticipated that that year would have ended up with considerably more arrears than that.  It is interesting to see how that situation was avoided. For the three years prior to last year, the approximate amount of rates collected <Col N="1112" /> during the last quarter of the financial year was, on an average, £750,000.  In fact, for the year 1933-34 the actual sum collected in the last quarter was £751,417; and a worse situation, so far as the arrears of rates is concerned, was avoided last March by the fact that instead of collecting £751,417 for the last quarter as was collected the year before, the amount that was squeezed out of the farmers was £421,000 more than that figure. That large sum was squeezed out of the ratepayers in the county council areas during the last quarter of the year.  They had to shoulder and to face up in that quarter to a much bigger bill than ever before.  The Government is now providing for that grant in relief of rates £78,022 less than was paid in 1931-32, the last year of the administration of their predecessors.</P>
    <P>The farmers have just passed through a year, from the financial point of view, much worse than the year 1931-32 when they got a bigger grant in relief on a reduced figure as compared with this year.  The total warrant that was issued against the farmers for the last financial year in respect of rates was £775,189 more than the total warrant for 1931-32.  Of that sum £560,000 was made up of an increase, in the assessments. That is an increase, in the amount of money wanted for the carry ing out of the business of the local bodies, above the year 1931-32.  Of this excess a sum of £215,267 was due to arrears that the councils had failed to squeeze out of the ratepayers in the six months' squeeze carried out in October, 1934.  So that they have just finished the year in which they had to face a Bill of £775,000 more than they faced in the last year before Fianna Fáil came into office.  Their position in the last quarter of that year was that £421,000 more was squeezed out of them in the last three months than was squeezed out of them in the last quarter of the three years before that. Winding up that year they were told that a sum of £718,000 that they expected, was going to be kept back from them because of the non-payment of land annuities in the various areas last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> They end up with a disastrous year and the Minister cannot say, with the knowledge the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has in his Department, that the agricultural community in this country did not make Trojan efforts to face up to their responsibilities during the last financial year in respect of their rates, and he cannot say that the effort that was made during the last three months of the financial year to meet their responsibilities was not unprecedented. The Minister will have to admit that. In spite of whatever may be said with regard to complaints and plots in the community to prevent the collection of rates the Minister will have to admit that the agricultural community faced up to their responsibilities in the last 12 months.  When the financial year closed the Minister turns round and tells them then: &ldquo;We are going to take £718,000 more than you expected. That £718,000 will have to be got out of you in addition to what you ordinarily would have to pay in the carrying on of your business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, on top of all that, the Minister informs them that he is going to provide £100,000 less in relief of rates from the ordinary agricultural grant in the coming year.  And he comes in the ordinary way to tell the House that the Bill is going to do this&mdash;that it is going to provide for this, that and the other. He tells us nothing at all on behalf of the community from whom these rates must be raised in the coming year. Part of the Bill is so arranged that it is going to give increased employment in the country.  The grant in respect of employment is intended to encourage the employment of labour by farmers throughout the country.  We got, not so very long ago, figures showing the total number of persons engaged in agriculture in 1933.  When we compared that with 1931 there were about 12,000 persons missing and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his contribution to his own Estimate here the other day as well as in a Parliamentary answer yesterday gave the information as far as the total figures for the country is concerned down to June, 1934.  The one outstanding fact from these figures is that when we consider <Col N="1114" /> the male agricultural labourers of 18 years of age and upwards, the increase in that class between 1931 and 1934 is something like 1,600.  We have that position in a country where the Minister for Agriculture has been telling us that during 1934 there has been a very considerable increase in the acreage under wheat; that there has been an increase in the acreage of beet to the extent of 56,000 acres&mdash;the amount, practically, that will be necessary to supply all the sugar requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>The 1934 figures cover the period in which all that subsidised crop arrangement was working and covers the arrangements in which this particular machinery has been working for at least 12 months; yet the fact remains that only 1,600 additional agricultural labourers of 18 years of age and upwards are employed in the country. That is an index of the increased wealth producing machinery that there is in the country and that is what is going to support this very considerable additional burden with very much less resistance for the taxpayers than they have been having in the past, while, as I say, the Government are dipping their hands deeply into the pockets of the rate-paying community and taking £718,000 in respect of Land Commission annuities for last year out of them.  It is just in keeping with the blind-eyed way in which the Fianna Fáil Government are passing through life at present&mdash;not only trying to give the blind eye to present difficulties, but being completely blind to the situation of the agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 provides relief of rates for farmers who own lands in certain urban areas.  I do not understand on what principle these urban areas were selected, because there are other urban areas where conditions are identical which have been excluded from the terms of the Bill altogether and that notwithstanding the promise made by the Minister for Local Government to a deputation which approached him on the matter almost 12 months ago.  Take the Borough of Sligo.  The conditions of <Col N="1115" /> the farmers who own land inside of that borough are identical with the conditions of those who own land in the urban area of Ballina and the other urban areas referred to in the Schedule to this Bill.  Yet I notice that the Bill makes no provision for these farmers in Sligo who own land inside the borough.  A deputation of these farmers approached the Minister in September, 1934, and I am informed that he gave them a very solemn promise upon that occasion that when he was introducing the next Bill providing for the relief of rates on agricultural land he would make provision for their case as well. I do not see any provision whatever in this Bill to cover the grievances which these men placed before the Minister.</P>
      <P>Sligo is not alone in that respect. There are other urban areas also excluded from the terms of the Bill whose exclusion, on the face of it, it is exceedingly difficult to understand. The conditions, as I say, in these areas are identical with the conditions in the areas mentioned specially in the Schedule to the Bill.  I should like to know from the Minister when he is replying whether he is prepared, either on the Committee Stage or the Report Stage, to accept an amendment with the object of including areas like Sligo and urban areas similarly circumstanced throughout the country and if he is prepared to meet the case of those farmers who own land inside of these urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not say one word in his opening statement as to the reasons why £100,000 is being taken off the agricultural grant this year.  Not one word did he mention as to the reasons which inspired the Minister for Local Government to take £100,000 off the agricultural grant for the financial year 1935-36.  The Minister is as well aware as I am or as any other Deputy is of the conditions, especially amongst the members of the farming community, in this country at present. He knows perfectly well that at the moment they are more in need of relief than at any other period since the <Col N="1116" /> Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  He knows, furthermore, that the reduction of even £100,000 in the agricultural grant will impose a serious hardship on every county council in the Free State.  If the Minister wants any indication as to what the actual circumstances are in the farming industry at present he has only to look at the returns provided by the various Government Departments.  If he studies these returns he will find that the earning capacity of the members of the farming community has been reduced on an average by from 32½ to almost 50 per cent. in certain counties. It is in circumstances like these that the Minister proposes to reduce the agricultural grant by £100,000.  I am speaking of the actual reduction which the Minister referred to in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly, as the Minister knows, becoming increasingly difficult to collect land annuities.  That difficulty is not peculiar to one county&mdash;it is general in the 26 counties.  As time goes on it will become more difficult. Even though the rates were collected last year reasonably well, and the outstanding balance at the end of the year was not as great as some of us anticipated it would be, the general opinion among secretaries of county councils, judging entirely by present indications, is that it will be much more difficult during the present financial year to collect the rates than it was during the last financial year, or even the previous financial year.  That is due entirely to the fact that, as time goes on, and the country gets more and more experience of the Fianna Fáil policy, the earning capacity of the ordinary man to meet the demands upon him is lessening.  As I say, the ability of the farmers to pay land annuities is diminishing year by year. The ability will be less this year than it was last year and, consequently, it will happen, when the period is reached that this agricultural grant is being distributed, that the amount coming to many county councils will be almost negligible, and in some cases it will be very doubtful if there will be any money at all coming to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> I should like to hear from the Minister when replying (1), for what reason this £100,000 has been taken off this year; and (2) why it is that in Section 10 of the Bill he did not include the type of farmer in the urban areas I referred to at the opening of my statement.  Neither last year nor this year did the Minister give any reason whatsoever for excluding farmers in certain urban areas and including farmers in a number of other urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems regrettable that at this period in the history of the country the Government should see fit to take £100,000 off the agricultural grant.  It is clear to me that the greatest defaulters in connection with the payment of rates are the Government themselves, when they take £100,000 off the agricultural grant. What was the Fianna Fáil statement when they were on these benches? That the burdens on the farmer should be eased and that the best way to ease them was to reduce the rates.  In place of that, we have a reduction of £100,000 made in the agricultural grant, plus the moneys taken in respect of the non-payment of land annuities.  I think everybody, no matter on what side of the House he sits, will agree that the times have been bad for the agricultural community, and that they are getting worse.  We have been told from time to time of organisations up and down the country trying to prevent rates being paid.  It is idle for Government supporters to be talking in that way.  Is it not plain to everybody that the amount which the local authorities have to meet, as compared with the amount a few years ago, is considerably more than would be the case, owing to the reduction made in the agricultural grant?  It is very regrettable that that reduction should be made, and I put it to the farmer representatives on the Fianna Fáil Benches that it is unjust and unfair to allow that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter on which I should like some explanation from the Minister and that is the exclusion of some urban areas from the benefits of <Col N="1118" /> this Bill.  Amongst the urban areas which are to benefit by it, I cannot see any urban area in the constituency which I represent.  I know agitation has been going on probably in a small way, to have these lands, which are purely agricultural, given the benefit of the agricultural grant.  In my own county I know of holdings inside the fence, so to speak, which are just as agricultural in character as those outside the fence, and yet they get no benefit.  I want to know how it is that some urban areas are included and others left out.  Has there been a re-examination of the whole position? In my town of Carrick-on-Suir the urban area extends three or four miles into the country.  How that area has been drawn I do not know, but I know that great hardships and injustice have been put on some agricultural holdings in urban areas.  I really cannot understand why a proper examination was not made, and I would like some explanation from the Minister on that head.  I can only offer my protest against the deduction of the agricultural grant.  In connection with the payment of rates, the Government are very often the greatest defaulters in paying up what is due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to protest against the reduction of the agricultural grant for the year 1935-36.  Taking into consideration the position, all over the country for the last year or two, and looking at the situation from the point of view of the prospects of the future, it is my conviction that the farmers will not be in a position to meet higher rates now than they were asked to pay in years gone past.  I cannot see very much hope for the collection of the rates for 1935-36.  I know people who have made great efforts in the past year to pay their rates.  A good many then had their cattle seized for the non-payment of rates, and a great many, up to the present, are unable to pay.  Besides that you have the money due in connection with the unpaid land annuities. That will mean a further sum in addition to the unpaid rates for last <Col N="1119" /> year.  With the present reduction in the agricultural grant, I cannot possibly see how the rates are to be met for the year 1935-36.</P>
      <P>Allowances given in respect of people working on the land are, to my mind, too small.  A number of females working both inside and outside, on the land, are not taken into consideration in connection with the allowances. There are many people, under 18 years of age, working for whom no allowances are made.  I think allowances in respect of rates should be given for those people.  I cannot see how the Government can expect that high rates can be collected from the farmers under present conditions.  I speak as a farmer, and I know that farmers will find it almost impossible to meet their rates next year.  Many of the farmers on the Fianna Fáil Benches, living on the land in the country, if they were to state what is in their minds, would have to protest against any reduction of the agricultural grant for the year 1935-36.  As I have already said, I am of opinion that it will be almost impossible to collect rates under present conditions.  I am more than surprised to see any reduction made in the agricultural grant for the present year.</P>

      <P>We, on this side of the House, are protesting against this measure, and particularly in regard to the allocation of the grant.  I am glad that Deputy Holohan made the representations he did in reference to the employment of women.  I referred to that matter previously.  It is not included in this Bill, but I think it ought to be.  The allocation of the grant for the last two years has been very unfair to many farmers.  In Limerick and contiguous counties, the farmer with a farm of average size is placed in a very difficult position owing to the arrangement of the rates.  One farmer, with 30 or 40 acres, might be getting considerable relief, while his neighbour working a similar sized farm gets practically none, because of the particular method in which the relief is given.  One of the hardships in dairy counties is that there is no relief given <Col N="1120" /> for women workers.  In County Tipperary and County Limerick, in many instances&mdash;I will not say in the majority, but in a great many instances&mdash;I do not think I exaggerate when I say nearly half the farmers employ more women workers than men.  Some farmers employ all woman labour in regard to the milking of cows and all that.  It certainly is a hardship when one man sees his neighbour getting considerable relief while he himself is getting practically none.  I think the Minister should look into this.  It is very unfair to the dairy farmers of Limerick, Tipperary, Cork, Kilkenny and other dairy counties. While Deputies in other districts might not realise the unfairness of this allocation, I can assure them it exists and I hope the Minister will take this matter into consideration.</P>
      <P>The burden on the ratepayers has risen considerably in recent years.  It is now £700,000 odd higher than it was some years ago, and, to make matters worse, there is increasing disability on the part of the farmers to meet their obligations.  As Deputy Holohan has said, the farmers are experiencing increasing difficulties to meet their rates alone.  Arrears are accumulating in many counties and, despite the inducement in the way of credit notes&mdash;with their particularly mean way, something of the method of the collection of moneylenders' bills&mdash;farmers were almost put to it at the end of the year to beg, borrow or steal, or else lose the particular advantage offered.  If it had not been for that, I believe the arrears of rates, much as the Deputy would regret it, would have been considerably more than they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many farmers this year went to great lengths to borrow or get money in any way they could rather than lose the advantage of the credit notes. They will be unable to do that in succeeding years.  In many instances, to my own knowledge, people had to get rid of their stock to pay rates.  If you add to that the difficulties which they experienced in meeting other commitments in the shape of annuities, it is easy to visualise what the position of the farmer will be in regard to <Col N="1121" /> meeting future rateable charges.  If there is to be any allocation out of Government funds in aid of rates it should be generously and fairly distributed. There should not, I think, be any discrimination against average-sized farmers who are working their land well.  They should not be precluded from the relief which other people are getting.  We all know that the smaller man is going to get a considerable amount of relief and I think that everybody will agree that the very small farmer is entitled to that relief; but then there is the case of the farmer whose farm is slightly bigger than that of the small man and whose valuation is a little higher.  He employs a man or two and he is really in a worse position than the smaller man inasmuch as the smaller man does his own work with the assistance of his own family.  He has not to meet the incidental expenses which the man with a slightly larger acreage has to meet.</P>
    <P>If the question were considered as it should be, I think it would be found that the people who have suffered most severely owing to the depression have been what I might call middle-sized farmers, men who employ a fairly large amount of labour and whose valuation, particularly in some counties, is fairly high.  If you take counties like Tipperary and Limerick, you will find that the valuation in some cases is more than £2 per acre.  In these counties it does not mean that a man is a very big farmer if his valuation runs up to £100.  I know of many famers of 50 acres whose valuation is over £100, and a man who has only 50 acres cannot certainly be called a big farmer. I do not think that anyone would make the case that a farmer of that type should not be eligible for the relief given in this measure.  Such a man is precluded from getting any relief in respect of agricultural workers if he has four or five women workers, while a man who employs two &ldquo;gossoons&rdquo; of 18 years of age gets the full amount of relief for agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister here before expressed the point of view to me that he did not think that female labour should be encouraged.  Whether it should be <Col N="1122" /> encouraged generally is another point, but there certainly should be some way out of the difficulty when women are doing absolutely legitimate work on a farm, work that perhaps men could not do as well.  It has been the practice for as long as I can remember to employ women in dairying.  It is not a question of their creeping in and taking the employment previously offered to men. They have been doing that work for a longer period than this Parliament has existed, and they will be doing it as long as the most of us will be here.  I think that farmers who employ these women should get some credit for that. The absence of such a provision is to me the chief blemish in the allocation of the grant.  It would not serve any useful purpose at this hour to go into the difficulties of all farmers.  They have been often brought up here, and they will be brought up again on the Vote for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>One feels it rather difficult to understand what object the Government hopes to achieve by this measure.  Recently we had a Budget introduced for the purpose of raising taxation which gave no review of the country's resources or no indication as to whether they were capable of producing that revenue.  In 1933 or 1934 I drew attention to this matter on the Budget Resolutions.  A Budget is produced but no stock is taken as to the country's assets or its capacity to pay. The very same principle is adopted in the case of this measure.  I am at a loss to understand what the Government <Col N="1123" /> is aiming at or where it is travelling.  There is an old Biblical saying either in one of the Gospels or in one of the Epistles&mdash;I think it is in the Gospel for Trinity Sunday&mdash;which is something to this effect: &ldquo;When the blind lead the blind, they will fall into the &lsquo;shough&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Apparently that is the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>That is apparently what is happening in this country. Whatever you want, try to extract it from the people and have no consideration at all for the means by which you will extract it or the capacity of those from whom it is extracted to pay it. The Budget increased taxation without reference to the resources of the country, its prosperity or potential prosperity.  Here is another lopsided statement: &ldquo;It is lower this year than last year, but it is higher than in other years.&rdquo;  That is a very enlightening statement.  With that gloss we are asked to swallow the Bill.  I should like if some other Minister were in charge of this measure.  I should like if either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Agriculture were in this House. Either of them could probably give some reason why this grant is reduced by £100,000 this year or could tell us whether there is any justification for it and, if so, what it is.  The Minister knows quite as well as I do, and as every citizen outside knows, that there is absolutely no justification for the reduction of this grant by £100,000. As a matter of fact, the contrary is the truth.  It would look as if I were piling it on too much if I quoted for you a few concrete cases to illustrate the condition of the people who are asked to bear this loss of £100,000.  The thing is tragic.  I took a cutting out of a paper some day last week&mdash;I think it was on Tuesday week&mdash;giving an account of a seizure which took place <Col N="1124" /> in some county, probably Cork, which makes most of the noise in this country.</P>

      <P>I want to quote this case and to relate it to this Bill. A seizure took place and the entire stock of the farm was cleared.  It was a very substantial farm, judging from the amount of stock that was seized and sold.  The sheriff seized 31 sheep, 32 lambs, 7 horses and 61 cattle.  Anyone who knows anything about farming can well understand that it must have been a very substantial farm off which that amount of stock was seized.  What was all this stock sold for?  The sum of £75.  Is not that a nice state of affairs?  I think the Minister is not just to himself or to the country, and certainly not just to his office, when you have a happening of that kind taking place in the country, and then coming here with a Bill to reduce the agricultural grant by £100,000.  We get from time to time from the Government Bench a lot of general statements which mean nothing and indicate nothing. Where are rates going to come out of that farm this year?  Who is going to bear them, and what are the prospects of the farmers for the future? The Government, apparently, are going to clear all the farms in the country as that farm has been cleared.  Remember, I am not complaining about the Government enforcing the law, because I will always stand behind any Government that enforces the law to the very letter, but what I object to is doing a thing like this, which is criminally immoral.  It is certainly criminally immoral to clear a valuable farm of the entire of its valuable stock, then take the stock to some town in <Col N="1125" /> Ireland and, instead of insisting that the full market price be paid for the stock, selling it to some fellow who comes along from some place that nobody knows for £75.  I do not blame the man who got all that stock for £75.  There is an old saying in the criminal law that if there were no receivers there would be no thieves.  Who are the receivers in this case and who are the thieves?  Why does a man who steals a valuable ring &mdash;it may be worth £20, £50, £100 or £200&mdash;go into a pawnbroker and sell it for 5/-?  Does not the pawnbroker know quite well that when a man does that that there must be something wrong?</P>

The Deputy is entitled, of course, to refer to the need for an increased grant or to object to a reduction of the grant, and to point out in doing so the condition of the ratepayers and how they will be hit.

      <P>I protest against that amount of stock being handed over to any man for £75.  I will make no further comment on it, because no comment that I could make would be half so eloquent as the facts I have given.  Is the Department of Local Government looking ahead and paying any attention to the situation in the country in face of these facts?  There is an intelligence staff in the Department, and I am sure it is as good and efficient as similar staffs in any other Government Departments.  The officials in it have ability and experience and all these things must be well known to them.  No explanation has been given for the reduction that has taken place in the agricultural grant. Deputies will remember all the promises <Col N="1126" /> that were made by the members of the Government before they got into office, and what they stated their policy was to be.  It would take too long to enumerate all the promises they made, but, in brief, they said that their policy for the agricultural industry was to give it an opportunity that it had not had since 1922.  They said that the rule of the sheriff and that the sheriff's bailiff would be put an end to when Fianna Fáil got into office.  I certainly cannot be taken as one who patted the back of the last Administration, but I can say this that in the county I come from there were not ten seizures in it during the ten years that the last Government was in power.  One cannot take up a daily newspaper now without reading reports in it of wholesale seizures.  These reports do not refer to seizures to pay off the net amount of a decree&mdash;the seizure of one cow or something like that&mdash;but they record the seizures of the entire stocks of farms.  The entire stock on farms throughout the country is now being swept away, and then somebody is allowed to come into the sale and bag the loot&mdash;to make an enormous profit out of the whole thing.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, but these reports of seizures make very tragic reading indeed.  I have referred to all the promises that were made by the Government before they got into office.  I will just quote one which had not struck my eye before.  One of the promises they made&mdash;it was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on January the 19th, 1933&mdash;was to develop the untapped mineral resources of Ireland. That had escaped my attention previously. I protest against the reduction in the agricultural grant.  I could quote for the House many cases of real distress amongst the farmers of the country, amongst people who, if you like, were never wealthy.  They could not be called prosperous, yet they were industrious and were able to live in frugal comfort.  Their position to-day is that they have been reduced to a <Col N="1127" /> state of utter poverty.  We hear a lot about the condition of the big farmers. I have no special mission to come here and plead for them, and I am not doing it.  I would like to see them prosperous just as I would like to see every unit in the country prosperous. If the big farmers are not prosperous, it follows that the small farmers cannot be prosperous.  I come here to plead for the small farmers of the country who have been brought to ruin by the policy of the Government.  They have suffered most in this economic war, and, as I said here before and it is a remarkable thing, they are the people who complain least.  In the parish in which I was born the rate collector closed his warrant on the 31st March this year.  There was not one seizure for land annuities in that parish.  The average valuations in it do not exceed £5.  Therefore, I think I am entitled to come here and ask the Government to change its ways and get away from its blind alley policy &mdash;not to be thinking about its own high politics but to think about the people. If the Government fail to do that, then I fear the people will get out of hand &mdash;out of the control of the Government and other responsible people in the country.  The Government should think of the people who are heroically bearing the burdens of this economic war. If they fail to do that, then I fear the storm will break, and when it does there will be no need for this Government or this House.</P>

      <P>We heard from Deputy Mulcahy about the great relief that was given the ratepayers during the last year that his Party were in office, that being the year before the General Election.  No attempt was made from 1925 to give increased relief until that year, when £750,000 was given.  In the two years since we came into office, there was more given than in that year, £250,000 was given in addition to what they gave that year during our first year and, last year, £22,000 more was given than on the previous occasion. The Deputy conveniently forgot that the land annuities have been halved and that that has given relief to the <Col N="1128" /> agricultural community.  He also forgot that the Unemployment Assistance Act has relieved the rates in several parts of the country.  Of course, it is not for him to say these things.</P>
      <P>The burden of all the speeches was that things were getting worse and worse, and that things would be so bad that, next year, we would scarcely get in any rates at all.  The fact is we got more rates in last year than Deputy Mulcahy anticipated.  He says that we got these rates through squeezing. I say that we got them because the campaign in which his Party had been engaged has broken down.  He complains that the moneys stopped and paid into the Guarantee Fund must be spread over the counties and the rates mulcted accordingly.  That will not be so serious an item in the future either, because the campaign in that respect is also breaking down.  We are not going to stand for people paying their rates and refusing to pay their annuities. We are going to get what we are entitled to from those who can pay. We know very well that the campaign is being carried on largely by people who can well afford to pay&mdash;people who led others who, perhaps, could not pay and who might have got consideration, into trouble.  As was stated in this House, when these people were tackled, they paid&mdash;when the sheriff arrived. That game is over now, and I can assure Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues that they are quite wrong in thinking that the rate position is going to be worse in the future.  It is going to be better, so they can cheer up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy raised a question about rating in urban areas.  I understand that when the Minister met this deputation he completely turned down the proposal that there should be extra relief given to certain ratepayers in urban areas.  The only areas which get that relief are those which were rural areas in 1898.  I should like to remind Deputy Roddy that a member of his Party has a motion on the Order Paper asking the Government to tax land values in these areas.  I do not know what the policy of the Party opposite is.  One member of it wants us to tax land-values, <Col N="1129" /> while another tells us that we should relieve the rates in these areas. Those urban areas which are getting this remission are areas which had it in 1898.  The question about women workers was discussed last year.  The Minister is satisfied that it is fair to give relief only in respect of whole-time adult male workers.  I agree with him that that is the most desirable thing.  Even if we were inclined to include women, it would be very difficult, because, as everybody knows, their work on a farm is not whole-time. Their time is divided between the home and the land, and it could not be said that they were employed whole-time on agricultural work.  Deputy Curran also referred to the urban areas. I thought that Deputy Curran was purely a farmer Deputy.  There is a certain amount of relief given the farmers and, if that were extended to the towns, the portion thus given would come off the farmers.  The Deputy says that the towns should get the same relief that is now given to the farmers.</P>

This £100,000 will not be taken off the small farmers or from farmers of the type mentioned by Deputy Bennett&mdash; farmers who employ a number of men. There is relief of an extra £12 10s. in respect of every male worker employed, and the man with 50 acres who employs the requisite number of men will get full relief.  It is the people who give little or no employment who will have to pay the £100,000.</P>

      <P>There is a point which I should like to raise, but I do not know whether it is appropriate to this Vote.  Recently there have been published returns of a by-election in Galway.  Amongst the particulars published were the number of votes polled for different Parties in particular areas.  This bears on the secrecy of the ballot, and I should like to ask the Minister if the conduct of elections is such that these disclosures can be made and if he will undertake that the arrangements in the future will be such as will preserve the secrecy of the ballot.</P>

      <P>Surely somebody is responsible for the control of these officers.  It is not a question of an election petition.  It should not be necessary to take an election petition in order to correct an obvious irregularity in the conduct of elections.  The Minister and every other Deputy should be interested to secure that the ballot will be secret.  Apparently, there have been disclosures in connection with the Galway by-election which show that there is a lack of secrecy.</P>

      <P>I should like to get some information with regard to this Vote.  There is a provision in the Estimate for binding and printing an English-Irish dictionary.  I asked the Minister on a previous occasion when it is anticipated this English-Irish dictionary will be ready for issue to the public, and what will be the price of the dictionary when issued.  Again, there is repeated an increased amount <Col N="1133" /> for the publication of an Irish translation of the New Testament.  Year after year money has been voted for that purpose, but, as far as we know, no progress has been made with that work.  Can the Minister assure us that progress is now being made, and that the increase in the Vote over that of last year indicates that the work will be completed this year?  In connection with the publication of the Oireachtas Debates and in view of the fact that at this period of the year the House sits on Tuesdays, I should like to know if something could not be done to speed up the printing, so that the Debates for the previous week would get into the hands of Deputies not later than Tuesday morning.  It is very inconvenient at times, particularly when the Government is anxious to speed up business, when we often deal with matters on Thursday that the Minister has to deal with again on Tuesday, that he has to do so without the volume of the Debates being in his hands.  It leads to a certain amount of extra trouble on the part of Deputies.  I should like to ask whether it is because of the delay in the Stationery Office, or in any of the printing establishments, that the Trade Returns are so late in being issued.  There was a time when we got monthly trade returns within 14 or 15 days after the end of the month.  Now we have to wait six weeks for the official trade returns for a particular month.  The volume of trade returns for March reaches us about the middle of May and for April in the middle of June.  I should like to know if it is the Stationery Office that is responsible for the abnormal delay, which we were not at all used to, and which leads to a certain amount of inconvenience.</P>

      <P>On the question of the earlier publication of the Parliamentary Debates, I do not see how that is going to be practicable.  After all, the House as a rule sits on Fridays, and the printers have only got the remainder of that day, part of Saturday and Monday to print the Debates.  I will see if anything can be done to expedite the issue of the weekly reports, <Col N="1134" /> because I agree with the Deputy that it is rather disadvantageous not to have them when the House sits first during the following week.  On the question of the English-Irish dictionary, it was expected that that would be published last year, during the financial year ending 31st March last.  I am advised now that it will probably be issued before the end of September. In regard to the publication of the Irish translation of the New Testament. some difficulties have been experienced owing to the fact that other matters than merely the adequacy of translation have, on occasion, to be taken into consideration.  Arrangements have been made which, I think, will lead to the issue of the translation in fitting form at the earliest possible date.  I would not go so far as to say an early date, but the earliest date possible. With regard to the delay in the issue of Trade Returns, I am not in a position to say if that can be ascribed to the procedure in the Stationery Office or not, but I will have inquiries made to see if it can be expedited.  At the same time, it was not my experience in opposition that we received these returns within 14 or 15 days.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether any proceedings are being taken by this Department to bring out some up-to-date maps from the point of view of aviation?  There is a certain lack of proper flying maps.  In other countries in which I have been&mdash;England, <Col N="1136" /> France and even in Eastern Europe&mdash;they have very good modern flying maps for the guidance of aviators. There is a certain lack in that respect here.  Certain maps that were printed under the British régime have been reprinted, but generally they only cover very small areas.  It would be well if arrangements were made to issue maps for the convenience of visitors that will be coming here in increasing numbers, and in order that we should have such maps as other countries have.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir, but there was one question that I wanted to mention in connection with this.  I did not realise that it was related to this Vote.  I should like to know whether anything has been done in the Ordnance Survey with regard to the preparation of suitable maps in Irish.  There is a lamentable absence of anything like a reasonable map of Irish counties in the Irish language&mdash; or even of a map of Ireland.  I understand that a certain amount of progress has been made with regard to the preparation of such maps, but I think everyone will agree that the progress that has been made in the provision of county histories and maps in the various counties is slower than we would like to see.  There is an increasing amount of schools throughout the country where instruction is being made through the medium of Irish. More concentration is being put on the teaching of geography and history through the medium of Irish than on the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish.  Nevertheless, we are completely without maps in Irish. I should like to know from the Minister whether or not there is any prospect of such maps being made available.  It is obvious that nobody else except the Government is going to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I can inform the Deputy that a certain amount of work has been going on in that connection for quite a long time, <Col N="1137" /> but the Deputy will understand that, sometimes, it is not very easy to determine the correct form of all the Irish place names to be put on the maps.  I am sure that the Deputy is aware that the question of the proper names of places has been a matter that has led to considerable controversy in the past. However, a Committee has been working on that matter, and a good deal of work has been done by that Committee already.  I can assure the Deputy that that matter has not been lost sight of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>The Minister has been very general in his statements.  If there is a difficulty in clarifying certain Irish place names, and if the Department of Education and the Ordnance Survey Department are sitting down in front of that difficulty, I am afraid that it means that nothing will be done for a couple of hundred years.  However, if we could get from the Minister some assurance that some particular county is engaging the attention of the Ordnance Survey Department, we would feel more hopeful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

Moreover, that a committee, so far from sitting down in front of the difficulty, which the Deputy has mentioned, has got quite a distance along the road. However, if the Deputy means that these maps should be published according as they are ready, I shall put that matter before the Department concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote is the only opportunity that we have of getting some information with regard to some of these commissions and special inquiries.  There are three commissions mentioned there that, so far as I am concerned, I should like to hear something about.  The first is the Irish Manuscripts Commission.  I should like to get some information as to the particular line the Manuscripts Commission is pursuing at the present time.  Then there is the Banking and Currency Commission.  When the latter Commission was set up, I tried to argue with the Minister that, for many reasons, the evidence given by that Commission should be given in public, that it should be suitably taken note of, and that it should be made public not only to members of this House but to the public; particularly to Deputies or members of the public who might be anxious to get into touch with the deliberations of the Banking and Currency Commission for the purpose of seeing the trend of discussion there and the ideas current there, with a view to being in a better position to prepare for the discussions that will inevitably take place when that Commission finishes its sittings and makes its report.  Has not the time now come for some kind of a report to be given to members of the House, or for some kind of information to be given to such members of the House as may want some information as to the ground covered up to the present by the Banking and Currency Commission? I should also like to know whether, in view of the fact that, already, a number of reports or statements of evidence have been placed before the Banking and Currency Commission, these reports and statements <Col N="1139" /> of evidence should not be made available to Deputies of this House and the general public.  That Commission has now been sitting for some time.  We must presume that it has not been idling its time or avoiding discussion, and there must be some useful memoranda which could be made available to Deputies and to the public.  Again, I should like to hear whether the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Works has finished its labours or when it will issue its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, should like to hear about the activities of the Inter-Departmental Committee.  I understand that a number of schemes were considered, and we have heard that the report will be made available to the members of the House.  As far as I know, however, we have got no information at all with regard to these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us what this Inter-Departmental Committee in connection with Public Works have in mind when they speak of novel schemes of work?  It has come to my notice that local authorities have abandoned schemes that, otherwise, would have been dealt with by these local authorities, because of the idea that these schemes were to be financed by the Inter-Departmental Committee.  I gather that there has been a widespread misconception as to the type of schemes this Committee will finance, and that that has been the cause of certain schemes being abandoned by local authorities.  If it is not intended to finance schemes which are properly in the domain of the local authorities at present, the Committee should make that clear.  Cases have come to my notice recently where a public work of rather urgent character, in a particular town in my own constituency, and which had arrived at an advanced stage, was sent to the Inter-Departmental Committee in the belief that the local authority might induce the Committee to finance that scheme. The receipt of the proposals for the scheme was duly acknowledged by the <Col N="1140" /> Committee, and I believe that that acknowledgment led them to believe that the scheme might be financed by the Inter-Departmental Committee.</P>
      <P>The fact of acknowledging a letter in that way seems to me to be calculated to give a local authority the impression that there is a chance that a scheme of that kind will be financed by the inter-Departmental Committee. I suggest to the Minister that some steps should be taken to indicate in broad outline the kind of schemes the Committee have in mind and that the inter-Departmental Committee ought not be used by local authorities as a means of avoiding the carrying out of schemes for public works which are properly within the province of these local authorities at present.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Mulcahy, I am anxious to know whether this Committee has published any report and whether the report will be made available to Deputies, either by sending them individual copies or by laying it on the Table of the House. There was a good deal of Press publicity given to the fact that the Committee had been established, and there was a good deal of boosting in relation to the novel kind of schemes the Committee would undertake.  I should like to know whether any proposals have been made by the Committee for dealing with any of these novel schemes of public works, what kind of schemes they propose to finance, and generally, what has been done by this inter-Departmental Committee.</P>
      <P>There is a sub-head in the Estimate providing for the expenditure of £1,700 this year on Commissions and Inquiries not specifically provided for, which I do not see explained subsequently in the Estimate.  I should like to know whether any of that money has been spent during the present financial year and, if so, on what kind of Commissions and Inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I, first of all, dispel a misconception which seems to be current, judging by some of the speeches which have been made here? The inter-Departmental Committee <Col N="1141" /> will not have the disbursement of any funds and, therefore, it will not of itself be able to carry out any works. It was set up &ldquo;to consider the extent to which it is practicable to devise a scheme of useful and desirable public works with a view to reducing expenditure on unemployment assistance to a minimum and to report upon the nature and extent of such works, the steps to be taken to initiate them, the best method of financing them, and the organisations to be set up to carry them out.&rdquo;  It was obviously a purely advisory and not an executive body, and, therefore, if there should be any local authorities with duties and responsibilities to the public who are so misinformed as to believe that this Committee is going to relieve them of any of their obligations, they had better get rid of that misapprehension at once.</P>
      <P>The mere fact that the Committee is asked for schemes of a novel character is an indication that it is not going to recommend that local authorities should be relieved of their proper responsibilities in matters of public health and, therefore, if there is any local authority deferring the execution of necessary public works, in the hope that the Committee is going to take some part of the charge off them, they had better depart from that attitude at once.  In fact, I might say that, so far as I am concerned, the Departmental machinery will not be used to relieve local authorities of the duty of carrying out works which would normally be done by them.  On the question of the interim report, it is not proposed to publish it because all the ground would be covered in the final report.  It is of a preliminary nature only and has merely set out the lacunæ and blanks which have to be filled in our information with regard to the distribution of unemployment and certain legislative defects which the Committee has come up against.</P>

      <P>It is true that a great deal of ground has been covered by the Committee, but I should like the Deputy not to be under any misapprehension. A great deal of material has not been put before them by the general public, and, in fact, the Committee had to adjourn some of its sessions and ask the general public again and again to submit memoranda on the matter.  I take it that the Deputy does not accuse the Committee of lying down on the job.  I can assure him in regard to that.  The mere fact that the people who are on the Committee have been able to give what might be described as nine weeks' continuous work, between 23rd November and 10th April is, I think, an indication that they are taking the job pretty seriously.</P>

I think the general mass of the people would disagree with him also, because what they are concerned with is the official report of the Committee, and not the individual views of this or that person.  Those views may be distorted and wrong, and the reason why we have set up a Committee is in order that it should consider the matters which have been put before it, and, having heard the evidence, express an opinion.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been pointing out on the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, that the ratepayers in the county council areas last year had to provide, under the assessments alone, £560,000 more than they had to provide three years ago, before the present Government came into office; that is, the ordinary ratepayers throughout the country had to provide more than half a million pounds out of their pockets.  We had the Government proposing under the present Budgetary arrangements an increase in the valuation of property in urban districts by 25 per cent., in order that the Government may get more taxation based on that property.  This Estimate discloses that the Government is able to wangle its own business so well that it is going to pay £5,680 less in respect of contributions to the rates for the coming year than it did last year. There is no person in this country who would not be glad to know how the Government manages to do that.  It does seem, in the first place, very strange on the part of the Government that it is able to so wangle its own rates bill that it can save £5,680 in this particular year.  It seems an astounding <Col N="1148" /> thing that the Minister should get up and put this Estimate before the House without saying a single thing about it.  Would the Minister say what local bodies he is &ldquo;sticking&rdquo; this year for £5,680 which they expected to get from him?</P>

Of course I am aware that the rates are down somewhat in the city, but that would seem to indicate that they had got a reduction in the valuation. I should like to know if there is a reduction in the valuation of buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That will certainly arise.  Another matter I notice is that there is nothing set out for Beggar's Bush Barracks, where the central marketing depôt has its stores.  Are no rates paid on that?  Looking at the Gaeltacht Services, I cannot see anything for rates in that either.  I would like to put those two points to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has gone in for a little bit of deception in order to hide from the public the regrettable fact that we are paying for two Viceregal establishments.  The rates on the Viceregal Lodge in the Phoenix Park come to about £800.  They were mentioned in previous Estimates, but they are not mentioned this year. The Minister doubted the fact that rates were paid on that establishment, but it is a fact that £800 are paid by the taxpayers for the upkeep of a derelict palace.  There is there a vast estate falling to pieces, apparently. The roof is falling in and nothing is being done for it.</P>

      <P>I do not know where Deputy Mulcahy got the happy inspiration which caused him to speak on this Vote.  He was Minister for Local Government at one time and he knows exactly how this grant is determined. The amount of it is determined primarily by the rates, the amount in the £ which is levied for rates.  The reduction in the Vote this year is not due to the fact that we are withholding anything from any of those hard-pressed local authorities for whom the Deputy is so solicitous.  It is mainly due to the fact that most of the Government property is located in Dublin and there has been, under this Administration, a substantial decrease in the Dublin rate and, accordingly, we get the benefit, the advantage, of that. That explains the point which Deputy Dockrell raised in regard to the Oireachtas building.</P>
      <P>On the other question of the two palaces to which Deputy Esmonde refers, I am rather surprised to learn that the roof is falling off one of these palaces.  It is, in fact, at the present moment being converted into a museum.  Presumably, the Deputy's portrait may, at some time, occupy a high position there.  It is, at any rate, being converted into a museum and, therefore, it is not true to say that we are paying rates on a derelict building.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look at Part III of the Estimate, which gives details, he will notice the buildings are not set out there individually and that the total Estimate is apportioned among the Departments of State under whose control the particular buildings are.  Therefore, whatever rates are payable on any property under the control of the Minister for Lands&mdash;and that, of course, would include the Gaeltacht Depot&mdash;they would be included there.  Whether the place is being used for the purpose of the Gaeltacht section of the Department, or for some other service for which the Gaeltacht Department is responsible, it would be included under Item 10 in the figure £4,490.</P>

      <P>I notice there is an increase in the Vote for the Abbey Theatre.  I have no special objection to it this year, but I must say it is becoming rather a national monument, rather fossilised.  If it does not show a little more liveliness.  I think we should not continue this Vote through the years. I think the theatre should be allowed to rest on its laurels, and it should show a little more initiative.  With regard to sub-head C&mdash;Scientific Investigation, etc.&mdash;I am glad to see the Minister has increased the amount for various scientific societies.  The increase is very small, but nevertheless I am glad to see it.  I hope the Minister read very carefully the address given a couple of days ago by Dr. Thomas Bodkin, in which he put forth some very good home truths.  I will refer to that matter later, when the Vote for the Department of Education comes under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago I had occasion to mention that I thought the various small Votes dealing with scientific and cultural matters should be brought together under one heading.  Here today we have had to deal with the Stationery Office, the Ordnance Survey, Commissions and Special Inquiries, and now Miscellaneous Expenses. Later on, we will come to deal with Science and Art.  We have a large <Col N="1151" /> number of small Votes dealing with precisely the same matters&mdash;the publication of texts, translations from the Irish language, etc.&mdash;and I think it is high time that some co-ordination should be brought about between these various activities.  There is a great waste of effort when various small societies, or small authorities, are doing work individually which together they could do very much better.  However, that would be more a matter for the Minister for Education, and I will raise it when we come to the Vote dealing with Science and Art.  I hope the Minister for Finance who is, I understand, a co-ordinating power amongst various Departments, will give favourable consideration to the proposal put forward by Dr. Bodkin, that there should be a central department for cultural activities in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): This particular matter always reminds me of a kind of penny dip for every Government that is in power.  I am rather intrigued to know what is the reason for this eternal subsidising of the Abbey Theatre.  What is wrong with Irish life that it cannot be presented in such an attractive form as will bring people to the theatre?  What is wrong with Irish life that it cannot be presented in such an attractive form as to change queues from outside our picture houses and place them outside our theatres? For some years past the Abbey Theatre has been endeavouring to make the Irish peasant stand on his head.  We are granting £1,000 to a theatre which has a very limited appeal.  What the Abbey Theatre presents has a very limited appeal.  It does not extend to the general public; it does not extend even to the entire public of Dublin City, where the theatre is situated.  It is no harm it does not go down the country, because the Irish peasant would never, in the mirror reflected by <Col N="1152" /> the Abbey Theatre, recognise or understand himself at all.</P>
      <P>What is there sacred in drama that we must subsidise it eternally and leave everything else out of consideration? Has the Minister ever taken a journey in a fast train, walked down the corridor and observed all the people reading magazines published across the water, and for which they have to pay an extra penny or two?  Has it ever occurred to him to subsidise an Irish-produced magazine which would present suitable reading to the Irish public and get nearer to the people, rather than subsidise a theatre in the heart of the City of Dublin, about which the majority of the people of Dublin know nothing, and which the people of the country never see?  We find a great deal of attention being given to the Abbey actors in London and America, but after all, it is not to amuse the people of London or New York, or Chicago, that we should subsidise that particular theatre.  I suggest to him that there are various other things on which he might usefully spend that £1,000 other than in subsidising these institutions that are making the Irish peasant ridiculous, and making him stand on his head, for the past 30 years.</P>

      <P>I move that the report be referred back to the Committee of Selection for further consideration.  It has been said that the chameleon is a creature that can change his colour with amazing frequency.  The capacity of Fianna Fáil to change its policy to suit the particular breeze that is blowing puts the chameleon's art to shame. Last night the Fianna Fáil Deputies who were on the Committee of Selection claimed the right to choose not only the Deputies who would represent their Party on the special committee that was to be set up, but also the right to choose the Deputies who would represent the Opposition Party.  That claim was rebutted by the representatives of the Opposition and the Committee adjourned for an hour.  When it reassembled the Fianna Fáil Deputies not only claimed it, but by their packed majority, forced that construction of the precedents governing the Selection Committees upon the Committee of Selection and they actually did elect or purport to elect Deputies to represent this Party in an inquiry into the seedy transactions of their own Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These Deputies profess to be supporters of President de Valera.  On the 17th May, 1929, as reported in column 2257 of volume 29 of the Official Debates, Deputy de Valera, as he then was, is reported as speaking with reference to a Committee similar to the Committee in the deliberations of which we took part last night, and he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to Private Bills in general, we therefore hold that the Committee set up to examine a Private Bill ought to be fairly representative of the House, and to get a representative Committee the same procedure ought to be adopted as is adopted for other Committees.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the Committee of which we are debating the setting up is one of the other committees.  It is not a Private Bill Committee.  The President continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The procedure in regard to other committees is that on the Selection Committee you have representatives of the different Parties, and when a selection of members has to be made, representatives of the different Parties nominate, and as a rule, the nominations are accepted,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies Traynor and Smith to take special note of that&mdash;&ldquo;as a rule, the nominations are accepted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not know that it has ever been held that the Committee of Selection could not refuse to take nominations from the representatives of any Party, but it has not in practice ever been done.  Commonsense dictates&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, he recognised that at this time he was not addressing his own supporters, or he would not appeal to commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Commonsense dictates that the simplest way to get a representative committee is to have the Selection Committee representative of all Parties, and to have it understood <Col N="1155" /> as a working rule that the nominees of the representatives on that committee of the different Parties will be accepted.  That is our position with regard to this particular Joint Committee.  We had a representative on it, and we expected that representative, when a selection was being made of members, would have the right to nominate on behalf of our Party such members as he thought would serve on that committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is pretty explicit.  It clearly lays down the view of Deputy de Valera, as he then was, and of President de Valera, as he now is.  When, however, acting on that well-established and universally accepted precedent, we went to the Committee of Selection last night and handed in the names of four Deputies who would most adequately represent our Party on the Special Committee, we were met by a blank refusal by the packed majority of Fianna Fáil, to consent to their election, and they purported to choose other persons.  Now, that is a direct negation of what President de Valera himself stood for in the House when he represented the Opposition.  It is a direct repudiation of the well-established precedents by this House which were established long before Fianna Fáil came into the House at all.  These were precedents of which Fianna Fáil did not hesitate to claim the protection in their own defence when they came in here as an Opposition.  These are precedents established by Cumann na nGaedheal, the Labour Party, and the Independents, when they formed this House in the absence of Fianna Fáil. They were implemented by Fianna Fáil, for their own protection, when they were the Opposition.  Their right to claim that protection was admitted by the majority with which they were confronted at that time.  But on the first occasion, when those precedents are called to the aid of the minority which faces them in the Opposition, they sent in those two pillars of jurisprudence, Deputy Traynor and Deputy Smith, of Cavan, to luxuriate in their opportunity of trampling on the precedents <Col N="1156" /> which protected the independence of this House.  It is nothing surprising to us to meet an attitude of that kind in Deputies like Deputy Traynor and Deputy Smith.  We expected it and it does not surprise us.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it quite clear that, though we recognise in their attitude a determination on their part to prostitute the proceedings of this House for the purpose of cheap Party advantage and for the purpose of defeating the ends for which this Committee was set up, we recognise our duty to co-operate in the carrying on of Parliamentary government in this country and we therefore propose to partake in this Committee in order to avoid a situation arising in which it might be said elsewhere that the ordinary institutions of Parliamentary government had broken down for want of capacity in the representatives of the people to carry them on.  I want the House to realise, quite apart from the contemptible conduct which we have all come to expect from certain Deputies in the Government Party, the extremely disastrous precedent that is going to be established if the House allows this thing to happen.  The Constitution guarantees one forum in this State upon which public men can ventilate what they believe to be abuses and where what appears to them to be a <i>prima facie</i> case of scandal has arisen, they can refer to it in this House; they can demand its investigation, and they can catechise the responsible Minister with absolute privilege.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the departure which is now adumbrated from well-established precedent is permitted by this House the situation in future is going to be that, when a public man states what appears to him to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of abuses in Government circles or Government administration, the Government of the day can, by using their majority in this House, fix the terms of reference for a Select Committee consisting not necessarily of the facts as stated by the member of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit in brief that they can use their majority to fix the terms of reference, that they can use their majority for the purpose of choosing the personnel, and that they can then use their majority on the Select Committee for the purpose of making a report.  I venture to submit that I am not departing from the strict rule of order in pointing out the consequence that is going to flow from the precedent about to be established.  First, the Government majority in this House can fix the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should appreciate the fact that as soon as the terms of reference are decided by a Vote of the House they become terms of reference settled by the Dáil and may not be described as Party terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That merely emphasises the argument which I am submitting to the House.  If Parliamentary institutions are to be worked they must be worked with goodwill.  If they are to be abused by a majority they become the most loathsome tyranny of all, and that is the tyranny of a majority masquerading as democracy.  They become a veiled and loathsome tyranny which holds itself out to the public as an advocate of freedom.  It is to be observed that once the terms of reference are fixed they go up to the Committee as the terms of reference adopted, not by a Party, but by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And have done so. Under the procedure of this House, without particular reference to these terms of reference, it is open to the Government to insist on any terms of reference they like if they command a majority of the members of the House. Having got that far, the precedent is laid down that the Opposition shall be furnished with the protection that they can put upon that Committee a fair <Col N="1158" /> proportion of members of their own choosing so that they may put upon it the most efficient members of their Party to conduct the inquiry that will arise out of the terms of reference fixed by the dominant Party in this House.</P>
      <P>Now, it is sought to establish a rule that, having fixed the terms of reference, the Government can then proceed to choose, not only members of the Special Committee to represent their own Party but, where they think necessary, they can also choose members who they think will represent the Opposition Party, although the Opposition Party warns them that the names upon which their fancy has lighted do not represent the Opposition, and although the Opposition Party tenders for the acceptance of the Committee names which they, the Opposition, say fairly represent them in the matter to be undertaken.  In this particular case the names submitted by the Opposition were those of Deputies Costello, McGilligan, Fitzgerald and Coburn.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Government claim the right to exclude from the Select Committee the one individual who, we say, is fully competent to investigate matters which will come within the competence of the Committee to examine.  I want to submit to the Government that in order to draw a veil over these activities they have allowed themselves to be carried away into discriminating against one individual.  I urge them to realise that, in fact, what they are doing is destroying one of the most valuable liberties that Deputies in this House have got.  I urge them to refrain from doing something which is going to be irreparable, simply from motives of pure expediency.</P>
      <P>Precedents are hard to establish; but once established they are almost impossible to get rid of.  We have, in this House, definitely established the right of every Party to nominate its own representatives upon select committees. That right is going to be taken away.  If it is once established that the majority can take that right from the minority, in a case of one individual, you will have established, for all time, the principle that the majority has a right to nominate the whole committee if they so will, and this precedent will be quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, as he then was, when in opposition saw the danger of it.  The Government of the day saw the danger when Deputy de Valera remonstrated, and willingly agreed that it was essential to preserve that protection. Admittedly it is a fiction, because in the theory of the law the Committee of Selection can choose whom they will without reference to Parties at all.  The precedent has grown up in order to prevent the committee doing injustice.  Bring down that precedent once and you open the floodgates of injustice, and no one can close them except by an express resolution of this House, which will completely destroy the whole system of committees of selection for the future.  We believe &mdash;we do not ask anyone on the Government side to agree with us&mdash;that this inquiry can be conducted satisfactorily <Col N="1161" /> only if Deputy McGilligan is a member of the Committee.  We believe that unless he is there to assist in indicating persons and papers which must be sent for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We want the fullest possible examination of everybody and everything connected with it, but we want it done in such a way that substantial truth will emerge.  And that cannot be if the Government adhere to the attitude their representative adopted on this Committee of Selection.  I urge them not to jettison precedents of this House in order to serve the contemptible and transient purpose they have in mind at the present time.</P>

      <P>I desire to second the motion that the report be referred back.  The reason it is necessary to do this is that the action of the Committee of Selection last night was contrary to every scrap of precedent in connection with it.  We had the President's appreciation of the situation, <Col N="1162" /> and the value of it, two years after he entered this House.  We have the admission from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs now that that has been the precedent.  Nevertheless the Committee of Selection were forced last night, shall I say by the chairman's attitude, to deal with matters in a way they were never dealt with before.  The Selection Committee heretofore was never anything but machinery for associating the proposals of the various Parties in the House, and putting them together for presentation to the House. There never was a motion before them. The Committee has its own tradition. It was the machinery for taking certain bits of information, piecing them together, and presenting them to the House.  All the precedents established in that particular way were scrapped and wiped out last night by the attitude of the chairman, forced upon him by the attitude of the representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The House has decided that a special committee shall be set up to elicit certain facts, and having elicited them, to make such report upon them as a select committee of the Parliament of this country ought to make.  As far as the people of the country are concerned, and the rank and file of this House are concerned, that report should be made upon the facts elicited by a committee like that, and would be worthy of the House and worthy of an Irish Parliament.  But the particular things we are concerned with are the facts themselves.  Deputy McGilligan brought some facts before the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain facts with regard to action taken, and certain facts with regard to the existence of documents.  So far as the facts could be brought before the Dáil he made the House aware of the existence of certain documents, and the happenings of certain transactions.  And on this he based an allegation that transactions had taken place, or were taking place, in respect of public property in this country which it was not in the public interest should be allowed to continue that they were such as should be <Col N="1163" /> inquired into in a public way; that the full facts should be brought to light and such action taken as would preserve the public interest.</P>
      <P>Apart from whatever the departure from precedent may bring personally, I am concerned at the moment with the immediate purposes of this House; and the immediate purpose of this House is that it requires a select committee and has ordered such to be set up to elicit the facts and make a report to this House.  Deputy Dillon has stated that Deputy McGilligan is being prevented from acting as a member of this committee in accordance with the wishes of the Fianna Fáil Party, and Deputy Donnelly says approvingly with a nod of the head: &ldquo;Because he made the allegation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A Deputy who becomes cognisant of certain facts, brings these facts before the House here and so makes a case to the House that the public interest is being injured and has to be protected, is to be excluded, in Deputy Donnelly's opinion, from membership of the Committee that is to find out, by order of this House, every single person who can give information, every document in which information may be available, and have these brought before the Committee as a whole.  This is a Committee on which the Government <i>bloc</i> are to have a majority.  They have the chairman.  There will be one report. If there is a majority opinion in that Committee, the report will be the majority opinion.  There simply will be one report.  It is only in the examination in the work of the Committee itself that the facts may be fully and clearly seen.  Lack of information on the part of the Committee as to where they may look for facts, either from persons or documents, will keep the facts hidden.  The absence from the Committee of any person, in respect of whom there is clear evidence that he can be of use to the Committee in following up the facts is going to make the work of the other members of the Committee more laborious than it otherwise would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the attitude of the Fianna Fáil members if they refuse to accept this motion, is that they want to make it difficult for the members of this House sitting on this Committee to get at the facts.  They can be assured that the sense of public duty, which members of this Party have in <Col N="1165" /> this House, is such as not to allow them shrink from any additional effort or work that may be necessary to get all the facts with regard to this particular matter, so that the facts and the implications of them may be fully estimated by the Committee.  It is deliberately throwing difficulties in the way of the work of the Committee, set up by this House, to exclude from membership of the Committee the person who, because he brought certain facts before the House and because he made a case before this House, brought the House to the point of setting up this Committee to inquire into the facts.</P>

      <P>We want to know from Deputies of every Party, whether we are now to accept Deputy Donnelly's attitude that if a Deputy in this House puts facts before the House and makes therefrom allegations that drive this House to set up a Committee to inquire into them, the person who has taken the initiative in inquiring into the matter is going to be excluded from the body that will be set up to pursue the inquiry.  There is no other interpretation that can be put on Deputy Donnelly's remark just now, the attitude of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party at the Selection Committee last night, or the vote that they may give if they decline to refer this report back to the Selection Committee, and, referring it back, do not give their representatives on that Committee different instructions.  The House, by referring the report back, will do two things: (1) it will stick to the precedents already established in the Committee of Selection, and (2) it will establish this precedent, that when this House sets up a Committee to inquire into any matter that it believes should be inquired into because of the public interest, that the person who is responsible for drawing the attention of this House to such a public matter will not, by reason of the fact that he took the initiative in warning the House, be excluded from the Committee set up to inquire.  If there is one person in this House who can be of use on this Committee, it is Deputy McGilligan, and to keep him off the Committee is to do what I have said, and to endeavour to make the work of the inquiry harder for those who may have to go on the Committee.</P>

      <P>I confess that I have not very much knowledge of the working of this type of Committee. I can only gather from the <Col N="1167" /> general experience that I have had with regard to the setting up of tribunals the principles that ought to be applied by Deputies in considering the question that we are now discussing. It does seem to me an extraordinary attitude for the Opposition to take up: that it is unreasonable for Deputies here to oppose putting on this particular Committee Deputy McGilligan.  I say that because the very resolution which was on the Order Paper states that the Committee is to be set up to investigate allegations made by Deputy McGilligan.  I may be approaching this from a wrong. point of view, but it seems to me an amazing thing that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy should, with such vehemence, urge that the man who has appeared in this House in the rôle of accuser, and who, from what I have heard of his statements in the House, has prejudged the issues, should allow his name to be nominated on this Committee. That seems to me a most amazing thing.  I find it difficult to understand why Deputies who, I presume, are setting up this Committee in theory for the purpose of having an impartial inquiry to judge whether the allegations made by Deputy McGilligan are correctly founded or not should ask that that Committee should contain the member of the House who has been responsible for making the allegations which induced the Minister to invite the House to set up an inquiry to investigate the charges. That seems to be an extraordinary attitude, and it is very difficult to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that this particular tribunal is to approach its task in a judicial manner: that it will inquire into these allegations in a judicial way.  It passes me to understand how any Deputy who has made himself responsible for drawing inferences from certain facts which, he says, he has already in his possession, should consider himself fitted to occupy a position of an impartial judge at an inquiry such as this.  That is one reason why I certainly cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition.  Another reason which has been adverted to in <Col N="1168" /> the cross-fire and exchanges that took place here is an equally cogent one. Deputy Mulcahy attempted to suggest that what happened here was that Deputy McGilligan brought certain facts before the House and, more or less, invited the House to set up this Committee to inquire into them.  I do not think that is exactly what happened at all.  What happened I stated a moment ago.  That Deputy McGilligan made certain definite charges.  In any case, the terms of the resolution set down that there are certain definite charges made by him, and this Committee is being set up to approach this matter in an impartial way, to get all the facts and to see if those allegations are justifiable or not.  It seems fairly clear as was suggested in the cross-fire and exchanges that have taken place here that he must be a witness there.  I cannot very well understand why he should not be anxious to be a witness. It is very difficult to understand how he can be both judge and witness as well.  I cannot understand why he himself should not insist on his Party allowing him to elect to appear there to substantiate the charges which, according to this resolution, he has made and which are about to be investigated.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the members opposite to drop the Party considerations which seem to weigh with them in this matter and to approach this question in the way that any responsible body would approach the question of setting up a committee to inquire into serious charges.  They should not put themselves in the absurd position of insisting that one of the judges is to be the man who, according to my reading of what he has said, has certainly to a great extent prejudged the very issues which he is asked to try.  For these reasons, I suggest to the Party opposite that they ought to reconsider the attitude which they are adopting towards this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

The Minister, according to his own statement, amended that motion at the behest of certain persons, certain interested parties.  That is point No. 1. The next is that the Minister selected the terms of reference, but he objected to including in the terms of reference the very thing that the Attorney-General has referred to&mdash;the charges made by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>I know.  The Minister put his resolution to the House and the House accepted it.  That, I take it, will put the point made by the Attorney-General in order.  The House, having passed a resolution which was objected to, sent it forward to the Selection Committee, and the report of the Selection Committee has, I understand, already been given.  I would remind Deputies that this is a Selection Committee and not a Nomination Committee. A Selection Committee is set up on the basis that it is composed of members from each Party in the House. It has to do certain things.  That Committee, as I say, is composed of representatives of the different Parties, and its work is done on the basis that the views of the different political Parties get expression there.  This is the first time in the history of the House that the nominations of the Selection Committee have been made by a majority. Is that statement questioned?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> One is called the Joint Committee on Private Bills.  That is not a Selection Committee.  Is that point clear to the Deputy?  Let me repeat again, that this is the first occasion on which a Committee has been selected by a majority by the Selection Committee. If that point is accepted, then we can get on.  It is not fair to the public that there should be a lot of pettifogging cloudiness in connection with a matter that is up here for discussion.  Let me again emphasise that the Selection Committee of this House has never before appointed a Committee by a majority.  It has always been unanimous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So that this is a precedent. There are a couple of other points mentioned in connection with this matter which are of interest.  The Attorney-General says that Deputy McGilligan is the accuser and, as such, has prejudged the issue.  The Attorney-General has had experience in connection with prosecutions and, if I may say so, occupies a position even above that of prosecutor.  He has to take judicial cognisance of the elements of a prosecution.  He knows what the position of a prosecutor is in court. The prosecutor gets the case and, if he is satisfied with it, it goes before the court.  But there are other cases in which he says: &ldquo;I enter a <i>nolle prosequi.</i>&rdquo;  He is prosecutor and judge at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>He judges the case and says that he is withdrawing the prosecution.  Is not that so?  <i>(Interruption).</i> We can deal with this matter without any heat, without any excitement or without any hysteria or irrelevance.  We are informed that a man cannot prosecute and be a judge. The Attorney-General is both prosecutor and judge.  He is prosecutor when he places the case before the court and he is judge when he says: &ldquo;I am entering a <i>nolle prosequi</i> in this case.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be far-fetched but it is information for some of the people over there.  What is the next point?  That Deputy McGilligan is a witness.  The Attorney-General, above all the members of that Party, knows the facts to which a witness can be called upon to testify.  Has there been any statement made here by Deputy McGilligan which would qualify him for the office of witness before that Committee?  Was he a witness to the lease?  Was he a witness to any of the transactions which took place?  The Attorney-General would, I think, admit that, from all we have heard, there is nothing which would qualify Deputy McGilligan to be a witness.  That is my opinion and I am not a lawyer. Therefore, the witness point goes.  The objection stood upon two legs, neither of them very strong.  One of them was that Deputy McGilligan was the prosecutor; the other was that he was a witness.</P>

      <P>The selection takes place by people who prepared the terms of reference, or by their colleagues.  What transpires from the selection?  There were two Ministers mentioned, if my recollection is correct, in connection with this case, and the Parliamentary Secretary to one of them is to be one of the judges.  That is the third impartiality. We have got to realise that if people speak of impartiality it is not secured by putting a cloak on it, or by labelling it impartiality.  We want to see impartiality actually in practice.  It is well-known from what transpired here that Deputy McGilligan is not a witness.  If there is objection to his being on the Committee, for the express purpose of finding out some of the things the Committee was to investigate, that is all right, But, as was stated, the Committee is not set up to investigate the charges he made, and that he read out.  On these grounds, number one, Deputy McGilligan was not present when the Selection Committee was setting up this Committee.  Number two, the nominees of this Party have not been accepted.  A precedent has been established now for the first time, and it is a precedent which distinguishes this whole proceeding from beginning to end.  This is obviously a case in which there ought to have been agreement, as regards the terms of reference and the Committee.  No attempt at all has been made at that, except to correct the haste of the Minister.</P>

If we accepted that principle of impartiality and if we had taken the same line as the Deputies on the opposite benches who have entered objections, we could have entered objections to certain names.  It was not done.  Why? Because this is a matter of great public interest and great public importance, and it has been treated in a manner which reflects badly on the Committee of Selection, and on those who advised them to act as they have acted in this case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down has been pleading for consideration of this case in a judicial and impartial manner, yet, he took the opportunity in his speech to endeavour to prejudice, in advance, the opinion which the public might form on the report of the Committee, by referring to the fact that the name of the Minister for Finance had been mentioned in the course of discussion on the whole matter.  I think I showed to your satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of the House, that this matter was first raised most improperly by Deputy McGilligan on the debate on the Finance Bill, and that he made several inaccurate statements, by saying that the matter arose on the State Lands Act, for which I am the Minister responsible.  In fact it arose on the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931, for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing in the terms of reference of this Committee for which I, as Minister, am peculiarly, individually, or particularly, involved.  The only purpose that <Col N="1176" /> Deputy Cosgrave could have had in taking objection on that ground, to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will be a member of the Committee, was to endeavour to prejudice in advance the opinion which the public might form on the report of the Committee.  I have had no discussion about the case, good, bad or indifferent, with my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn, and I do not intend to have, so long as the Committee is sitting and so long as its report remains a matter of discussion.</P>

The terms of reference are that a Committee has been appointed to report to the Dáil on allegations made by Deputy McGilligan, and I am pointing out that it would not be proper that a member of the Committee should be the person who, according to the terms of reference, has made allegations; allegations not merely to things which relate to particular individuals whose names have been mentioned, but also relate&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, but I am going to point out that one allegation was that the action of the Minister in making such demise was improper.  It has been stated that the terms are not wide enough and do not cover certain charges made by the Deputy.  On that charge, they do cover everything said in this House by Deputy McGilligan. However, in relation to the things which Deputy McGilligan has said, if he appears before the Committee, he will come in some one or other capacity.  Many of us believe that he will appear before that Committee as the accused person. Others think he is going there as a witness.  The Party opposite thinks that he is the accuser in the case.  In whatever capacity he goes before the Committee, I submit that it is improper that he should go there as a member, both as the accused and as his own judge.  If he is a member of the Committee he cannot be a witness before it to prove allegations which some of his friends pretend to believe have substance. He cannot be there as accuser and as judge.  That is what the Party opposite wants to make him.  The one thing which they do not want to have him appear at the Committee is as a witness, because, quite evidently his connection with other parties to these proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by Deputy Dillon that precedents are to be established.  But when a precedent has been established&mdash;and I am not suggesting that there has been any well-established precedent in this matter&mdash;it is capable of abuse, when it is abused it becomes a new precedent which it is desirable should be overthrown.  What was the new precedent which it was sought to establish in regard to this matter?  I think it will be admitted that it has been the universal practice, when there is going to be a judicial or an impartial investigation of any sort, that a person who is either the accuser or the accused should not also be the judge. I do not mind what light Deputy McGilligan stands in this matter.  He <Col N="1178" /> should not appear on the Committee as a member of the investigating body. His function, if he has any function at all before the Committee, is either to give proof of the charges he made or to go there to rebut the charge which will be made against him.  He cannot go there in a dual capacity.  If, in putting forward our nominee for this Committee, we had the temerity, the hardihood or the audacity to nominate the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would not public opinion be shocked?  Would not public opinion be shocked and appalled if we took such a cynical course?  What is proposed by the Opposition?  They propose to set up on that Committee the other party to these proceedings. Do they think they are going to get away with that?  Do they not think that public opinion is going to see through it?</P>

      <P>I am only dealing now, Sir, with the reason why the Opposition want to deal with this question in that way.  Perhaps the other reason is that they want to make certain that there might be some other person on the Committee who would not subscribe to its report and they wish to put Deputy McGilligan on to ensure this because he could not damnify himself by subscribing to it. What other grounds could there be for the Opposition to seek to put Deputy McGilligan on this Committee? Is it that they are inadequately represented on the Committee already?  It cannot be that, because they have the former Attorney-General on the Committee; they have the ex-Minister <Col N="1179" /> for Justice on the Committee; they have the ex-Minister for Defence on the Committee; and they have the ex-Minister for External Affairs on the Committee, and they have Deputy Coburn on the Committee. Is it suggested that any of these men are not capable of carrying out these investigations?  Are we to understand that a trained investigator like Deputy Costello is incompetent to conduct an enquiry of this sort unless he has Deputy McGilligan sitting beside him?  I suggest that Deputy Costello does know a great deal about this case and about the proposed investigation into this whole case.  Deputy Costello was sitting beside Deputy McGilligan when Deputy McGilligan was making these allegations, and I formed the impression that Deputy Costello was perfectly familiar with the whole of this case.  I got the impression that there was not anything that Deputy McGilligan could tell Deputy Costello that the later did not know already.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy says that the Committee must not be held up in its work for lack of information or lack of knowledge as to where to look for the facts.  Is not Deputy McGilligan still a member of the Party opposite?  He is not ostracised? They are not boycotting him, are they? Is there any fact in the possession of Deputy McGilligan that he is afraid to give to Deputy Costello or Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney or any of the other members of the Committee who sat with him in the same Cabinet?  Is there any person that Deputy McGilligan wishes to bring forward as a witness in this matter about whom he cannot inform his colleagues?  Is there any fact that Deputy McGilligan should conceal from the members of the Committee&mdash;his own colleagues&mdash; merely because he himself is not a member of the Committee?  The Deputy is in intimate touch with his own colleagues, and surely there is no fact that he would wish to conceal from those of them who happen to be members of this Committee? Who is going to be absent from the Committee who could be helpful to the Committee?  Deputy Mulcahy said that the reason why it was sought to keep Deputy McGilligan off the Committee was because Deputy McGilligan knew of certain facts that would be helpful to the Committee.  If there be any truth in that allegation, let Deputy McGilligan appear before the Committee and prove who is cognisant of these alleged facts and let him satisfy the Committee that he is cognisant of the existence of these facts, and that the statements he made are true, because that is the whole question.  The whole question involved in this matter is whether the statements made by Deputy McGilligan are true or false and whether they were justifiable under the law.  Let Deputy McGilligan submit to the examination of the members of the Committee some evidence that will, at any rate, convince them that there was some foundation for the allegations he made and some substance in the charges he made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy McGilligan is to be a <Col N="1181" /> member of that Committee, however, does not everybody know that the one thing that cannot be done is to cross-examine him&mdash;the man who has been the prime mover in the whole thing&mdash; about these allegations?  Perhaps that is the reason why the Opposition, for the first time, want to run a coach-and-six through all the rules of procedure in order to make a Deputy a member of the very Committee before which the same Deputy should prove to its members the truth of the allegations he made in this House.  Of course, the Deputy says that he did not make any allegations, but at any rate, the purpose of the Committee is to inquire into his insinuations or into the impressions which the Deputy wished the public to form as a result of his statement.</P>

If this Committee were going to examine the facts in a spirit of impartiality and in a spirit of judicial inquiry, I agree that it would be grotesque to put Deputy McGilligan on such a Committee, and I hold that it would be equally grotesque to put the Minister for Industry and Commerce on it.  As things have developed, however, I would be perfectly satisfied to see both Deputy McGilligan and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that Committee, because it is not going to be an impartial Committee. It was the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself who decided what would be the spirit of that Committee.  The Minister decided that the question to be decided was going to be a Party issue and that he was going to treat it as a Party issue and as nothing else.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also decided that he was going to frame the terms of reference in a way that this Party here strenuously objects to.  The fact of the matter is that this Committee is going to perform only one function: and that is to collect and present a body of evidence.  The chances of an unanimous report, in view of what has occurred in the meantime, are absolutely nil.</P>

If the Committee had a genuinely judicial character, it would be otherwise; but, as it is, I see no reason why the Minister and Deputy McGilligan should not be members of the Committee.  Consequently, I see no reason why the Opposition should not be given its right, by the precedents of this House, to nominate its own members on such a Committee.  I suggest that it is for the Opposition, and not for the Government, to judge whether it is proper to make a particular nomination or not.</P>

      <P>I have always regarded the Fianna Fáil Party as very cunning politicians and I certainly have no reason to change my mind to-day.  We have the whole machinery of Government and the whole machinery of the majority Party in this House devoted to trying to make an issue an artificial issue which, in fact, is not the issue. We have them one by one standing up in this debate to argue whether in fact it is desirable or undesirable to have Deputy McGilligan a member of a particular Committee.  The issue that is to be decided by the House to-day is a far graver issue and a far more serious issue than whether an individual, or any particular group of individuals, should sit on any committee. It really is whether, in fact, the normal system of Party Parliamentary <Col N="1183" /> control is to be trampled under foot and whether the ordinary courtesies and the ordinary decencies that exist between political opponents and opposition Parties in a country's Parliament are to survive or not.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance tells us that Deputy McGilligan was not allowed on that Committee because public opinion would be shocked.  In all honesty, must it not be admitted that if we were likely to do anything that would shock public opinion, the last hands that would be stretched out to save us would be Fianna Fáil hands, and even of the Fianna Fáil hands, that the last of all would come from the Government Front Bench? That is not the honest reason why Deputy McGilligan is objected to.  We have the Attorney-General, a trained lawyer &mdash; trained in Parliamentary quibbling, I regret to say&mdash;getting up to finesse about judge and witness and prosecutor, with the cloak of impartiality around him, but his particular line was much too glib to deceive anybody by the cloak he wore.  The Attorney-General understands better than I do what constitutes a witness and what is admissible as evidence. The Attorney-General knows very well that the particular type of evidence which Deputy McGilligan tabled here was documentary; that his whole case was based on a document; that that document is available for this Committee of Inquiry, with or without Deputy McGilligan; and that beyond that particular document, there was no statement made by Deputy McGilligan that could be regarded, even remotely, as evidence.</P>

    <P>Let us here, and let the public outside, consider how the Parliamentary majority is to be used.  The precedents established here lay it down that the only Committee of the Dáil that is in existence normally which is to inquire into the work of public Departments will of necessity always have a majority drawn from the Opposition and a Chairman drawn from the Opposition Party.  The only Parliamentary Committee normally in existence whose function it is to inquire into the work of Government Departments was established under a clean régime, and the safeguard of the public was that the majority of that Committee and the Chairman of that Committee would be drawn from the political minority of this House.  We are here faced with the situation that certain documentary evidence has been produced in this House, and if that evidence is substantiated and the obvious deductions from that evidence proved to be correct, the House is called on to inquire closely and intensely into a Government Department, in order either to prove or to disprove the existence of what amounts to as grave and as big a scandal as ever was heard of in the history of this State.  How do we depart, in the first place, from all normal, clean precedent?  We, first of all, use our majority in this House so <Col N="1185" /> that anything will be inquired into rather than the statements made here, and we will not inquire into that Department, in spite of the fact that we had the cheap, bombastic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Step No. 2 is to secure that the majority of the Committee to inquire into the charges will be again constituted by and from the majority Party, and step No. 3 is that the man most calculated, in the opinion of this Party, to bring all that is behind the scenes to light is precluded from serving on that Committee by a vote again of the majority. Heretofore, as I said, ordinary Parliamentary decency laid it down that when there was an inquiry into a Government Department, irrespective of the magnitude of the Government majority, the majority of the members of the Committee and the Chairman of the Committee would be drawn from the political Opposition.  That was the greatest safeguard the public had and democracy in this country had.</P>

What safeguard would the people have if the Party constituting the Government were the Party that would control the Committee of Inquiry?

We heard a lot of loose talk from lawyers and others opposite with regard to the <Col N="1186" /> same body being judge and jury and prosecutor and, incidentally, in the dock.  How best can you achieve that than by securing that the majority Party which constitute the Government will be the Party to inquire into the Government when suggestions of maladministration are made? You can unquestionably pack the Committee, as you are doing, by virtue of your majority.  You can unquestionably get your packed and nominated Committee to enquire into your own deeds, by virtue of your majority.  But I would urge you that if there is anything in the Minister's offer, which has not so far been carried out or honoured, and if you faced up to your obligations and your responsibilities as members of the Government, as guardians of clean precedents in the past, and as the people responsible for establishing precedents for the future, even at this stage you would give back the right that always existed here&mdash; the right of the political Opposition to put forward their own nominees on Parliamentary Committees.  If by virtue of your majority, by virtue of your strength here in this House, you secure that a Committee nominated by yourselves will enquire into your own deeds, the harm you are doing is not going to begin and end with the vote to-day.

      <P>On Tuesday evening last, the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced a resolution into this House&mdash;which was carried&mdash; that a Committee of Inquiry be set up to enquire into certain allegations which had been made by Deputy McGilligan as against the Minister himself.  By virtue of that decision in the House the Selection Committee was called together last evening to select that Committee of Inquiry.  We met, and, according to Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon, we trespassed on the right of the Opposition; we proceeded to nominate the people who should represent them on the Committee of <Col N="1187" /> Inquiry.  That certainly is not so. We met in Committee Room 91, and the Opposition submitted four names. Three were accepted, unanimously, I think, and the representatives of the Government Party&mdash;I as one of them &mdash;did object to the name of Deputy McGilligan.  On the motion of Deputy Smith&mdash;seconded, I think, by Deputy Kelly&mdash;the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, was put on the Committee of Inquiry instead of Deputy McGilligan.  We have in no way interfered with the rights of the Opposition in sending their proper number of Deputies to act on this Committee of Inquiry.  I want to give my particular reason for voting against the selection of Deputy McGilligan as a member of this Committee. I looked at the terms of reference by which this Committee of Inquiry will be bound, and they are such as, in my opinion, to make it a practical impossibility for Deputy McGilligan to act on that Committee. The Committee was to be set up to investigate certain allegations made by Deputy McGilligan, as against the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave tried to make a point here this afternoon.  I always have great respect for any point made by the leader of the Opposition, and I certainly agree, too, with Deputy O'Higgins as regards the gravity of the circumstances which surround this inquiry.  Deputy Cosgrave said this is the first time that a Committee of Inquiry was set up by the majority vote of the Selection Committee.  That may be, but it is also the first time that a Deputy of this Assembly accused a responsible Minister of State of corruption, because that is what it amounts to.  Does Deputy Costello, for instance, suggest for one moment, or does any responsible Deputy on the opposite benches suggest for one moment that the man who made that charge against the Minister for Industry and Commerce should act as one of the Committee of Inquiry?  Is it not obviously a case where he should act as a witness? The terms of reference give that Committee <Col N="1188" /> power, as all the Deputies have admitted, to bring before it all the necessary persons and documents.  I certainly agree with Deputy O'Higgins that there is a certain amount of gravity attached to this case, but that is all the more reason why Deputy McGilligan should appear as a witness instead of being there as one of the members trying the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to our packed majority on the Committee of Selection.  Deputy O'Higgins, I think, said the same, and, of course, Deputy Dillon said, &ldquo;by virtue of your packed majority.&rdquo;  When the Committees of this House were being selected every Party in this House got its proper quota in every Committee.  There is not a packed majority.  We have not one Deputy on the Selection Committee more or less than we are entitled to, and neither has the Opposition.  I think there is not one Deputy in this House who will not admit that that is so.  We have been accused of treating the Opposition unjustly.  We put on the ex-Minister for Defence, Deputy Fitzgerald; we put on the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney; we put on the ex-Attorney-General, Deputy Costello.  Surely to goodness that is a good enough representation for the Opposition, not to mention Deputy Coburn, and if there is anybody in this House who thinks for one moment that Deputy Coburn cannot keep his end up at a committee meeting, or at any other kind of meeting, I would tell that Deputy that he is living in a kind of fool's paradise.  My reason, as one member of the Selection Committee, for voting against Deputy McGilligan as a member of the Committee of Inquiry is because he is the gentleman who made the allegations in this House, and the onus of proving whether they are true or untrue rests on the shoulders of Deputy McGilligan and on nobody else.  He will have his friends there as members of this Committee of Inquiry.  Surely his interests will be properly guarded.  Surely there is not such difference between Deputy McGilligan's status in the Opposition, and the status of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who was once Minister for <Col N="1189" /> Justice, that all this hub-bub should be made?  If we were to allow it to go out from this House that a Deputy of this House could make, against a Minister of State, charges sufficiently grave to warrant the setting up of an Inquiry, and that one of the members of that Court of Inquiry was the man who made the charges, in my opinion we would figure as a laughing stock before the public.  For that reason, I certainly did vote against the selection of Deputy McGilligan as a member of the Committee.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer.  Deputy Cosgrave adverted here to the presence of Deputy Briscoe at the meeting of the Selection Committee.  Deputy McGilligan is also a member of the Selection Committee.  He was not there; that is quite true.  Deputy Briscoe was there; that is also quite true.  Deputy Briscoe said that he would leave the meeting on account of being one of the principals in this case.  &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Deputy Dillon&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy can support me in this&mdash;&ldquo;we have not the slightest objection to your presence.&rdquo; Notwithstanding that, Deputy Cosgrave comes along here this evening and attempts to make a point out of that, whether or not it is in support of the packed majority argument, I do not know, but, certainly, I do not think that the presence of Deputy Briscoe at that meeting should be made a point of, more particularly in view of what Deputy Briscoe did last evening at the meeting of the Selection Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I have got to say in connection with this matter.  Speaking for my colleagues as well as for myself, I may say we went in there to select the best Committee we could select.  We had our own nominees there and we put them forward.  We objected to Deputy McGilligan for the reasons we have given, and we substituted for him on the Committee the ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  We did not take one person away from that Committee to which the Opposition would be entitled from the point of view of numbers.  Notwithstanding that, we have been accused by one <Col N="1190" /> speaker after another on the Opposition Benches of trying to load the dice, trying to take our majority from the House to the Selection Committee, and then to the Committee of Inquiry. Surely the Opposition do not put it up here as a reasonable argument that the Government which runs the country and which is in a majority here should not, in ordinary fair play, have that majority reflected in the sub-committees set up by the House?  Was it not the same in the days of our predecessors, and will it not be always the same in Parliamentary life?  Why make such bones about this majority of ours?</P>
    <P>I say advisedly that in order that this matter may be fully and freely investigated, in order that the last ounce may be got out of every witness, in order that we may have every document, in order that the case may be brought out fully in public, in order that everybody connected with it may be fully examined and in the very interests of Deputy McGilligan himself, it would be much better to have him as a witness rather than to have him sitting on the Committee as one of the judges.  That is my main reason for voting against him&mdash;I have no other.  It was with the sole object of getting the very best out of this Committee that I voted against his being made a member.  I sincerely hope when the Committee has concluded its labours that we will be further on both as regards procedure and as regards other matters to which I will not advert at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do think the arguments put forward by members of the Opposition are very unworthy, particularly in relation to a case of this kind, which is unprecedented, when a responsible Minister has been deliberately charged by a member of the Opposition with corruption. I consider it very bad tactics, very ill-advised, that they should, under cover of other arguments, try to make a farce out of a Committee that it is intended should probe this thing to the uttermost.</P>

      <P>Committee Room 91 will become as famous as Committee Room <Col N="1191" /> 15 in the British House of Commons, judging by the tremendous upheaval our objection to the procedure that took place there yesterday afternoon has caused in the Fianna Fáil Party. If the suggestion of the Chairman of that Committee had been carried out, namely, to give to the House the statement that they could achieve no agreement, it would be something for the House to discuss in decency and fairness. The Chairman of the Committee distinctly stated at the outset&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling.  As a member of the Selection Committee on the Fine Gael side, let me say that we decided to propose, nominate, or elect, I do not know which is the right word, four names, and we put these four names forward as of right, and that right was denied us.  That is the main subject of the debate here to-day &mdash;the denial of that right.  No matter on what side of the House one may stand, it must be apparent that the main issue is that a majority denied a minority its right on that Committee. As a member of that Committee, in all fairness, I could not but oppose the Committee of Inquiry submitted by the Government representatives, introduced by Deputy Little.</P>

      <P>That is not the point. It was all our four or none.  We were denied the right to put our four names forward.  Is that fair?  I contend it is not.  It is no use getting into a circle over accused or accusers, prosecutors or witnesses or judges.  The main issue is that we were denied our right as members of the Selection Committee. We were not allowed to put forward the four names we wanted to <Col N="1192" /> put forward.  I will not enter into this debate further than that.  I leave it to the House to decide was it or was it not fair play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One day last week when a motion was before this House for the appointment of a Select Committee, I drew the attention of the House and the Minister to the fact that the Minister and the Government had completely misconceived the issue before them on that occasion.  It is quite apparent from each and every one of the speeches that have come from the Government Benches that they have again completely misconceived the issue that is before the House on this motion and the motion to refer back the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Deputy O'Higgins has, in my view, put the real issue that is raised by the present motion.  Deputy Donnelly completely showed his hand and showed the conceptions of the Government in this respect.  Apparently, he was quite unable to appreciate the issue before the House, because he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Have not the Opposition good enough representation on this Committee of Inquiry?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Donnelly asks, showing that he conceives this Committee to be a Committee on which the Government will have a majority which will decide in favour of the Government's point of view.  He says that as the Government have a majority in this House, why should not the subCommittees of the House be reflected by way of numbers; in other words, why should not the Government have a majority on every sub-Committee of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>He again puts the case, not meaning to put it, that every sub-Committee should be in a position to decide in favour of the Government.  But even that is not the real issue that is before the House. The question of the numbers that the Opposition are entitled to on every Committee is not the real point at <Col N="1193" /> issue.  We have never made any complaint that we have not got our fair representation on the Committee of Selection, that we have not got on the Committee of Selection the number of people we are entitled to have in accordance with the rules and traditions of the House.  We have not made that complaint, but we have made complaint and we do complain in connection with this motion in relation to the precedent that has been established over the last 13 years, that the nominees of the Opposition on the Committee of Selection have the right to say who their people will be on any committee selected by that Committee of Selection.  That is what we complain of&mdash;not that we have not got four or five members on the Committee of Selection.  We have our proper numbers there, but for the first time, as the leader of the Opposition has stated in this House, and he has stated it without contradiction&mdash;for the first time in the history of Parliamentary institutions in this country, the Opposition has been denied the right which was established by tradition and precedent to nominate the persons whom they wanted to represent them in the Committee of Selection set up by order of this House.  This is the first time that that right has been denied the Opposition. The right was granted to the Opposition by Deputy Cosgrave when he was President of the Executive Council of this Parliament.  He could, if he liked, have established the principle which Deputy Donnelly appeared to think is the proper principle&mdash;the principle of majority rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave started the practice that the Opposition had the right, without reference to the wishes of the majority either of this House or of the majority of the Committee, to nominate the Deputies whom they wish to represent them on that Committee.  That procedure started by the late Government was fostered and maintained through the whole period during which they were <Col N="1194" /> the Government of this country and that practice was handed over by them to the present Government.  The question before the House now is not whether Deputy McGilligan is the accuser or the accused.  The question rather is whether the decencies of parliamentary life and the decencies of parliamentary institutions which have grown up in this State during the last 13 years are to be set aside, because, as will be obvious, the present Government want a majority who will decide in their favour in advance and prejudge the issue.  We are not pleading to have Deputy McGilligan put on the Committee to be set up.  We are not pleading for that, but we do claim the right&mdash;which has been established for the past 13 years by practice and precedents&mdash;to nominate who is to represent us on this Committee.  I could give any number of reasons showing that Deputy McGilligan is the proper person to be put on that Committee to represent us, and I could give these reasons from the discussions that have centred around the facts in this House. But I do not intend to do so.  Even the Government themselves do not know whether Deputy McGilligan is the accuser or the accused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very opening of this debate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs got up and said he objected to Deputy McGilligan being put on this Committee because he was the person who was the accuser.  He was followed by the Attorney-General who objected to Deputy McGilligan being put upon this Committee because he is in the rôle of accuser.  The Attorney-General thinks Deputy McGilligan is the accuser and so does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. But the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no doubt about the matter.  According to him, Deputy McGilligan is the accused and he is going to make him the accused.  Deputy Cleary interjected that he is the accused.  So you have the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Cleary deciding that he is the accused <Col N="1195" /> and the Attorney-General and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs quite satisfied that he is the accuser. They do not know themselves what he is.  One thing the Minister for Industry and Commerce is determined to achieve and that is that he is going, by the majority of his own nominees, to make Deputy McGilligan the accused and put him into that position irrespective of whatever anybody else thinks.  He tells us that the fact that Deputy McGilligan was put on this Committee would shock the public conscience.  The public conscience has been sufficiently shocked already and it will be more than shocked now by the precedent proposed in the course of this debate to be set up.  The question is as to whether the public interest has been preserved or maintained or whether it has been prejudicially affected by the transactions that have gone on in connection with this matter. I pointed out on the last day that it was a matter of the public interest and not the reputation of whoever happens to be at the moment Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That is a fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the back benchers on the Government side do not appreciate. They do not appreciate the vital issue here.  That vital issue is whether or not the decencies of parliamentary institutions are to be maintained.  The Minister for Finance went as near as he could to saying that I ought to be put off the Committee as well as Deputy McGilligan.  He gave out his mind on the subject; he said he objected to Deputy McGilligan going on this Committee &ldquo;because he is the man against whom the investigations of the Committee will be directed.&rdquo;  I took a note of his words.  That is what the Government Party want to do. They want to direct their investigations against Deputy McGilligan.  I know as much about this transaction as Deputy McGilligan knows.  I ought to be put off this Committee just as well as Deputy McGilligan is being put off it, but I make a present of that point to the Minister for Finance.  He can put me off with the greatest possible pleasure and they have as much <Col N="1196" /> justice on their side for putting me off as for putting Deputy McGilligan off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say to Deputy Cleary, and I was about to say it in anticipation of the remark he made that I would approach the consideration of this matter with an open and impartial mind; I refrain from putting any adjective in front of the remark that has fallen from the Deputy.  Deputy McGilligan exercised his right and discharged the duty he was bound to discharge as a public representative in this House.  That was the duty I would have to discharge if Deputy McGilligan had not done it.  That was the duty of bringing before this House certain facts which raise a <i>prima facie</i> case of a public scandal.  According to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy McGilligan is in the rôle of accuser; according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and Deputy Cleary he is in the rôle of the accused.  The real thing is that Deputy McGilligan is in the rôle of a man who does what he conceives to be his duty by his constituents and by his country as a public representative.  The Government have made up their minds that they are going to make this a Party issue.  That has been stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We have no desire to ruin anybody or to throw aspersions on the public or private activities of any Deputy or Minister in this House.  But we do think that certain facts brought to light in this House require investigation. <Col N="1197" /> They do not require to be cloaked over and whitewashed in the way the Government are trying to cloak them over and whitewash them. The members of this Party have a free right to put whom they will on this Committee.  It was perfectly ridiculous for the Attorney General to argue otherwise; he was the only member on the Government side who struck me during the debate as having any sincerity in the matter, but it was ridiculous for him to have deluded himself into the belief that this was going to be an impartial investigation. The whole atmosphere from the Government point of view, surrounding this Committee at the present time, is an atmosphere of Party, and there is about as much chance of getting an impartial consideration of the facts and circumstances from that Committee as there would be from the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself if he were the sole judge.  The public conscience will be shocked by the action of the Government in connection with this matter.  What hope have the public of getting the facts from the sort of Committee they are seeking to set up?</P>
      <P>What confidence will the public have in any report that this Committee will bring in?  What is the use of pretending that this is going to have even the shadow of a pretence of being an impartial judicial inquiry?  If the Government have nothing to fear from the facts brought forth by Deputy McGilligan, if they are not afraid of a full public investigation, why not put Deputy McGilligan in the place where he can best find out these facts?</P>

      <P>I would be very loath to make any such suggestion.  In case you, Sir, think I was making any such suggestion, I will pass from it.  It is perfectly apparent, I submit, that this Committee is being set up as a Party Committee, and that Deputy McGilligan has been put off this Committee for the purpose mentioned by the Minister for Finance, that he is the man against whom the investigation of the Committee will be directed. That is what they want to do.  They want to do what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said on the last occasion&mdash;they want to hang something around his neck.  That is why they do not want to have the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, who knows this Department, who knows every intricacy of the Department better than anyone in this House, including the present Minister, in the place where he can find out the facts of this case.  That is why they do not want to have him in a position to cross-examine the <Col N="1199" /> various people who will be brought forward.  I put it to this House, therefore, that the action of the Government in refusing to allow Deputy McGilligan to be a member of this Committee is one which will reflect and bring discredit upon themselves&mdash; that would not matter very much&mdash;but it will bring discredit on this House and the Parliamentary institutions set up in this country and the traditions of Parliamentary government established in the last 13 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress on this section last night, I was making the point, in reply to Deputy McGilligan, that there has been a considerable and extensive invasion of occupations formerly filled by men now filled by women, with the result that male employees are finding it increasingly difficult not merely to obtain their old and former occupations but to secure entry into the new occupations made available by the development of new industries.  Deputy McGilligan last night, in opposition to this section, made a rather halfhearted attempt to defend the present sex equality from the point of view of industrial work.  His defence seemed to me to be based on the supposition that there was no reason to fear, granted equality in the matter of employment as between men and women, that there would not be a further contraction of industrial employment for men and a further tendency to lower the rates of wages not only for men but for women.  He seemed to ignore completely the self-evident fact that there has been a considerable invasion by women in the matter of industrial employment: that the entry of women into many industries has resulted in men being ousted from employment in which they formerly predominated.  In any choice as between men and women in the matter of employment, I think that most persons will say that we ought to retain employment for men for two reasons, apart from others: (1) that man is the natural bread winner of the family. On him devolves the responsibility, in most cases, of providing for his wife and family.  He cannot adequately discharge that responsibility, morally or legally, unless he is placed in a position to command a wage and employment. In addition to that reason, we must acknowledge that the women are employed not because they are women, not because there is any disposition on the part of the employing class to extend to them industrial equality but because they are cheap, because they can be adapted to new mechanical processes and because they are, from the employer's point of view, very docile and, from the trade union point of view, extremely difficult to organise.  It will be apparent to everybody who is in any way familiar with the trend of modern industrial development in the direction of giving preference in employment to women that that preference has been based solely on the desire to secure women because they are cheap, because there is a plentiful supply of that labour and because it is a type of easily-managed labour which has a very considerable attraction for certain types of employer. Deputy McGilligan seemed to make a case last night in some portions of his speech for equality between men and women but already, through the International Labour Office, and in a variety of other ways, there has been a recognition that women should not participate in certain kinds of occupations or in employment at certain hours.  Deputy McGilligan discloses himself as a whole-hog advocate of the complete play of economic forces.  He discloses himself, in some portions of his speech, as one who stands for absolute equality as between men and women in industrial employment.  I do not think that you can consider a claim of that kind without taking notice of the direction in which the implementation of that claim is leading <Col N="1207" /> you.  Few will challenge the assertion that, if there is unrestricted entry of women into all branches of industry, that will be accompanied by a low wage policy and by the substitution of better-paid male workers by badly-paid female workers.  Last night, Deputy McGilligan had no remedy for dealing with a situation of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true he suggested that the trade unions should deal with that kind of problem.  But that is an extremely difficult problem for the trade unions to deal with.  The man-workers is in many cases a skilled craftsman.  He has usually had a long apprenticeship to the industry in which he serves and, in most cases, he dedicates his life almost to that service.  On the other hand, women are more birds-of-passage in industry. There is not the same tradition behind their industrial activities.  There is not the same resignation to life-time service to an industry.  These factors, undoubtedly, place difficulties in the way of trade union organisation.  Even prior to the change of Government in 1922, following that, and subsequent to the change of Government in 1932, it has been necessary for the State to recognise that female employment should be termed in most cases &ldquo;sweated employment.&rdquo;  Trade boards were constituted to deal with the menace of low wages in certain kinds of industries.  These boards were established in cases where there was no effective kind of trade union organisation to protect the workers against the exploitation which existed in these industries.  If we look at the number of trade boards which have been established and at the kind of industries in which they have been established, we shall recognise that trade boards are mainly associated with those industries in which women occupy either a substantial position as workers or in which they predominate. Even during the period of Deputy McGilligan's administration, he found it necessary not merely to maintain the trade boards but, in <Col N="1208" /> some cases, to extend them in order to deal with the problem of the exploitation of wage-earners in these industries.  For some time to come, I think it will be extremely difficult to organise women industrially to the same extent as men.  The problem of organisation is still more difficult in those industries in which women predominate. Considerable success has attended the efforts of trade unions to organise workers in industries in which there is a substantial proportion of men.  It is relatively easy to organise workers in industries in which men predominate.  The experience of persons associated with the trade union movement shows, however, that many obstacles will be encountered in the organisation of workers in those industries in which women predominate.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the remedy suggested by Deputy McGilligan is by any means a perfect remedy.  Having regard to the present weaknesses of that remedy in respect of the organisation of women and having regard also to the increasing tendency to employ women, this House cannot be convinced that there is an effective remedy, even though there might be a partial remedy, in the direction suggested by Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan pleaded last night for absolute equality as between men and women in industrial matters.  I think the only countries where that equality is conceded are Russia and Mexico, but I do not think that Deputy McGilligan wants to outbid these countries in that respect.  No matter what other countries do in that respect, we have got to realise that we ourselves can only solve this problem as we know it to exist.  One of the ways in which the invasion of women into industry can be checked is through the procedure suggested in this section.  I do not think anyone desires to exclude women from industry, or from employment for which they are peculiarly fitted.  No one wants to take up the attitude that a woman is only to be employed when the last man has been employed.  This section will not be used in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> Faced as we are with a growing invasion of industry by women, and with the fact that, consequent upon that invasion, it is difficult, and in many cases impossible, for men to retain their hold on industry, it is only reasonable that the State, acting on behalf of a community, which desires to see a balanced kind of industrial employment should be armed with the powers which are given to the Minister in this section. It may be that the manner in which the powers will be welded are not completely satisfactory.  It may be that it is too much to give a Minister the very extreme powers sought in this section, but knowing the problem as we do, I do not think there is any case to be made for permitting the present invasion of industry by women to continue unchecked.  It is for that reason I think this section is, in the circumstances, one of the ways in which the problem can be met.  The section offers a partial solution in its effect when dealing with the problem of trying to retain work for men who followed industrial employment all their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the matters raised on this section seem to me to have got mixed up, I suggest to the Minister that he should tell us what he conceives to be the function of the Government in a Bill such as this.  I agree with a good deal of what Deputy Norton said, but I am surprised that he has not gone on to draw certain conclusions.  For instance, he mentioned the invasion of the clothing trade by women.  That is undoubtedly a fact.  I suggest to him that that is very largely due to the force of economic circumstances.  In order to illustrate my point, I should point out that if one goes back a couple of generations, practically all or a very large proportion of the male population wore clothes that were fitted for them, individually.  Now the great proportion of the population wear ready-made clothes.  That is partly due to the play of economic circumstances. The middle classes have not the same amount of money to spend, and they look around to see how they <Col N="1210" /> can reduce expenditure.  That has displaced the highly skilled male tailors.  The whole industry has changed.  These men have been replaced by women who can do the work just as well, with the help of a machine, as a highly skilled male tailor did it in the past.  That is one aspect of that particular trade.  I suggest to the Minister that it is certainly the duty of the Government to see that women workers are not exploited, and that wage levels are not driven below certain standards. I should like to contradict the impression that Deputy Norton gave, that the youngest member of the family can go out and take his father's job. Surely some skill is required at such work.  A boy cannot be put on a man's job.  Deputy Norton seems to think, according to this Bill, that the Government should put a man on a boy's job.  If the Government are going to undertake that task they have some job in front of them.  I suggest that the Minister might be interfering too much if he seeks to interfere with the play of economic circumstances.  It is quite possible, having driven the cost of clothing up again, by putting men on boys' jobs, that really no effect will be produced because the cost can be driven too high, and people might be forced back into making clothes at home. What I really want to urge on the Minister is, that he should state how far the Government are prepared to go in compelling employers to put males on jobs where they may not be considered necessary.  While I quite agree that the Minister should take power to prohibit females in certain industries, and working under certain industrial conditions, at the same time he should not interfere with the economic laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important subject and strikes at the whole root of the unemployment question. I think the Minister is entirely justified in asking for the powers he will get in this Section.  He should have them, not only for the general regulation of employment but in the interests of women workers themselves. <Col N="1211" /> As Deputies know the tendency of women to invade industries in other countries has resulted in some places in very violent reactions, for instance, in Germany.  These reactions have caused very grave hardship to vast numbers of women workers who were thrown out of employment as a result of the revolution.  The powers to be given to the Minister are very wide. It is a question whether they should be put into the hands of one man, because a great deal depends on the personal opinion of the Minister in power, as to what industries would be suitable for women to work at.  At the same time, presumably the Department when dealing with this Bill will use some kind of yard-stick or touch-stone, and, I presume, whenever the Minister makes an order or a regulation he will submit it to the Executive Council, after which it is liable to be revoked by the Dáil.  Even so, the main deciding factor will be the opinion of the Minister in charge.  The Minister stated that he has already power to prohibit women being employed in coal mines.  He wants to get power to prevent women being employed as stokers for boilers.  There are other industries in which women are employed which might be called border line cases.  We make bricks in County Wexford, and I understand that only male labour is employed.  I am told, however, that the bricks made in Dublin are made, largely, by female labour.</P>

      <P>I think that it is difficult to determine whether or not the Minister should use his own discretion as to whether a particular industry is suitable for female labour.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some indication as to what he has in mind with regard to this matter.  The Minister may be able to make regulations preventing women from working as coal-miners, but he cannot prevent the ladies from using coal.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken referred to the checks imposed on the Minister in regard to the <Col N="1212" /> powers given to the Minister in this section.  I should like to draw attention, first, to the very great powers which the section does propose to give to the Minister.  Roughly, a little more than half the citizenship of this country consists of women.  This section gives the Minister power to exclude women from employment in any industry which he thinks to be unsuitable for women.  I suggest that is a very great power to put in the hands of any one Minister, or of any man, in the State, no matter how impartial or humane he may be.  In criticising that power, I hope it is understood that one is criticising possible Ministers and not only the present Minister.  I think that the power that is proposed to be given here is a very important power. It is inherent in our Constitution that women should have the same freedom of action in this country as the male citizens, and that they should be free to undertake any form of activity such as the male citizens are free to undertake. If it is necessary that any checks should be put on that freedom of action, I think that the conditions under which such checks or obstacles are to be applied should receive very careful scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us yesterday that there are two sorts of cases in which this check might apply.  One case that he mentioned was that of the necessity for protecting women themselves from being induced to take employment in industries that would be quite unsuitable for female labour.  I think that we can all sympathise with that point of view, and I think that we would all agree that such occupations as coal-mining are unsuitable for women, and that it would be necessary for the State to protect women to the extent of preventing them from undertaking such occupations as coal-mining.  I understand, however, that it has been illegal for many years, in this country as well as in the neighbouring country, for women to take part in coal-mining operations.  I understand that that has been prohibited by statute and that it is not a matter of regulation by the Minister or Department concerned.  I think that the proposed restrictions on liberty contained in this section are <Col N="1213" /> so great that this whole thing should be a matter to be fixed by statute rather than by regulation by the Minister or his successors.</P>
    <P>The other case that the Minister has in mind, with regard to this section, is somewhat different.  According to what the Minister said, the section is intended to protect male workers from competition by women in the same industry.  The Leader of the Labour Party, I think, suggested that such protection is very necessary for male workers.  I confess to some difficulty in understanding how the Leader of the Labour Party and his colleagues, who, I thought, were here representing the interests of labour as a whole, had developed into being the representatives merely of one section of labour, and how they had made themselves, so to speak, sectional leaders of male labour as against female labour.  The Leader of the Labour Party, I understand, says that he does not wish to exclude females from any occupations for which they are peculiarly fitted.  Is there any possibility of their getting employment in any occupation for which they are not peculiarly fitted? That remark takes away the whole force of the argument made by the Leader of the Labour Party.  Deputy McGilligan, speaking last night, said that handiness&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;now takes the place of muscle, and that, therefore, women are more fitted for certain occupations than men.  If there are industries for which women are fitted, I suggest that these are the only industries in which this matter can arise, and that it is only in such cases that the Minister will be called upon to exercise the power proposed to be given to him under this section.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the checks that are laid down in the section&mdash;if one admits that it may be necessary to have such powers&mdash;are entirely inadequate to exercise proper control.  I believe that it will mean that the Minister, or his successors, will be subjected to constant representations from male workers in one industry or another who feel that their interests <Col N="1214" /> are hazarded by what they call the intrusion of female labour into these industries.  Very strong influences will be brought to bear on the Minister or his successors to exclude female labour.  Speaking last night, the Minister said that, before he would make such regulations as he is empowered to make under this section, he would have to consult with employers and workers interested in the particular industry concerned. A case might arise, however, of a particular industry in which, up to the moment, there had been no women employees, and it would be difficult, for the Minister, therefore, to consider the views of prospective women workers in regard to such an industry.  I do not know whether or not the Minister or his successors would hold that prospective interests of that kind would be covered by this section.  It is possible that the section is quite wide enough to cover, not alone the actual interests of persons now employed, but the prospective interests of the kind to which I have referred.  Of course, it is a fact that a regulation such as this can be revoked by the Oireachtas, but one knows that such a step has hardly any practical value and that once the regulation is made it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to persuade the Dáil to revoke the regulation and thereby pass practically a vote of censure on a Ministerial act of that sort.  As long as any Government had a majority in the House, that is practically impossible, so that the most the Dáil can do under the power given to it is to bring public criticism to bear on the regulation which has already been made and which will remain as long as the Minister is minded to keep it.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he might adopt some other method than the very simple one laid down in the section in regard to such regulations, whereby such regulations might be issued in draft in advance so that they might be subject to criticism before they become binding.  I would draw his attention to a parallel which he might take from the Trade Boards Act of 1918 in relation to the setting <Col N="1215" /> up of Trade Boards.  By that Act, the Minister is empowered to establish a Trade Board for any trade in which, in his opinion, no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of wages and so on.  Before his Order can become effective, certain conditions must be complied with and these conditions are laid down in the Schedule to the Act.  He must publish notice of his intention to make an Order; he must prepare a draft Order and make it available for those who wish to study it; he must allow an interval of 40 days to elapse during which persons interested may make objections to the Order before it becomes effective; and he must consider every objection which is not frivolous and which is submitted to him within the requisits time by interested parties.  Having considered the objections, he can amend the draft Order in the manner suggested so as to make it acceptable to the objectors.  If he refuses to withdraw or amend the draft Order, he is required, before confirming the Order, to direct an inquiry to be held in regard to the objections and the objectors can give evidence before that inquiry.  That inquiry must be held by an independent person who is not in any Government employ, and the person commissioned to hold the inquiry has very considerable powers as to the kind of Order that will finally be drafted.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that some machinery comparable to that would put a very considerable check on what may be, in the future, a very improper use of the powers which the section proposes to confer on the Minister.  I do not suggest that the exact machinery laid down in the Trade Boards Act should be followed, but I think the Minister would act wisely in considering whether he cannot provide some such check as that, or some equally effective check, to tie his successors in office as well as himself. Again, I will say that I am not suggesting that either the Minister or his successors are likely to use this power in a wanton way, but I think it is for the Dáil, which is about to make the law under which Ministers <Col N="1216" /> will act, to make sure that such checks as these are effective and that no Minister can, even if he were willing to do so, act in a wanton or irresponsible way in regard to an interest which is so great, the interest of what may be a very large body of the citizens of the country who, as far as the Constitution goes, have equal rights with other citizens of the country and whose liberties of action, liberties of contract, and liberties of work should not be, without very stringent checks, in the hands of any one Minister, however wise and responsible and humane that Minister may be.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde suggested that this amendment was being inserted in the Bill as a contribution towards the solution of the unemployment problem and that suggestion also came from some of those who spoke yesterday evening.  I stated then that I did not regard this section as having any relation to the problem of unemployment and that it was not being put forward in any sense as a means of easing unemployment.  I want to qualify, to some extent, what I said in that connection, because I have asked myself this question: would we have this section in the Bill if there were no unemployment?  And I think the answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  It is true that we might consider it desirable to have provisions of this kind for various reasons, but it is unlikely that we would have undertaken the responsibility of enacting them, and of meeting the criticism which was inevitable, unless there was a certain relation between the proposal here and the unemployment position.  The relation is this, that, in our opinion, it is a social necessity so long as unemployment exists to ensure the maximum possible employment for adult male workers.  It is much more advantageous socially to have adult male workers employed than other classes of workers, generally speaking, and, therefore, any power that is necessary in order to maintain the amount of employment available for adult male workers is a contribution to the solution of the difficulties created by the existence of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> It has been said that this legislation is anti-feminist, that there is or should be equality in regard to the sexes in the matter of industrial employment. There cannot be equality in regard to the sexes.  Whatever theoretical argument might be advanced in favour of sex equality, in practice, female labour is cheaper labour than male labour and the reason for that is obvious.  The great majority of the adult males seeking industrial work are married, and, because they are married, the standard of wages for adult males is, or necessarily must become, sufficiently high to enable the married man to maintain himself and his family.  I am not saying that the standard wage in any industry answers that description at the moment, but the tendency, obviously, will be, in relation to adult male labour, to fix a standard wage which would be sufficient for the maintenance of a married man and his family.  On the other hand, the great majority of women in industrial work are unmarried and a very big proportion of them are without dependents.  Consequently, women will be prepared to work and even to regard as a good wage for themselves, in their circumstances, a remuneration which would be utterly inadequate and would be regarded as inadequate for a married man, and, consequently, therefore, we have got to face the practical fact that at present and for a very long time to come female labour is likely to be cheaper labour than male labour.  Therefore, to create a position in which there is absolute equality between women and men in respect of industrial employment means a preference for female employment&mdash;a preference which has been exercised by employers in the past, wherever it was possible.  Wherever the nature of the work was such that women could readily perform it or wherever the invention of some mechanical device enabled women to do work which previously only men could do, employers exercised a preference for female workers because female workers were prepared to work at lower rates of wages.</P>
    <P>The next question that arises, therefore, is: Do we regard women in industry <Col N="1218" /> as undesirable?  Obviously not. Obviously, there are a large number of industries that could not be maintained at all unless on the basis of wages which are at the present time regarded as more or less satisfactory for women workers, even though they may be regarded as unsatisfactory for male workers.  The readymade clothing industry was mentioned in this debate.  The progress in the readymade clothing industry has been based entirely upon the cheapness of the product, and any development which would increase the price of the readymade suit of clothes in relation to the tailormade suit of clothes would decrease considerably the productivity of the industry; it would decrease the demand for the products, and turn the demand back to tailormade products. We would have increased employment in the tailoring trade, at the expense of a decrease of employment in the readymade clothing trade, and probably, taking the aggregate output of the two trades together, a decrease in that aggregate output.  There are other industries, all of which will readily occur to the minds of Deputies, which would not exist at all except for the fact that their products are cheap, and that people buy them because of their cheapness.  In relation to those industries it is inevitable, I think, that women will continue to be employed, and that any attempt to substitute the existing female labour in those industries by higher paid male labour would be bound to fail, because it would result in the virtual disappearance of the industries altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not contemplate the exercise of the powers conferred under this section in order to upset the existing position in any industry where women have definitely established themselves. It would not be possible to do it.  No Minister could contemplate effecting a regulation which was going to operate to put a large number of women out of employment in an industry for which trained male labour was not available. Even if trained male labour were available the change would be too drastic to contemplate.  Where, under existing practice, women are definitely established in any form of industrial work, <Col N="1219" /> I think they must be allowed to remain there, except a case can be made that a particular form of industrial work is physically unsuitable for women, in which case a regulation prohibiting their employment in that work can be made.  But the main purpose for which, I think, those powers are necessary is to check any future development towards the replacement of existing male employment in some form of industrial work by female labour. That is necessary in our circumstances, but the necessity for that would diminish with the diminution of our unemployment problem.  There are many examples of that.  I quoted, as an example to a deputation which came to me on that matter, the manufacture of upholstery for motor cars.  In other countries that is done very largely by female labour.  The firm in Cork, Messrs.  Ford, who first started the building of motor-cars in this country, decided to employ male labour at adult male rates of wages upon that class of work.  When they did that, we were more or less in a position to insist upon other firms which subsequently came into the same industry adopting the same practice.  At the present time, all that class of work is, I believe, being done by male workers, but at some particular stage one of those firms may substitute those male workers by female workers at lower rates of wages, and, consequently, get a competitive advantage over their rivals.  If that should happen, I believe in due course every firm would be forced to adopt the same methods, and we would have an industry which is at present being conducted by male workers completely transformed into a female workers' industry.</P>
    <P>I think we should have power to stop that tendency in the beginning in present circumstances, where we have a number of male workers unemployed, because I repeat that there is a greater social advantage in having an adult male worker employed than there is in having a female or juvenile worker employed.  We should like to see them all employed, if employment could be provided for them, and, therefore, <Col N="1220" /> the question of using the powers conferred by this section really only arises where there is unemployment and one is forced to make an unpleasant choice as between the various classes of workers.  I want definitely to remove any impression which might be created by statements that have been made here or by interested organisations in the Press to the effect that it is intended to use the powers under this Bill to cause the general displacement of women workers and their replacement by men.  That is not intended at all, so far as I am concerned.  The question arises there as to whether I am given power to do that under the section.  I am, nor do I know any alternative to the form of this section that will be workable if we are to have the powers which we desire to have.  I do not think it would be practicable to use, in relation to a Bill of this kind, the very cumbersome machinery that is laid down in the Trade Board Acts, and which has to be operated before a Trade Board can be established.  That machinery undoubtedly, provides at every turn for the making of objections by interested parties, for the holding of enquiries, or the publication of notices, and so forth.  The effect of having those provisions in that Act is that it is regarded as a major matter in the Department of Industry and Commerce when a decision is made to establish a new Trade Board.  All sorts of officials have to be got working on the matter&mdash;legal officials as well as the officers of the department who deal with those matters generally; notices have to be prepared and published, and it is many months after the decision is made before you can get within sight of the establishment of your Trade Board.  That fact has, I believe, resulted in Trade Boards not being established in respect of industries or occupations for which they should have been established, and which come within the definition set out in the Trade Board Acts.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I think the power which is given by this section is not anything as extensive as they appear to be.  It is easy enough to say that this section gives to the Minister for Industry and Commerce absolute power, at his own discretion, to make those orders, but so long as the Government of this State is responsible to the Dáil and through the Dáil to the people, it is quite clear that no Minister for Industry and Commerce could attempt to exercise that power in an arbitrary manner. In order to ensure, in any event, that the idea will not enter his head, it is set out here first of all that he must have, before any regulation is made, consultation with persons who are representative of both parties in the industry in respect of which the regulation is intended.  What I contemplate is, after the passage of this Act, the parties interested in the particular industries being brought into consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;not to consider the question of an order under Section 11, or an order under Section 12, or an agreement under Section 42, or anything else, but all those things together. I contemplate those representatives being brought in to draw up, in agreement, in so far as it is possible for us to get agreement, the regulations that are going to fix fair conditions of employment in those industries.  The agreements that will be made and the decisions that will be arrived at may involve a regulation under Section 11, or a regulation under Section 12, or a regulation under some other section. They may even involve the setting up of an Apprenticeship Committee under the Apprenticeship Act, but I contemplate that we would get all those things done together in so far as it was necessary to do them for each industry, taking first the industries in respect of which we think regulations are most urgently required, and then the industries which are pretty well regulated at the present time by Trade Union action.  Obviously, one of the questions that will arise at any of those conferences is: &ldquo;Is it necessary to make any regulation in respect of female employment?  Should we confine, <Col N="1222" /> not employment in the industry as a whole, but employment in some form of industrial work associated with the industry, to male workers, or should we fix the proportion which the number of women employed should bear to the total number of people employed in any form of industrial work?&rdquo;  Arising out of the discussions, it may or may not be decided to recommend that such regulations should be made.  I think that if, arising out of these discussions affecting particular industries, a clear necessity for making such regulations should emerge, we should have power to make them and that is all that this section confirms.</P>
      <P>I am aware that what is troubling certain of the women workers' organisations which have made representations on these matters, is the feeling that the Minister may consult with people who are not properly representative of employers or workers, even though the Minister may accept them as such.  Similar fears have been expressed in relation to other sections where that provision in respect of consultation exists.  I think we can get over that objection, if it is pressed, by some provision which will give to any party the right to appeal to a court to upset the regulations made on the ground that the parties who were really representative of the interests involved, whether the employers or the workers, were not consulted. So far as I am concerned, and so far as the present administration is concerned, I would aim to secure, in relation to any of these matters, agreement between the interests concerned.  In some cases we might not get that agreement and have to act on our own view against the view of one or other, or both the parties; but if no agreement could be secured when consultation first takes place, it might be better to postpone making the regulations in the hope of getting agreement rather than to act in accordance with our own opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the manner in which I would propose to utilise the powers conferred by Sections 11 and 12 and <Col N="1223" /> other sections.  The extent of that power is very largely illusory.  In fact, the Minister must be satisfied that the bulk of the people engaged in the industry will agree with the regulation he proposes to make before he makes it; otherwise the regulation could be made ineffective by those people.  If there are any restrictions upon that power which Deputies think should be inserted in the Bill, I am prepared to consider them so long as they are not restrictions which are going to make the powers inoperative, restrictions which are going to involve too cumbersome machinery, which, in fact, would not be exercised.  The experience always has been that if the provisions of a measure designed to secure safeguards against wanton exercise of power by the Executive, are too cumbersome or restrictive, then the power is not used at all, and the purpose for which the legislation is designed is not achieved.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to consider any proposal designed to secure reasonable safeguards, but they are there already, in my opinion.  The consultation with the representatives of both parties, coupled with the requirement that the regulations must be laid upon the Table, and can be annulled here, are adequate, and I do not think any more is required except, perhaps, power to any party to appeal to the courts on the ground that the persons consulted by the Minister were not representative of the interests concerned.</P>

    <P>(2)  Any regulations made under this section in respect of any form of industrial work may be expressed to be limited in effect to an area specified <Col N="1224" /> therein and whenever such regulations are expressed to be so limited they shall render unlawful the employment of outworkers resident in that area to do such form of industrial work but shall not restrict the employment of any other outworkers.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may in respect of any form of industrial work, after consultation with persons who are in his opinion representative of employers engaged in such form of industrial work and with persons who are in his opinion representative of workers so engaged, by order make regulations either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  prohibiting the employment of any worker at a rate of pay below a specified minimum standard of remuneration to do such form of industrial work, or</P>
      <P>(b)  fixing the proportion which the number of workers remunerated below a specified standard of remuneration employed by any employer to do such form of industrial work may bear to the total number of other workers so employed.</P>
      <P>(2)  When any regulations made under this section are for the time being in force in respect of any form of industrial work it shall not be lawful for any employer to employ to do such form of industrial work either (as the case may be) any worker or so many workers at a rate of pay below the minimum standard of remuneration specified in such regulations that the number of such workers so employed by such employer bears to the number of other workers so employed a proportion greater than that fixed by such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> (3)  If, when any regulations made under this section are for the time being in force, any employer employs a worker or a number of workers in contravention of such regulations such employer shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be guilty of an offence in respect of every day on which such contravention continues.</P>
    <P>Making a case for the reasonableness of the last section, the Minister said he did not intend to use it in any wanton way; he did not intend to do anything which would have an upsetting effect on industry; he just wanted to guard against the possibility of there being an undesirable extension of female employment in industry, and, consequently, it was necessary for him to be armed with the powers conferred on him by the section and the House could rest assured that these powers would be used in a very reasonable way.  Indeed, the Minister almost suggested they would be used in an extremely timid way.</P>
    <P>In this proposed new section I want to give the Minister power to deal with an emergency of a similar kind.  The provisions of this section are designed to give the Minister power to restrict the employment of low-paid workers in any form of industrial work.  Seeing that the manner in which the powers will be exercised is couched in language similar to the previous section, I do not think the Minister can reasonably object to be armed with the powers specified in the new section.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very new in the principle suggested in the amendment. The same principle is virtually enshrined in this section as is enshrined in Section 12.  In the latter section it is specified that the Minister should have power to prohibit the employment of any female worker to do any form of industrial work and in Section 11 the Minister has power to prohibit the employment of any young person to do any form of industrial work.  These two sections are desirable, but I think the Minister should also be armed with powers much <Col N="1226" /> similar in principle to restrict the employment in industry of an overwhelming volume of low-paid workers. The Minister has power to prohibit the employment of young persons in industry, but there may be persons employed who, while not being young persons, are probably as undesirable in that industry as if they were young persons by the reason that they are possibly receiving a rate of wages as low as, or perhaps lower than that paid to a young worker.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider the position which might conceivably arise in future under the scheme of codes which he has in mind.  It might be possible, in respect of a particular type of industry competing with another type of industry, that the employers in the industry paying a higher rate of wages would join with the representatives of the workers in making representations to the Minister to the effect that their existence was being menaced, that their rates of wages and conditions of employment were being menaced by reason of the fact that in a competing industry, or perhaps a group of industries, there was an undue proportion of low-paid labour.  I think in a case of that kind the Minister should be armed with powers to deal with such a situation, especially if the situation is one in which the representatives of the employers and the workers are prepared to come together for the purpose of making representations to the Minister.  The powers conferred in this amendment will be exercisable by the Minister.  They cannot be brought into play without his consent and without positive action on his part, and therefore, I hope the Minister will soon be armed with the power to deal with the emergency where the employment of low-paid workers would be deemed to be socially an evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give the Minister power which, in my opinion, he should not have.  If workers in an industry are not organised in unions or associations and it is necessary because of the circumstances existing in that <Col N="1227" /> industry to fix minimum rates of wages, we have the Trade Boards Act to provide for that.  That is quite adequate to deal with it.  Once a trade board has been established it can deal with this.  If an industry does not come within that description, if the majority of the workers are organised in unions and they are in a position to negotiate agreements with the employers then standard wages should be fixed by agreement.  My proposals for dealing with the matter are set out in Section 42 of the Bill.  If there is any idea that rates of wages are to be fixed otherwise than by agreement&mdash;if they are to be fixed by administrative action &mdash;then that is a matter that we cannot concede, for if we did we would have to go considerably further and ensure that these rates were going to be properly observed.  I think that if there is any question of giving the Department power to interfere for the purpose of fixing minimum rates that we should not just leave it at that but that we should consider the whole matter of trade unions in the new system as well.  In my view, it is much more desirable in the circumstances that rates of wages should be fixed by agreement between representatives of the workers and the employers and I propose in Section 42 of the Bill that where there is such an agreement made between the workers and the employers, on registration it can be legally enforced by everybody concerned. That is as far as I would consent to go at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Illogicalities contrary to fact will never meet.  In this matter we seem to be getting further apart.  In Section 12 there is a restriction on the employment of female workers ostensibly because they bring down wage rates.  Deputy Norton in this amendment wants to prevent low-paid workers being engaged in industry. Let us take low-paid workers as meaning women.  Why is the Deputy so afraid of women in industry if the section is in?  He should not have any terrors as to the wage-lowering effect of women in industry.  The Minister thinks he cannot stop here, that if he <Col N="1228" /> takes one step he has to go further. But the Minister finds that he has taken one step.  There are trade boards in connection with minimum wages. Are they enforceable?  If their agreements are enforceable, why not this? Why not have a complete exclusion of the Minister's power with regard to women in industry and, instead, tackle this whole thing from the angle of low-paid workers?  I have no belief in the argument that it cannot be done. If you pass legislation you must enforce it.  But we are about enforcing legislation which does establish minimum rates.  If we can do that we should surely be able to say &ldquo;we will not have more than a certain proportion of low-paid wage rates.&rdquo;  Certainly if the question of low-paid workers is to be tackled it is to be tackled on this basis and not on the basis of giving the Minister power to exclude women as a class because women have a tendency to lower the wage rate.  We are told that Section 42 is the farthest that the Minister will go.  That section means that there are wage agreements registered, and if they are, the Department will see to their enforcement.  There is not a bit of timidity about the Department in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department does not undertake to enforce them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it establishes a way of enforcing them through the courts and it does not follow that the courts will be faced with an impossible task.  Otherwise, the Section is futile. The Department thinks it is right to pass a standard like that and throw it to the courts.  Yet it will not accept Deputy Norton's standard and throw it to the courts.  I consider there will be considerable difficulty in enforcing Section 42 on the employer, but not on the worker.  We will be faced, I suppose, with the statement that in the general strike in England in 1926 certain legal pundits were able to declare that the strike was illegal. Apart from anything else, would the fact that certain legal pundits declared it illegal, have stopped the strike?  Not a bit of it.  In the same way, legal agreements made between the workers <Col N="1229" /> and the employer will not prevent the workers from going on strike in defiance of these agreements.  The reason is that you can get after the individual employer, because he is one single man, but how can you get after 2,000 or 3,000 employees and enforce wages agreements on them?  It is nonsense to think you can, and everybody knows it.  The trade unions in their strength can laugh at Section 42.  They know it is not a double-edged sword.  It is a single-edged sword.  They know that it can be used against the employer but not against the workers.  But it cannot be ruled out on the grounds of the impossibility of enforcing it.  That is not the ground on which it can be ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but I maintain that it is undesirable that this method of fixing wages in respect of industries that are organised should be resorted to.  If the industries are organised then there are trade unions that are quite capable of enforcing the agreements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we are to leave it to the consciousness that they will be regulated according to the strength of the unions.  If it is desired to prevent underpaid labour in industry; to prevent, say, women in industry because women have a lowering effect upon wage rates in industry, then tackle the thing from this angle, and get after the vice of low-wage rates.  Do not get after what is an excuse for the vice, women in industry. I would prefer to have Section 12 dropped and Deputy Norton's amendment put in than to have Deputy Norton's amendment dropped and Section 12 put in.  Because you are then tackling low wages and you are tackling them in the right way.  The Minister says that if the agreements for wages are registered &ldquo;we will enforce them under the law.&rdquo;  In these circumstances, you decide that you will establish minimum rates of wages and you will enforce them.  There is no doubt about the capacity of the State to enforce them.  As regards this, however, we think it is not the proper thing to do.  The Minister says because of the impossibility of enforcing it, it <Col N="1230" /> should be left to the unions.  Deputy Norton thinks the Minister should have power to declare restriction on the employment of low-paid workers and that he should have some weapon like this.  At any rate, if the Minister has these powers he will be strengthened.</P>
      <P>I see nothing in the argument of the Minister, because, in effect, that means that if you cannot get 100 per cent. compliance with legislation, you should not enforce it.  You may get 100 per cent. compliance by degrees.  The fact that you have it there will aid you to get it by progressing to the 100 per cent. compliance.</P>
      <P>At any rate Deputy Norton is pleading for a good principle.  I do not know how he is going to get a definition of the low-paid worker.  That will be difficult.  But let it be assumed that there is some national standard and that there are people who fall below that, and therefore classifiable as low-paid workers.  It is surely the proper thing to see that those people who are recognised to be low-paid should not be allowed to have that weakening effect upon the wage level generally, and particularly, should not be allowed to have that effect under the Bill, which has only a backing and only a context in conditions of great unemployment, and, especially, when it is unemployment in a country which has gone completely mad on tariffs where the consumers pay and where the consumers ought to be able to say that there is a community benefit instead of an employer benefit.  We get the community benefit instead of the employer benefit by saying that we are not going to have the employers making at the expense of the community in a tariffed industry and not passing on the benefit to the workers.  If the low-paid workers' section will aid in spreading the benefit to the community, then I am in favour of it, and I see no reason why it should not be enforced.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's attitude in resisting an amendment of this kind.  Apparently, to meet the criticism advanced against Section 12, he proceeded to deprecate the strength of that section.  He took <Col N="1231" /> the view that it was a section which would only be used in extreme cases. He is given power by the amendment to be able to adopt similar restrictive activities in respect of low-paid workers.  The Minister sees in this amendment, which is in principle the same as Section 12, all kinds of dangers which he does not profess to see from his own standpoint in Section 12.</P>

He is not compelled to use the powers of the section.  He is not obliged to take the viewpoint of the union or the viewpoint of the particular employer.

      <P>We were told by the Minister that the machinery for setting up a trade board was cumbersome and that he believed it had resulted in trade boards not being set up.  Now he supplements that viewpoint by saying that, notwithstanding that cumbersome machinery, notwithstanding the fact that the setting up of a trade board is an event in the Department of Industry and Commerse, they have managed to set up a few in very obvious cases.  In other words, when you are in danger of squeezing the life almost out of the worker you will get a trade board, but if there is any chance of being able to hang on without a trade board, then leave that piece of cumbersome machinery alone. That is the remedy which the Minister offers us to deal with the problem of the low paid workers.  In other debates in this House the Minister seemed to me to be keen upon wanting to get into his hands the power to regulate wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite another problem.  My standard is not necessarily tied to the trade board standard; while there are in some cases trade union agreements made between employers and workers which are regarded as the trade board standard, in these cases reasonable rates of wages are paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the Minister looks at the minimum rates paid in certain industries under the Trade Boards Acts he will find no ground for saying that the trade board rates of wages, where the minimum is often the maximum, are rates about which he cannot feel in any way satisfied.  The fixation of rates of wages by the Minister is not a new function for the Minister.  If the Minister looks up the Transport Act, 1933, he will find that he takes power to prescribe fair rates <Col N="1234" /> of wages.  We are asking under this section that he should have the same power to prescribe minimum rates of wages and he is to do that not under compulsion but of his own free will after having consulted the employers and representatives of the workers.  I think the principle enshrined in this amendment is good.  I think that in a country which is young industrially it is exceptionally good.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan that it is desirable at this stage to make it clear to those charged with the responsibility of running industry that the community expects, in return for the inconveniences to which it subjects itself on behalf of industry, and for the burden which it bears on behalf of industry, that those charged with the administration of industry shall reciprocate by conforming to standard calculated to raise the standard of living in the country.  This is a power which is to be given to the Minister for use in his own discretion for use in extreme cases.  But the Minister proceeds to assume that you cannot possibly have the extreme case.</P>

This gives the unions and employers power to consult and gives power &ldquo;prohibiting the employment of any worker at a rate of pay below the specified minimum standard of remuneration&rdquo; and fixes &ldquo;the proportion which the number of workers remunerated below the specified standard of remuneration employed by any employer to do such form of industrial work, may bear to the total number of other workers so employed.&rdquo; Is there anything wrong in principle in the State taking power to prohibit the employment of persons in receipt of low rates of wages?  I do not think the Minister would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that. If there is nothing wrong in it in principle, what is there wrong in practice? The Minister's fear, I think, is that there might be a dispute initiated for a certain standard rate of wages, and that he would be asked to evoke the powers of the section to show that the rates demanded should be regarded as minimum rates.  Assuming that that claim was made on behalf of workers, the Minister could say it is exaggerated and make that defence.</P>

At any rate, it was a unique case.  I am convinced it was a ramp, and a dishonest ramp, to state that the workers would be better off if they had a lower rate of wages, even than the starvation rate of wages they had. This is not the first time we have had that kind of thing.  We have often been told that if we would only lower the rate of wages we could employ more people.  That doctrine has been falsified in every instance.  This is the only case that can be quoted of a number of embroidery workers in a particular part of the country rebelling against being paid too high.  We have only one instance in which such a protest has been made.  Even then we have no particulars produced in connection with the rate of wages that were fixed by the Trades Board. That is the case on which these arguments are founded.  Does the Minister fear that if he fixes a rate of wages in a particular trade there would be a demonstration outside Government Buildings protesting against his action.</P>

      <P>No.  But you would be in danger of having confusion and industrial dislocation if you are to have the Department of Industry and Commerce and trade unions interfering in the rates of wages fixed.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take that argument. Under Section 12 you will have cases where the trade unions look after the interests of women and men.  The Minister is not content to let the unions look after the interests of women and men.  He wants to come in under Section 12 and to say to them: &ldquo;You are to look after both the women and the men but I am going to take a hand also.  I am going to come in there and review your functions in relation to the number of women to be employed. We have that case under Section 12, and, even, under Section 11 the Minister is not prepared to stand out and keep the ring.  He is going to come in under Sections 11 and 12 and <Col N="1238" /> I think rightly so.  I want him to come in too under Section 13 and prohibit the employment of any worker at a rate of pay below the specified minimum standard of remuneration for such form of industrial work, and I want him to fix the proportion which the number of workers remunerated below the specified standard may be to the total number of other workers so employed.  The Minister's defence is that because the unions are doing that work he does not want to do it as well.  He said that in the course of the discussion on the proposed new Section 13 which immediately follows the two sections in which the Minister interferes with the unions where they are catering for a particular problem in which he wants to meddle. I suggest to the Minister that he could have no valid objection to this section, if he does not want to interfere in the regulation of wages.</P>

I could quite understand if this section were so drawn that it forced the Minister to act, but, instead of putting any compulsion on the Minister, I give him the option of taking the powers&mdash;he need not use them if he likes&mdash;to be used in cases in which there is an undue proportion of lowly-paid workers to highly-paid workers.</P>

      <P>The manifesto; the plan is part of it if you like.  This amendment is pink almost as compared with the promises contained in the manifesto.  I thought it should not be necessary having regard to these promises, to ask the Minister to accept an amendment of this kind.  It is in no way revolutionary or radical.  From the Minister's previous utterances on industrial matters I assumed he would be only too willing to accept an amendment of this kind and put it into the Bill.  The only case the Minister can make against it is that he does not want to be receiving deputations all his life or whilst he is Minister, dealing with the question of lowly-paid <Col N="1241" /> workers.  I say it is worth while putting the Minister to the trouble if we can get lowly-paid workers eliminated from industry.</P>

      <P>Section 42 will never be effective if it stands in its present form.  The Minister knows that the trades unions objected to Section 42 as it stands.  Section 42 is no remedy. This new section represents an attempt to give the Minister power which I think he should have&mdash;he need not exercise it if he does not like, but he can exercise if he thinks it necessary &mdash;to eliminate from industry the worst evil of industrialism, the lowly-paid worker menace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get this into its proper perspective. I do not know what the Minister's main argument against this is.  I heard him interrupt about strikers making terms but I do not know that I have got the point yet.  Deputy Norton should realise that this would be an uncomfortable section for the Minister, with his past and his promises, to operate because he has to do either of two things.  He has only faced up to one alternative himself, that he would have to be constantly refusing people who would come to him to demand that the section should be made operative.  He has another alternative equally undesirable from his angle.  He cannot fix a specific minimum below which workers should not be paid and without which the section would be useless.  I think that he would have to fix it so low that it would cause an outcry.  Sometimes you have certain rather sentimental speeches in this House and people become agitated about slave conditions, un-Christian conditions, and so on, but when you proceed in a Bill to put in cold print what is your standard of the non-Christian or the unChristian conditions, you find yourself up against a lot of things, stretching your levels and increasing your gaps.  We remember the Moneylenders Bill.  When it was first introduced, people began to wander in the direction <Col N="1242" /> of 5 and 7 per cent., and thought that 12 per cent. was a terrific rate of interest, but what happened?  It is now found that up to 39 per cent. can be charged under certain conditions. It has to be charged to allow for the ordinary conditions under which money is lent and even to allow for what is socially desirable for the lending of money.  So if in the future the Minister had to sit down with his knowledge of the unemployment situation, the difficulty of getting industry going and the conditions that have to be tolerated in industry at the beginning to keep the wheels moving, there would be flashed on an astonished community a basic wage that would shock the community.  That is the main difficulty.</P>
      <P>I should like to have this looked into.  I am not at all in favour of the amendment as desirable in a Bill which in itself is undesirable which is only made partly desirable because of the undesirable circumstances in which we find ourselves.  We are trying not to increase employment but merely to spread out unemployment, to spread the evil effects of unemployment among a greater number of people.  These are the circumstances as I see them.  There is enough unemployment here and the Minister is trying to deal with the matter as if unemployment were not a normal matter.  He is trying to keep various people, women and children, out of industry.  Deputy Norton readily makes the point that if the Minister is prepared to prevent young people and women from entering industry he should certainly have power to prevent the employment of lowly paid employees in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is possible to prohibit young people, and, particularly, if it is possible, in the teeth of the opposition that such a reactionary clause will arouse, to prohibit women in industry, it ought to be eminently easy and very desirable to prevent low paid workers in industry.  Now, in present circumstances, we have to think not merely in terms of unemployment but in terms of the ransom that at the moment is being paid by the community because of extremely high tariffs.  When you <Col N="1243" /> have a tariff barrier of a particular height that is able to give a certain amount of protection to the home manufacturer and, at the same time, is able to give him a stimulus and an incentive to do good work&mdash;because there will be other goods coming in of the type he produces&mdash;a manufacturer in such circumstances cannot hold the community to ransom.  Under those conditions you may not get a speedy development in industry, but you will get a sound development in industry, one that will last.  Instead of that, we have wandered behind these huge tariff barriers.</P>
    <P>I assert that where you have 80 and 90 per cent. tariffs, as you have here to-day, the community is being ransomed in the price it pays.  I do not think that anyone can come into the House and demand that the community should pay that ransom to benefit certain employers, their families and friends only.  The only philosophy on which such a policy can be based is that the community itself will benefit, because in the end, when the community benefits, we all benefit.  If that benefit gives more purchasing power through more wages and more industry, there will be less unemployment assistance, less unemployment insurance, and less taxation.  But the position is that we are having it both ways at the moment.  Ordinary taxes are heavy and the community is being held to ransom by high prices.  We want to see, in any event, that the benefit of these high prices will go to the community and not to individuals or to the families of individuals.  There is one way of doing that, although it may not be a very good way.  We should say that here we have a system under which the goods we manufacture are protected from competition.  The market here is reserved to our manufacturers and the community must, of necessity, buy certain types of goods from them.  Let us, at any rate, not have the community sacrificed, benefiting only a few people, because it does not do the community any great good if a group of employers, their families and relatives should be able to live <Col N="1244" /> better than they were doing.  But the community derives a vast advantage if purchasing power through wages is spread through the community.</P>
    <P>With those high tariffs, I do not see why the Minister should be timid about facing up to manufacturers and saying that if there was free competition, if they were subject to outside intervention, if goods manufactured abroad by cheap labour could come in here, that the impact of all that would be such that he could not fix rates of wages at too high a level.  But he could also say to them: &ldquo;Here you have a closed borough protected by 80 and 90 per cent. tariffs and I am going to see that you will spread some of that benefit over the community.&rdquo;  There is a good philosophy in that.  But the Minister's difficulty, despite all his talk about employment growing, increased prosperity, and all the rest, is that he would have to put to himself this question: &ldquo;What wages can I fix in a particular industry protected, as it is, in the main, by a tariff of 80 or 90 per cent., and how am I to expose myself before the world that for this community in the Irish Free State I have got to fix a low rate of wages?&rdquo;  Is not that a complete answer to all his talk about the increased wealth and prosperity in the country?  That is his difficulty. He knows that he could not fix that low rate of wages, although if there was prosperity, he should be able to do it.  Suppose there is a lag in the growth of industry, cannot the Minister &mdash;if this is his case, and he can make his case better inside his office than here in the House&mdash;when these workers come to him and say that they want a higher rate of wages, turn to them and say: &ldquo;If I fix that now it will be a real downward trend; it will be a pointer downward; wait a year or two; things are on the up-grade and you have only to bide your time to feel the flush of prosperity.&rdquo;  He can tell them to tighten their belts and, with his persuasiveness, can get the workers to agree, because, in the end, the workers will lose if they insist on a rate of wages being fixed higher than industry can afford.  Industry will not pay it; it will go out.</P>
    <P>On the other hand.  I have fears of <Col N="1245" /> this, because it is in a very adroit way introducing the Australian conditions. Australia was protected by high tariffs and had a wages board.  It had a wages board prior to the war.  That wages board had on it a majority of people whose minds were, say, attuned to the mind of whoever the Australian Deputy Norton was.  The workers there wanted a certain wage.  What happened was that you got tariffs. The tariffs raised the cost of living, and then the workers found that their wages were not buying as much as they used to buy.  The result was that they applied for an increase.  They got the increase, and the moment they got it it was found that it was equivalent to reducing the tariff by 5 per cent.  Then there was an application for an increased tariff.  All that brought Australia to a certain condition in the end.  It was not a desirable end.  With that example before us, I would feel a bit perturbed about this amendment of Deputy Norton.</P>
    <P>The circumstance that we have here is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce states that if we are not actually rolling in prosperity at the moment, that prosperity is just around the corner.  I do not know how far off the corner is.  If that be the case, the Minister is not in any great danger if he accepts the amendment, because he can postpone fixing the specified minimum rate until the prosperity has come. The workers may get tired of waiting for that prosperity.  If that should happen, then the Minister, in his office, and through the Press, will have to say that he is rather a bit afraid that prosperity is not keeping the appointment up to time.  Then we will get truth, clarity and fact, and we want all that.  If the situation is that our industrialists, protected by tariffs of 80 and 90 per cent., are able to deliver the goods, then they ought to be able to deliver the wages.  I think good industrialists in this country will not pass an uneasy second in their night's sleep by reason of this amendment, but certain shockingly bad employers, brought into this country by these 80 and 90 per cent. tariffs will, and the sooner that we get rid of these people the better.  The work they do is being <Col N="1246" /> extracted from the scope of the work that the good manufacturer might do, and the more that we can put into the hands of good manufacturers operating under good conditions, the better for industry, the better for the health of the workers, and the better for conditions all round.  There is a good philosophy in all that.  This amendment seems to tend towards that, and I think the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to say why he makes this peculiar divagation that it is necessary to have the power to preclude women from employment because they depress wages, and that it is not proper to have the power to exclude from work low paid wage-earners? Surely, they will depress wages as much as women ever can.  If it is right to have that power in Section 12, the Minister ought to accept this amendment.  I do not say that there is not another situation that might develop, and that is that Section 12 should be dropped and that, instead, this amendment, which refers to the employment of low paid workers be substituted.  The only argument used with regard to women in industry was that women gave cheap labour and, therefore, that they had the effect that this section is designed to prevent.  I hope that, with Deputy Norton's assistance, I will be able to get Section 12 deleted on the Report Stage.  I will bargain with him on that.  Let us attack the principle of low paid wages. Do not let us attack it in one of its manifestations as regards women.  I do not believe that it is correct to say that women, in fact, have a depressing effect on wages.  I thought that stage had long since passed, but if that is the case, let us attack low paid wages where they occur.  This is a fainthearted amendment, but I can see that it could be a highly dangerous amendment if supposing Deputy Norton was the Minister and he had the duty of operating it in one of his proletarian intelligentsia moods.  You might get a medium or a good man to operate it fairly or decently.  You might get a good employer to operate it decently, because he would like to operate it to help a good employer and cut out the bad <Col N="1247" /> employer, and thereby have good employment.  But, as between the two, the Minister will not operate it so as to do any good from Deputy Norton's viewpoint or my viewpoint.  If Deputy Norton had control, he would operate it in a way which would ruin industry, but there is no danger of that at the moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan's speech in favour of the amendment would have been a good one if it had anything to do with it.  But it had <Col N="1248" /> nothing to do with the amendment. The question is not whether there should be high wages or low wages.  It is a question of whether, in organised industries, it is more desirable to have rates of wages regulated by negotiation between trade unions and associations of employers or by State action.  Deputy Norton wants to regulate the wages by State action.  I think that, in organised industries, they should be regulated by agreement between the parties, and I propose, as an alternative to this amendment, Section 42.</P>

      <P>The trades union movement has to be protected from his advocacy!  The object here is to ensure that whenever an employer is requested by an authorised representative of the workers he may inspect particulars which are on the piece-work dockets, piece-work placards or piece-work particulars book, which are the basis of the rates of remuneration of the workers.  It is a reasonable requirement that if an employer is issuing <i>bona fide</i> particulars to workers, and if there is fair dealing, that the dockets providing the remuneration at the rate agreed upon between the worker and the employer may be furnished.  The employers should have no hesitation whatever in consenting to have such particulars furnished to the representatives of the trades unions.  It may be argued by the Minister that this is unnecessarily interfering with the work of employers.  I can assure the Minister that no trades union official wants to inspect particulars of this kind merely for the purpose of wasting his time inspecting them.  The fact that he may require information of this kind might help to obviate the development of friction in the industry which, if it took place, would have more serious effects on workers and employers than if these particulars were furnished.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot is after voting for an amendment for low wages in an industry, and he now says &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to the Minister.  This is a curious kind of alliance.  It is, according to the Minister for Industry <Col N="1252" /> and Commerce, going to help the trade union movement.  The Minister may get a bit embarrassed by some of his friends that are going to help him in opposing trades unionism.  Deputy MacDermot says he is in favour of the Minister's objection to the trade union movement.  I should have thought that the fact that Deputy MacDermot objected to this amendment would be one of the reasons that the Minister should accept it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will probably vote with the Minister this time, and, while going to the Division Lobby, may explain why he is with him. I think that it is desirable that the workers' representative should be entitled, since he represents the workers' interests and is freely acknowledged by the worker as his representative, to inspect a docket of this kind or to have a duly authenticated copy of it sent to him on application.  I think that if a regulation of that kind were made it would avoid a lot of annoyance and irritation.  I am sure that the Minister has come across cases from time to time where he though the action of employers was needlessly stubborn and that that stubbornness might have been avoided if there had been a little bit of give and take.  The object of this amendment is to see that the representative of the workers should be entitled to inspect certain dockets, and I hold that there should be no reason for refusing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On yesterday's Order Paper, there appeared a question in my name addressed to the Minister for Justice in which I drew his attention to the fact that a sheriff's officer paid for and bought 89 cattle for the sum of £90, which subsequently realised over £700 in Belfast, and, secondly, asking if the Minister would direct sheriffs in future to offer livestock at public sales in lots not exceeding six beasts, in order to ensure that excessive loss would not be inflicted on the owners of property offered for sale.  In asking him to give that instruction, I was asking him to do no more than to insist on the statute law of this country being observed by the officials of the Government because the Court Enforcements Order Act, and other Acts controlling the method whereby seized goods shall be sold and realised for the payment of debts, provides that the goods must be sold by the sheriff or his officer in such a way as to realise the largest possible sum for the owner of the goods.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in reply to me that he had no doubt that if the proper representations are made in the matter to under-sheriffs at the proper time and in the proper way, such representations will receive reasonable and fair consideration. I am frequently charged in this House&mdash;falsely charged but nevertheless charged&mdash;with making general allegations without producing specific proof.  To date, I am glad to say, I have always been able to follow up a general allegation with a specific case, to illustrate in detail whatever allegations I have brought before the House, and I intend to do that on this occasion, as I have done in the past.  I intend to do it by reading to the House now a letter addressed by a farmer from County Cork to the Bishop of his diocese and a copy of which has been sent to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference precisely to the seizures that have taken place in Cork and to the sale that has taken place there in bulk resulting in an excessive loss, in a case where representations were made in the matter to the under-sheriff at the proper time and in the proper way, and such representations did not receive the reasonable and fair consideration which the Minister said he was satisfied they would have received had they been made.  The letter, which is addressed from Leitrim, Kilworth, County Cork, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I take the opportunity of writing certain particulars, knowing that you take a keen interest in the country, and in the awful plight of the farming community at the present time.  Last Saturday morning,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>the letter is dated 22nd June, 1935,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Land Commission Flying Squad visited me at 7.30 o'clock, fully equipped with lorries full of armed men, with rifles and revolvers.  They took 16 milch cows, leaving two that were practically useless to rear the young calves which I had not had the heart to slaughter.  They also took my working horses, leaving me helpless to do any bit of work during the year, and what sheep and lambs were in the place&mdash;23 in all.  They then went on to an outside farm of mine, and stripped it of every living animal. They took off that farm 45 cattle, 32 sheep and 5 valuable horses.  The whole of the stock taken from me was put up for sale on Monday in one lot horses, cattle, sheep, and a saddle and a winkers.  A friend of mine, who is a reputable person, went there with the object of buying back the stock for me, and when the Government agent bid £75 my friend bid £75 5/-, but his bid was refused and the lot was knocked down to the Government agent at the original bid of £75.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What more rational representation could be made to the sheriff's officer than to offer him a bid in excess of the Government agent's bid?  That <Col N="1257" /> offer was made.  The bid was refused, and the stock, which I have enumerated, was knocked down for £75.  The letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This all happened in a few seconds.  After the sale a number of my friends undertook to find the money for me to meet the full demand of the sheriff, including costs, and I offered to pay the full amount, but my offer was refused. Surely, it is downright robbery to deprive me of practically the whole of my means for the sum of £75, and the case is made very much worse by the refusal of the Government agent to return the stock to me when it was made possible for me to meet the demand.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Friends gathered around him and said that, in the circumstances, they would offer to put up the money to meet the debt, but the agent refused to return the goods. He said that he got them for £75 and he would stick to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale took place; all the stock I have described was put up, together with a saddle and winkers.  The Government agent bid £75.  The friend of the farmer who writes this letter said: &ldquo;I bid £75 and 5/-.&rdquo;  The sheriff's officer said: &ldquo;I will not accept that bid.  I knock down all to the Government agent for £75.&rdquo;  Then the friends of the farmer gathered around and said: &ldquo;Well, this is an unsatisfactory sale. To make an end of the business we will offer to pay his debt for him to the sheriff, and give those goods back to the man.&rdquo;  The Government agent, however, said: &ldquo;I will not give back the goods.  I bought them for £75, and I am going to stick to them.&rdquo; In his letter the man says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely, it is downright robbery to deprive me of practically the whole of my means for the sum of £75, and the case is made very much worse by the refusal of the <Col N="1258" /> Government agent to return the stock to me when it was made possible by my neighbours for me to meet the demand.  To make the position worse, there were three of my children sick in bed, the eldest being 9 years, and the youngest 2 years.  My wife was under the doctor's care, and the visit of the squad gave her such a shock that she is now in a state of prostration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to deal with the general condition of the country, and so forth.</P>
    <P>The case I want to make to the Minister is this: Those are all law-abiding men, who, for generations, have been the backbone of the country.  They are honest men.  They are men whose credit has always been good.  They are the type of men who never defaulted on their legitimate commitments at any time.  This is a family man, with a young growing family.  He is apparently hard-working. He has horses, sheep and cattle. He tries his hand at everything.  He is anxious to pay his way.  In another part of the letter he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I paid £112 in rates, and I had to leave my family without many essentials in order to provide that money.  I sold 12 cattle at the last fair in Mitchelstown at a very bad price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to explain that there was a tariff of £6 on each of the cattle, and that that interfered with the price.  He was not a man who tried to run away from his obligations. He was ready to tighten his belt, and not only to do that but to deprive his family of what he felt they were entitled to have, in order to find money to pay his rates.  That man had not got the money to pay the land annuities.  He was willing to take out and sell his stock at a sacrifice, and he did sell it a sacrifice in order to try and raise the money, but here he was with cattle, calves, sheep and horses, and he could not sell any of them.  The calves were not worth taking out.  If he did take them out he would be left there <Col N="1259" /> with all the cattle and the milk; you cannot sell butter now without a licence and there is a 4d. levy on it. The man could not possibly raise the money in any way to meet his commitment.</P>
    <P>The sheriff's officer comes out.  He does not take a modest and reasonable proportion of the man's stock; he takes everything.  He leaves that man in the condition that he will not only be unable to meet his commitments this year, but that he will never be able to meet his commitments again; his entire stock-in-trade is gone.  That is not all. He brings all that stock into the pound. All the stock which I have described to the House here to-day was worth, on a conservative estimate, £800 or £900. Probably, if this man's valuation of his five horses was a fair one, his property was worth £1,200.  Let us take an average figure, and say that all that stock together, prudently sold, would be worth £1,000.  £1,000 worth of stock &mdash;the entire stock-in-trade and means of livelihood of a man who has got a wife and young family&mdash;is taken from him, and sold to a bailiff for £75, the bid of his friend for £75 5s. being refused. The man is left destitute, with his wife and children to provide for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the debt is not stated, but it was for land annuities, and when we see £75 taken by the sheriff we may assume that that is approximately the amount that was due.  It was a figure in that neighbourhood, or else some endeavour would have been made to raise a larger sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully realise that, but the case I want to make is this: when <Col N="1260" /> the auctioneer had that £1,000 worth of stock in the saleyard, was there any reason in justice why he should not divide it up into lots of six or eight beasts, keep offering them in lots of six or eight beasts until a sum sufficient to pay the debt due was realised, and then return the surplus stock to the owner?  Unless the purpose is not only to recover the amount due on foot of land annuities, but to penalise and victimise individual farmers, that course would be followed.  I have moved this motion on the adjournment for the purpose of charging the Government with something graver than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My elaboration of it is this: There was no explanation vouchsafed for the refusal to divide this man's stock and other articles into lots, into modest numbers, so that they could be sold to advantage.  The reason of that refusal is, I believe, because the Government want to exasperate respectable farmers in Cork in order to justify the taking of coercion measures against them.  That is a criminal activity for any Government to engage in.  The <i>agent provocateur</i> was sent out 30 or 40 years ago by the British Government when they could not otherwise exasperate men to break the law, when those men stood united within the law, conforming with the law, but resisting injustice.  The <i>agent provocateur</i> was then sent out to stir up trouble and violence so that the military could be let loose on the people.  Sergeant Sheridan was sent out.  When the people stood fast and would not be excited into deeds of violence, Sergeant Sheridan was sent out in order to do the deeds of violence and plant them on the people.  I submit that to take £1,000 worth of property from a hardworking farmer and sell it under his very nose for £75, leaving him and his wife and family destitute, is the act of an <i>agent provocateur</i> and this is done with the intention of driving these respectable men into violence, into breaches of the law, to <Col N="1261" /> provide the Government with an excuse to victimise and to trample them and lastly, to evict them.</P>
      <P>I implore the Government to stop that.  We have used, and are using, all the influence at our disposal to prevent defiance of the law in any part of the country.  We will continue to do so, but I solemnly warn the Government that if they are going to embark on a course of gross and flagrant injustice with the view of provoking these men into defiance of the law in order to get an opportunity to victimise and then evict them, I am quite prepared to advise them to resist the evicters' battering ram with all the energy of their forefathers.</P>

      <P>I presume Deputy Dillon raised this matter on the adjournment in order to give me an opportunity of saying something.  Apparently, Deputy O'Leary and others on the opposite benches are endeavouring to prevent me saying anything.  This method of raising a question on the adjournment is largely used for that purpose and not with any sincerity at all.  What position have you in Co. Cork?  You have a certain number of Blueshirt farmers who look upon impeding the Fianna Fáil Government as their normal duty and do not look after their farming interests at all&mdash;that does not matter at all, it is of no importance.  They endeavour to impede the Government as far as they can.  Up to six or eight months ago there was no such thing as a seizure in Co. Cork, but we had at that time the cutting of telegraph poles, the blocking of roads and interfering with the railways, although the <Col N="1262" /> telegraph wires and railways were not used in any way to interfere with these farmers.  Now we have all this talk about trying to drive these farmers into rebellion, and so on.  All that went on before ever there was a seizure in Cork&mdash;the cutting of wires and the blocking of roads and railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only in April, 1935 &mdash;three months ago&mdash;that the Government began to give assistance to the under-sheriff to collect land annuities. At that time there was an agitation amongst the farmers that these cattle should not be bought when they were brought to the pound.  They went to their friends and told them not to bid and they would not bid themselves and when another person, who was not a Government agent, made a bid, they tracked him and tried to interfere with him selling the cattle wherever he could bring them.  When that did not succeed they started branding the cattle in order that they would fetch a ridiculously small price.  After all that has occurred, after the farmers themselves have tried as far as they could to make these cattle worthless at these sales, we have this speech from Deputy Dillon just as if the Government were trying to prevent these people from getting a reasonable price. We have heard Deputy Dillon say that these are law-abiding men, those men who have cut telegraph wires and interfered with the railways.  I read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 26th June&mdash; yesterday&mdash;that a certain gentleman in the County Cork whose cattle were seized said in a speech afterwards that they would pay the land annuities when the present régime came to an end.</P>

      <P>What régime did he refer to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil régime, I suppose.  What other régime is there?  And these are the law-abiding men that we had to get special powers to go down to and deal with!  They will not buy themselves, but they have tried to prevent a decent price being obtained for their cattle because they <Col N="1263" /> have the cattle branded so that they cannot be disposed of; at least, so far as they can prevent it.</P>

      <P>They have done their level best to make it as dangerous as they possibly can for any person to bid for the cattle.  Then they come along and get innocent Deputies&mdash;if I may call them innocent&mdash;to raise this question in the House.  They get these Deputies to complain bitterly that the Minister for Justice is unable to secure a high price for their cattle.  It is hardly necessary to remark that that sort of humbug does not deceive anybody, not even Deputy Dillon.  The Deputy complains that these buyers are getting large profits. I hope they are.  It is the only way this campaign can be stopped&mdash; when we get buyers who will go there and get large profits.  They would need large profits with the risks they are running in these places.  I hope they are getting large profits and will continue to attend these sales.  At Fermoy the other day I notice they bought in their own cattle.  That is a departure, and perhaps it is the dawn of commonsense for these misguided individuals. Deputy Dillon and others say they have counselled respect for the law.  Where? They have never condemned any of these outrages, such as the cutting of wires, the breaking up of railways, the burning of T.D.'s houses&mdash;they have never condemned anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The dawn of sanity is appearing.  They are beginning to buy back their own cattle.  It is nearly time that they became sane.  Surely those men, if they have any sense, would <Col N="1264" /> not have their cattle seized and would not be paying, not only the annuity, but the sheriffs' expenses as well.  Surely they ought to pay those annuities before the cattle are taken to the pound.  I am quite sure if the Minister for Justice were here he would have no apology to make.  I have none to make on his behalf for what has been done. The men who led this campaign are to blame.  It was not condemned by the men opposite, who were responsible for it by making it impossible for anybody to buy the cattle, marking and branding them so that nobody could buy them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice said there was no Government agent buying these cattle. That is true, but that is not a promise.  A Government agent will, if necessary, be appointed and every step will be taken to make these men pay the land annuities where they can pay them.  It is evident from the case mentioned by Deputy Dillon that the man could pay the land annuities, but he preferred to have this political show in order to defeat the Fianna Fáil Government.  Why do they not pay before the sheriff comes and cut out all the trouble?</P>
