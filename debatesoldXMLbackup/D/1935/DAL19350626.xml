    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the accounts of the Ballaghaderreen electricity undertaking were audited by one of the auditors of his Department before the vesting of the undertaking in the Electricity Supply Board; and, if so, if he will state what sums were certified by the auditor as a set off under Section 39 (7) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part the provisions of Section 39 (7) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, apply only to the amount raised by means of rates in aid of the undertaking up to the 31st March, 1927, and the amount ascertained to be so raised within that period and applicable to the purposes of the undertaking after allowing for the cost of public lighting is £1,367 3s. 1d.  No formal certificate is required to be given by the auditor under the Act of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, would he examine the question as to whether the allowance for public lighting is not straining the terms of the statute under which the auditor purports to make his calculations, in view of the fact that no charge had been made by the undertaking for public lighting during the 20 years of its existence?  The attempt of the Electricity Supply Board now is <Col N="908" /> to fix an arbitrary sum that ought to have been charged, and to set that off against their liability for recoupment to the local authority in rates.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary look into that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the housing scheme formulated by the Clonakilty Urban Council is being held up as a result, of the Minister's refusal to sanction the appointment of the clerk of works selected by the Urban Council; that the Council is satisfied that the clerk of works whom they have selected possesses the necessary qualifications to carry out the duties efficiently; and if, in the circumstances, he will give the necessary sanction to the appointment made and allow the work to be proceeded with at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The person selected by the Clonakilty Urban District Council for the position of clerk of works for the proposed housing scheme in the district is aged 74 years and is in receipt of an old age pension.  He has had no previous experience as clerk of works, and I do not consider that he is a suitable person for the position, and I am not prepared to sanction his employment by the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that a man 74 years of age would not forego his pension?  This is a man who is fully qualified to act as clerk of works.  He has had big experience of building works.  There was no question of age in the letter that was sent by the Department stating that the position should be advertised.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice <Col N="909" /> if he will state on what grounds James Cronin was arrested on 28th May, 1935, and by what authority he was detained in the Bridewell Barracks, Cork, for a period of almost 72 hours and upon what grounds he was rearrested immediately upon leaving the said barracks and by what authority he was again detained in the Bridewell Barracks, Cork, for a further period of almost 72 hours and on what grounds he was rearrested immediately upon leaving the said barracks, and by what authority he was detained for a third consecutive period of 72 hours; and if, on any of these three several occasions he was arrested and detained upon suspicion of being concerned in or having knowledge of the commission of any offences set out in the Appendix to Article 2A of the Constitution; what were the offences upon suspicion of having been concerned in or having knowledge of the commission of which he was arrested and detained in the first, second and third instance referred to in this question respectively.</P>

      <P>The person named in the Deputy's question was apprehended and detained in each instance in pursuance of the powers conferred by Article 2A of the Constitution. As this man is now awaiting trial by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal, it would not be proper for me to make any further statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say under what clause of Article 2A of the Constitution this man was apprehended and detained for three successive periods of 72 hours?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's information, I can tell him that there is only one clause&mdash;Clause 14&mdash;which empowers the Guards to detain a man for one period of 72 hours only.  It is quite obvious that there was here an attempt at an evasion of the restrictions laid down under the Act.  The man was kept for nearly 72 hours on <Col N="910" /> the first occasion.  He was then allowed outside the door, hauled back again and detained for a second period of nearly 72 hours.  He was again let out, hauled back immediately and detained for a third period of 72 hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that the sheriff or his officer accepted a bid of £90 for 89 cattle at Fermoy which subsequently realised over £700 at Belfast, and whether he will direct sheriffs in future to offer live stock at public sales in lots not exceeding six beasts in one lot in order to ensure that excessive losses will not be inflicted on the owners of the property offered for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both parts of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  As regards the last part of the question, however, I may say that I have no doubt that, if appropriate representations are made in the matter to under-sheriffs at a proper time and in a proper way, such representations will receive reasonable and fair consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, he states that if reasonable representations are made to the sheriff he will agree to do what is asked in the question.  Representations have been made from time to time to the sheriff, or to whomever is <Col N="911" /> in charge, to have these cattle put up in reasonable lots, and these representations have not been acceded to. The answer that they have given to such representations has been to the effect that they have received instructions to do otherwise, and in some places they have put up as many as 100 cattle together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state (a) how many seizures have been made in Cork County on foot of decrees for unpaid annuities during the past six months; (b) the number of horses, cattle, sheep, pigs and motor cars seized in that time; (c) the total amount realised at the sales; and (d) the total costs incurred in connection with those seizures and sales.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer which I gave yesterday to Deputy Burke in reply to a similar question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present yesterday when the Minister for Justice answered Deputy Burke's question. Surely somebody ought to be responsible for giving this information, but, as I understand it, nobody is responsible. People cannot get information about the amounts realised at these sales or of the total costs incurred. Surely somebody is responsible, and information should be given to members of the House as to the costs incurred and the amounts realised at these sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, I understand, is that the Minister is responsible for the making of the regulations and the notices to be issued <Col N="912" /> before a seizure is made, but that from the time a seizure is made the undersheriff is altogether responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of the information asked for by the Deputy would require an examination of all requests made by my Department to the Revenue Commissioners for the issue of licences for the importation of dutiable articles free of duty and would involve an expenditure of time and labour which would not be justified by the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is a question that he himself invited me to put down with the view to eliciting this information?  Am I to understand now that, having conceded that he was quite prepared for the fullest publicity in regard to all these licensing transactions, he now runs away from the undertaking which he <Col N="913" /> gave and of which he made so much capital on the Vote for his Department?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to perpetuate the veil of secrecy which has covered these transactions in connection with the issuing of licences and the discrimination between one citizen and another which is at present going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation is that discrimination is being made between citizens in regard to the granting of licences to import goods free of import duty.  The Minister challenged me to put down a question and ask him for a full record of all licensing transactions, the answer to which he said, would clear him of any suggestion of incompetence or impartiality.  I have now put down a question and he runs away from his undertaking.  I now ask the Minister, arising out of his reply, if there is any means whereby Deputies can ascertain who got these licences and to what extent discrimination has been used in the granting of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ties in question were rejected as being unsaleable goods by the marketing organisation.  Some were the product <Col N="916" /> of defective poplin made at Annagry; others were made from cotton material purchased for the learners at the outset of the tie-making experiment.  The ties themselves were badly made, and in some cases had been ripped up and remade. When the offer of 2/- per dozen was received in October, 1934, it was submitted to the then Secretary of the Department who, with a full knowledge of the position, approved the acceptance of the offer as a means of realising some small amount on stock regarded as waste.  It would be contrary to Departmental practice to disclose the name of the purchaser.</P>

If that is so, will the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Minister, whom he now represents, to come before this House and withdraw the suggestion he made here, that good poplin ties manufactured at Annagry had had to be sold at 2/- per dozen?  From the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to my question, it now emerges that there was no truth whatever in that allegation.</P>

      <P>I am not going beyond that.  That was the complaint we had. We hear Deputies on the opposite benches wailing day after day, and month after month, and the Order Paper is piled up with motions complaining of the position of the farmers while, at the same time, we find these Deputies coming here with complaints, wails and means about every proposition that is brought in to benefit the farming community, or to give them a fair price for their produce.  We were on the opposite benches for six or seven years, and we had to listen to the cry that wheat could not be grown by our farmers; that the climate would not let it grow.  That was what the ex-Minister for Agriculture said when he was asked about the matter.  He said the climate would not let wheat grow here, that it was lunacy to think otherwise, yet 200,000 acres of wheat have been grown this year.  I agree with Deputy Belton that the minimum price for the wheat is hardly enough.</P>

      <P>No.  The price will leave a fair margin of profit, and it is guaranteed to the farmers.  It has increased the acreage from 26,000, when we came into office, to 200,000 acres.  It represents £2,000,000 in the farmers' pockets for a market that can be controlled at home.  Deputy Dillon in a regular outburst yesterday said that he would not grow wheat and would not grow beet.  He need not. I agree that the Deputy has a better opening.  He can draw a fiver or a £10 note for looking at a brief for a few minutes.  That pays a lot better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy have some consideration for farmers, who are depending on farming for a livelihood. <Col N="921" /> We have heard any amount of these complaints.  Lo and behold!  we had farmers getting up and complaining about unfortunate consumers who would have to pay more for bread, while three weeks ago we had Deputy Bennett, with his tongue in his cheek, complaining about the price to be fixed for butter.  In the Deputy's opinion it was no harm to charge 1/5 per lb. for butter for the benefit of his constituency, but it was a terrible thing to charge consumers for the wheat that was grown.  The sooner Deputies opposite stop pulling Johnny-both-ways the better.  For nine or ten years tillage farmers who grew wheat paid through the nose for wheat-growing land.  They paid on their valuations four or five times more than what was paid in cattle-raising districts.  They paid more for wheat-growing land on their valuations and rates.  At that time we had a Government here that told the farmers they could grow wheat if they liked at the world market price. That price was £6 a ton in 1926.  I know farmers who grew wheat every year, and who on 11 acres had 25 cwt. to the acre, which had to be sold at £6 a ton.  It was admitted that it was good millable wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Cosgrave and the ex-Minister for Agriculture were in office they did not tell the farmers that they need not pay any more rates because their land was valued as wheat-growing land, and did not tell them that they would provide a market for them.  The farmers grew the wheat and on their valuations paid 25/-, 30/- and 35/- an acre, even though the policy of the Government at that time was definitely killing any hope of making the growing of wheat profitable. When this Government came along they fixed a minimum price at which wheat could be grown.  As a result the acreage has been increased and the farmers have been guaranteed a price.  Despite that we have Deputy Dillon getting up and complaining that it was a terrible thing for these ruffians of farmers to go in and spoil lovely green soil; to care to go into the ranches and to turn up grand bullock land and sow wheat there.  For these terrible ruffians to do that is an <Col N="922" /> awful thing but, what about the poor of the country whom lawyers charge a fee of £25?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take all classes of consumers about which Deputy Dillon complains in this particular case.  I take it that lawyers are bread consumers and cannot get enough of it. However, coming to that point, Deputy Dillon's complaint is that those people, because they tilled the land and because they produced crops on the land, are not to get the cost of production plus a little profit that is guaranteed by the Government here. That is Deputy Dillon's complaint. The people are wiser now, however. The people, whom Deputy Dillon's organisation advised not to grow wheat and the people whom his organisation in Cork county advised last year not to grow beet, have paid for taking that advice in the meantime.  They have become good boys this year, however; they have learned their lesson and are growing wheat and beet and they are being guaranteed a minimum price for that wheat in this Bill.  I cannot see what argument Deputy Dillon can produce against that.  We have the same arguments in regard to everything, but I suggest that Deputies cannot blow hot and cold in this manner.  They cannot come here complaining that the Government is ruining the farmers and then, when a Bill is brought in here guaranteeing a minimum price, we cannot have them standing up here and complaining against that price on the ground that it is unfair to the consumer and so on.  The man who grows wheat in this country is as much entitled to that minimum price as any industrialist in this country is to the minimum price that he can extract for his produce.  It is the very self-same thing, and I hope to see established in this country a minimum price for everything that can be produced here: a minimum price covering the cost of production plus some profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Until that is done, the agricultural labourer, about whom Deputy Dillon was complaining and bewailing here last night, will be brought still lower by Deputy Dillon's endeavouring to lower the price of wheat.  I hold that nine-tenths of the agricultural labourers in this country, about whom Deputy Dillon was talking last night, are far more competent in their work than any of the hoodoo professors and lawyers such as we have here.  It takes a farmer a longer time to learn his job.  The farming community are far more competent and deserve more of the community in general than three-fourths of those who talk here about the conditions of the farmers.  We hear a lot of talk about them on these lines, but when we see individuals getting up here, having made their own position secure through federations of teachers, federations of lawyers, and federations of every other profession, and talking about the condition of the farming community, we may be pardoned for doubting their sincerity.  I am sorry that Deputy Bennett is not here.  If he were here I would give him a little bit of advice, because he needs it in this particular connection. As I was saying, when we see this kind of thing carried on here, we do not believe in its sincerity.</P>
    <P>A farmer is entitled to the cost of production, plus a profit, for every article he can produce here and, so far as we can, we will see that he gets it. I do not wish to delay the debate, but I could not sit here and listen to the kind of talk going on here from Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon without entering that protest against them.  They come in here day after day and week after week complaining about the position of the farmers and, at the same time, come in here deliberately to endeavour to kill any hope the farmer has of getting an alternative market or any hope of getting his own market here at home enlarged for him and preserved for him.  When one listens to that kind of thing, one wonders at the sincerity of those Deputies opposite who complain about the condition of the farmers.  What was the position?  We <Col N="924" /> had enormous ranches in Canada and in America sending in wheat here from all over the world.</P>

      <P>There is one point that I should like to dwell on here, and that is in reference to a complaint that was made here yesterday in regard to the abolition, as they called it, of the subsidy for wheat.  I am one of those who always protested against that bounty on wheat.  I protested for several reasons.  One is that I do not believe in making the farmer a kind of &ldquo;souper,&rdquo; if you like, in that particular line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am sure that when a lawyer has a job he does not wait for six months for his money.  It is cash on the nail so far as he is concerned. Evidently Deputy Dillon regrets the fact that the farmer is not <Col N="925" /> prepared to wait from September, when he sells his wheat, until the following January or February, when he only gets half of his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Corry does not want to make &ldquo;soupers&rdquo; of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The lawyer takes care to get his money in advance.  However, to return to this particular matter, I always protested against that method because I consider that the farmer is entitled to get his cost of production plus a profit, and I consider that there should be no such thing as a bounty or subsidy hanging on to it any more than it should be hanging on to the manufacturer of boots or hanging on to the cost of the manufacture of artificial manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You voted against giving it to the pig producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon knows nothing about it any more than he knows anything about anything under the sun.  He is a jack of all trades and master of none.  That is why I would emphatically protest against any attempt to continue subsidies.  I consider that the miller should pay the price, cost of production plus subsidy, and that the consumer should be equally prepared to pay it.  And there should be no noise about it, any more than the farmer has a right to protest against the price of artificial manures or the price of home-produced farm machinery or anything else.  We are entitled to the same rights as the industrialists and we should get them. We regard it as a right, and any self-respecting farmer looks upon it as a right.  I am sure that, when Bills were brought in here for protecting industries, we did not see any indication that the actual cost of, say, a boot or a shoe would be 9/6 and that the buyer of the article would be charged the 9/6 and the State pay a bounty to the boot manufacturer of the extra 5/- or 6/- as the case may be.  There has been too much of this thing attached to farmers, and this is one direct attempt to end it and to end it once and for all.  I hope that, despite <Col N="926" /> Deputy Dillon's fears and dreads in regard to the wheat question, that we will see a better price for wheat.  I hope to see Deputy Dillon and all the other drones like him in this country paying it.  It is about time they paid their share of something.  That, however, is beside the question.  I am glad to see Deputy Bennett arriving now. He came in here three weeks ago, with his tongue in his cheek, and departed from the fold by catching a hold of the tail of my coat and following me into the Lobby to vote for compelling these people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have already convinced Deputy Minch, I think, who became converted yesterday to the true fold in relation to this matter.  I succeeded in converting Deputy Bennett in relation to butter and, after all, as a farmer, even if he is only a kind of a farmer, he should have the interests of the agricultural community at heart. I should like to appeal to him, as representing a rural constituency and representing farmers here, because some number of the deluded farmers voted for him, to stand in with the rest of the farmers in this country and just as the rest of the farmers and the farmers' representatives here succeeded in getting him a price for his butter which he approved of, because he voted for the Bill, he should help the tillage farmers of this country who work with their hands, with their brains and with the plough to get at least the cost of production for their wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He should help to do that by voting with us instead of talking about the unfortunate consumer for whom he has all sympathy to-day in the matter of bread, but for whom he had no sympathy last week in their having to pay 1/5 for butter.  He did not care a hang if they never got bread so long as they buttered it, but you cannot use <Col N="927" /> the butter without the bread or the bread without the butter.

      <P>The whole world is not contained in that little constituency of Co. Limerick, or in that portion of it that is dairying.  We have got into a large portion of Limerick with the plough, and there are many good fields of wheat grown in the county, as I saw last week.  I must congratulate the Limerick farmers on becoming converted so quickly.  We saw a lot of good wheat grown there and Deputy Bennett should remember that these are constituents of his who are growing wheat and he should give them a hand in securing a fair price.  He should not come in here to talk about the unfortunate consumers whom he compelled to buy butter at 1/5 last week.  If he had no sympathy for them last week, he cannot have so much sympathy for them now.  These consumers whom he talks about are the gentlemen who work in factories and for whom we are providing work in factories and whom the farmers are paying a little extra in the price of artificial manures, farm machinery and other things of that description in order to keep them in those factories.  I am sure that the gentlemen who produce the farm machinery and the artificial manures will not sell them under the cost of production, but we do not hear any wail about the farmers who have to buy the machinery and the artificial manures.  I think that those for whom we found employment in the manufacture of these articles ought to have no complaint whatever about paying a little extra for their bread in order that we may be able to keep the farmers going as well.  I suggest that you advise all your farmers to grow more wheat.  They will grow it whether you like it or not and you <Col N="928" /> might as well be in the swim.  Give them advice; coax them along; and show them good example by voting for this.  After all, a £2,000,000 market for the farmers is just as important as the butter market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did and not one on the Government side, including the Minister, discussed it.  They discussed everything else except the section or this Bill or how it effects a change.  Not one of them discussed the change that this Bill effects.  They discussed everything else except that. We have listened to Deputy Corry who did bring in two arguments, with which I will deal in a moment, that referred to the section.  I admit that in that he is differentiated from the other members who have spoken in favour of the section because he did, in these two arguments, drop into referring to the section we are discussing. What we are discussing is a certain change which this section brings about in the present system. Speaking on this last night, I was very careful to confine myself exclusively to what this section purports to do or&mdash; shall I put it a little more correctly&mdash; enables the Minister to do because the one thing it does not do is to give him, in addition to any power he has at present, any additional power to give a fair price to the farmers.  He has that power at present.  There is nothing at all in the legislation, as it stands under the present system of financing wheat, that precludes the Minister from giving any price he likes for the wheat higher than the 23/6 and higher even than 30/- if he wishes to do so.  That is his power at present and the present section does not add one iota to that power.  Therefore, so far as this Bill and this section are concerned, the question as to whether or not the farmers ought to get fair prices simply does not arise. That power is there at the present moment, and the present section does not give any additional power to the Minister in that respect.  Everybody will agree that if the farmers are induced, by the Government policy, to grow wheat, they should get a fair and economic price for it.  So far as the actual price mentioned in the Schedule to which this section refers is concerned, we do not think that price is an economic one, and we never thought it economic in this respect, but I suggest that that is irrelevant to the <Col N="930" /> merits of the present section.  What does the present section purport to do?  I admit&mdash;it is a purely debating point on the part of the Minister, as he acknowledged himself&mdash;that it does not take away the power of still granting the bounty.  What it does is a different thing.  It enables the Minister to get out of that obligation of granting a bounty from the taxes, and enables him to put indirectly on to the price of bread the figure that is necessary to reach even the appearance of an economic price for the farmer.  That is what it does.  This Bill or this section does not add an extra halfpenny or even an extra farthing to the price that the farmer can get for his wheat.</P>

It is one of the few relevant remarks from that side of the House, and, therefore, I will deal with it.  The Deputy will remember one of the principal advantages which the Minister claimed for this particular Bill.  This is the operative section so far as that is concerned; it is, therefore, perfectly relevant here, and the Deputy's interruption was relevant&mdash; not to my argument at the moment but to the general section.  One of the principal advantages claimed by the Minister is that he will now immediately give the full price to the farmer. That is the point which the Deputy is making, is it not?</P>

      <P>I am not saying what the Minister would do; he may have other reasons.  I am dealing with this particular argument at the present moment, namely, that without this method of putting a charge on bread, the price could be immediately paid to the farmer.  I gathered that from column 507 of last week's Official Debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not legislate? My whole point is that, so far as the main advantage of this Bill is concerned, there was no necessity to tax the bread of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is the question I am discussing.  I think that what I said last night along these lines was perfectly relevant to the section, <Col N="932" /> and if the Minister would listen he would know that that is the main question in which I am interested in regard to this particular section, and it is this section we are discussing.  I kept away from anything which was in the slightest way irrelevant.  Therefore, the main advantage of this Bill to the farmer, on the confession of the Minister on the Second Reading and repeated just now, could be got&mdash; under legislation if necessary&mdash;without taxing the bread of the people in the way in which this Bill taxes it.  That is the point I want to make in answer to Deputy Victory.  It is giving the Minister this substitute power; he made it quite clear that he intends to use it, and that so far as he was concerned, at all events, the policy of helping wheat that was in force up to the present is dead.  Theoretically, that power&mdash;to help by subsidy&mdash;still exists, but the power which the Minister intends to use is the power that he has under this particular section. That, as I say, is an amending Bill.  It does not at all deal with the question as to whether wheat growing is a proper economic proposition for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask you, Sir, to restrain the Deputy.  It is impossible, both when he is making a speech and when he is &ldquo;silent,&rdquo; to follow a serious train of argument. The farmer is not likely to get, and will not get, a halfpenny more under this system than he would get otherwise. All that is necessary to help the farmer could be done without doing what the Minister and the Government <Col N="933" /> propose to do now&mdash;namely, tax the bread of the people.</P>
      <P>I think it would have been a much straighter proposition, and the country would have known definitely where it was, if the Minister for Finance had come in and openly and plainly put a tax on bread.  The Deputy grins at that; he does not like it.  I quite agree with him.  He would grin a lot if they did it, in the same way as he did not like some of the other taxes which they put on.  You are concealing this tax, and you object to putting it on openly. That is what I object to in this Bill; you are putting a tax on the bread of the people and trying to hide it.  The Minister last night seemed to object to its being called a tax, but it is pure indulgence in subtlety to think that you are doing anything else.  It would have been much straighter and more above-board if the Minister for Finance came into this House and said, &ldquo;The Government in the present year requires £350,000,&rdquo; or whatever the sum is, &ldquo;in order to help wheat growing; we will put a tax on bread for that.&rdquo;  That is what you are doing under this Bill.  When I made that statement last night it was applauded by Deputy Donnelly.  When I said that the tax on bread would ultimately mean, according to the Minister, £1,500,000 per annum, and that it probably would amount to more according to the other figures given by the Minister, I again got &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from Deputy Donnelly.  Let it be quite clearly understood that this is a tax on bread.  Just as you have a tax on tea and sugar in order to carry on the necessary Departments of the State, and in order to carry on what the Government claim are social services, here is a thing which, according to your policy, you consider necessary to carry on.  It would have been much clearer to the people, and a much straighter course, openly to put a tax on bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister objected last night to the phrase &ldquo;concealed taxes&rdquo; and pretended that there is no concealment about it.  The objection displayed a short time ago on the opposite benches, when I mentioned this tax on bread, <Col N="934" /> shows that there is a desire to conceal the real purpose of the section.  The real purpose of the section is to enable the Government to get out of doing the unpopular thing, and to enable them to put a tax on bread while pretending they are not doing it.  That is what the Government is doing.  The Minister who objected to the phrase &ldquo;concealed taxes,&rdquo; then began to discuss the suggestions from this side that if this had to be done it ought to be done out of revenue.  &ldquo;Imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all those things done out of revenue, until finally there would be £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 put on.&rdquo;  I think that is the figure which the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>I will not take responsibility for that, but I think £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 is the sum he mentioned as being put on in that way.  So far as the people of this country are concerned, they are paying it either in the amount they are paying for their bread or will pay for the bread after this legislation is enacted, or through whatever system of taxes is put on to meet the charges. You may call it a levy or a tax, but the unfortunate individual in this country pays it.  Yet the Minister was aghast that it should be paid out of revenue&mdash;it would be too open.</P>
    <P>I suggest the only thing that arises for serious consideration here is whether the bread is a proper article to tax in order to help wheat growing. That is the only point at issue.  So far as this section indicates a change in the existing position, it has as one of its advantages the quicker payment of the farmer.  Deputy Corry has been accused of many things in this House, but subtlety is not one of the things that I have heard very often thrown at him.  Well, I can do it to-day. According to him it is wrong for the farmer to receive a subsidy, but because he carried out the national policy it is no harm for him to get the same money indirectly through a tax on bread.  That is a piece of subtlety that is beyond me.  In the one case it is souperism&mdash;that is the phrase he used.</P>
    <P>The farmer is certainly entitled if <Col N="935" /> he grows wheat, especially at the instigation of the Government, to get a fair economic price for it.  There is no disputing that.  There has always been a difference of opinion as to what the proper price was.  The Minister taunted us last night that we did insist a couple of years ago on a higher price as being an economic price. Therefore, when we repeat to-day that if the farmer must grow wheat he must get a proper economic price, there is no change of attitude there.</P>
    <P>But that is not the issue that is before us at the present moment.  The issue is whether this is the proper method of doing it; in other words, whether bread is the proper article to tax in order to subsidise wheat.  I hold that is the whole issue at stake in this particular section.  It is not a question of the economic price for the farmer or the value of wheat growing. That has got nothing to do with the main purpose of the Bill, of which this is one of the most crucial sections. The real question is the concealed tax on bread and that is our principal objection to this section.  We feel that the thing could be done in a way that would not be open to that objection. I can imagine many things being taxed, but I think the taxing of bread is the lowest level to which the Government has fallen in its efforts to get money to help its policy.  I think I have indicated clearly the grounds of our objection to this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the point Deputy O'Sullivan has put up and to make a personal explanation. I did not allude to the subsidy as souperism.  The Deputy said that I called it souperism.  I called all subsidies souperism.  That is just a point of personal explanation in regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's allegation.  No amount of argument from Deputy O'Sullivan is going to fool the ordinary farmer.  The Deputy's attitude from 1923 to 1932 was that the farmer who grows wheat must sell it at the world price and is not entitled to an economic price.  When tariffs on industrial products were introduced, we had no <Col N="936" /> suggestion from Deputies opposite that that matter should be dealt with by subsidies.  In the case of artificial manures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would back it up again in the morning and I would back up anything that gives employment here. We are not going to have Deputy O'Sullivan blowing hot and cold, saying at one moment that the farmers are badly off and in the next moment, when the farmer is getting the cost of production for his produce, saying it means a tax on bread.  The farmer is entitled to the home market for everything he can produce.  He is entitled to the cost of production.  Deputy O'Sullivan protests against that farmer getting the cost of production directly.  Under the subsidy system the farmer was paid in September a portion of the money for the wheat. If he was lucky, the following January or February he got the other quarter and perhaps in many cases he had to wait for it until May or June.  This Bill fixes the price that the miller must pay directly for the wheat.  It abolishes the subsidy system and I am glad to see the subsidy system abolished, even in wheat.  The farmer should get the cost of production in his home market without any bounty or subsidy or anything else to keep it up.  The sooner we get out of that, the sooner we will get away from the sneers of Deputy Dillon and the rest of them that we are pauperising and souperising the farmers.  That is what Deputy Dillon has called this system that the Minister is now abolishing.  This bounty is a souperising thing&mdash;that is Deputy Dillon's argument always&mdash;but we are now getting away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeing that the cost of production of wheat is going to be paid direct by the consumer.  In my opinion, we, the farmers, are entitled to the cost of production for all that we can produce on our land.  We are entitled to be paid that by the consumer.  It is just as well to be straight on that matter.  We might equally well say that it is very wrong for the teacher to expect a salary for, after all, he is only imparting learning to the young children and he should not charge for <Col N="937" /> that.  We are as equally entitled to payment for what we produce.  It is all very well for the Deputy to say that the farmer should not get his cost of production for his wheat, but we will see that the farmer will get his cost of production.  I am glad that under the subsidy system we have increased the production of wheat from 26,000 acres to 200,000 acres.  We have provided the farmers with a market worth £2,000,000 to them and no argument can change that.  A few years ago we had 26,000 acres of wheat grown at £6 a ton but we are going to have 200,000 acres at 23/6 a sack&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I just wanted to get this point&mdash;what we are doing in this particular section is to abolish the subsidy and to see that the farmer will get the full price of his wheat direct when he sells it, and let the consumer pay.  We have no apology to offer for making the consumer pay the cost of production to the farmer for his wheat any more than we have sympathy for asking anybody else to pay the cost of production.  The farmer is entitled to the cost of production and the sooner that gets home to the minds of the professional people in the country the sooner we will get down to bedrock.</P>

I am going to do it anyway, and I am going to give my vote on my economic opinion and on my outlook on wheat growing on this section.  Perhaps the section is not the very section I would frame if I had authority for doing it but it approximates nearer than anything else I have seen or that has been suggested.  Consequently, I will vote for it as the best way out.</P>
      <P>Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan has been hammering home that this is a tax on bread.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is only paying an economic price for a necessary article of human consumption. I noticed that statements were made yesterday that it was giving a subsidy to wheat land and the question was asked what was it doing for mountain land.  When one takes an acre of wheat land away from the cattle grazing one increases the economic value of the land left.  That is sticking out.  I cannot term the opposition to this section as anything beyond this&mdash;retaining for the wheat dumpers of the world this country as a free dumping ground for the surplus wheat on hands and the carry overs of the wheat-exporting countries of the world.  The price purported to be fixed by this section will be around 23/- or 24/- per barrel.  Before the wheat position became acute; before over-production began to show its effects in 1926 or 1927 the price of wheat was 11.06s. per cwt.  That would be about 27/- to 28/- a barrel.  I take it that that was an economic price, that is 2/- or 3/- higher than the price proposed to be fixed by this section. Now, if you had not dumping, the people of this country would have to pay more for their bread than they will have to pay if this section becomes operative.  What is the objection to that?  I am quoting from the <i>Economist</i> of the 8th of the present month:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Since long before even the world economic conference in London in 1933, the world's agricultural representatives have demanded measures to raise the price of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the article goes on and talks about other matters.  The world is trying to raise the price of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> There are three things operating in the matter of wheat.  Amongst the wheat-consuming countries there is less consumption in the last ten or 12 years.  New areas, the open spaces of the world, are being developed for wheat production and new countries have developed agricultural nationalism.  The importing wheat-countries of the world in 1926 produced 999,000,000 bushels of wheat.  In 1928, they produced 1,102,000,000 bushels of wheat; in 1932-33, 1,358,000,000 bushels; in 1933-34, 1,440,000,000 bushels and in 1934-35, 1,350,000,000 bushels, while the exporting countries were shrinking.  The exporting countries have now 310,000,000 bushels of wheat on hands&mdash;surplus stock, and they would have more than that only for the drought of last year.  They are looking for a dump for that wheat. Voting against this section is giving them the dump for that.  It is not a question of voting for a tax on bread. It would take too long to elaborate in the course of a debate on the section all this material.  Deputy Dillon said yesterday that he is going to let himself go on the Agriculture Estimate. If he leaves himself go on the wheat estimate, I hope I will be here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave expression to these sentiments and opinions on the Second Reading, and I am prepared to debate them now with any Deputy, or any man in Ireland, in this House or outside it.  The proposal in this section, as I see and understand it, is to pay an economic price for wheat to produce flour.  There is no use going into fantastic figures.  The most we will produce will be about 25 per cent. of our requirements.  I would say, as a rough shot, that amongst the wheat-growing countries that would be a small percentage of their requirements, but no wheat-growing country or European country is growing less at the present time, perhaps with the exception of England.  If it is good economics for European countries and for Canada, the Argentine, New Zealand and Australia to grow their own wheat, and see that their citizens pay an economic price for that wheat, what is wrong with our doing the same? The alternative is: &ldquo;Do not grow wheat at all.&rdquo;  Surely in opposing this section it cannot be the intention of any member of this House to want to offer an uneconomic price for wheat. I do not think that Deputy Dillon or Deputy O'Leary or any other Deputy is animated by such a sentiment as that.  But before we reached this section we were committed to the growing of wheat, and unless we are to go back to what we did before, we have no option except to vote for an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the subsidy was souperism.  That was afterwards more or less withdrawn. But I have no hesitation in saying that it is souperism&mdash;a price for producing an article that is uneconomic.  If I were growing wheat I would rather have this arrangement than any subsidy. If growing for a market at <Col N="941" /> home, saturation would not be reached unless we have 700,000 or 800,000 acres. The question was put yesterday: what are we going to do with the surplus? That will look after itself.  When we get to the stage that we are growing a surplus the laws of supply and demand will regulate matters.  If 100,000 acres is enough and we grow 150,000 there will be contraction in price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning I quoted from a statement of mine made at an agricultural conference held in 1928.  I then advocated the growing of wheat that would give us a percentage of home-grown wheat, and I put that as high as 15 per cent., but the percentage will settle itself.  The Minister will find if he examines the statistics of the average yield he can estimate what the percentage of the total requirements of home-grown produce would fill the bill and he can fix his percentage in advance.  If the percentage be 15, and if the Minister made an Order that there must be 15 per cent. of Irish wheat in the flour turned out here, the farmers can compete for that 15 per cent.  There would be machinery available to see that the miller used not less than 15 per cent. of Irish wheat while the Order ran, and that would automatically fix the price.  If I had authority I would fix no price.  I would fix the percentage, and I would let the farmers compete. Then there would be no souperism.  At the present time a farmer cannot wear a new suit of clothes but his neighbours will tell him that he got it from the State in the nature of subsidies. Give the people a chance so that a man can wear his new suit without being taunted with souperism and the dole. I think that would be a distinct advance on the policy of subsidy which is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole policy of growing wheat is to protect this market, and to give agricultural producers a chance, and to protect this country from being a dumping-ground for the produce of the ranching countries.  It is not a tax on bread&mdash;nothing of the kind.  The <Col N="942" /> price offered here is not up to the cost of production.  I threw out a challenge yesterday on this matter.  I feel very sensitive in connection with this whole thing, because I represent a city constituency in this Dáil and a working class area in the Corporation.  I do not want to be taunted with taxing the bread of the people.  If that taunt is thrown at me I shall be well able to defend myself.  This is a <i>quid pro quo.</i> The farmer is buying his boots and clothes and farm machinery produced by city workers, and he has to pay a higher price for that particular produce. Where is the injustice, then, in asking the city worker to pay more for the farmer's produce?</P>

In order to carry out what seems to the Deputy a highly desirable reform in economic policy, money must be got from somewhere, either from the taxpayer, the farmer or somebody else.  The Deputy says the farmer must get an economic price, and I agree.  Then in order to pay that economic price we must produce the money from somewhere.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all, but it is going to come from the consumers of <Col N="945" /> bread.  My point, and the point made by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, is that if you are going to raise money for purposes which apparently have been deemed proper by the elected Parliament of the people, you must make up your mind as to what section of the community you are going to take that money from.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan and I say that if the people desire this agricultural policy, it should be financed out of the Exchequer and the general burden of taxation apportioned as Dáil Eireann shall see fit.  The Minister for Agriculture apparently sees that the people would not stand for the taxation necessary to finance this policy.  We must, therefore, conceal it by putting it into the price of bread and by turning the baker and the miller into tax-gatherers. We say that, by doing that, you are restricting the impact of this taxation to the poorest section of the community, because the poorer a person is, the larger bread bulks in his daily ration.  The richer a man is, the further away he is from the borderline of destitution, the less bread you find on his table.</P>
      <P>I was proceeding up towards Temple Street, a couple of days ago, and I found myself walking beside a child going home to a tenement room in Temple Street with an oilcloth bag in his hand.  We got into a chat and in the course of the conversation I asked him what he had in the bag.  He said he had four 2-lb. loaves which he was bringing home to his mother, brothers and sisters to eat in their tenement room.  It occurred to me that we were engaged in the pious purpose of exacting from that tenement family a tax of approximately 4d.&mdash;at least 4d.&mdash;on the contents of that bag.  Those are the facts and you cannot get away from them.  I am sure that many Fianna Fáil Deputies feel just as uncomfortable as I do about it.  It is shocking that we should turn to these people, who are put to the pin of their collar to keep body and soul together, and ask them to contribute to the public purse, to the Exchequer.  It is that which makes a bread tax so nauseating to responsible men in this country and every country in the world.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the rate for agricultural wages in Great Britain is 20/- per week, all found, and 33/- per week with free housing accommodation, the labouring man purchasing his own food.  At 23/6 per barrel the agricultural labourer is to be paid 21/-.  So far as my knowledge of the farmers of that part of the country goes, they have never been slave-drivers. They have always paid what they could pay.  What I am warning the House of is that once you get well away on the wheat-growing experiment, the labourers producing this crop are going to become, indirectly, employees of the Government, because the Government, by fixing a minimum price for wheat, is going to control their wages.  No Government and no Oireachtas in the world could stand for a weekly wage of 21/- for a married agricultural labourer with a family. Sooner or later this House is going to be forced to compel every Minister to insist that at least a minimum wage of 30/- will be paid to every common labourer working under the Board of Works or any other Government Department. When that stage is reached naturally an irresistible case will be made for compelling the farmers, who are to receive this minimum price, to pay their agricultural labourers 30/- per week.  When you arrive at that stage it is not 4d. that you will levy on the bag of bread that the child carries home to the tenement family, but 8d. or 10d. upon it.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows it is not.  Every social worker you meet, every student of social subjects will tell you that the lower the social standard of the people falls, the greater the consumption of bread throughout the State.  The lower a man's economic position becomes, the larger does bread bulk in his daily diet; the further removed he is from want, the less bread features in his daily diet.  I think even Deputy Mrs. Concannon will agree with me on that.  Deputy Mrs. Concannon, with the winning naïveté which is no small part of her irresistible charm, admitted yesterday that the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party was that you would go on raising the price of wheat and contemporaneously raising the price of bread to finance it until the glorious time would come that you would raise the price of wheat so high that there will be a surplus of wheat, and then we would provide free bread for everybody and finance the higher price of wheat out of the 2d. we get from the bread.  That is the kind of outlook that there is on those benches. Deputy Belton here to-day says it has been argued that if we raise the price of wheat sufficiently high the day will come when there will be a surplus. Let that day, he says, take care of itself.</P>

But we hear Deputy Belton rumbling already.  He says that is not an economic price.  As I pointed out last night in the House. Deputy Belton when contesting the next election will contest it on the price of wheat.  He will go out as the candidate standing for an additional price for wheat.  He will be the candidate standing for a fair price for wheat. Somebody will say: &ldquo;What is that fair price to be?&rdquo;  Deputy Belton will say &ldquo;30/-.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Donnelly will go up to Upper Mount Street and say: &ldquo;Deputy Belton is rampaging in North Dublin for a price of 30/- for wheat; that means ruin if we do not face it.&rdquo; A very solemn meeting will be held, and the President will convince himself that the public interest demands that he should remain as President and that the price of wheat should be 35/- a barrel. Deputy Donnelly will be sent out then to proclaim that the price of wheat is to be 35/- per barrel.  No doubt the Labour Party will then take the hustings and declare that they stand for the rights of the working man, and that 40/- per barrel is the smallest sum that will yield a decent living wage to the agricultural community.</P>

If you raise the price of wheat sufficiently high the whole country will grow wheat, and then the time will come when there will be a surplus of wheat, and that surplus will have to be disposed of somehow.</P>

      <P>The Chair will not permit a discussion now as to the desirability of growing wheat at all.  I have often described the whole thing as a fraudulent swindle, but I will not elaborate that now.  I look forward to the Vote for Agriculture to explain its fraudulency and its swindle character. I am only discussing now what the section permits me to discuss, and that is what the burden of this is going to be, and where the burden is going to fall.  I object to it even in its present form, on account of its incidence on the poorer section of the community.  I warn the House that if they submit to a system of raising this money such as is adumbrated here that, great as is the burden now on the poorer section of the community, it will be infinitely greater as political pressure is brought to bear on the Minister to boost up the price of wheat, just as we heard from Deputy Belton and Deputy Corry. The wind is already beginning to blow, and that is why I am trying to warn Deputies of what they are walking into. When they walk into it, and commit themselves to it, it will be too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No political Party in the country will resist the pressure of the people who are growing wheat.  There will be so many growing wheat at an inflated price that the unfortunate consumer will be exploited to the last degree. Eventually you will have, as in France, some extreme political crisis, and a joint Government will say: &ldquo;To blazes with this whole experiment; whether you like it or not the price of wheat has to come down,&rdquo; and in the process of arriving at that stage inestimable damage will have been done, oceans of money lost which could be profitably <Col N="950" /> employed, and the poorer section of the community are going to suffer.  I should like to make a last despairing attempt to awake members of the Fianna Fáil Party to the criminal folly of what they are doing.  The object of providing an economic price for wheat is, of course, to enable the farmer to get the most he can out of his land. We are fixing the price at 23/6 and we say: &ldquo;To grow wheat at that price you will get the best yield out of the land that a man can reasonably expect to get.&rdquo;  Suppose you have two varieties of wheat, and one variety will give you 20 barrels per statute acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  A ton to the statute acre was the figure mentioned by the Minister as the average yield last year.  Take another variety which will give 25 cwts. to the statute acre, if such a variety were in existence. Surely Deputy Belton and the Minister will advise the farmers to grow the 25 cwt. variety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sensible.  It is said that a price of 23/6 will give a fair return.  I would say to them: &ldquo;Grow a variety of other crops, which I do not want to particularise; feed them to live stock, and then, with the money you get for that produce of the soil, buy 25 cwt. of wheat, and after you have bought it you will have a £5 note left.&rdquo;  Is not that a better way?  Will not farmers get more out of the land in that way than if they simply grow a crop which will only give 25 cwt. of wheat?  I am asking them to grow a crop which will not only produce out of every statute acre 25 cwt. of wheat but, over and above that, a comfortable sum of money in hand with which to buy boots, shoes and clothes from Irish factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I adumbrate is a far more important element than the actual element of yield, because the moment a farmer is making a profit out of a statute acre of land there devolves upon him an absolute obligation to pay a just wage to his labourers.  That ought to be a first charge out of the profit that he makes.  But no farmer making a fair profit out of his land would be justified if he only paid an agricultural wage of 21/- a week.  Until you put the farmers of the country in a position that they are able to earn a profit out of their land, you cannot hope to raise the level of agricultural wages.  That is the real object that we ought to have in mind in fixing an economic price.</P>

      <P>For wheat.  I am not trying to wriggle out of any obligation in regard to order, and I have gone so far only to prove that what is going to happen is, that heavy as the burden is now, and restricted as its incidence is going to be, as time passes the inevitable result of this legislation is going to be that the burden will grow heavier and heavier, and that this House will have virtually no control over it until a critical situation develops.  Even then, it will be extremely difficult for any political Government to control the situation which it will have to face.  The Government will have to resort to some such expedient as was resorted to in France when very grave difficulties and hardships fell on the persons who were growing wheat as a result of the Government's exhortations.  The same results will follow here.  I am not very hopeful of convincing the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but it is right that someone should warn them as to where they are going.  It is right that someone should protest against something which every decent democratic country in the world has resisted heretofore, namely, a tax on bread, and those countries have resisted that because it is the most inequitable, unjust and oppressive tax that any Parliament could enact.</P>

Seemingly, the Deputy cannot discuss any question without bringing his low political mind into it to see what advantage he can get out of any particular point he makes.  He repeated here this afternoon, almost word for word, the speech that he made last night. Surely he did not do that for our benefit because we were not a bit impressed by what he said last night any more than we are now.  The only reason that I can think the Deputy had for repeating last night's speech is that there may be different people in the strangers' gallery to-day.

      <P>Deputy Dillon was not here for the Second Reading of the Bill and the debate on it ran in a <Col N="953" /> more or less non-political way.  The Second Reading was passed without a division because Deputies opposite looked upon this as an economic question, and, with the exception of Deputy Bennett, did not try to make any great political capital out of it. Now we have the position that when Deputy Dillon comes back to the House, with that political mind of his which he cannot escape from, he seeks to make all the capital he can out of this Bill and he divides the House not only on the Money Resolution but on the sections in Committee.  He talks about the tax on bread.  I do not know what is going to become of Deputy Dillon, although I have a fair idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the Deputy to the mercy of the people.  Deputy Dillon talks about the poor little boy going up Upper Temple Street with the four loaves in his hands, and says he will have to pay an extra 4d. because of the legislation we are passing here.  What does the 4d. amount to? Fifteen shillings a sack on flour represents 4d. on four 2 lb. leaves.  Does Deputy Dillon hold that this particular section is going to increase the cost of wheat by that amount?  The Deputy says that we are paying 23/- per barrel for wheat, but that when the price is 30/- the increase in the price of bread will be not 4d. but 8d. or 10d.  Statements of that kind give one an idea of the type of exaggeration that Deputy Dillon indulges in when putting forward his arguments here.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This is a speech pointing out the justice and truth of this.  I never made a claim that this section was going to confer any benefit on the farmer.  Despite what Deputy O'Sullivan may say, I never made the claim that the farmer would get any benefit under this Bill.  The only thing that he will get under it is immediate payment.  When he delivers his wheat he will get his 23/-, whereas at present he gets 17/- at first and 6/- later.  Deputy O'Sullivan spent a lot of time trying to rebut an argument that was supposed to have been used by me, that the farmer was going to get a lot of benefit out of this section. The only claim I made was that the farmer would get immediate payment for his wheat.  That is all that this section proposes to give him.</P>

I never discussed the price of flour with them.  There is about the same amount of truth in what the Deputy has just said as there <Col N="955" /> is in many of the other allegations he makes.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right and we will leave it at that.  As I was saying, the only benefit that the farmer will get under this section is immediate payment for his wheat.  On the question of price, some Deputies say that the farmer is not getting enough and some say that he is&mdash;I do not know. The only way in which that question can be judged in the future is when we discover whether we can get wheat grown at that price.  If we cannot, then I suppose we will have to give more.  There is a consultative council composed of millers, dealers and farmers.  That council has been consulted about the price.  We have got general agreement at that council that this is a good price to offer, at least for the moment, and gives a sufficient profit to the grower.  But, as I have said, that is not going to be the test. The test is going to be: can we get all the wheat that we want grown at that price?  If we cannot, then we will have to give a fuller price.  It is only a matter of opinion.  One Deputy says he should get 30/- and another says he should get 35/-.  None of these opinions is based on any sort of scientific formula. Costings are very difficult in one item of agricultural production. I was told that I objected to this charge being referred to as a concealed tax.  What I object to is the statement that I tried to conceal it as a tax.  I pointed out on Second Reading that the price of Irish-grown wheat would <Col N="956" /> be passed on to the flour miller and the baker and would be borne by the consumer. I pointed out clearly that the consumer would bear the price of Irish-grown wheat in future and that there would be no subsidy out of taxation. I did not try to conceal that. Whether you call it a tax, a subsidy or an economic price for bread does not, I think, matter much.  Whatever you call it, the consumer is going to bear it in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if this Bill is passed, there will be no trouble in having a bounty paid, if necessary, to the flour miller in the future.  It would be paid direct to the flour miller and the farmer would get the full price for his wheat on delivery.  If we were going to continue the subsidy, we would pay it to the flour miller-instead of to the farmer.  But that can be done by a Supplementary Estimate.  No legislation would be necessary.  All any Government would have to do would be to bring in a Supplementary Estimate giving so much a barrel on wheat and the subsidy would be paid out to the flour miller.  It has been suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan that it would be fairer to put a tax on bread and give the subsidy as before.  Let any sensible Deputy examine that proposition. Where would you collect the tax off bread?  Some flour goes to householders and some to bakers.  You would have to take the tax at the flour mill and you would have to give the subsidy at the flour mill.  What would be thought of any Government which would bring in a proposal that a tax be collected from the flour mill, passed through the revenue to me and then to the Minister for Finance and that that money should be passed back to me again and on to the flour millers by way of subsidy?  Every Deputy knows that that procedure would be absolutely ridiculous.  That proposal merely proves what I have already said, that nearly all these arguments have been used for political purposes and for no other reason.  It appears to me extraordinary that Deputies should propose to divide on this section after allowing the Bill through on Second Reading without a division. Not only that, but Deputies divided on <Col N="957" /> the Money Resolution, which is a most unusual thing.  It has hardly ever been known to have a division on a Money Resolution unless the Opposition is out for obstruction.</P>

The quality of the wheat is determined by a certain instrument prescribed by the Minister according to certain regulations laid down.  Who will actually decide the quality?  Is it the miller?  Will there be any check?  Coming to the question of evasion, the Minister may remember that a minimum price was fixed for cattle.  I have heard complaints&mdash;and I have no doubt the Minister has heard them&mdash;that that price was not always realised.  Has he any guarantee that even if he fixes a minimum price the farmer is bound to get that price?  I admit that if the miller does not pay the minimum price he will make himself amenable to penalties.  What will the method be to discover whether there has been evasion?  There is a question of a reasonable price for transport and other things which will undoubtedly open roads to evasion. Perhaps the Minister would clear up these points on this section.</P>

      <P>When the Minister comes to clear up these points&mdash;I understand that complaints have been made&mdash;and I have no doubt made to the Minister &mdash;that a very grave difficulty arises about the condition of wheat as to cleanliness.  Has the Minister considered it practicable to prescribe the maximum percentage of foreign matter that may be in the wheat, in order that it may be millable within the meaning of this legislation?  Does he think it practicable to sample wheat and to ascertain the quantity of foreign matter in it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was correspondence <Col N="960" /> with some millers on that point as to what is &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and &ldquo;merchantable,&rdquo; because these words occur in the definition of millable wheat in the regulations issued.  We have not yet concluded that correspondence because it is not a matter that arises under the Bill but occurs under the regulations. It is extremely difficult to have any rule giving a definition of millable wheat.  No country has been able to do that, as far as I know.  You must use the words &ldquo;merchantable&rdquo; and &ldquo;clean,&rdquo; and these are extremely difficult words to define.  In the end it really comes down to a process of bargaining between the seller and the miller, if the miller says it is not good wheat, and not worth as much as another sample, and if the seller says it is.  We have tried to fix up an instrument which is referred to as the bushel measure.  It is admitted by millers, dealers and others interested that, on the whole, the bushel is the fairest basis we could adopt.  They have all agreed that the bushel weight will give the greatest justice in any legal check we could possibly lay down. Now the bushelling will be done by the miller or the dealer, as the case may be; in other words, the buyer. Naturally, however, if the farmer wishes it, the bushelling will be done in his presence.  I do not know if that is sufficient check, but there is this to be said also.  Deputy O'Sullivan, for instance, mentioned the minimum price for cattle.  I think the situation here is different, however.  We fix a quota for the amount of wheat the millers must take, so that in the aggregate the millers must take all the wheat of the country and, accordingly, they will not be in a position to have an unnecessary dispute with the grower.  They will be in the position of looking for their quota, and they will be anxious, naturally, to take any wheat that is reasonably good wheat.  In that way, the seller is in as good a case here as the buyer, because the buyer is in the position that he must get it.  Deputy O'Sullivan wanted to know if there was any question of appeal.  I do not think there could be.</P>

      <P>I forgot to deal with that point.  However, as I said before, I think the seller is going to be in a strong position, in so far as he can say to the miller that he must take his wheat eventually and that, therefore, he can afford to hold out for the minimum price.  At least, we have had a couple of years' experience of this kind of thing, not in regard to this particular matter, but where they were working on the bushel system, and I think there were no great complaints about it.  Of course, under this Bill we shall be able to tighten the regulations so as to see that the bushelling is done in a fairer and more open way.  With regard to the costs of transport, the miller must pay the price at the nearest railway station or port, and the only thing he can charge on is where he takes it actually from the haggard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The farmer has his remedy in that case because he can find out the charge beforehand, and if he thinks it too high, he can deliver his wheat to the station.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall so exercise the power conferred on him by sub-section (1) of this section that no holder of a milling licence in respect of a mill shall be required by virtue of a compulsory sale order or orders to purchase in all in any cereal year an amount of home-grown millable wheat exceeding one-fourth of one per cent. of the home-grown wheat quota for such mill for such cereal year.</P>
      <P>With regard to this section, Sir, I think I mentioned on Second Reading that, no matter what percentage we might fix&mdash;let us suppose 20¼ per cent. &mdash;we are likely to have some odd lots of wheat left on the hands of certain farmers after all the millers have taken their percentage.  The purpose of this is to meet the difficulty in connection with these odd lots and to enable the Minister to serve an Order on a miller to take so much from a farmer.  Some of the millers thought that, as this section was drafted, it was possible for the Minister to serve notice on them to take an unlimited quantity.  The amendment is designed to cover that. We cannot compel any miller to take more than a quarter per cent. of his share of the national percentage of these odd lots.</P>

      <P>On the section, Sir.  The section purports to restrict a licensed miller in the re-sale of wheat.  I suppose that the object of that is to prevent profiteering in wheat.  Is it the Minister's intention to extend that restraint to wheat dealers in order to prevent profiteering in wheat by dealers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object is not exactly to prevent profiteering but to compel the miller to mill the wheat.  If any miller did buy, for instance, some most inferior kind of Irish wheat in order to get it rather cheap, thinking that he might afterwards pass it on for some other purpose, it is designed here to prevent that happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a wheat dealer goes into the market in October and November in order to make a corner in home-grown wheat, and the Minister has made a Quota Order on the basis of the total production of wheat; what would happen in that case?  The millers then go out to buy their wheat and they find that wheat is not to be had at the minimum price.  The dealer then comes out and says: &ldquo;Well, you want wheat and I have got it, but my price is 33/-.&rdquo;  The Minister <Col N="964" /> himself has said that it is his object not to enable any miller to say that he could not get wheat at a reasonable price or to offer that as his excuse for being unable to fall in with the Quota Order.  The Minister has so drafted the quota section that he can compel the miller to go and get his wheat somewhere and at the best price he can get it at.  There is room here for an abuse which would injure not only the miller but the producer of wheat as well, and I think the Minister ought to consider whether he should not furnish himself with some kind of machinery whereby he could check profiteering operations of that character by middlemen standing between the producer and the miller.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has proposed to the millers&mdash;I do not know if it is final&mdash;that he will be prepared to lend money at 5½ per cent., repayable in five years.  I said on the Second Reading of the Bill that we did not want to make this money too attractive because we should prefer the millers to go to their own banks and get the money if possible.  I know that some further negotiation is taking place in regard to that offer but I think that is the offer that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the Minister for Finance has offered <Col N="965" /> to lend this money for five years at five and a half per cent., secured, not only on the new storing and drying plant to be erected, but also on the personal security of the millers themselves, and that, in fact, the Minister requires a first charge on all the property, which most of the millers would not be in a position to give.  In addition to that, they feel that there is no obvious explanation for the Minister's refusal to extend the period of repayment to a period longer than five years.  I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that, as he wants to push this scheme through, it is very necessary that he should have the mills properly equipped so as to give the scheme the best possible chance of succeeding.  I, therefore, suggest that he ought to make the strongest possible representations to the Minister for Finance that as most of these milling companies are solvent, he should go as far as he could to meet them (1) in the term over which they will be allowed to repay the loan; and (2) in the extent of the mortgage he would require to secure the money.</P>
      <P>The probability of any serious loss accruing is extremely remote, but very grave inconvenience and delay might result from the Department of Finance proving too stiff in this matter, as a number of the millers might find it impossible to get financial accommodation with the banks and would have to consider floating issues on the stock market in order to get the necessary money to carry out the developments that will be required by the Bill.</P>

As I said, these are the terms offered by the Minister for Finance. I am not sure that they might not be varied in some way or other, following negotiation, but, at any rate, the interest will not be varied and I think we would need to look for the best possible security for the loan.  No bank, so far as I know, will advance <Col N="966" /> the full cost of a building on the security of that building alone.  They will require something more as security.</P>

      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  seed wheat was during the period of 12 months commencing on the 1st day of August, 1934, sold on credit by a person (in this section referred to as the merchant) to another person (in this section referred to as the farmer), and</P>
      <P>(2)  the farmer on the occasion of such sale signed a document whereby he</P>
      <P>(i)  admitted that a specified sum (in this section referred to as the debt) was due by him to the merchant for such seed wheat, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  undertook to sow the said seed wheat during the said period, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  authorised the Minister to pay to the merchant the debt out of any wheat bounty payable to him in respect of the produce of such seed wheat, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  agreed that if no wheat bounty became payable to him in respect of such produce that the debt should be payable by him to the merchant, and <Col N="967" /> (3)  the farmer sowed the said seed wheat in pursuance of the said undertaking, and the crop, the produce of such sowing, is millable wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete line 24, and substitute the following.&mdash;&ldquo;is millable wheat, and</P>
      <P>(4)  the Minister has advanced to the merchant any moneys on account of the debt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section deals with the seed wheat loan scheme.  I think I explained it on Second Reading, but it might be no harm to deal with the section for a few moments.  We had a scheme whereby a merchant, who gave seed wheat on credit to a farmer and who got the farmer to authorise the Minister for Agriculture to pay out of his bounty, when it became due, whatever sum he owed the merchant, sent that authorisation on and the Minister for Agriculture paid the merchant what was due. As a matter of fact, we paid something like 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. in advance and the remainder when the bounty became payable to each individual grower, but where an individual grower did not receive a bounty, the Minister was not liable to the seed merchant.  The seed merchants, of course, entered into an arrangement with certain growers in respect of the 1934 crop.  If this Bill goes through, there is no means of collecting what is due to the seed merchant and this section, therefore, was put in to enable the Minister for Agriculture to take a lien, as it were, on the crop and serve notice on the particular farmer to sell to a particular dealer and to serve notice on the dealer to pay the price to the Minister, who will pay the seed merchant what was due to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three conditions are set out as the section stands&mdash;that the seed was sold on credit; that the farmer undertook to authorise the Minister for Agriculture to pay the seed merchant out of his bounty; and that the farmer sold the seed wheat in pursuance of the said undertaking.  These three conditions <Col N="968" /> might be fulfilled, and yet I think we should not be liable in a certain case which I will cite.  There is a certain case I know of in which a merchant actually got 50 per cent. on the seed when selling to the farmer and then sent to us to cover him for the remainder.  We would not do that. The Department thinks that the seed merchant has done fairly well in the course of ordinary trade and that he would not have done anything better than getting one half down and the remaining half when the crop is sold. We do not think we should give any further guarantee in such a case.  In that particular case all the conditions in the section would have been fulfilled and, accordingly, I want to insert this fourth condition, that the Minister had advanced to the merchant any moneys on account of the debt.  As I have already said, where a merchant gives full credit and gives the seed without any cash, the Department has during the last two years given him half payment in advance.  This particular man has collected half payment himself from the purchasers, and I think his case should not be covered. This amendment is designed to bring about that position.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides that the Minister will pay part of the cost of the seed-wheat to those who distribute it to the farmers. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that a very considerable number of registered seed distributors have been selling winter wheat to farmers in the months of February and March, and inducing those farmers to sow winter wheat when spring wheat ought to be sown?  Has his attention been drawn to the fact that a good deal of wheat failed and never came to maturity for that reason, and, if it has, has he considered taking steps to penalise the seed distributor who, having winter wheat left on his hands, fobbed it off on the farmer as spring wheat and induced him to sow it when it was too late for sowing such <Col N="969" /> wheat and involved the farmer in the heavy losses of a crop failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Department can possibly do so, they advise farmers to get a written guarantee with their seed.  No doubt, it is not so easy to reach farmers in every case with these bills, advertisements and posters and, possibly, some farmers did not receive that warning.  A number of them, however, did, and a good number did ask for a guarantee that the seed was of the spring variety.  Where they had an understanding or a guarantee of that kind, they have an action against the merchant.  We also went further in that we advised merchants to get some guarantee in respect of wheat imported from whomever they might be buying their wheat, because seed wheat mostly comes from England, and a number of them, I believe, did get such guarantees.  In one particular case, in which a lot of the seed failed, there was a definite guarantee given that the seed was all right.  In that case they have an action, of course, against the person from whom they imported.  I think that in most cases, at any rate, the farmer is all right.  He will be compensated if he has gone about the matter in a legal way, and got the wheat under guarantee.  Where there is no guarantee, I do not know exactly where they stand legally. Perhaps I should not express an opinion on it, because I do not know the law.  I do not know what we can do in regard to that matter.  We have no power, as far as I know.  It is power which, perhaps, we ought to have, and in regard to which we will probably bring in legislation.  I think we should have more power over the seed merchants; with our present powers I think we can do nothing.  It is a matter between the farmer and the merchant, and in turn, between the merchant and the person from whom he imported.</P>

      <P>There is one thing which the Minister can do&mdash;a very effective thing&mdash;and that is where it is brought to his attention that a seed merchant had supplied a farmer with winter wheat in spring, and that in respect of that transaction he had got <Col N="970" /> one of those orders on the Minister which has just been described, the Minister could refuse to pay the merchant and hand the money back to the farmer saying: &ldquo;You have been made a fool of.&rdquo;  Of course, the trouble is that if the farmer had been made a fool of he would not have been entitled to the bounty, because he would not have any wheat to sell, so I agree with the Minister that unless he gets legislation passed by the House giving him some control over seed merchants, he has little remedy against them.  I suggest that he ought to seriously consider the registration of seed merchants, and the requiring of a certain standard of excellence to be maintained by persons who import seed.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister get no false sense of security.  Deputy Curran may not see the snag in this matter.  Let me give an example.  A country merchant buys winter wheat in anticipation of a big demand.  He cannot sell it; he does not get as big a demand as he thought he would get, and he keeps the surplus in the background. Now, he gets in a stock of spring wheat.  Before he brings the spring wheat forward he brings forward the butt of his winter wheat stock, and sells that first.  That is where the principal abuse lies.  That is the abuse that will have to be got after.  Do not let any false sense of security be acquired through prohibiting the import of wheat, because I believe there is very little abuse there. When you are dealing with a big seed merchant it will not be worth his while consciously to do a dishonest thing of that type.  It is the small man, to whom the loss of a sack of wheat is a very big thing, who is tempted to pass it off for something which it is not.</P>

I know of one district in my constituency which is very badly hit this year owing to &ldquo;dud&rdquo; seed.  The crop is going to be an absolute failure on hundreds of acres of land.  That is a very serious thing for those people, although it does not occur in many parts of the country&mdash; perhaps in not more than two or three in the Free State.  In order to safeguard the wheat growers from having seed like this given to them by merchants in whom they have confidence, I would support the suggestion that none but tested and guaranteed seed should be allowed to be sold by the merchants to the wheat growers of the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister can rest assured that any legislation which he may bring in to control the seed merchants dealing in any cereals, whether it be wheat, barley or oats, will be welcomed by the trade.  It is quite true that those who have established a reputation for themselves with the farmers for having first-class seed only, always send their samples to the Department of Agriculture for a test, and they get a germination of at least 98 per cent.  The report comes back that the seed is free from smut and such diseases as are an absolute calamity.  Of course, there are certain limits beyond which seed merchants, even of the highest standard, cannot go.  They cannot guarantee that the crop will grow.  No seed merchant can do that, because there may be certain diseases in the ground, or some other pest which may interfere with the crop. The sending to the Department of samples of what is being sold should be insisted on, and would be welcomed by all in the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point which, although it is a general one, I think may be raised here.  The Minister has, in the short space of the last couple of years, produced what I call nearly a code in this particular matter.  If he looks at the section he will find at least three Acts, and this is the fourth.  I raise the matter here because it may as well be raised on this section as on any other, but if he looks through this Bill he will find plenty of other instances of it.  He will find plenty of registration by reference, and penalties by reference. With those four Acts re-enacting, partially repealing and temporarily repealing one another, I wonder whether the ordinary businessman can know where he is in regard to all those regulations.  Would it be possible to avoid all this unnecessary legislation by reference?  I know that from the Minister's point of view there is a lot to be said for it in the matter of convenience, but I can easily understand the ordinary businessman in the country not knowing quite where he is, and I wonder whether the Minister might not issue a kind of official codification of his four Acts.  I am not now asking him to codify the four Acts-and bring in a new Bill, but to issue an official codification in order that people can really know where they are. All this legislation, amending legislation, reamending legislation, and now amending reamending legislation is, as I think the Minister will acknowledge, calculated to cause a considerable amount of confusion and difficulty in the mind of the ordinary businessman.</P>

      <P>What a glorious commentary on Dáil Eireann!  The Minister reassures us that the citizens of this State are really not concerned with the legislation of this House at all.  The legislation of this House has really one purpose only, and that is to deliver the citizen bound hand and foot into the hands of the civil servants, and they deal with them.  All the citizen need do, according to the Minister, is refer to the regulations. Those statutes do not affect him at all. Where are we going?  Surely, the time is rapidly arriving when we can pass a law empowering the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make such regulations as he thinks desirable for the public welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions which I desire to address to the Minister. On the Second Reading of this Bill he spoke of his intention to introduce similar legislation with reference to retail distributors and a variety of other trades.  Has he considered the desirability of setting up some kind of commission forthwith to investigate the sort of restrictions that might appropriately be applied to these various other trades to which he referred?  He does not, apparently, intend to introduce the legislation immediately, and surely it would be well to initiate an inquiry into how far one could equate hours in urban shops with hours in rural shops&mdash;how far conditions in those two types of shops could be equated&mdash;and a variety of questions of that kind upon which <Col N="975" /> he will have to seek practical information before he proceeds to draft the legislation?</P>
      <P>The second question is one of more immediate importance and that is as to the differentiation between workshops and factories.  I understood that almost any place where industrial occupations were carried on was a factory and was liable to inspection under the Factory Acts.  I learned for the first time from Deputy T. Kelly, who is the chairman of many trade boards, that there is a distinction between a factory and a workshop. Will the Minister take advantage of this occasion to explain to the House what is the difference between a factory and a workshop and what essential element in an industrial enterprise is it that brings it within the scope of the Trade Boards Acts and what kind of enterprise is excluded from the operation of the Trade Boards Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the Minister need not try to make things more complicated than they <Col N="976" /> already are.  I understood that if you had a trade board, say for the furniture industry, under the chairmanship of Deputy T. Kelly, representatives of the employers and employees would come to him and arrange conditions of employment and those conditions would apply to every workingman employed in the manufacture of furniture. I now discover from Deputy T. Kelly that that is not strictly accurate, that the regulations made by the Trade Board for the furniture trade apply only to operatives working in a factory.  If they are working in a workshop the Trade Board regulations do not apply to them, nor have the factory inspectors any power to require the owners of workshops to carry out the regulations.  Only the Dublin Corporation can control the workshops in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>Before line 26 to insert the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;representative of workers&rdquo; means a trade union of workers within the meaning of the Trade Union Acts acknowledged by the national trade union centre as being representative of workers whom it purports to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a different amendment to No. 1 and I prefer it to the amendment in Deputy Anthony's name.  The Minister might consider it a better definition than that in amendment No. 1. <Col N="982" /> In this Bill there are frequent references to &ldquo;representative of workers,&rdquo; and the object of this amendment is to define what the expression means.  The amendment seeks to insure that it means a trade union of workers within the meaning of the Trade Union Acts acknowledged by the national trade union centre as being representative of workers whom it purports to represent. It is quite possible under this Bill for employers or workers organised in a company union or house union to endeavour to negotiate an agreement unsatisfactory to the workers with a union of that kind; or it is quite possible under this Bill for employers to be able to negotiate in a particular section of industry an agreement with some of their workers and to seek in that way to have an agreement of that kind registered in the Wages Agreement Register.  The object of this amendment is to insure that the agreements which it is proposed to register and the voices of the workers whom it is proposed to hear shall be the voices of the workers organised in a particular union and the particular union concerned shall be a recognised trade union.  In other words, that it shall be recognised by the national trade union centre as a trade union centre.  In that way I think the workers would be protected against the registration of what can only be described as bogus agreements negotiated either by representatives of workers unorganised in any union or negotiated by workers in what has come to be known as the worst possible type of union, namely, house or company unions.  I do not think the House can have any objection to an amendment of this kind. There is no difficulty in recognising a national trade union centre.  This well-known phrase is well-known in labour circles.  I am sure that in Geneva last year the Minister heard the word used. If there is a national trade union centre in the country, it is only right that a body of that kind speaking for the trade unions of the country should have some voice in saying what is a legitimate union and what is an illegitimate union.  We allow various boards in the country to determine who is a <Col N="983" /> doctor and who is a dentist and we ought to allow the national trade union centre to have some say in what body really constitutes a trade union.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. It may possibly save him from a good many difficulties later on.</P>

      <P>I think there is a trade union congress.  What I want the Minister to understand is this, that Deputy Norton is raising a very dangerous suggestion.  He wants the national trade union centre or whatever the name is to be the complete arbiter and controller of what union is to be recognised and what union is not to be recognised.  There are certain unions which negotiate with employers' associations.  The Trade Union Congress recognises one union and they do not recognise another.  The result is that if the Minister is to give way on this amendment he will interfere with voluntary agreements entered into by recognised unions with certain employers' associations.  To my mind, irrespective of any obstacles or disagreements which may be put up by employers against this amendment of Deputy Norton's, I think it would seem to me to be absolutely and completely handing over to the national trade union centre a power which would make them complete dictators as to what body was a trade union and what was not.  That would be a very dangerous power indeed to hand over.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said that I would have no difficulty in recognising what was the national trade union centre.  I do not know precisely what Deputy Norton intends by that phrase.  I assume he means the Trades Union Congress.  I could not accept the position that I can only recognise as a trade union representation of the workers in any industry, a trade union recognised by the Trades Union Congress.  Every <Col N="984" /> trade union may be recognised by the Trades Union Congress and that may be always the case, but we have no security in that respect.  There are certain unions not so recognised at present.</P>

      <P>I cannot recognise the distinction.  So far as I am concerned, it seems to me that any Minister operating this Bill, and seeking representatives of the workers employed in an industry would naturally go to the union to which these workers belong.  In practice that would be the situation.  If we had to deal with an industry the workers of which belonged to Mr. Larkin's union&mdash;the Irish Workers' Union&mdash;we would be immediately in difficulty if Deputy's Norton's amendment was passed, because I am not sure that that union I have mentioned would be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a situation might occur.  Next month there might be a dispute in which that union would be involved.  In fact, a dispute in connection with a firm engaged in the grocery business was conducted by a union not recognised by the Trades Union Congress.  I do not know in what respect it was representative of the workers engaged in that particular industry, but there we would have that difficulty.  This suggestion is linked up with the proposal in amendment No. 34, in the name of Deputy Dockrell, and which is repeated in connection with other sections of the Bill.  I would amend the Bill to provide that the Minister must consult with organisations and associations representative of the employers, and organisations and associations representative of the workers.  If no such associations existed, then the Minister would consult with people considered by him to be representative of either party. The Minister would be bound by the necessity of satisfying himself that there was no association representative <Col N="985" /> of the employers or workers before negotiating with individuals.</P>
      <P>What is in Deputy's Norton's mind is the possibility of the Minister accepting as representatives of the workers an organisation not a <i>bona fide</i> trade union, or a group of workers who are only a minority of the workers employed in the industry.  We could avoid that difficulty, if it existed, by a variation of the words in the section on the lines I have indicated.  But it would create a danger of greater magnitude if we were to hand over, to a body over which the Legislature has no control whatever, the matter of deciding what unions were, or were not, representative of the workers in a particular industry.  It is quite possible there might be two Trades Union Congresses at a particular stage, and the Act would become largely inoperative in such circumstances. I must therefore resist the amendment and confine the operations of the Minister, in the various sections of the Bill, to consulting with associations representative of the workers or employers, and where no such associations exist to consulting persons who appear to me to be so representative. I think the Deputy need have no fears that that provision will be used for any purpose except to ensure that the opinions of the workers involved and concerned in any question arising under this Bill will be entertained.  At any rate, I do not think it is likely that any Minister for Industry and Commerce would take the risk of making arrangements for matters dealt with under this Bill unless he was certain that he had in fact ascertained the general views of those involved, whether workers or employers.  He might not agree with their views and he might make his arrangements against their representations, but he would take all precautions to ascertain their views before making any arrangements.</P>

He is morally obliged to do that, and that obligation is discharged by all except the most tyrannical Governments in the world.  The Minister sends a special delegation of employers and a special delegation of workers. The Minister is obliged by the articles of the Treaty to ensure that the trades union delegation is representative of the trades union centre, and in interpreting that the Minister comes to the Trades Union Congress and recognises them as the national trades union centre, and asks them whom they propose to send.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He goes to the Trades Union Congress as representing the trades union centre.  I suggest to Deputy Dockrell that he should look up the article.  The Minister goes, in any case, to the Trades Union Congress, and asks them to submit names of those who are to be delegates to the advisory body.  The Minister has no difficulty in recognising that this body does represent the workers of the country so that there can be no difficulty in accepting this amendment.  It may be that there are organisations <Col N="987" /> not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, but that does not prevent the Trades Union Congress from acknowledging that they are trade unions and that they are genuinely representative of the workers whom they purport to represent.  The amendment does not make it necessary for the union to get a certificate of that kind or that it should be affiliated to the Trades Union Congress.  It only suggests that it should be acknowledged by the Trades Union Congress. Of course, the Trades Union Congress might have from time to time correspondence with an organisation not affiliated to it, thereby recognising it in fact as a trade union body.  What I want to secure is, not that it should be affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, but that house unions and company unions will not be allowed to masquerade as trade unions.  I want to make sure that an employer is not allowed to get a number of workers into his pocket, to get an agreement with them, and then to register that agreement.  These are legitimate safeguards which should be inserted in this Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to make sure that the body who is going to register the agreement is, in fact, properly constituted and properly representative of a trade union.  There can be no possible objection from that point of view.  The Minister offered to alter the section so that he would consult only with representatives of the workers or with members of a union which was representative of the workers.  Any set of people could represent themselves as a trade union.</P>

I say a body of that kind may be a bogus body.  As the Minister knows, or ought to know, these company unions or house unions have been established, not to defend the workers but to make them more manageable, more docile and more unprotesting in the interests of the employers who want to exploit them. I think that the amendment is a suitable amendment for a Bill of this kind and that it is desirable to make sure that bogus organisations are not recognised in these consultations and registrations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton states that even if a union is not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, that does not mean that the Trades Union Congress refuses to acknowledge it as a union.  As a matter of fact, a very important union which I know has applied for affiliation to the Trades Union Congress and has been refused. Further, that union controls a large section of the workers in this city and outside it.  There are employers' associations which have got to sign a yearly agreement with that union. They signed that agreement and afterwards signed a similar agreement with the Transport Union.  If a union like that is refused affiliation by the Trade Union Congress, it is not likely that the Trades Union Congress would be ready to acknowledge that union in a practical way as representative of the workers.  The amendment, in my opinion, would only be a cause of strife inasmuch as it would make dictators of this autocratic body.</P>

      <P>The question arises as to what persons are to be regarded as representative of the workers in a particular interest.  In the great majority of cases, the trade unions to which the workers will belong, will be the bodies representative of these workers who will be consulted, but we are not going to bind ourselves to accept any body as representative of the workers, no matter what developments may take place in future, or no matter what trade unions may be recognised by the Trades Union Congress. We must deal with persons who are representative of the workers whoever they may be.  The Deputy can be assured, in view of the phraseology in the Bill, that there is no danger that a small body of people will be accepted as representative of the workers in an industry in the manner he suggests.  That danger is not likely to arise in respect of industries in which the workers are members of a trade union and when there is not a sufficient number of men in an industry to belong to a trade union, then the obligation is on the Minister to consult with such persons as he believes are representative of the workers.  There are certain industries which are not organised.</P>

      <P>In practice, the Minister will endeavour to find an organisation, a trades union, representative of the workers, who will be interested in any question that arises.  I am prepared to put into the Bill that he shall first consult with associations representative <Col N="990" /> of the workers and that, if no such associations exist, he shall himself select persons who are representative of the workers, but I am not prepared to say that only persons recognised by the Trades Union Congress as representative of the workers, shall be consulted. I am not quite clear as to what acknowledgment by the Trades Union Congress might mean, and I could not accept the Trades Union Congress as the final arbiter in these matters.  It is possible that the Trades Union Congress may not always be accepted as fully representative of the workers. The trades union movement in its present form may not always exist, and we could not risk the possibility of the whole Act being nullified if some development took place which would change the whole trades union situation.</P>

What protection has he himself, or what machinery has he to guide him, when he comes to give effect to the provision that no body except people directly representative of the workers shall be consulted?  We know that the Minister is inspired by the best motives, but the present Minister will not be the Minister for all time, and this law is being made to endure. While we are prepared to accept the Minister's intentions as being of the best, I should like to know what protection he is providing for himself and his successors, to ensure that none but representatives of the workers shall be consulted in these cases.  We are suggesting that he should provide machinery in the Bill to ensure that only true representatives of the workers will be consulted.  There is a real danger that you will have company pocket unions coming along, yet the Minister refuses to adopt the machinery which we suggest as necessary to enable him to ascertain what bodies are truly representative of the workers.  If he gets a suitable alternative to our proposal we are satisfied.</P>

      <P>Before line 26 to insert the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;indenture of apprenticeship&rdquo; means the instrument under which a person under 18 years of age is bound for the purpose of being instructed in the knowledge and practice of any industrial process for a period not less than three years and a person not so bound shall be deemed not to be employed to do industrial work for the purpose of learning any trade or calling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to make it clear what an indenture of <Col N="992" /> apprenticeship is.  The phrase is used in a number of places in the Bill but it does not seem to me, for the purposes of this Bill, to have any definite meaning.  There are obvious advantages to employers to describe a document as an indenture of apprenticeship and the Bill takes no steps to ensure that an indenture of apprenticeship is something which I think the Minister has in mind.  The object of this amendment is, therefore, to ensure that an indenture of apprenticeship for the purposes of this Bill will have a very definite meaning, and that is the meaning set out in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, of course, must be considered in relation to Section 11, which is the only section in which the term &ldquo;indenture of apprenticeship&rdquo; occurs.  That is a section which gives the Minister power to prohibit or restrict the employment of young persons in any trade other than persons who are under an indenture of apprenticeship.  I agree that some such amendment as the Deputy suggests is required and I am accepting the amendment in principle, but I am asking the Deputy to keep it over until the next stage.  The only addition to the Deputy's suggestions which I am making is to include persons who are employed as apprentices under the rules of an apprenticeship committee established under the Apprenticeship Act.  You will, therefore, have two types of apprentices, those who are indentured apprentices and those who are apprentices under the rules of an apprenticeship committee.  I do not see that it is necessary to have the words &ldquo;and a person not so bound shall be deemed not to be employed to do industrial work for the purpose of learning any trade or calling.&rdquo;  I do not think that is necessary, but when drafting the amendment that point will be considered.</P>

As far as the <Col N="993" /> trades are concerned, I think it is pretty well understood that at the present time there are two classes of apprentices&mdash;one, the bound apprentice, as he is called, with an indenture of apprenticeship, and the other, a person who has no legal document, but who is considered absolutely on all-fours with the person who has an indenture of apprenticeship.

Unless he is very careful he will find that he has left a huge gap, namely, the apprentices who are not bound at all, but who are, according to the practice of a great number of trades, learning their trade.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point when drafting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell appreciates that the question will never arise at all unless regulations are made under Section 11 in relation to a particular trade.  If such regulations are made, then I think we will have to have some clear definition of apprenticeship, and there would have to be something more than a verbal agreement&mdash;either an indenture of apprenticeship or the other alternative which I have mentioned, namely, rules established by an apprenticeship committee.  The matter will not arise at all in the ordinary run of industry.  It will only arise where regulations prohibiting or restricting the employment of young people in a particular form of industrial work are made under Section 11.  If such regulations are in force, obviously there must be some clear definition of the persons excluded from their scope.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must, I think, discuss this amendment in relation <Col N="995" /> to amendments 12 and 27.  The term &ldquo;commercial undertaking&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill as drafted.  The Deputy is proposing to insert a definition of that term.  The term is not in the Bill.  He is, however, proposing to put it in the Bill in his amendments Nos. 12 and 27.  So far as amendment No. 12 is concerned, I want to mention that I am proposing on the next stage to move to take out paragraph (c) of Section 3 (1).  That is the paragraph which deals with the warehousing of goods in any warehouse where mechanical means for lifting or hauling are used.  I think the regulation of employment in concerns of that kind would more properly fall under the legislation to be introduced dealing with commercial undertakings generally, and that it complicates this Bill to have that type of employment regulated by it.  If, therefore, we take out that particular paragraph in Section 3, then the Deputy's amendment becomes unnecessary and, consequently, this amendment becomes unnecessary.  I propose to move to do that on the next stage.  I think that we can deal with employment in warehouses in a better way if we do it separately in the legislation which will control retail trading and wholesale trading generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;commercial undertaking&rdquo; means an undertaking in which no industrial work is carried <Col N="996" /> on or which is exempt from the provisions of this Act because the amount of industrial work done in the carrying on of the undertaking is so small that the provisions of the Act cannot be conveniently applied.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a large drapery establishment in a town which, in addition to doing a retail trade, also employs tailors and dressmakers as part of its activities.  The work of the dressmakers and tailors would constitute a very small portion, perhaps, of the activities of the firm.  Deputy Dockrell's amendment would not only ensure that the undertaking proper was excluded from the scope of the Bill, but that the tailors and dressmakers employed by the firm would be excluded from the protective clauses of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In lines 30 and 31, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;work,&rdquo; line 30, to the end of line 31 and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> In the Bill the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; means a person, other than an outworker, who does industrial work for a salary or wages, or for the purpose of learning any trade or calling.  There are already, of course, well known definitions of the word &ldquo;worker.&rdquo;  The Minister could have got them in the Factory Act, the National Health Insurance Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act.  None of these well-tried definitions has been used in connection with this Bill.  The definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in this Bill is a new kind of definition so far as our legislation is concerned.  Our previous definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; has been much more comprehensive and more in accordance with the terms of my amendment.  I want to ensure that the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in this Bill will apply much more comprehensively than the limited definition in the Bill.  For instance, a person who is not remunerated&mdash;who does not receive any wages or salary&mdash;is not a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; within the meaning of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not in the general way proposed in this amendment. If the Minister looks at Section 51 he will see that it deals with quite a different kind of person.  In any case, I propose to take out, under my amendment, the kind of definition that there is in Section 51.  It is quite possible, for instance, that a person might be employed as a learner and not under an indenture of apprenticeship.  It is quite a common thing in the country for a dressmaker, doing an extensive business, to take in a number of girls. The temptation to work for a master, or mistress, dressmaker is that it is desirable to get a trade in an establishment of that kind.  It is not an uncommon thing for such a dressmaker to have a large number of persons employed and not be paying wages to any of them. We all know that happens.  The persons so employed would not be brought within the scope of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not sure about that.  I think if the Minister looks into Section 51 he will find that such persons would not come within the terms of it.  It is quite possible, at all events, for non-paid persons in industry to be excluded from the scope of the Bill. I submit that is undesirable, because if they are so excluded then they are excluded from the limitation of hours, from the right to obtain holidays, and they become subject to all the conditions which the Bill is designed to prevent.  I would ask the Minister to examine the matter with a view to ensuring that the unpaid worker in industry is brought within the scope of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is employed for the purpose of learning a trade, then that person is included in the definition section&mdash;Section 2&mdash;whether paid a salary or wage or not.  Section 51 covers persons employed without remuneration &ldquo;or on any other grounds&rdquo; whether as members of the employer's family, or, to give another example, as, say, shareholders in a co-operative society doing industrial work.  Shareholders might very well work without wages or salary, being satisfied with the profits derived from their share-holding.  They are all covered by Section 51.  I had thought that Deputy Norton had a somewhat different idea in mind in this amendment, and that was to cover the case of workers who were employed not exactly by the employer but with whom the employer might contract with respect to each piece of work done. There are certain cases of that kind, where individuals evade the obligation to employ a person to do work at a wage by entering into a contract with him to do work&mdash;the material to be supplied by the employer&mdash;at a fixed contract price per piece of work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> I agree that there is some doubt as to whether employment of that kind is fully covered by the definition, and it will be necessary to examine it in that regard.  I do not think it is necessary to amend the definition in order to bring in persons who are employed in industrial work without remuneration, whether as learners or as members of an employer's family or on any other ground.  I propose having the definition re-examined with a view to satisfying myself as to its adequacy to cover peculiar types of employment of the kind that I have mentioned which have perhaps increased in volume recently in certain trades.  I would prefer to deal with the question of workers not remunerated by a section in the Bill, such as Section 51, rather than in a definition section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 41 to delete the word &ldquo;fourteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;sixteen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the definition section, the expression &ldquo;young person&rdquo; means a worker whose age is less than 18 and more than 14 years.  Consequently, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill it would be possible to employ a &ldquo;young person&rdquo; who had reached the age of 14 years, and a person so employed would come within the scope of this Bill.  The object of this amendment is to state definitely that a young person is not a person between the ages of 14 years and 18 years, but a person between the ages of 16 years and 18 years.  The desire is to exclude a young person of 14 years from industry.  Anybody who <Col N="1000" /> has given consideration to the problem of children of tender years being brought into factories and used as cogs in the industrial wheel must feel ashamed of the system of society that permits that kind of exploitation of human beings to continue.  The employment of young persons of 14 years has had an injurious effect on the employment openings for the older members of the families.  It is well known that there is a type of unscrupulous employer who takes particular delight in recruiting young persons between 14 years and 16 years. Some of the advantages in the employment of young persons are (1) that they are plentiful; (2) that they are cheap; and (3) that the employer does not have to pay any national health or unemployment insurance contributions in respect of them.  I think that inspectors in the Minister's Department could tell him that there are employers in the City and throughout the country who dismiss young persons at the age of 16 years because they would increase their liability by reason of the fact that, with the advancing years, they would have to get more wages and national health and unemployment insurance contributions would have to be paid in respect of them. Here is a Bill which, according to the title, is designed to make further and better provision for regulating and controlling the conditions of employment of workers.  Yet, in this Bill, we are proposing with our eyes open to permit young persons between 14 years and 16 years to be taken into factories under modern industrial conditions, there to act as machine-minders and to meet the impact of modern industrial conditions, with all the deleterious effects that that impact must have on the physique and mentality of such young persons.  The modern industrial problem is not a problem of finding employment for the child.  Modern industrialism finds an attraction in the child-worker.  At one time, the problem of the parents was to find employment for their growing children.  The modern problem is for the children to find employment for their fathers.  The children are now being brought into industry and are being exploited at low <Col N="1001" /> rates of wages.  Half a dozen children in a family would not earn in a week as much as their father would earn in a day.  Because we permit that kind of industrialism to continue, the father &mdash;the natural bread-winner and worker of the family&mdash;is denied an opportunity of earning the wherewithal to support his family, while young children, who ought still to be at school and tasting the best things of youth, are compelled to go into the factories and save the family from the destitution which is inevitable where the father is compelled to abandon work on account of these young persons.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is in order to discuss what Deputy Norton intended to do or whether we should discuss only what, in fact, his amendment would accomplish. Assuming that there were other amendments, as he says, to prevent the employment of persons under 16 years of age, his view is one with which I should have considerable sympathy were it not that it seems to be putting the cart before the horse to introduce legislation of such a character before the school-leaving age has been raised.  I am in favour of raising the school-leaving age.  That is a very difficult problem which, I understand, a Commission has been considering for a considerable length of time, and it is bound up with the equally difficult problem of raising the deplorably low level of the teaching in our national schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so as to ensure that the children would benefit by remaining longer at school.  I do not like to see children under 16 years employed in factories, but I should rather see them employed in factories, or employed in some other way, than see them running loose about the streets.  Whatever dangers they may be exposed to by being thrown into industry at an early age, it appears to me they would be exposed to worse dangers by being removed from school and prohibited from doing anything except running loose about the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister questions whether the amendment is effective to do what it proposes to do.  If the Minister looks at amendment No. 32, to Section 10, he will see that the <Col N="1003" /> object is to make it unlawful for any person to employ any person whose age is less than 16 years to do industrial work.  That dovetails in with the amendment I have just moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is on that amendment I suggest it should be argued.  We can argue it now if the Deputy desires.  Personally, I have every sympathy with the idea he has in mind, namely, that the minimum age for entering into industry should be 16 years.  But, we cannot merely provide that by making it law that no person under 16 shall do industrial work.  That does not solve the problem. The problem is, what are we to do with these persons between 14 and 16 if they are not attending school, or if they cannot attend school.  If they were all to become available to attend school, and decided to do so, there would be no school accommodation and no teachers.  Therefore, you are not making it possible for these persons to remain in school when you debar them from taking industrial work.  What is to happen?  Is it desirable that a young person not at school, and under 18, should have two years of enforced idleness before becoming eligible to take industrial employment?  I do not think so.  I agree that we should work towards raising the age of entry, but, as Deputy MacDermot said, we must start by providing that school facilities will be available for such persons for these two years.  A committee which has been sitting considered the question of raising the school leaving age from 14 to 16 years.  It has not yet reported.  The difficulties in that connection are almost entirely financial, but there is also the problem of getting within reasonable time an adequate number of additional trained teachers, capable of teaching those in standards higher than the existing national school standards.  Apart from that, there is the cost of that teaching staff, the cost of school accommodation and equipment, and behind that problem is the loss of earning power to the families to which these children belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> The Deputy will remember that when there was a Labour Government in Great Britain, when it was proposed to raise the school leaving age from 14 to 16, and to raise the age of entry into industry simultaneously, they, at the same time, contemplated payment out of State funds, of an amount equivalent to the possible earnings of these children, to the parents or guardians.  Of course, the bill was a huge one and the scheme was not proceeded with on that account.  That is another matter which cannot be ignored in considering this question.  I suggest that we should consider it as a whole; that the question of raising the school leaving age, and of raising the age of entry into industry and commercial work should be taken as one problem, and dealt with separately to the matters dealt with in this Bill.  We set down in this Bill provisions for regulating employment in industry as at present undertaken.  If the State decides to commit itself to the very big task of raising the age at which young people complete their education, and go into employment, then it has got to do it as a separate matter.  I urge that that problem should be left over until the report of the committee that has been sitting is presented.  I understand the report is being prepared and that it will be a comprehensive one which will bring forward all the points of difficulty as well, possibly, as suggestions for getting over them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that one problem is, what is to happen the children between 14 and 16 years of age.  It we were creating a new problem, of people walking around with nothing to do, I could understand the Minister being concerned with a problem of that kind.  But, when the Employment Exchanges show that there are 130,000 people walking around, and that there are many thousands more that do not find it advantageous to register at the Exchanges, because of the fact that they are below 18 years of age, the walking around problem for a section of the community is already with us. What we have to decide is, who is <Col N="1005" /> going to do the walking.  Is it children between 14 and 16 or children between 16 and 18?  In a choice of that kind, I prefer to allow the youngest children to do the walking around.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The fact of the matter is, it is easier for a child to get into employment the younger that child is.  Those between 16 and 18 cannot find employment.  When they make application at the factories they are told that they are too old; that they want persons between 14 and 15.  Every school teacher in the city can tell the Minister the same thing. It is a well-known fact that if one wants industrial employment it is an asset to be as little over 14 as possible. I am sure there are Deputies present who have often been troubled by constituents who tell them of their quest for work because they are too old to get into factories.  It is not possible in a Bill of this kind to move an amendment to ensure that children should be kept at school until 16. Contrary to the view-point of Deputy MacDermot, I think that if there is walking around to be done and if people have to be idle, if young persons are taken away from industrial life and from the impacts of that life, it would be better for them physically and mentally.  I do not think it is at all impossible to apply the principle of this amendment to the Bill, even though the school-leaving age is 14 years.  It is of very questionable value to the physique of our future citizens to have them employed from 14 to 16.</P>

That might not be such a big calamity if the problem was going to be cured.  I suppose we might be prepared to sacrifice the young people in that respect, but, until all sections of workers have been dealt with, would not the immediate effect of such a provision be that in other classes of work, which are not legislated for, you would have such a rush of applicants that wages and conditions would inevitably tumble? Everybody agrees that it is most desirable that the school-leaving age should be raised, and that persons between 14 and 16 should be compelled to attend vocational schools, at all events when there is no work for them to do.  I think, however, that such a thing as that could not be done piecemeal and that the proper time to discuss it would be when some Bill dealing with the school age is <Col N="1007" /> going through.  Further, I think that it would interfere with existing conditions and that the effect might be altogether a regrettable thing for very many working-class people.</P>

      <P>With reference to what Deputy Norton said just now, I confess that if I have to choose between the interests of the rising generation and the interests of the full-grown generation, I prefer the interests of the rising generation.  It does appear to me that it is disastrous to a child to leave a gap, a long gap of hanging around between the child's leaving school and doing something definite in life.  I have not heard anything from Deputy Norton to shake my opinion that that must lead to demoralisation and that, consequently, the effect of his amendment on the younger generation would be bad and disastrously bad.  I may be wrong in that opinion, but Deputy Norton has said absolutely nothing to lessen the force of that criticism.  I do most heartily and sincerely wish to see the school-leaving age raised and, as Deputy Moore says, to see boys and girls going on to vocational schools. Until that is accomplished, however, I think that Deputy Norton is asking us to sacrifice the interests of the younger generation to a degree that we ought not to sacrifice it.</P>

It must be remembered that every industry is not unhealthy for young persons.  I myself started in industrial work at the age of 14, and I do not think that it impaired either my physique or my mentality.  I am quite sure that the same applies to a very large number of Deputies in the House.  There are industries, however, that are unsuited to young persons, and it is for that reason that regulations can be made under Section 11 to exclude young persons from employment in such industries.</P>

      <P>Yes; but I think that the power that the Minister is taking in Section 11 is a justification for this amendment of mine.  In Section 11 the Minister may, in respect of any form of industrial work, prohibit the employment of young persons in particular industries.  What is going to happen them between the ages of 14 and 16?  Are they going to walk around there?</P>

      <P>There is nothing illogical in that.  If the Minister is saving them from something that is definitely bad for them, you must be prepared to risk the other evil.  After all, the effect of saving them from industrial employment that is definitely bad for them may be that they will be able to find employment that is more suitable.</P>

      <P>I am quite in sympathy with what the Minister is doing in Section 11, but I want the Minister to extend that prohibition by saying that no person under 16 years of age can be employed to do industrial work. I know that that is going a step further than the Minister contemplates. Perhaps it is going a considerable step further.</P>

      <P>Judging by what the Minister has said, it is not possible to do that until the school-leaving age is raised to 16 years of age, and since that involves the expenditure of, perhaps, a substantial sum of money, I think the Minister would be very optimistic, having regard to this year's Budget, to think that we are going to see that reform introduced for many years yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if one were to look at the question from the point of view of an individual citizen, one might be inclined to take that view. This Assembly, however, cannot make a microscopic examination of the conditions of life of every family; it must take the broad view.  The Minister, and the Deputy himself, have expressed sympathy with the object here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the school-leaving age is raised to 16 I have no other method of dealing with this matter except by means of this Bill.  This Bill is the nearest instrument to my hand, and I want to establish the principle in this Bill that a person should not be employed to do industrial work under 16 years of age. I think that, generally, the result would be that the children would benefit, that the physique of the nation would benefit, and that older persons who were seeking an entry into industry would also benefit.  I think that even the passing of an amendment of this kind, with the prohibition it seeks to enshrine in this Bill, would do a great deal to induce the Government to realise the necessity of keeping children at school until they are 16. So long as the factory gates are yawning to take them in and give them low wages, we will always get the argument about reducing the earning power of the family.  I think that one of the best ways of reaching the object, with which we all have sympathy, is to carry this amendment because, so long as the factory gates are open to take the children in at 14 years of age, <Col N="1010" /> because they are young and cheap, it will be a long time before you will see legislation passed in this country to provide that people must remain at school until they are 16.  Deputy MacDermot wants to keep them at school until they are 16.  Well, I suggest that one of the best levers for that is to keep them out of industry until they are 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that teachers are in danger of losing their jobs because the average attendance is falling.  Although the Minister is aware that he was told 12 months ago about this, nothing has been done.  There is plenty of room in some of the schools for the children who are in the factories, and there are plenty of unemployed teachers too.  If the Minister looks up a Parliamentary Question asked here a few weeks ago, he will see that the surest way of keeping the children at school until they are 16 is by not providing the factory as a subterfuge for the child.  If that is done, I think the Executive Council would be quickly compelled to realise the importance of keeping children at school until they are 16.  I think, Sir, that there is a strong case for this amendment, and I do not think that any of the difficulties foreseen by the Minister would be serious in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the only difficulty, we can deal with that. Deputy Moore said that this prohibition was to get the children out of the Bill, and then I called his attention to the fact that they were in the Bill, and that the object of this <Col N="1011" /> amendment was to exclude them from industry.  If the only difficulty is that of the apprenticeship, I am willing to seek accommodation with the Deputy or the Minister in regard to that matter.  The problem remains, however, that the majority of these children are not going into industry as apprentices but merely as machine minders with the object of keeping them at a cheap rate for a couple of years until there is a fresh supply of similar labour.  I think that there is a strong case for this amendment, and I should like to know from the Ceann Comhairle whether it is proposed to deal with amendments Nos. 32 and 118 in connection with it.</P>

      <P>After the words &ldquo;days,&rdquo; line 45, to delete all words to the end of line 48 and substitute the words &ldquo;New Year's Day, the sixth day of January, St. Patrick's Day, the first day of May, Ascension Thursday, Corpus Christi, the Feast of SS.

      <P>It says &ldquo;the first day of May.&rdquo;  In any event I agree it is desirable that we ought to have some latitude in respect of the public holidays to be observed, but the Bill provides for six public holidays, and I do not think it is desirable that we should increase that number.  I will introduce an amendment on the next stage of the Bill to provide that whereas six public holidays must be observed, nevertheless instead of Easter Monday, Whit Monday and the first Monday in August the nearest Church holidays can be substituted.  I do not think we can extend it so as to include the 12 holidays which Deputy Murphy suggests.  The existing law provides for only three holidays.  I think in a number of places they in fact close down the factories on Church holidays, but there is no statutory obligation to do so.  We are imposing a statutory obligation in respect of six holidays at the present time, but of course that does not prevent any particular employer&mdash;if it has been his practice in the past, or if he desires to make it his practice in the future&mdash;from shutting down for further holidays if he so desires.  The only thing we are imposing in this Bill is a statutory obligation to give six holidays, instead of the existing obligation, which is only for three.  I agree it is desirable that there should be discretion to substitute for the three holidays I have mentioned the nearest Church holidays, and I will produce an amendment to that effect on the next stage of the Bill.</P>

I do not think that there ought to be any question of discretion in regard to church holidays in the matter of employment.  I thought it was unnecessary to go into this matter.  In fact local authorities and certain employers have long since adopted this principle, and it is very undesirable and anything but edifying to see a certain section of workers compelled to work on a church holiday, while other workers who are employed by more considerate employers are getting paid for that day and getting the day off.  The Minister must be aware of the fact that this matter has been discussed by local authorities in various places, and this Parliament has set a very good example by ceasing to do public work on church holidays.  I am not quite satisfied with the Minister's gesture in this matter.  I think there ought to be no question in this House about conceding all the church holidays.</P>

It has been for many years recognised as a day given over to rejoicing by the workers.  Deputy Dillon seems to see some sinister meaning in the first day of May, although even the present dictator in Germany, on whose methods he was keen on fashioning his own Party recently, has now recognised the 1st May as a public holiday.  In many other countries throughout the world there has been an official, or a growing unofficial <Col N="1018" /> recognition of the 1st May being given as a day of rejoicing and legitimate festivity to the workers.  Here in this country there is probably a specially strong case for making the 1st May a public holiday, because in this country the workers have not only served the nation by their services in all the spheres of industry, science, art and agriculture, but in a very special manner they have served the national cause in this country and, quite apart from the fact that we ought to be in step with modern feelings in the direction of recognising that the 1st May should be a holiday specially given to symbolise the contribution which the workers make towards the creation of the things we enjoy in this country, there is, I think, a very special case for recognising their claim to that holiday as the nation's recognition of the part they have played in serving the national movement at all times.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will agree to accept this amendment and make the 1st May a public holiday.  If he does that I think that we would be making a public holiday of a day which we can probably justify more than any public holiday mentioned in this section of the Bill.  There is a strong case to be made for the 1st May being conceded as a public holiday and, while it may seem novel to us now to make that day a public holiday, in years to come, judging by the progress which that movement is making, I think there will be a general recognition by all Governments that that day should be given over to the workers as a day which will symbolise the nation's appreciation of their services.</P>

      <P>It is not.  I suggest to the Minister that if the first day of May is included in this section, with the amendments which have been moved around the section it will be quite clear that the workers can get that day as a public holiday.  I cannot amend in this Bill the Act declaring holidays to be public holidays, but I think the Minister will realise in regard to some of these days that the position is not even quite clear in the appropriate Act why they should be <Col N="1020" /> so regarded and, consequently, this day is in no worse position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 11, to insert after the word &ldquo;activities&rdquo; the words &ldquo;whether done by a worker as part of the work contracted to be done for a specified employer, or by a worker outside the period of such contracted work and in the worker's own time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment I am really only asking that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  I do not think the Minister will object to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the amendment, but I am obliged not to accept it because it would be impossible to enforce such a provision. We prescribe a 48-hour week for a worker in the form of not permitting the employer to employ that employee for a longer period, but you have the position that the worker can employ himself on another class of work outside the hours prescribed in the Bill. The amendment is in conformity, no doubt, with the intentions of the Bill, but there are no means by which we could enforce this regulation.  I do not <Col N="1023" /> think it is desirable that we should enact provisions that we could not possibly carry out.  Therefore, I do not think that I can accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so it throws a certain light on this Bill which certainly I did not realise up to now. If employers are to be asked to stand by a 48-hour week, or whatever it is, and there is no such obligation upon the workers, then I do not think it is an equitable provision.  I think at least that if proved it should be made an offence on the part of the worker acting in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy appreciates that the amendment if adopted would make it illegal for the worker to go home and repair the clock or put up a shelf or do any other form of work of that kind in his own home.  I know that the Deputy's intention is to prevent the worker taking up other employment in his spare time.  But that provision is one that it would be impossible to enforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that it would be absolutely impossible for the Minister to prevent a man working for himself; but I think the Minister ought to go to the length of saying that where the worker is employed by another employer that it would not be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's reply is to be taken as a <i>non-possumus</i> to the general principle that Deputy Dockrell described I very much regret it, because in certain trades it is certainly a very grave injustice, particularly to the fellow-workers of those who take on private work.  For instance, in motor repairing there is an amount of work done by people in their spare time, even on Sundays, to the great detriment of motor mechanics generally. You have the situation that where there are a number of people unemployed you have others taking on far more than their day's work represents. I am sorry if the Minister's statement means that nothing can be done in regard to that problem.  It is <Col N="1024" /> certainly a source of unemployment, and I hope the Minister will examine the question to see if any provision could be inserted in the Bill that will have the desired effect of putting a stop to such practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the idea behind the amendment, but I know of no means by which it could be enforced.  You do not stop this practice by simply saying it should not be done.  There is no means by which the Department could get after such work and keep track of it.  It would be a big mistake to embody a provision that we know quite well we could not possibly give effect to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put before the Minister this possibility; it is illuminating.  Suppose, for the sake of argument, an employer has a particular job that requires to be done.  For some reason or other he cannot get it finished; there is a difficulty or some delay.  Is it open to him to take another worker from another employer to do the work which his own employe would be precluded from carrying out under the terms of his employment? Because that is the effect of what the Minister has told us.  I repeat that I recognise the Minister cannot stop a man working at home, in his own house. But if he is allowed to go out after he has finished his day's work for one employer, and march into the employment of another employer, who presumably can say, &ldquo;I do not know where he is employed or whether he is in work,&rdquo; then I think it is going to make a farce of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The maximum hours&mdash;the limits within which a worker can be employed on industrial work&mdash;are fixed in the Bill.  But the Deputy is trying to get at persons such as those mentioned by Deputy Moore, that is, the motor mechanic who calls to the house of a private individual and takes the opportunity of repairing his car.  Take the case of a builder's labourer who undertakes to do some repairs in the house after ordinary working hours, and other things of that kind.  I agree with the desirability of making it impossible, if we could do it. <Col N="1025" /> But I do not see how we can do it. No suggestion has been made as to how provisions of that kind in a Bill could be enforced.  It could not be done without some very elaborate inspection system, or organisation of that kind, which it is not proposed to set up.  To say that such work should not be done will not prevent it being done, and everybody knows there is no means of effectually penalising those who do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me carry Deputy Moore's example a little further.  The Minister mentioned the case where a motor mechanic calls at the house of a private individual to repair his car. But I can envisage such a man going to a garage proprietor not far away from where he is working, and doing a job for him, and that is not provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another side to this matter.  The objection taken by the Minister is on the ground of administrative difficulty.  Apparently the principle is regarded as acceptable and desirable, but the administrative difficulty overrules that. But is it any more difficult to administer than, say, looking after a person who hires a number of employees and gets one of those after hours to cut the grass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the cutting of the grass would not be industrial work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it will be taken as industrial work under Section 47.  The Section says:</P>
      <P>If any employer employs any worker to do any industrial work for any part of any day and employs such worker to do other work which is not industrial work for any other part of that day such worker shall, for the purpose of this part of this Act, be deemed to be employed to do such industrial work while doing such other work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-industrial work, therefore, shall be deemed to be industrial work in this instance.  Let us get that concrete. A man is employed in the motor business and his employer gets him round to his house in the evening <Col N="1026" /> to cut the grass.  You are deeming that to be industrial work and you get the regulations dealing with rates of wages and hours direct into the matter of the cutting of the grass.  Is that administratively more difficult to tackle than the case of a person who breaks these regulations by doing what has been spoken of here.  Take the case of a man who is employed by a building contractor in the country.  He works full time, daily and weekly, for that employer.  Then after he leaves work he takes on the job of carpenter for a neighbour who wants sashes made for windows.  He goes down to that man and works for him.  Surely you should include that as part of the worker's time.  Is it more difficult to get after a case of that kind than that of a man who goes and cuts his employer's grass?  I see no difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I see considerable difficulty. Remember the employer of the motor mechanic, who gets the man to cut the grass must require him to do so as a condition of his employment; he requires him to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Or on any other ground.  Deputies who want to do this must state how it is going to be done.  In the other case there are two parties with a special interest. If the employee is employed overtime, whether on industrial work or nonindustrial work which for the purposes of the Act is deemed to be industrial work, then either he is paid the overtime rate and is willing to work overtime or he declines to do so, in which <Col N="1027" /> case the employer has no power to compel him to do it.  There we have the aggrieved party who is going to bring the fact to the notice of the authorities.  In the other case, the case of the carpenter who is going to work in his own time, it would be impossible to get at him, and I should like to know how you could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The aggrieved party!  The only way then apparently in which you can get after a man going around after hours, if he feels he should not do the work, is that he should proceed to make himself obnoxious by reporting the matter. But the man who decides that he would like to do the job, because he is sure of a bit of additional pay even though he is working overtime, can do it and you cannot check that up.  That is the situation according to the Minister. But shall we not get people doing this work who either themselves will report the matter or whose comrades will report the matter?  Remember, you cannot always depend on the aggrieved person to report it.  Take my example of the man who goes down the street to do a job of carpentry. If the principle of the Bill is that you want to spread work as much as possible and that you want to prevent overtime being worked as a normal thing, if there are men unemployed in that trade in which this man worked after hours, they will report it because they will say: &ldquo;We would be getting that work if this man had not taken, it.&rdquo;  You will get reports of that kind without any elaborate system of inspection. Although we may not get 100 per cent. compliance, it is better to have the provision there and get it recognised than not to have it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember there is another side to this matter.  If these conditions of employment are going to be imposed, they should be imposed on everybody. Why should a building contractor&mdash; I am taking him as an example, but the motor trade employer could be brought into this as well&mdash;have terms and conditions imposed on him that the jobbing carpenter will not have <Col N="1028" /> to observe?  Why should there not be fairness in competition?  You are going to have one set of conditions imposed on one man but you are going to let off the man who is working in his backyard or the back part of his premises.  I submit that the conditions should be equal for both. I admit that you cannot get 100 per cent. compliance for this provision, but you will get information from others who are eager for the work which will enable you to bring about reasonable compliance with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that there are difficulties in giving effect to the second portion of the amendment because of its wide ramifications, but I think the first portion of the amendment is much simpler to administer than any other section of the Bill.  I do not see any real difficulty in meeting the point suggested in the amendment. It is well known, and the Minister must be aware of the fact, that certain persons who are at present employed in certain kinds of occupations actually look for, and take on, other work after the normal hours of employment.  This amendment is designed to deal with that kind of person and to limit that kind of activity.  There is a specially good case for limiting that kind of activity when we find, as is usually the case, that the trade in which he is employed is one in which there is already a large amount of unemployment. I suggest to the Minister that there is no difficulty in putting the first part of the amendment into operation.  His whole case was made against the second portion.  There is no case to be made against the first portion.  I think the Minister ought to accept it so as to prevent the kind of person I have described from working after his normal hours of employment, thus keeping other people out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

It is a somewhat surprising development.

If Deputy Norton wants me to take up the position that we shall not merely penalise the employer, but also penalise the worker, I am prepared to see if we can devise some means of meeting him, but you cannot devise any means which will enable you to get after the worker who is employed for wages during the day and who, for a period in his own time afterwards, acts as an independent contractor. You do not get after him by an amendment of this nature.  There might be a case where a worker is employed for wages during the day and is offered employment for wages outside that day but even in that respect there are certain provisions in the Bill.  A person who does a job of carpentry work or of mechanical work is in a different position and you will not be in a position to get after him.</P>

As long as unemployment lasts, there will be people to complain and give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But now a new point has been made by the Minister with regard to this Bill.  It cuts at the root of the whole thing and I was wondering how he will get over it.  The independent contractor emerges.  Could not the man who cuts grass at night turn himself into an independent contractor?  By a couple of recent decisions of the courts, it is rather easy, provided the person goes about it in the right way, to establish a position as an independent contractor. It is not easy after the event, and in unusual conditions, to establish retrospectively.  I thought the whole thing was caught by this, that anybody who does industrial work for salary or wages is a worker under this, and many a small independent contractor I thought would be deemed to be a worker under this, because he is in receipt of salary or wages.  The Minister is, apparently, now swinging to the side of the grand old phrase &ldquo;independent contractor,&rdquo; the lifebuoy of many a firm in connection with the Compensation Acts and apparently it is going to be the safeguard in relation to this.  If you extend the use of this, if you are going to cut away from the Bill some zone and make it a zone of uncertainty by the use of this phrase &ldquo;independent <Col N="1032" /> contractor,&rdquo; that zone will widen constantly until the Bill is of no great effect.  I thought it was all copper-fastened by the use of this phrase, that everybody is a worker who gets either salary or wages.  Apparently, we are now going to have a salaried man who will be an independent contractor and outside the measure.  If that is so, I think it is easy to turn the man who cuts grass at night into an independent contractor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as a person who is working is a member of a trade union he will find it extremely difficult and very unprofitable to plead before his trade union in defence of his action that he is an independent contractor, because he cannot be a member of a trade union and act as a journeyman for eight hours of the day and, for two, three, or four hours in the evening or at night time, plead that he is an independent contractor.  The very fact that he will have to get into that position in order to escape the provisions of this Bill will cause such difficulty that he is not likely to plead that defence.  I think this is the best way of dealing with that particular problem, so far as it can be dealt with, and the Minister need have no fear that anybody on these Benches is concerned about a person who is not satisfied with doing his own work, but wants somebody else's as well.</P>

I think that a provision dealing with employment in warehouses would more appropriately belong to that measure than to this. In fact, it has become evident that considerable difficulties would arise if we were to keep paragraph (c) as it is in the Bill&mdash;that some very anomalous situations would arise. These difficulties can be got over altogether by putting employment in warehouses within the scope of the Bill for the regulation of conditions of employment in the wholesale and retail trade in general.  Therefore, I propose to move to delete paragraph (c) from the section.</P>

It makes a peculiar discrimination with regard to the warehousing of goods where mechanical power is used for the movement of goods.  There is first a discrimination where mechanical power is used for the movement of goods&mdash;the implication being that where mechanical power is not used for the movement of goods then they would <Col N="1036" /> not, be covered&mdash;and, secondly, where goods are lifted by any mechanical appliance, whether such appliance is or is not actuated by mechanical power.  Why these two distinctions?</P>

      <P>In some places you have cranes worked by hand and in other places they are worked by electric or steam power.  I am afraid if this sub-section is left in the Bill it will create chaos so far as railway employment is concerned.  For instance, during one part of the day a man may be employed operating a crane by hand for the lifting of goods in the store, and on the following day he may be engaged in the yard shunting.  If his employment is varied in that way it is likely to be held that he is not engaged in an industrial occupation. If an attempt is made to enforce this sub-section, it will, I fear, make confusion worse confounded so far as railway employment is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the definition of mechanical power for the movement of goods, I have already explained how this Bill originated. Originally we contemplated one Bill dealing with all matters relating to industrial employment&mdash;health, safety and similar provisions&mdash;as well as the conditions of employment.  Then, for a variety of reasons, we decided to put these proposals into two Bills, one dealing with the conditions of employment, and the other with health and safety provisions.  Where you are dealing with safety provisions and similar matters, the question whether mechanical power is used or not becomes a matter of primary importance. These provisions are not being carried into this Bill.  Consequently, we have to revise the definitions in it in the light of the change which is being made, and I think the best way of doing that is to take this section out of the Bill.  In the Bill dealing with factories and workshops, safety arrangements and all the rest of it, we will, of course, have safety provisions where mechanical power is used and irrespective of whether it is used in connection with industrial work or not.  But that is another day's work.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the Deputy should appreciate the difficulties likely to arise if we include ancillary workers within the scope of the Bill.  Take the example that was given of the Dublin Gas Company.  It gets an order for the delivery of coke on a Saturday morning.  It sends out its vans with the consignment of coke to its customer.  The drivers cannot just stop work at one o'clock.  Their conditions of employment are different from those for factory workers, who come into work at a stated hour and leave off at a stated hour.  You cannot apply the conditions under which these drivers are employed in a Bill of this kind without the possibility of giving rise to considerable difficulty.  On that account they were left out of the scope of this Bill.  Where we will fit them in in our scheme of legislation is another problem.  I do not say that that problem has been solved, but, at the same time, it seems to me that we cannot bring them into this Bill because the provisions in it, which prescribe the hours after which industrial work, as defined here, must not be done, and all the rest, cannot easily be applied to workers engaged in the delivery of goods or in similar occupations.  Their hours of work are generally determined by the requirements of the industry in which they are engaged.  In relation to such workers, we could prescribe a maximum number of hours per week, but we could not have, in relation to them, the same hours per day or the same provisions for a short day, the rest periods, and so on, that we have for industrial workers generally. Therefore, I think they cannot be included in this Bill, and must be dealt with as a separate class of workers, in respect of whom different provision must be made.  I decided deliberately, after considering the matter very fully, that we could not bring such ancillary workers within the terms of this Bill, and I would not be disposed to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>They constitute a class in themselves&mdash;a class with whom it will <Col N="1040" /> be very difficult to deal in any of the measures I mentioned.  It is my intenttion that they should be covered, but exactly how that is to be done, I have not finally determined.</P>

      <P>In this Bill, we are providing for persons engaged in the construction, reconstruction, repair and demolition of a road, bridge, viaduct, sewer, drain, pipe, etc.  These are within the terms of the Bill, but the man who is carting away the material which the other man is demolishing is outside the scope of the Bill.  The Minister cannot plead that that kind of carting work is very urgent.  The man probably thinks that he is drawing from an endless mound of refuse.  Is there not a strong case for including that worker in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I think the Minister should consider the question of including this class in the Bill.  I think that they would fit into the Bill as conveniently as they would fit into any other class of Bill.  The Minister mentioned the case of a person ordering a ton of coke on Saturday morning.  That would be an extraordinary type of case.  A person who required the fuel urgently would not wait until Saturday morning to order it.  It is hardly necessary to frame a separate Bill for this class of worker.  I think that this class could be fitted into the present Bill.</P>

In the paragraphs are set out forms of industrial work which are included, but there may be other forms of industrial work somewhat similar which are not mentioned there, but which would be included.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think that they are out, but there may be particular cases where they might be brought in. In the majority of cases, where a person is employed delivering goods produced in a factory, obviously different working conditions will operate than those which operate in the case of a worker actually employed in the production of goods in the factory.  It would not be possible to provide automatically for the same rest periods and the same finishing hours of work.

Work of that kind cannot be regulated by the ordinary time schedules that might apply to factory work.  Work of that kind must go on while there is daylight, and not from eight to six, nine to seven, or seven to five. Forestry cannot he done after dark. It must cease when daylight ceases, irrespective of whether it is early or late.  The conditions in forestry are similar to those in agricultural work <Col N="1045" /> and we have decided to exclude forestry from the scope of the Bill.

      <P>(2)  Where the amount of any form of industrial work done in the carrying on of any undertaking is so small that in the opinion of the Minister the provisions of this Act cannot be conveniently applied to the employment of workers to do such form of industrial work in such undertaking, the Minister may, upon the application in the prescribed form of the person carrying on such undertaking, grant to such person a licence to employ workers in such undertaking to do such forms of industrial work while remaining exempt from the provisions of this Act and while any such licence remains in force the person to whom such licence is granted shall in respect of the employment of workers in such undertaking to do such form of industrial work, be an exempted employer for the purpose of this section.</P>

      <Col N="1049" /> (3)  Every licence granted under this section, unless previously revoked by the Minister, shall remain in force for the period specified therein and shall then expire.</P>

      <P>This amendment is put down to ensure that the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in the Bill means something other than an individual employer and that it includes any body of persons, corporate or unincorporate, and the legal personal representatives of a deceased employer, and in relation to industrial work undertaken by a Department of State includes the Minister in charge of the Department.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>The object of sub-section (2) of Section 4 is to provide that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the amount of any form of industrial work done in the carrying on of any undertaking is so small that in the opinion of the Minister the provisions of this Act cannot be conveniently applied to the employment of workers to do such form of industrial work in such undertaking, the Minister may, upon the application in the prescribed form of the person carrying on such undertaking, grant to such person a licence to employ workers in such undertaking to do such form of industrial work while remaining exempt from the provisions of this Act, and while any such licence remains in force the person to whom such licence is granted shall, in respect of the employment of workers in such undertaking to do such form of industrial work, be an exempted employer for the purpose of this Section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the right to grant licences to such persons is, as it is set out in this Bill, a highly dangerous kind of arrangement, because in this Bill the Minister is taking power to amend sections of the Factory and Workshops Act, the Employment of Children Act, the Factory and Workshops Act, 1907 and 1901, and the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, 1920.  If these sections are repealed by means of the licences granted by the Minister in this case, then these people will have no protection whatever in so far as the repealed sections of those Acts are concerned.  The Minister must be aware that these sections have been of considerable benefit so far as these employed persons were concerned.  I suggest <Col N="1051" /> that the effect of this would be that, for instance, the grant of a licence to an employer to operate outside the scope of the Act might lead to a denial of the weekly half-holiday, the meal intervals, the regulation of overtime, and so on, all of which were provided for in the Acts to which I have referred.  These are considerations which ought to weigh with the Minister in deciding whether or not to grant a licence to operate outside the scope of this Bill.  If that is intended, I think it a serious blemish on the Bill, but I hope the Minister is going to give an assurance that, so far as these sections of existing Acts are concerned, they will be preserved. I should prefer, however, that all such things should be brought within the scope of this Act because the case of exemption for the small firm has been a constant source of trouble in dealing with legislation of this kind.  There has been very constant and sustained irritation at Geneva in connection with legislation of this kind, and I hope that the Minister will not insist upon granting licences to such persons. I hold that the most effective way in which that can be dealt with is by the deletion of the sub-section in which the Minister is given power to grant such licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension if he thinks that this is designed to exempt small firms from their obligations under this Act.  It is really designed to deal with certain peculiar cases that might arise. As a matter of fact, the only case which has arisen, that I know of, was in connection with Messrs.  Woolworth's who, in one of their stores, put upon the counter a small machine used for the purpose of printing visiting cards. Anybody could go into that store and get their visiting cards printed on the machine by one of the assistants in the store.  I think it will be agreed that the use of such a machine could hardly be regarded as a factory, but the installation of that machine led to a demand that we should deem that store to be a factory and that all the conditions necessary under the Workshops and <Col N="1052" /> Factories code should apply to it. Obviously, it was impossible to apply the Factories and Workshops code to Messrs. Woolworth's merely because they had that machine in their store. The purpose of this sub-section is merely to enable exemption to be given in cases of that kind.  The considerations to which Deputy Norton has referred would be taken into account before a licence would be granted. The fact that we require an individual application in every case means that this section is only going to be used on very rare occasions, such as the one to which I have referred.  It is designed to meet just the type of case to which I have referred, and it arose out of our experience in connection with Messrs. Woolworth's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take power, in a specific way, to ensure that where such persons are granted exemption, by means of a licence issued by the Minister, the conditions of this Bill will be complied with in other respects so far as the employees are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be taken into consideration when the particular application is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But if, as the Minister said, even a very infinitesimal portion can be described as a factory, surely there is all the more reason for saying that it is only in cases of that kind that such licences would be granted, and that otherwise the Bill would apply so far as the conditions of employment are concerned.  Saying here that these things will be taken into consideration when the application is being considered, is very different from saying in the Bill that it is only in such rare cases that a licence would be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It says here that where the amount of industrial work done in the carrying on of any undertaking is so small that it is not practicable to apply the provisions of the Bill, an exemption may be granted.  Remember that the undertaking is one which will be to the extent of 99½ per cent. outside this Bill altogether, and, consequently, not concerned with its provisions.  The intention is to ensure that it will not <Col N="1053" /> necessarily become a concern subject to the provisions of this Bill because a very inconsequential amount of industrial work is done and an exemption is given, having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the only case the Minister has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite definitely.  I do not suppose that in a drapery establishment in the country, where any of the stock in trade have been damaged in the course of the business, the damage would not be repaired by one of the assistants.  In such a case, I am quite sure that they will not even bother to apply for exemption, but if there were an application for exemption in such a case, it might be considered.  The definition is, I think, fairly clear&mdash; where the amount of industrial work done in the carrying on of any undertaking is so small that it is not practicable to apply the Bill, exemption may be given on individual application and on due consideration of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But once the licence is granted, that undertaking is outside the scope of this Bill because it is not deemed to be the form of industrial work to which this Bill applies.  That firm is, therefore, entitled to operate outside the scope of this Bill, but this very Bill, under which that power is given to this undertaking, repeals certain beneficial provisions of other Acts which cannot then be invoked by the workers in that undertaking against the employer.  What is the authority, for instance, in a firm of that kind excluded from the scope of this Bill, to enforce the weekly half holiday against the employer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In a firm of that kind, the weekly half holiday is enforceable irrespective of who is employed. Remember that this is not a factory or workshop.  It is a concern which does not come within the definition of factory or workshop.  It would be a firm like the firm I mentioned&mdash;a retail trading establishment&mdash;which is required by other legislation to observe the weekly half holiday.</P>

However, it is merely a matter of drafting and I shall have it looked into.  The intention is fairly clear in any event and I do not think there is any disagreement.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any proceedings for an offence against this Act before a court of summary jurisdiction may, notwithstanding any enactment prescribing the time within which such proceeding may be brought, be brought either within the time so prescribed or within three months from the date on which evidence sufficient in the opinion of the Minister to justify a prosecution for the offence comes to his knowledge whichever is the longer and for the purposes of this sub-section a certificate purporting to be signed by the Minister as to the date on which such offence as aforesaid comes to his knowledge shall be conclusive evidence thereof.</P>
      <P>This amendment is submitted for the purpose of providing a wider jurisdiction than, I think, is at present available for dealing with offences under the section.  I think, for instance, that the Summary Jurisdiction Act fixes a maximum period of two months for the purpose of prosecuting in any action brought under the Act, and if an offence is only discovered, say, six months after it is committed, it is not possible, at present, to sue in a case of that kind.

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every employer who employs a young person to do industrial work shall cause such young person to produce to him a birth certificate as evidence that such young person is entitled under the provisions of this section to be employed to do such industrial work and such employer shall retain and keep in safe custody such birth certificate.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to require the employer to have produced to him the birth certificate of the person whom he proposes to employ.  At present, the Bill says that it shall not be lawful for any employer to employ any person whose age is less than 14 years to do industrial work.  If a person comes along and represents that he is 14 years of age, when, in fact, he has not attained the age of 14, the employer may claim on, perhaps, a written application made by that person, that the person represented himself to be 14 years.  Obviously, a greater responsibility should be put on the employer, and the best way in which that responsibility can be fixed is to require that the birth certificate of the person seeking employment should actually be produced for inspection. Otherwise, we may have persons under 14 years employed to do industrial work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (b) to add at the end of line 16 the words:&mdash;&ldquo;provided always that the proportion fixed shall allow the employment of a minimum of one young person in respect of each recognised division or series of operations of any piece of work and in addition shall permit the employment of a minimum of one young person to every ten other workers employed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is clear. The Minister takes power under this section, after consultation, to do either of two things: first, to prohibit the employment of young persons from certain classes of industrial activity, or, secondly, where he does not prohibit them, to say that they will only be employed in a certain proportion, so many young people to so many adults.  I would like to have established one or two guiding rules.  I suggest one part of this proposal first and then another part rather by way of example.  I want to ensure, first of all, that the proportion fixed shall at any rate permit the employment of a minimum of one young person in respect of each recognised division or series of operations of any piece of work.  I should say in regard to this that if the emergency provisions were less narrow than they are, there might be no necessity for this; or if application with regard to the employment of young people was made easier, if the system of application was enlarged, <Col N="1064" /> there might be no great necessity for this.  But taking the Bill in its present rigid form, I am suggesting that the proportion so fixed would not prohibit in such a way as to forbid one person in respect of each recognised division of work or series of operations of any piece of work where these can be segregated as to a particular piece of work.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that this has been surveyed over all the trades or even a majority of them, but in those that we looked at there are recognised divisions of a job and it would be easy to have this interpreted and carried out.  It may be, of course, that there can be arguments as to whether one is required in all cases, but, after consultation with people interested in this, I had it demonstrated to me that there is a greater probability of one young person being required than there is a likelihood of the work being able to be carried on without one young person to each group of adults; in other words, that the normal type of work will require a young person.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part&mdash;&ldquo;and in addition shall permit the employment of a minimum of one young person to every ten other workers employed&rdquo;&mdash;whether that will be ten or 20 or 30 can be argued, but there should be some restriction placed on the Minister.  If he likes to make up his mind that the business does not require young people, that choice can be made, but once it gets out of that category and these young persons must be allowed, he should take another jump and see that this Bill should lay it down that there will be at any rate one young person for each division, and that there will be one young person to every ten, 15 or 20 adults employed. I suggest ten.  Whether the figure is to be moved up or down is another matter.  We can have an argument in regard to different trades; but in relation to industry generally ten is a fair average, and will be found not to be an enlargement of what is the usual practice with regard to the employment of these young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments provide that an order might be made <Col N="1065" /> prohibiting the employment of young persons in any form of industrial work and, if so, no young persons will be employed; or alternatively, an order may be made fixing the proportion of young persons to adults.  Deputies desire that if there is a proportion fixed it shall not be less than one to ten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much objection to that amendment.  In fact, I could imagine in any case where a proportion is fixed a smaller proportion than one to ten would be most unlikely.  I am not clear as to why it is considered desirable to put in that over-riding limitation.  In so far as persons are employed as apprentices, persons learning a trade, we will cover them by sub-section (4), as we propose to amend it by bringing in persons apprenticed under the rules of apprenticeship committees; but in so far as persons are not employed by way of apprentices, there should be freedom to fix whatever proportion is determined upon after the consultation provided for in sub-section (1).  In these consultations due regard will be had to the requirements of a particular industry, so that there will be whatever proportion in the different industrial work done in that industry would be necessary to enable it to be carried on.  In any event, I would not like an amendment to go in which would convey the suggestion that there might be division in respect of forms of industrial work.  In the building industry, for instance, there would be many forms of industrial work, but each form should, I think, be distinct in itself and we should not recognise divisions within that form of work.  If it is necessary to make different regulations for different types of workers, then we should regard them as persons engaged in different forms of industrial work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to how the question of the emergency section of the Bill arises, but it is definitely intended to widen the scope of the emergency section which, I agree, is at <Col N="1066" /> present much too restricted, and to provide a much more liberal definition of what constitutes an emergency for the purpose of enabling the provisions of this Bill to be departed from.  The intention in respect of young people is not to interfere with their employment where such employment is leading up to adult employment in the same industry later on.  It will be only where a tendency is developing to employ young people only to be dismissed from that employment when they reach a certain age that these powers would be exercised, and the number of cases where that situation will not be capable of being adjusted by consultation between the parties will be very few indeed.  In such circumstances it is quite possible that no actual order may have to be made, but if such order has to be made I think we should have a fairly free hand to give effect to whatever may arise from the consultations provided for.  I have no strong objection to an over-riding limitation of one to ten if it is con sidered desirable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is, I think, made necessary by the fact that while offences under the section are punishable there is no provision made for the punishment of a continuing offence.  A case may come to notice where an employer is guilty of an offence under the section.  There may be considerable delay in prosecuting the person concerned.  If the person is going to be prosecuted he may, in a particular case, think it advantageous to continue <Col N="1067" /> to offend in the way he offended in the first instance, and he would be subject to no greater fine for committing offences over a period of two months than he would be if he committed a single offence in one day.  I think the Minister should make provision to ensure that the punishment to be imposed in these cases will be related in a heavier form to a case where the offence is of a continuing nature.</P>

      <P>There is a point in connection with this section that should be discussed here in any event.  What is aimed at?  Is this definitely going to the point of saying that we cannot get rid of spectacular unemployment except by finding employment for men or causing unemployment more definitely amongst people who stay at home when unemployed.  It is the men who stand around the corners parading themselves.  If that is the only reason for the section I am going to vote against it.  There may be some other reasons.  It may be founded on statistical returns which show that there are more women in employment; that they are in considerable numbers in greater employment than ever before, and that it can be alleged that women are encroaching on the work that was heretofore done by men. Even the mere statement of that would not justify the section.  I think the Minister will have to go further and say that it is undesirable in certain classes of employment to have women employed.  The Minister will either have to state here what classes of employment these are; or else he will take the stand that he will not allow women to get employment no matter what their capabilities or craftsmanship are so long as there are men unemployed. Then, at once, we have the question of sex inequality raised.  I would like to know which of these it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time we tried to get statistical returns to show how far there was in this country what was observed in other countries, particularly those countries which had sent a great number of men to the Great War.  In their absence the women who had not been previously engaged in industrial occupations got into these occupations and remained in them when the men came home.  Of course, there are not those historical circumstances making <Col N="1070" /> for such a change in this country.  Any statistical information I had did not indicate that there was any rise in the varieties of the occupations in which women were engaged.  There was a rise in the number of women employed. There was no spectacular rise but a steady increase, and that was a development of the modern idea, giving women an equal chance with men in gainful occupations.  There is no such thing here as happened in other countries of men going off to other duties and being replaced by women.  There was no figure to show any case of that or that women had gone into occupations previously held by men and remained in these positions when the men came home.  We have here an absence of these circumstances which have aggravated the whole unemployment problem all over the world and which only made a change here in the incidence of unemployment.  These circumstances are not here.  The situation as I found it was that you have a good increase in the number of women having occupations in a number of diversified forms; but this was only because of the modern tendency to give women equality with men.</P>
    <P>We are not asked in this Bill to stop that tendency.  What we are asked to do is to give the Minister power uncontrolled by anyone in this House to stop it at any moment.  There has been quite an amount of agitation over this, and I gather there has been quite a number of leaflets going around.  I turn to this objection here on both grounds: first, that it is undesirable and that it is retrogressive as being reactionary in its tendencies; secondly, it is undesirable as going into a new item of bureaucratic control outside the scope of this House&mdash;giving the Minister power to determine in respect of sex that he will make a discrimination and that he can fling out any class with no arguments used for it. The section says that the Minister may prohibit the employment of women to do certain forms of industrial work. It may be that it is not inconceivable at all that there should be a certain number of occupations sheltered in which those who hold fanatical points <Col N="1071" /> of view would agree that it was undesirable to have women working.  I think the women folk could claim that there could be scheduled a few classes of occupations in which it would be undesirable to have men employed. Then the Minister takes power to fix the proportion which the female workers employed by any firm will bear to the number of non-female workers.  Can we have any indication from the Minister why this power is sought?  It seems a peculiar power to give the Minister when it is equated with the section that comes before it. It can be argued from two grounds.</P>
    <P>That clause about young persons could be supported by two arguments: one, that it is undesirable from the social or humanitarian point of view to have young people employed in certain activities so as to bear more than a fair proportion of the whole.  Secondly, it could be argued that, employment being scarce, we should do our best to get adults to work.  The second argument could hardly be used in these days when the modern world has got us into our present position with regard to female wage earners.  That argument could hardly be used in regard to that second point, and I do not think it is going to be used except in regard to those businesses to which the humanitarian argument is applicable.  If that is so you can only schedule a certain number of businesses to which that argument would apply&mdash;a very small number indeed.  If we do schedule a few we possibly would get agreement.  I suggest that even if it comes to mutilating the Bill and getting in more provisions it would be well to do so to satisfy an apprehension that may be argued out to the effect that this is a retrogressive step intended to oust women from employment &mdash; to let men in because women are women and men are men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a certain opposition voiced to this section of the Bill on the ground that it was designed to prejudice a number of women in getting industrial employment and, therefore, is retrogressive legislation of anti-feminist <Col N="1072" /> nature.  I find it very hard to take that contention seriously.  It is not to-day, or yesterday, that the idea of legislation to prevent women from being employed in certain forms of industrial work was first conceived.  But it was only quite recently that any argument was advanced that such legislation was of an anti-feminist or retrogressive character.  I certainly came up against it for the first time when I was attending an international conference at Geneva, when certain suggestions were under discussion for the purpose of prohibiting the employment of women in certain industries. I received circulars from some women's international organisations protesting against the adoption of these conventions on the ground that they were designed to create positions of inequality so far as the law was concerned in respect of the sexes.</P>
      <P>There is, at present, embodied in the law of this and other countries various provisions to prohibit the employment of women in occupations of one kind or another.  It is not lawful to employ women underground in mines, or to employ women at night in certain occupations.  There are other occupations, also, in respect of which I think it is undesirable that women should be employed because the work involved is of a kind unsuitable to women.  These occupations are followed by men at the present time. If I was asked to give an example of them I would say, practically, any one of the occupations which are at present exclusively followed by men. Deputy P.S. Doyle has an amendment, No. 43, on the Paper designed to make it unlawful for women to be employed at work of stoking or attending steam boilers.  I think it is undesirable that women should be employed at work of that kind; and there should exist in a Bill designed to control industrial employment power to prohibit the employment of women at certain specified work.  That power is not unlimited. The section provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must consult all interested parties in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is not required to get their agreement, it is true.  But the regulations when made are laid on the Table of the House, and may be annulled by a resolution of either House, within the usual period of 21 days.</P>
      <P>The fact that women may be employed in occupations unsuitable to women is not the sole reason why I am proposing the adoption of this section.  The tendency of women to replace men in industry has been facilitated by technical developments of one kind or another.  The fact that women are willing to work for wages which men would not accept, that trades unions have found them more difficult to organise, and that there are other circumstances which make it almost inevitable that the prevailing wage for women workers will be lower than for male workers, has accelerated the tendency to employ women at work that men used to do, now that it is possible for them to do that work with the aid of mechanical devices and processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is made that we should try to deal with this problem by legislation designed to insure that where men and women are employed at a similar class of work they should be paid the same rate of wages.  Legislation of that kind, I think, would have more effect in preventing the employment of women in industry than anything in this Bill.  I do not think we could get far with that legislation because, as Deputies are aware, the tendency, in such cases, would be to bring down the prevailing rates of wages for men to the level at which women are prepared to work.  The average rate of wages for men, in any industry is fixed generally at such level as will enable a man to maintain himself, plus his family. The majority of men who work are married men with families and dependents.  On the other hand the majority of women engaged in industrial work are not married, and, although some have dependents, a large number of them have no dependents and, consequently, the wages that women as a class, are prepared to accept from industry are usually lower than would <Col N="1074" /> be possible for a man to maintain himself and his family on.  I do not think, however, it is possible for us to go back on what has been done already in the form of the invasion of industry by women.</P>
    <P>A very large amount of industrial work now done is work for which women are adapted perhaps more than men.  In any industry in which female employment is, and has been, the practice, I do not think we could attempt any revolutionary changes at all.  But I think it is desirable that we should have power to arrest the tendency at any time we see it operating in a manner such as is likely to create further problems.  There are industries at the present time in which men only are employed, and in respect to which, nevertheless, developments are taking place which may make it possible for women to do the work these men are now doing.  If these developments occur, I think it is desirable that we should have power, when we deem it necessary to use it after consultation with the interested parties, to ensure that men will continue to be employed. We have had a case of that kind only quite recently in certain industries where the general adoption of certain machines resulted in the employment of women to do work which men had previously regarded as their own.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill is not in any way designed to be a method of dealing with unemployment.  I said in introducing the Bill that I did not regard it as offering any solution of our unemployment problem.  It may help us in certain directions to ease that problem but it certainly will not remove it nor do I think any law of this kind dealing with the hours of work, or the regulation of what classes of persons might engage in particular forms of work, will solve unemployment, but I think most Deputies will agree that it would create social problems of the first magnitude if there should be any considerable acceleration of the tendency to replace men by women in industrial work.  It is desirable that there should be power in existence to check any such tendency if it should develop in future to any greater extent <Col N="1075" /> than in the past.  We cannot have regard to purely theoretical considerations in dealing with matters of this kind; we must have regard to practical considerations.</P>
    <P>Taken theoretically, the section may be regarded as placing women, not in a position of equality with men, but in a position of inequality.  I think that contention does not hold water at all. It is obviously desirable that we should have power to see that persons are not employed upon work for which they are not fitted.  The section which precedes this giving power to restrict or prohibit the employment of young persons has an obvious need behind it.  I think the same thing can be said of Section 12.  The powers imposed in this section should, in my opinion, be used to check any tendency to employ women in occupations in which men are now employed exclusively, or to prevent women being employed in work which because of its nature is unsuitable for women, and not for the purpose of trying to undo anything that has been done in the matter of the replacement of men by women in industrial occupations.</P>
    <P>I have received resolutions passed by various labour organisations lately, male labour organisations, urging that this section of the Bill should be used drastically in relation to certain trades and occupations but I do not think that could be done.  Certainly, I think this power should not be used to put out of employment any considerable number of persons now employed. There may be individual cases.  I think there is a case which was mentioned here already in which a woman employee is the stoker of a boiler.  I think we should prevent women being employed in work of that kind.  There might be an individual woman here and there who would lose employment on that account but we could not deal with large numbers in that way by making regulations under that section. I, for one, would not propose to do it.</P>
    <P>The main reason, therefore, why this section is considered desirable is because it is thought necessary that there should be power to restrict or prevent the employment of women in occupations for which they are unsuitable, a <Col N="1076" /> power which in the past was conferred by special Acts, such as the Acts which prohibited the employment of women in coal mines but which in future will be exercisable in accordance with the provisions of this section.  Secondly, it is thought desirable that there should be power to check any new tendency developing in the future to replace men by women in occupations in which men are now generally employed and which might possibly become suitable for women because of technical developments.  One of the main causes of unemployment has, of course, been the fact that the technical development of industry has far outrun man's ability to use the new powers, which it has conferred upon him, wisely and effectively.  The measures which we are taking in order to deal with the difficulties created and to prevent undue dislocation or undue hardship are in a sense temporary expedients while mankind is endeavouring to find out the fundamental causes of its economic troubles.</P>
    <P>The phenomena we have witnessed here in the matter of unemployment and the tendency to substitute men by women have, of course, been repeated in all countries.  Our problem is in no way unique, although attempts are being made through the International Labour Office to get some common policy adopted internationally for dealing with these matters.  The International Labour Office, which cannot be regarded as an opponent of progress, has thought fit to ignore, and certainly to refuse to be affected by, representations made on the grounds that certain of its conventions placed women in a position of legal inequality.  They considered the practical results they desired and a large number of conventions adopted are designed to prevent the employment of women in particular industries or to restrict their employment at certain hours of the day or night or in certain circumstances.  If we keep in line with the movement introduced at the International Labour Office, I think we will be in no way open to the charge of being retrogressive. On the contrary, we shall have a code of laws which, from the point of progress, will be as advanced as <Col N="1077" /> those operating in any country in the world.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Kelly is in any doubt as to what he ought to say to the women, let him say that the Minister is looking after them.  The Minister is full of care for them&mdash;the sort of care that the bold bad wolf had for little Red Riding Hood.  I never heard such a stream of what I must describe as a sort of bourgeois reaction in my life.  The Minister thinks we are <Col N="1078" /> going to have a grand progressive code.  One of the things is that he must have power to arrest the tendency that apparently there is towards women getting into industry.  If Deputy Kelly tells the women who bother him that the Minister is simply going to arrest the tendency which is showing at the moment towards women getting into industries where men used to be, I am sure they will go away happy.  It is decidedly reactionary.</P>
      <P>I was hoping that we might have heard the Labour point of view on this. I thought the Labour principle on everything was equal opportunity for all.  I thought the attitude was that there should be equal opportunity for talent and agility, whether with the mind or the hands, in the way of working at machines or manually.  Now, we are apparently to decide that it is equal opportunity, but we are going to have some sort of sex bar.  Let me say that if by simply leaving things as they are, not moving in another direction, excluding this Section 12, there was any danger that that was going to operate in the way of allowing the women's wage in certain industries to become the standard for all, and if the trade unions could not prevent that, then this section and the drastic use of it may be necessary.  But I doubt whether that will ever occur.  I doubt, if it shows any signs of developing or that the trade unions are so weak that they will not be able to prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember we have got this point definitely into the open: that this is not merely a matter of scheduling a few undesirable trades about which there probably would be common agreement in this House.  What the Minister says is: &ldquo;I want power from time to time to determine (a) whether women will be employed at all; and (b) in what proportions; I want to have that power because it is my intention to arrest the modern tendency of women getting into industry.&rdquo;  That is a clear-cut statement, and that is what anybody who finds himself bothered by these women's associations has to put to them as the best that can be got.  I think there will <Col N="1079" /> not be much satisfaction gained from that answer, because they have objection, first of all, to this section being there at all; and, secondly, a very definite objection to giving this power to an individual who may change, whose views may change, or whose attitude towards women in industry may change.  Yet this House is going to vote, through the medium of this measure that an individual Minister will have power to restrict the employment of women in industry in whatever way he likes.</P>
    <P>We are told, of course, that regulations will have to be made and that they must lie on the Table of the House.  Look at what will happen. Deputy Kelly has some doubts about whether women ought to be restricted in employment in certain industries. Suddenly there is a regulation flashed, and Deputy Kelly is, therefore, put in the predicament that he must vote against his Party if he stands by a motion from this side of the House to annul that regulation; and the matter becomes a Party matter at once.  It is not that this will be a proposal of the Minister; it will be an accomplished fact by the time that the Deputy gives his vote on it.</P>
    <P>Although it is a bad thing in itself, I suggest that the best thing to do is that the Minister should at any rate schedule groups of trades from which he wants women entirely prohibited and then we can debate these.  I suggest that after that the power of fixing proportions as between men and women in industry should be entirely taken from him.  I am not going to the point of saying that the modern business world should be allowed to operate without the interaction of the trade unions with regard to men and women.  Things will find their level; the sexes will find their level in business, and you will have the interaction of the trade unions to watch the impact of that on the point of wages. Taking that section out of the Bill does not mean, as a matter of law, that you are going to have, say, so many women employed&mdash;equal representation, so to speak, in trades and <Col N="1080" /> industries for women and men.  It only means that you leave the situation as it is.  The Minister objects to that situation for the reason stated, that there is a tendency these days for women to flow into industry and to do out the men.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he does not regard this Bill as a solution of the unemployment problem.  Nobody does.  This can be said, at any rate: that if it were not for the problem of unemployment this Bill would be highly improper.  The Bill is antisocial because it is an attempt to restrict the free operation of people in regard to their own labour and their use of that labour.  It is decidedly retrogressive in its whole tendency in that respect.  We have been driven, logically I think, to adopt the position that Deputy Norton spoke of: that you are not merely to call it an offence for an employer to employ people outside the conditions of this Bill, but to call it an offence for a worker to work even in his own hours, if he is outside the conditions of employment of this Bill.  That is the logical point to which Deputy Norton was driven.  I agree that it is the logical outcome of the measure.</P>
    <P>The whole tendency of this is absurd. It is most restrictive&mdash;completely away from the freedom of the ordinary individual with regard to what he wants to do in the world.  It is completely reactionary in that way.  The only thing that makes it not completely improper is that there is a bad unemployment problem and that this may, to some extent, relieve it.  You have some artificial spreading of employment, but you do not at all increase employment.  You simply spread it a little better.  Some who have it will not get as much as they used to, and some who have not it will get a little.  That tendency is entirely nullified by other activities of the Government, where you have a gap between what a working man gets for his work and what a man not working gets for not working.  There is such a close approximation between the wages earned and the doles given that it entirely nullifies any good there may be in this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The Minister reveals an extraordinary mentality.  His remarks proceeded somewhat in this way: that women at the moment are getting more occupation in industry, because it has to be recognised&mdash;and the Minister apparently boasts that he cannot set back the clock&mdash;that we are in a machine age.  As there are machines now used for work where muscle was formerly required, the women can employ their handiness on the machines where previously, because they were deficient in muscular power, they could not be operating.  In certain types of industry we have machines, and women are getting more and more into employment because there are machines to ease the human effort.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister tells us that the trouble is that technical equipment has outrun man's power to utilise and use that equipment wisely.  It has not. There are ghastly pictures to be painted of the unsatisfied demands of the people.  What has happened is, not that the technical equipment has outrun man's power to use it, but that the folly of politicians has prevented the proper use of the goods that would flow from the technical equipment. We are in the middle of that.  All these restrictions of the narrow nationalistic type are preventing the flow from each country of the goods that country can produce in abundance and the sharing of those amongst other peoples.  Why should we tie ourselves down to a sort of funny asceticism and make people suffer in this ascetic way because they are deluded into the belief that there is some sentimental satisfaction to be got through asceticism.  The Minister in this Bill is simply saying that we have got into the position in which intellectual development has brought about a machine age, and that this has resulted in a rush of women into all kinds of employment.  His attitude is that we should prevent that happening: that we should not allow women to continue in certain types of occupation into which they have forced themselves. The Minister does not defend this restriction except on humanitarian grounds.  He simply thinks that it is <Col N="1082" /> bad not to be in a position to be able to arrest that tendency.  But why should that tendency be arrested?  The Minister's thesis cannot be supported by anyone who holds to the theory of equal opportunity for all.</P>
    <P>The accident of birth has decided that certain people are womenfolk and certain others menfolk.  If there is going to be segregation on that line, then let us have it and leave the humanitarian side out of it altogether. Let us see if we can get unanimity, or at least something approaching agreement, on certain occupations in which women should not be employed.  Certain groups of women will object to that.  They will not be reconciled to it, but at any rate the objection to that could be narrowed to a certain point. Let us leave the humanitarian argument aside and say that there are certain occupations which in our wisdom &mdash;in this House composed almost entirely of men&mdash;we will not allow women to enter into.  Why not cut out all this stuff about humanitarianism, and say that, save for certain things, we will not encourage women to come into our territory: that what we have we will hold, according to the good old man in possession argument.  There has been no argument other than that used.</P>
    <P>There is a rather important social matter to be dealt with in this clause and it should be argued.  The Minister made a point about the Labour Office at Geneva.  He referred to the fact that he discovered, for the first time, that women's organisations were active at Geneva last year.  That is explained possibly by the fact that it was the Minister's first time at Geneva.  As far as my memory goes of all activities at Geneva&mdash;Labour or League of Nations&mdash;women's organisations have been active on this point only, not that they want things equalised but rather that they do not want the present reaction against the old tendency to drive them out of occupation.  They do not want to see that increased.  They would be content simply to stop the grasping activities of the men's side of humanity in this matter.  I do not stand for anything in the nature of female <Col N="1083" /> employment if that is going to be used as a lever to depress the wages of men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I could rely on the Deputy and his colleagues to prevent it through their industrial organisations, and I do not think that I will get a confession from them that they are not equal to that.  There is a case to be made if certain industries are being run unfairly upon cheap female labour.  If that is so, then that is a matter to be attended to.  We are not going to do anything in favour of women in this.  We are simply preventing the Minister doing something aggressively against them.  I do not think that stopping him from entering on that course is going to disturb wages in the whole community for men and women.  If the contrary is thought, let us be told where the danger is, and let us have a clear declaration from the Labour people that there is another way of meeting the situation besides leaving this to the decision of one man whose views about the employment of women may undergo great changes. Are we to be told that there is no other alternative: that we must accept the opinion of one man and that what he says goes?  I think the whole thing is definitely retrogressive.  I think that we should cut out this clause&mdash;scheduling certain groups of trades if it is thought well to do so&mdash;and leave the situation as it was before.  The Minister's statement was, I think, wrapped up by a world context and not an Irish Free State context at all.  I think it cannot be alleged that unemployment in this country is to any substantial degree affected by the influx of women into industry in which they were not previously occupied.  You may have there just a little reflex of the modern tendency of women to get into work, but I think that is all.  There is the problem of the equality of the sexes, but I think it is too late to-night to divide on that.  I do, however, propose to divide the House on the point of principle.</P>

      <P>To-day, I asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware <Col N="1086" /> that the Housing Scheme formulated by the Clonakilty Urban Council is being held up as a result of the Minister's refusal to sanction the appointment of the Clerk of Works selected by the Urban Council; that the Council is satisfied that the Clerk of Works whom they have selected possesses the necessary qualifications to carry out the duties efficiently; and if, in the circumstances, he will give the necessary sanction to the appointment made and allow the work to be proceeded with at once.</P>
      <P>The reply was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The person selected by the Clonakilty Urban District Council for the position of Clerk of Works for the proposed housing scheme in the district is aged 74 years and is in receipt of an old age pension.  He has had no previous experience as Clerk of Works.  I do not consider that he is a suitable person for the position and I am not prepared to sanction his employment by the Council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is not one of national importance but it is one of much local importance.  It reflects on the conduct of the Local Government Department and on their method of making appointments. The Clonakilty Urban Council decided to formulate a building scheme and, on the 16th May, a circular was sent to them asking them to advertise for a clerk of works.  This was done and, at a meeting on December 4, Mr. Harte was appointed by six votes to three for Mr. Hurley.  They are both equally competent and I do not want to say a word for one as against the other.  They are both good men and both were recommended by the engineer as equally suitable.  Mr. Harte, however, received the majority vote. A letter was received on December 20 from the Local Government Department stating that, as Mr. Harte and Mr. Hurley were equally suitable, preference should be given to Mr. Hurley on account of his satisfactory record on previous schemes.  The reason the urban council gave this appointment to <Col N="1087" /> Mr. Harte was that Mr. Hurley had carried out, as clerk of works, a previous scheme.  Mr. Hurley is town surveyor, for which he is drawing a salary, and the council thought that it would be only fair to give a turn to the other man, who is equally competent.  Nothing was heard from 20th December to 20th February, when there was a letter from the Department asking for particulars of Mr. Harte's age.  In the meantime&mdash;and this is where the reflection on the Local Government Department comes in&mdash;the local Fianna Fáil Club took the matter up and brought politics into it&mdash;a rotten thing.  They suggested, I take it, to the Local Government Department that Mr. Hurley should get the position in defiance of the majority wish of the urban council.  It took them 18 weeks to find out anything about Mr. Harte's age. Until I got the reply to my query to-day, I did not know what his age was, but I knew that he had been an old-age pensioner for a year or two.  Nevertheless, he is an active, energetic man and possesses the full qualifications.</P>
    <P>The urban council decided, in view of this, that they would adhere to their decision and give Mr. Harte the position. On 23rd March there was another letter stating that the Minister was not prepared to sanction Mr. Harte and that the council should proceed to appoint Mr. Hurley.  There was a further letter refusing to sanction the appointment of Mr. Harte and declining to recommend the issue of any instalment of the loan until Mr. Hurley had been appointed.  The majority of the urban council still refused to appoint Mr. Hurley because they regarded Mr. Harte as a man who possessed all the necessary qualifications. They also thought it unfair that political issues should crop up after Mr. Harte had been chosen by a majority of the council returned by the votes of the ratepayers.  Mr. Harte has worked for a considerable time as builder and contractor.  He has worked for different men.  He has had large experience, is active and energetic, and the Minister, in these circumstances, should not act contrary to the wishes of the majority of the urban council. <Col N="1088" /> It was unfair that the local Fianna Fáil Club should approach their Dáil representative for the area and try to get the decision of the council upset.  If procedure of this sort is tolerated, it will have a very bad effect on the community and will not reflect much credit on the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Some masons in Clonakilty and others who would be employed on this scheme were under the impression that it was the Urban Council who were holding up the scheme.  I was glad to get the admission in the first part of the reply to-day that the scheme was held up as a result of the refusal of the Department to sanction the appointment made by the Urban Council.  I should like to stress the point that, until now, there was no communication sent to the Urban Council with reference to Mr. Harte's age.  In the advertisement, there were no age limits stated, and why should the Department of Local Government come along now, at the end of six months, and turn down the selection made by the Urban Council owing to an objection made on the score of age?  I think that that is a very uncalled for action on the part of the Local Government Department.  It looks as if they were inclined to be partisan, and were not going to allow the majority of a council freedom of choice even when the man chosen is competent for the work.  The Urban Council are the best judges as to whether a man is fit for the work or not, and the matter should be left in their hands.  In this case, the candidate selected by the majority of the Council should, undoubtedly, be sanctioned by the Department.</P>
    <P>A deputation of workers waited on Clonakilty Urban Council and asked why the scheme was not being carried out.  The Council explained that the delay was the result of the action of the Local Government Department. That is confirmed by the Minister's reply.  If there is any further delay the blame must be thrown on the Department.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider the decision in this case, and give the Urban <Col N="1089" /> Council, as they have selected a man, an opportunity of letting him go on with the work.  He is fully competent to carry out the work.  I hope the Department will not be riding the high horse, but will give the Council the opportunity of proceeding with the scheme so that they may give tradesmen and others employment that they are anxious to get.  If the question of age was to be raised, that should have been done in the first instance, when the Urban Council was asked to advertise for a clerk of works.  The Minister should have suggested an age limit then.  It is unfair to do so at the end of four or five months.  I trust the Department will now accede to the wishes of the Urban Council.  The report of the engineer to the Council stated that both men were competent to carry out the work.  That was also the opinion of the majority of the members of the Council, who hope that the Minister will accede to their wishes and let the work proceed forthwith. The way the Department of Local Government is being worked is, I think, a reflection on the attitude of the members of the Council and, if it continues, it will not bring any credit either on the Department or on the country.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy O'Donovan in the position he finds himself in, in relation to this appointment in Cork.  I suppose the only possible justification that he could appear to give for raising this question in the House, much less on the Adjournment, would be an endeavour to give it a political tinge.  I think in turn I would be justified in assuming that this old Corkonian, Mr. Harte, is a true blue supporter of the Deputy and his Party.  Otherwise I do not think we would have the question raised in the House.  So far as the Deputy's recital of the course of events is concerned I have no fault to find.  The position was advertised in accordance with a circular letter from the Department of Local Government and the applications were referred <Col N="1090" /> to the engineer for report.  The Deputy is not quite accurate in his interpretation of that report.  The engineer in charge of the scheme reported that Messrs.  Harte and Hurley were equally suitable, as far as practical experience and general knowledge of building work goes.  But, he also reported that Mr. Hurley had already acted on three housing schemes and was found to be trustworthy and reliable.  These two applicants for the position might be equally suitable, so far as practical experience and general knowledge of building work goes, but they might be altogether unsuitable from other standpoints&mdash;for example, age and physical ability to carry out the work entailed.  If Deputy O'Donovan is sincere in the case he made on behalf of Mr. Harte he is really convinced that a man in his seventy-fifth year is a suitable and proper person for work on a scheme that involves climbing up scaffolds and inspecting the laying of roofs of houses.  Well, I would be surprised if he really felt in his heart that there was any genuine substance in the case he made on behalf of his client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand and sympathise with his position.  I am quite sure Deputy O'Donovan might not go back to Clonakilty to-morrow if he had not raised this question in the House. He will be in a good position to say to his political adherents that on the Adjournment: &ldquo;I did my best and, as far as I could fight the case, I fought it.&rdquo;  So far as that aspect of it is concerned I have no fault to find with Deputy O'Donovan.  He has played up to his political Party and dons his best to keep them humoured.  I understand it is a difficult job, and that it is getting more difficult in Cork from day to day.  Mr. Hurley is at present town surveyor in Clonakilty, and, if he were appointed, I presume Deputy O'Donovan or anyone else would not suggest that he would not be a suitable person for the position.  But the appointment of Mr. Hurley, with a slight addition to his present salary as town surveyor, would, at least, entail a corresponding saving in the cost of the housing scheme.  I am sure Deputy O'Donovan will agree with me that the <Col N="1091" /> closest scrutiny of every penny of expenditure on housing schemes has to be exercised, in order that it may be possible for the houses to be let at a rent that is within the capacity of the tenants to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are improving our methods even now it is something the Deputy should be grateful for.  I suggest that Deputy O'Donovan, after giving full weight and consideration to the natural virility and energy of Corkmen, will agree that a man in his seventy-fifth year is not a suitable and proper person to be appointed clerk of works on a housing scheme.  Even a Corkman might reasonably be asked to retire from business at 75 years of age. But Mr. Harte, in fact, retired some years ago.  He is in receipt of the full old age pension of 10/- weekly.  Before he got the pension the local pensions committee consisting of Corkmen, having the facts of the case before them, came to the conclusion that he was incapable of earning more than 6/- weekly.  If a jury of Corkmen decided that a man was not capable of earning for some time more than 6/- weekly, surely the Deputy cannot find fault with the Department of Local Government for refusing to agree that he is suddenly capable of earning £3 10s. a week.  On the other hand, if he has been capable of earning more than 6/- weekly, during all the time he has been drawing the old age pension, then the question of reviewing his claim and right to have the pension will have to be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Deputy Dillon is not particularly interested in this case, unless, of course, the interest that he shows in every question raised in this House.  He can never restrain <Col N="1092" /> himself from butting in on questions relating to places from Cork to Donegal.</P>

      <P>As I said on previous debates on which Deputy Dillon has been interested, no one pays very much attention to the Deputy, because that is his way.  He cannot restrain himself and, I suggest, is not personally responsible, but we have a certain amount of sympathy for him.</P>

      <P>On the question of the holding up of the housing scheme, let us be clear about the position.  Deputy O'Donovan would like to saddle all the blame for holding up the housing scheme on the Department of Local Government.  The Department has made its position clear on this matter time and time again.  It has been made perfectly clear to Clonakilty Urban Council that the Minister is not prepared to sanction this old man in his seventy-fifth year as clerk of works.  In spite of that, the council persisted in their refusal to make an appointment. The onus for any further delay that takes place must rest on the council, and I ask Deputy O'Donovan to take this message back to Clonakilty Urban Council, when reporting on his efforts on behalf of his old friend in Cork: that if the urban council persists in obstructing the Government in their efforts to provide suitable houses for the poor, the necessary steps will be taken, if the Minister is forced to it, to see that the housing policy of the Government is carried out in Clonakilty, the same as in every other part of the country.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, June 27th.</P>
