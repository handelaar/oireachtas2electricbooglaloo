      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state what were his reasons for instructing members of the Gárda Síochána to inform the general secretary of Fine Gael that if a raffle or sweepstakes which that organisation proposed to carry out in connection with the Cambridgeshire, 1935, sweep promoted by Hospitals Trust, was carried out, legal proceedings would be instituted in connection therewith, and whether he is aware that seven raffles similar to the one in question had been carried out previously by that organisation without any interference by the Gárda Síochána and whether he is aware that prior to the date of the information aforesaid heavy expense had been incurred by that organisation in relation to the said proposed raffle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I arranged for the broadcast on the 2nd September last of a notice relating to the position of lotteries other than those organised under the Public Charitable Hospitals Act, 1933, and that notice was printed in full in the daily papers of the following day.  The notice made it clear that lotteries otherwise than in aid of strictly charitable objects would no longer be tolerated.  Accordingly, the organisers of a sweepstake in aid of Fine Gael were informed that if the lottery in question was not forthwith abandoned the necessary steps would be taken to deal with it by way of legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>As regards previous lotteries promoted by the same organisation, I received a letter from the General Secretary of Fine Gael in which it was stated that seven such lotteries had been held.  A reply was sent explaining that it was, in fact, the increasing tendency to disregard the law on the subject which was illustrated by that statement which made it necessary to give public notice, as had been done that it was intended to enforce the law more strictly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> I have no information as to the amount of the expenses which had been incurred in connection with this lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is discrimination on the part of the Guards in dealing with this matter and, in view of that, will he furnish a return as to the number of those draws held in various parts of the country which necessitated his operating the Act in this particular way?  Will he also issue a return as to the number of persons or bodies on whom the Guards have called to intimate that lotteries which were being carried on by them should be dropped, because there are lotteries being carried on by people on whom the Guards have not called?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>During the last few months I have been in touch with and have received deputations representative of different tenant organisations regarding the demand for further remedial legislation in favour of town tenants.  I have explained to these representatives that, in my view, the first essential towards any progress in this matter is that a statement should be prepared setting out full particulars of a large number of cases, distributed as widely as possible over the country, which can be relied upon as typical examples of the hardships complained of.  As soon as such a statement is furnished I shall see that it receives the most careful examination as a preliminary to any further steps which the Government may consider it desirable to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the prices of flour and bread have been increased substantially in recent months; whether there is any justification for these increases, which bring the current prices of the commodities mentioned considerably above the competitive prices elsewhere; whether it is a fact that the Prices Commission have reported that the prices charged for flour and bread are excessive, and whether he will indicate the steps which it is proposed to take for regulating prices and profits in the flour-milling and bread-producing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there have been increases in the prices of flour and bread during recent months. Increases in the prices of flour are attributable to various causes of which the principal are (a) the fact that millers have now to pay the full guaranteed price for native wheat, (b) increased production of native wheat and (c) increased prices for imported wheat.  The Prices Commission have reported that the price of flour was unduly high during the period in 1934 covered by the Commission's inquiry but I have since been given an undertaking on behalf of the Saorstát flour millers that their prices are arranged in accordance with the formula set out in the Commission's report.  Whether in fact current prices for flour have been fixed in accordance with this formula is at present the subject of an inquiry by my Department.</P>
      <P>The whole question of bread prices is under active consideration both by the Prices Commission and by the Department.  It is hoped that in the near future new legislation will be brought before the Dáil to deal generally with bread prices.</P>

Owing to the receipt of a considerable number of new applications following the insertion of a notice in the Press that the final date for receiving applications would be the 30th September, 1935, it has not yet been possible for the Committee of Inquiry into the cases of civil servants who resigned or were dismissed for political reasons to present its final report.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained yesterday evening why it was desired to make this change in the Bill, and the improvement that it would effect in the definition of continuous employment. The only point that arose from the discussion was the advisability of having power to vary the number of hours in the year which would constitute continuous employment; the necessity for that variation arising possibly from the fact that the normal working week of particular classes of workers is now below 48 hours, or may in the future become below 48 hours.  I agree that there should be power to vary the number of hours set out in the amendment, and I am considering the form of an amendment to that end which it would be necessary to introduce on the Report Stage, if we decide to do so. It is undesirable that the number of hours should be fixed in the Bill and be unchangeable, except by amending legislation, because the aim of the Bill is to effect generally a reduction in the working hours.  That reduction could not be effected if it meant that the workers concerned could not qualify to receive the annual holidays.  Therefore, while I think this method of determining continuous employment is the best, and that this amendment should be inserted, I will have consideration given to the advisability of producing <Col N="266" /> on the Report Stage an amendment conferring power in some form to vary the number of hours in the year that will constitute continuous employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that while the Minister will take power in the Bill to vary the number of hours to qualify for holidays, nevertheless that he will keep the datum line at 1,800 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it that the datum line of 1,800 hours is something more than 75 per cent. of the full year's work on the basis of a 48-hour week. I suggest that the Minister should fix a datum line on 75 per cent. of the normal working period only on the basis of a 44-hour week, and not on the basis of a 48-hour week.  The Minister knows that in a very large number of occupations the working week is in the vicinity of 44 hours, and that the tendency of this Bill will be probably to reduce the working week to 44 hours. If the Minister will take 44 hours as the figure upon which he ought to base the datum line, I think he will produce a figure based on 75 per cent. of the normal number of working hours in a year, which would meet the point Deputy Keyes has in mind and, at the same time, represent a greater approximation to fairness than 1,800 hours does in these circumstances.  The Minister is not giving very much away, but he certainly will meet the point raised by Deputy Keyes, and which deserves to be met.  At the same time, he will have the power which he seeks to make the variations, and probably any variations made by the Minister at an early date will bring the Bill into line with the 1,700 hour average over a period of one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever number appears in the Bill must be related to the 48 hours, which is the working week prescribed as the maximum in the Bill, and I do not think that 1,800 hours in a year is an unreasonable proportion in relation to a 48-hour week.  But if in any particular trade it is now the practice, or if in future it should become the law that a shorter working week would operate, then this <Col N="267" /> has to be revised, not necessarily revised proportionately, but downwards to some extent, because otherwise you might have a position in which a large number of workers, because of the reduction in the working week, would be unable to qualify for the annual holidays; in fact, it would in certain circumstances become illegal to qualify for the annual holidays.  In these circumstances, I agree that this number should be varied, but in so far as the maximum working week prescribed in the Bill is 48 hours, I think 1,800 hours in the year is a reasonable figure to put in the Bill.  I do not think it is unduly high in relation to a 48-hour week, but I agree that it should be capable of being reduced when the working week is shorter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the particular case I cited last evening, where men work three-quarters or 75 per cent. of the available time in the way of days &mdash;they work four days out of six, and they are cut off for two days; and as they have been working like that for a period of over five years it has come to be recognised as a fairly established practice&mdash;would it not be equitable to fix the number of hours at 75 per cent. of the available work provided?  In this case it is a 47-hour week over six days, and they work four days, making 34 hours in all.  That gives them a total of 1,768 hours, which would bring them under the 1,800 hours, which would be definitely putting them outside the intention of the Bill.  Would it not be feasible to prescribe for three-quarters of the days of the week or 75 per cent. of the days available, or alternatively 1,800 hours or 1,700 hours or 1,600 hours, which will be 75 per cent. of the working week?  In that way you will meet the cases where half-time or three-quarter time has been put into operation in various industries.  It will definitely cover the point which I raised which deals with a very hard case.</P>

Deputy Keyes speaks of a man who works four days in the week and is laid off <Col N="268" /> for two days; then works four days in the next week and is laid off for two days.  The terms of the amendment are &ldquo;during which he has been continuously in the employment of such employer.&rdquo;  Surely a workman who is only working four days in the week and is laid off for two days cannot be held to be in continuous employment?  I remember at an early stage we discussed that at some length, and I know that in connection with the Galway Harbour Bill that question arose, and it was held that a man so employed would not come within the terms of the Bill, which described a workman as being continuously employed.</P>

      <P>I would be amazed if the Minister took that reading of it.  I spoke of servants of the railway company who in some instances have worked for 40 years.  They are at the disposal of the railway company on Friday and Saturday just as they are on the other days of the week.  If that is not continuous employment, just because the company sees fit only to give them four days' work in the week, I do not know what it is.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing one way or the other.  I am directing the attention of the Minister to something that might pass by unobserved.  I am giving the House the benefit of the experience I had when on the Committee of the Galway Harbour Bill when that question arose, and the best legal opinion before us informed us that a person working in that way would not be deemed to be in continuous employment.  I am drawing the attention of the Minister and interested Deputies to the fact, so that if it has to be altered it may be altered now and not pass into the Bill and require another Bill to set it right.</P>

      <P>I think there is no doubt that the workers to whom Deputy Keyes refers are continuously employed by the same employer even though they may be doing a 37- or 38-hour week at present.  I agree with Deputy Keyes that there should be power to prescribe a lower number of hours in the year to deal with the <Col N="269" /> difficulties of certain cases.  I object to taking the particular type of case which he has in mind as typical, as it is rather an abnormal type of case. A typical case is where the worker does a full working week which is nevertheless less than 40 hours.</P>

      <P>I am not saying it is unique, but it is not the type of case on which I should like to build legislation. Legislation should be built up against normal conditions.  There should be power to prescribe variations in the number of hours per year in order to deal with cases where the working week of a person continuously employed is less than the maximum prescribed by the Bill.  I am considering what amendment would be necessary in order to have power so to prescribe.  I do not think we should alter the maximum in the Bill, but merely take power to reduce the maximum wherever the circumstances seem to justify a reduction of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be prepared to meet the particular case, but the Deputy will appreciate that there will be many cases of all kinds similar to that mentioned by Deputy Keyes, where, however, it may be that there was not continuous employment.  We have to walk warily and make sure that we are not defeating the purpose of other sections of the Bill, which prescribe that in lieu of holidays certain payments are to be made where the continuity of the employment is broken.  A worker who does four or four-and-a-half days every week is undoubtedly continuously employed, but workers in industries similarly situated might do one month out of two months, or two months out of three, and they would be in a somewhat different position and should be <Col N="270" /> dealt with in a different way.  In so far as there is no doubt that the workers are continuously employed in the same occupation by the same employer, I think they should be met in the way I suggest by a reduction of this maximum.</P>

The employer might argue, however, that, by reason of the fact that the worker only worked four days in the week for him, he should not be liable for those other two days.

      <P>I hold that there is a very real danger there which ought to be met by the Minister, by defining what continuous employment means. I think that constant employment would be better, because there can be regularity in employment even if it is only one day or a half a day per week. A person might only work one day of the week, but would be constantly employed for that one day or two days, or even a half a day per week; but the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; has a much more serious significance than &ldquo;constantly&rdquo; or &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; employed. I suggest to the Minister that there is a very real difficulty there which ought to be met.  I suggest that it ought to be met by eliminating the word &ldquo;continuously,&rdquo; and substituting the word &ldquo;regularly,&rdquo; or that it should <Col N="273" /> be made clear that the 1,800 hours' work must be with the same employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the meaning is quite obvious.  We propose that a worker becomes entitled to, and must receive, six consecutive days' leave in every employment year; that is, provided he has been continuously in the employment of the particular employer and has worked 1,800 hours, which is substantially less than one year; that is because of the employment having been interrupted&mdash;as employment is frequently interrupted &mdash;and which interruption did not terminate the contract between the employer and the employee, which would terminate his employment.</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister can get information from people working in the Inchicore Works.  At present there is a limited number of people in Dublin employed at work who only get four days a week.  These people are free on the other two days, and they are quite entitled to do carpentering or any other work on these two days for other employers, and since house-building started here in Dublin they do it.

      <P>I ask the Minister if he would consider qualifying the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; in some way; if he would say &ldquo;continuously in the employment or available&rdquo; to the employer.  I say that because the men I speak of are available to the employer but he does not require their services.  You could obviate whatever dangerous meaning might be attached to the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; by saying &ldquo;or available.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the contract of service is not broken, the workman continues to be employed by that employer.  One can visualise the position of an engineer who works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, week in and week out, and the case of a man to whom the employer says &ldquo;I will want you next Monday,&rdquo; and at the end of the week says &ldquo;I will want you again next Monday.&rdquo;  That is not continuous employment.  That man may do spells of work, but that does not mean that he is continuously in the employment of the employer.  A man doing a 40 hours' week may work six days or five <Col N="275" /> days a week.  So far as he is concerned it may be a five-day or a six-day week. The mere fact that he does not work a six-day week does not mean that he is not continuously employed.

      <P>Very well.  Surely it should not be the intention of the Minister to put a premium on idleness. Surely the Minister would like to see the man who gets four days work per week looking for two days additional from someone else.  Our objection to the Minister's amendment is that it will prohibit the man who gets four days employment per week from looking for two days work from another employer, because if he does he will lose the benefit of the six days holidays. Perhaps if another word were used it might be possible that the purpose we all have in mind will be served.  I appreciate that it is impossible for the Minister to strike out one word and stick in another without consultation.  If the Minister says he will look into it, and that he will take such steps as are necessary, perhaps that would be satisfactory.</P>

If the man looks for two days' employment additional to complete the week he is to be penalised. That is manifestly unjust and no Deputy could stand for such an arrangement.

      <P>The Minister is ignoring the point that was raised earlier, namely, what is continuous employment. What is the definition of &ldquo;have been continuously in the employment of such employer&rdquo;?  I say there is a danger that that may mean that the person must be able to show that he has been working regularly for the normal working week for that employer and that if he cannot show that it may be held that he is not continuously in the employment of such employer even where he is working a 46-hour week for that employer and has rendered him 1,800 hours work during the year.  We think that in such case the man ought to get his annual leave.</P>
      <P>The Minister also says, I think, that he ought to get his annual leave.  The difference between us is that the Minister sees no seriousness in the words &ldquo;continuously in the employment of such employer&rdquo;, but it may well be held by the courts that &ldquo;continuously in the employment of such employer&rdquo; means that the man is working regularly for a fixed number of days or a fixed number of hours each week. The courts may hold that it did not matter how many hours he worked so long as he put in a normal working week.  But the courts may also hold that if he was out of employment for one day or two days a week that did not constitute being &ldquo;continuously employed for such employer.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to define what the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; means.  If he does it will avoid a good deal of hardship and confusion later, and I suggest to the Minister that he ought not to be so stubborn about the matter.</P>

If the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; could be <Col N="278" /> defined as simply as the Deputy suggests, then the amendment would not be required at all.  &ldquo;Continuously in the employment of such employer&rdquo; means that a man has been employed for not less than 1,800 hours.</P>

      <P>The amendment says the very reverse and emphasises the fact that it does not mean that, because it provides two conditions which must be fulfilled by the worker.  The first is that he has been &ldquo;continuously in the employment of such employer&rdquo;, and the second is that he has worked in such employment &ldquo;for not less than eighteen hundred hours.&rdquo;  The courts must hold that, whatever be the several meanings of these two conditions, one thing is certain, and that is that their meanings cannot be identical and that one cannot be a definition of the other because the Bill provides that both must be present.  Therefore, the position will be that a man must have not only the one qualification but the other as well.  It means that there is a difference between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this question has been debated altogether from a false angle.  The Minister is making provision for workers to be paid for a six days' holiday.  In order that broken time, illness and so on, will not interfere with the giving of that holiday, he has introduced this reduction of hours.  That is done in order to ensure that a reasonable interpretation may be given to the employment period.  There is the other side of the picture that has not been touched upon.  I am one of those who give a certain amount of casual employment, and I would like to see that casual employment protected in this connection. Deputy Norton spoke of the employer who employs a man for three days a week.  The man gets employment from other people for the remaining three days.  Surely, the employer who gives employment to the man for the first three days should not be asked to shoulder the full burden of the holiday payment.  If an employer employs a <Col N="280" /> man to the extent of 1,800 hours a year, the Minister holds that it is reasonable that he should be responsible for the holiday payment.  But, supposing the man worked a total of 2,400 hours in the year, I submit that it is reasonable to expect that the person employing him for the 600 hours &mdash;the balance over the 1,800 hours&mdash; should bear a share of the holiday payment.  I think that, in order to do justice to all parties, something should be done to meet that particular situation; that in a case such as I have mentioned, there should be a sharing of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already suggested to the Minister that if a man is continuously employed and is available, or at the disposal of his employer for a full week, then that employer ought to have responsibility placed upon him of providing the worker with a holiday.  The last speaker dealt with the case of a man who worked a certain period with one employer and another period with a second employer. I am dealing with the case of men who, because of the action of their employers, are only allowed to work four days a week.  That is their regular week, and in their case that has been the practice for ten years. The Minister should take notice of that.  As a result of that practice, their minimum working hours will fall short of the minimum set down in the Bill.  It would certainly be a hardship on them to be deprived of the benefit of the holiday, while it would be no hardship on their employers to be obliged to give them the holiday. Since this question of the meaning of &ldquo;continuously employed&rdquo; has been raised, I suggest to the Minister that he should do something to meet the case of those men who are available to their employer.  I am not suggesting that they ought to have liberty to go out and undertake work for other people on the two days of the week that they are not required by their present employers, because I am not in favour of putting men on three-quarter time in competition with those who can find no work at all.  These men are available to, and are at the disposal of, <Col N="281" /> their employers if they are required by them on the two days a week that they are not engaged at present, and therefore, I think, the full responsibility for their holiday payment should be put on their employers.</P>

      <P>Might I call the Minister's attention to the fact that in amendment No. 45 which he has submitted there is no question of a person being continuously in employment for a period of two months?  &ldquo;Continuously&rdquo; is omitted from amendment No. 45, and the amendment has as much sense as amendment No. 44 and seems to operate more equitably. What is the necessity for &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; in amendment No. 44 when it is not in amendment No. 45?  If he can drop it in amendment No. 45 he can drop it in amendment No. 44.</P>

      <P>There is one other aspect of amendment No. 44 upon which I should like some information from the Minister.  Under amendment No. 45 the employer pays the worker a day's pay on his employment ceasing with him for more than a day's pay according to the scale.  Under amendment No. 44 the much-debated year is under discussion and I am wondering if there will not be a tendency, where the holiday may have been overlooked or interfered with, to pay a worker a week's pay in lieu of the annual six days' leave.  Is it illegal for the employer to do that or for the worker to accept it?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a worker employed by an employer in an industrial undertaking ceases, at any time other than the end of an employment year of such worker, to be in the employment of such employer, such employer shall either:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) allow such worker, before such cesser, six days annual leave in respect of the portion of such employment year during which he was so employed, or</P>
      <P>(b) pay such worker, at such cesser&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii) one day's pay (calculated as aforesaid) in respect of the period (if any) in the said portion of such employment year which is less than two months but not less than one month and during which he has worked for not less than one hundred and fifty hours.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete Section 19 (3), and substitute four new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a worker who is a member of the Reserve Force of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann is absent from his employment for the purpose of attending and performing his duty as such member at any initial training, annual training, or test mobilisation, such worker shall, for the purpose of reckoning any period of employment or of continuous employment within the meaning of this section, be deemed to have been in his said employment during his said absence, and accordingly the period of his said absence shall for the purposes of this section be reckoned in the said period of employment or continuous employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Where the ownership of an industrial undertaking is transferred by act of the parties or operation of law, a worker who is employed in such undertaking immediately before and immediately after such transfer shall be entitled to reckon, for the purposes of this section, the period <Col N="284" /> of his continuous employment in such undertaking beginning before and ending at such transfer and the period of such continuous employment beginning at and continuing after such transfer as one uninterrupted period of continuous employment in such undertaking notwithstanding such transfer.</P>
    <P>(5) This section shall apply to the employment year current at the commencement of this Act of every worker who, at such passing, is in the employment of an employer in an industrial undertaking, and this section shall have effect in respect of such employment year and such worker as if this section had been in force at the beginning of such employment year, but subject to the modification that, if such employment year expires within one month after the commencement of this Act, such employer shall be deemed to have complied with this section if he allows to such worker, not later than three months after the expiration of such employment year, such annual leave as such worker may be entitled to under this section in respect of such employment year.</P>
    <P>(6) In this section and the two next following sections of this Act the expression `employment year' in relation to any worker means a period of one year beginning on the day on which such worker last entered the employment in relation to which the expression is used or on an anniversary of that day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 does a number of things.  In the first place it deletes sub-section 3 of section 19.  That is consequential on the adoption of amendment No. 45.  In the second place it provides that where a worker is a member of the Reserve Force of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann and is called up for any period of initial training, annual training or a test mobilisation, and is consequently absent from his employment during such period of initial training, annual training or test mobilisation, he shall, nevertheless, be deemed to have been continuously employed for the purposes of this section, that is, for the purpose of qualifying for the annual <Col N="285" /> leave.  We think it is undesirable that workers who are members of the Reserve Force should be penalised on that account, or put in a less advantageous position than their fellows in the matter of qualifying for the annual holidays.</P>
    <P>In the next sub-section the amendment provides that the continuity of a worker's employment will not be interrupted merely because the ownership of the business in which he is employed is transferred by act of the parties or the operation of law from one person to another, provided the worker has been employed in the concern both before and after the transfer.  The next sub-section provides for the transition stage, the period that will immediately follow the coming into operation of this section and is designed to prevent any serious dislocation arising in industry, if a large number of workers should become qualified and entitled to receive their annual leave in the same week.  The necessity for having some such provision, that is, a provision for the spreading of the holiday season over a particular period by employers so as to prevent dislocation will, I think, be obvious.  Sub-section (6) is merely a re-insertion of the definition of the &ldquo;employment year&rdquo; which we deleted from an earlier part of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to Clause 3 of this amendment except in regard to its uncertainty.  In all this question of holidays so far provided for in the Bill, it is possible to calculate what will be the expense beforehand and to make provision therefor, but this sub-section (3), which provides for time spent on service in defence forces such as a test mobilisation or initial training, gives no indication as to what period will be taken up, and therefore does not afford the contractor or the firm concerned an opportunity of calculating what expense will be incurred.  I think some limit should be put on this, so that a definite calculation can be made.  Conceivably to the layman it might mean a week, a month, or two months.  Could the Minister give us any indication of the period which it is intended to cover by this clause?  It is quite a new feature in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The period of initial training or annual training is very short, and the period of a test mobilisation will be only a matter of two or three days.  I am not sure what the exact period is, but it will not go beyond two or three weeks.  It is never longer than that.  A member of the Reserve Forces might be called to service in circumstances which would require a longer absence from his work than is mentioned here, but that absence would not count for the purposes of this Bill.  I think the Deputy will obviously see the desirability of having this provision here, because otherwise there would be a very strong reason why workers should not become members of the Reserve Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The element of uncertainty is very slight.  If any contractor were calculating the cost of certain work that might take a long time to execute, the amount he would have to allow against this item would obviously be very small, because such worker would qualify for the annual leave in any event if he were continuously employed on the job for a long period; he would succeed in securing the 1,800 hours' qualification without the necessity <Col N="287" /> of availing of this provision.  It is only in certain cases that it might happen that the worker's absence with the Reserve Forces might disqualify him from annual leave, and that is a hardship I am anxious to avoid.  The total amount which a member of the Reserve Forces does is one month's training annually.</P>

While it is desirable that workers who get annual leave under this measure should not work during that period of leave, it is very difficult to impose that as a statutory obligation on them.  A worker cannot work during that period in the service of his employer, but he might decide to do harvesting work or some other class of work which would mean a change of occupation and would be as good as a rest for him.  It would be practically impossible to enforce any such provision and I do not think we should have in the Bill provisions of this kind unless we can see our way to make them effective.  I cannot see how we could effectively enforce a provision which debars workers on annual leave from taking employment which might be taken by them in different parts of the country far away from the district in which they were ordinarily employed.</P>

      <P>I strenuously object to the principle enshrined in Deputy Norton's amendment.  I think it is typical of the Socialist mind that loves to dragoon everybody.  It may be necessary to have certain regulations in industry to preserve the rights of people and to keep an even keel between employer and employed, but the less we have of them the better.  I <Col N="289" /> strenuously object to pursuing a man outside his employment because he happens to work for wages; I protest against any attempt to dragoon him in his free time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell is entitled to hold his own views.  It does not follow that he should subscribe to my views or that I should subscribe to his.  Workmen are entitled to as much liberty as their employers.  I have no doubt if an attempt were made by the Government to prevent an employer pursuing any hobby he chose to pursue there would be a general outcry.  If that is so of employers I strenuously object to this House attempting to restrict the liberty of employees.  It is typical of the Socialist mind of Deputy Norton that he should want, not only to provide against abuses in industry, but to dragoon and discipline every citizen of the State in his working hours, out of his working hours, and every time he can get his claw on him.</P>

      <P>The amendment is directed to preventing a worker, while on annual leave, performing work for remuneration in the service of his employer.  I understood the Minister to say that the Bill provides that he cannot, if he is entitled to a week's holiday from an employer who has employed him during the whole working year, work during that holiday for that employer.  In so far as the amendment is directed to that purpose, it is superfluous, mere tautology, because that is already in the Bill.  But, surely, he can take <Col N="290" /> harvest work or casual work with some other employer if he so desires.</P>

I feel sure the Chair would not desire us to enter into a discussion at this stage as to the Fascist or Hitlerite tendencies of President de Valera, or his colleagues&mdash;we shall reserve that for another day&mdash;but in the meantime let us rejoice that the Socialist tendencies of Deputy Norton negative the Hitlerite tendencies of President de Valera and, in the middle, liberty is preserved for the workman, who can enjoy his holidays.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some idea in Deputy Dillon's mind that this is a Socialistic idea and that the State, or somebody else, is fastening its claws on a man's neck during his free time.  That is where we join issue, because the man is having a free holiday at the expense of his employer and he is supposed to be having it for the benefit of his health.  I quite agree that there may be a wide range of ideas as to how a person should take a holiday, and I agree that there should be considerable latitude.  I should find it difficult to say that a man who is employed in Dublin and who goes down to the West of Ireland and engages in harvesting operations is undermining his health.  I see by the Minister's attitude that he is sympathetic towards the idea, if he could get some words to express what is in the mind of Deputy Norton and others. My definition of it would be &ldquo;analogous employment,&rdquo; because I think it would be a most flagrant injustice if, during a very busy period in the building industry, let us say, an employer has to give a worker a week's holidays and see that worker working for a rival employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> We had a good deal of talk in a previous debate as to whether a man could mend a clock in his leisure time, but I believe the Minister, if he put his mind to it, could find some way of expressing what I believe would be best expressed by the term &ldquo;analogous employment.&rdquo;  I do not at all agree with the Minister that, because he cannot catch somebody who is doing something he ought not to do, it should not be prohibited.  I would far rather maintain our high ideals, even though it were not possible to detect very much of the abuse which we knew was going on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many sections in this Bill that will be extremely difficult to administer, and there are many offences created in the Bill that will be extremely difficult to detect. For instance, one portion of the Bill says that if a worker, after having worked for one employer, accepts employment with another during his holiday period, it is an offence, and if the other employer employs him, it is also an offence.  One can easily see the enormous difficulty of detecting offences of this kind, but the House has decided that it is an offence and that, as far as the Bill is concerned, every effort should be made to detect the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no difference at all between the principle in that case and the principle in this.  I agree that there are difficulties in this case, but I think we should endeavour, so far as legislation is concerned, to get as much grip over the offence as possible; otherwise, we are calmly contemplating a worker who has been given holidays for the benefit of his own health entering into undesirable competition, either with his unemployed colleagues or with some other persons in some other industry.  Bear in mind that the worker is not unemployed during that week.  He actually has a week's wages for that week, and ought to be content with that.  If they are not enough, there is another method of getting more wages, but he ought not to be allowed to say &ldquo;I am getting a week's wages for my holidays this week, and I am going to try to get some work <Col N="292" /> either at my own industry or at some other craft,&rdquo; to the possible detriment of another worker normally following that craft or engaged in that industry.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very simple proposition. I agree that you cannot make the offences punishable in all cases, but even 10 per cent. efficiency is better than no efficiency at all, and there might be respect for this amendment from the point of view of preventing the offences occurring if there was a section such as this in the Bill. Deputy Dillon, with his typical bogeyman mind, sees red ruin and revolution in this amendment.  It is a Socialist amendment, he says; it is reeking with Socialism and reeking with regimentation. And all that from a Deputy who is a member of a Party that wanted to regiment everybody, to make them join trade unions, whether they liked it or not, to make them pay contributions to trade unions, whether they liked it or not, and to prohibit their normal right to withdraw their labour if they liked.  This is the Deputy who now objects to regimentation&mdash;the Deputy who a short time ago was giving his benediction to a policy which not alone made the ordinary employee at, say, the Bank of Ireland come into a trade union, but made the Governor of the Bank of Ireland come into the same union with the employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the amendment.  As a matter of fact, I am discussing the amendment now by pointing out to Deputy Dillon that there is no real regimentation in this amendment at all.  It is quite a sensible amendment, and if that is Deputy Dillon's conception of Socialism, the Deputy has still a lot to learn.  Even Deputy Dockrell embraces this amendment. He says it is a sensible amendment, and I suppose Deputy Dockrell talks for the Party in this matter.  Probably he is longer in it than Deputy Dillon and knows more about the policy of the Party.  Deputy Dockrell does not see any Socialism in this.  He says it is a sensible amendment, and it is an amendment which Deputy Dillon, I should imagine, <Col N="293" /> if he had any pretence to being logical or equitable, ought to have gladly accepted.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been supported by other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party in addition to Deputy Dockrell. It is an eminently reasonable amendment. It may not be 100 per cent. efficient, but a substantial measure of efficiency can be got under it, and I think that if even only 10 per cent. efficiency can be got, it is very much better than leaving this matter unprovided for and in such a way as to allow workers, who are being paid a week's wages for a week's holidays, to enter into competition with other workers who are unemployed or find it difficult enough to get employment in their industry or at their craft.  Even if the Minister cannot make the thing wholly effective, I suggest that he ought, as a deterrent or even as something that will get a certain measure of efficiency in detection, agree to accept the principle of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will agree with Deputy Dockrell that there is a case for preventing certain classes of workers in particular from using their forced annual leave to do work.  Take the case of the aristocrats of the trade at the moment&mdash;the plasterers, who are in demand, I understand, by all contractors. A plasterer who got annual leave might well be induced by another contractor to do work for him during that period, and it would be unfair to the first employer who has to pay him for his period of leave.  I should not like to prevent a plasterer from taking on a job at fruit picking or harvesting or, even in certain circumstances, working in various occupations associated with or similar to his ordinary work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot prevent that altogether.  We have no means test in respect of employment and I do not think it would be possible to get that without regimentation of a ruthless kind.  There are people doing jobs who are in receipt of pensions which bring them in much more than this worker might be getting during his leave.  There is nothing to prevent them getting a job, even though there may be other people more in need of the work.  That is not the principle on which we ought to go.  The principle is that a worker, having been in employment for a year doing a certain form of industrial work and being given by law six days annual holiday from that work, should take that holiday, because otherwise the whole purpose of the scheme might be defeated. I think that the great majority of workers will take the holiday but there may develop a practice in relation to the different trades which it may be desirable to check. My difficulty has been the practical one of devising a workable scheme, not objection to the principle.  Now that I have heard Deputy Dillon on the principle, I am very anxious to find a workable scheme, and I should like to have another opportunity of considering the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we should be told by Deputy Norton, since he attaches so much importance to this amendment, what he considers will be the percentage of workers who will seek alternative work during the six days holiday they will be allowed. How many workers does he think will walk out of an engineering job and seek another engineering job elsewhere? Surely, he agrees that the overwhelming majority of workers will make straight for the hills and bogs and harvest fields rather than that they will start and search for another establishment similar to that in which they were employed so that they may work for the six free days.  It is obvious that Deputy Norton attaches great importance to this amendment. But is it worth while, if he is satisfied <Col N="295" /> that the efficiency will be only 10 per cent. and that it will cover only 1 per cent., 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. of workers, to insist upon the amendment?  Would it be worth while passing a law merely to secure that?  In many cases, even the analogous-occupation proposal will be impossible to administer.  If a painter goes down the country and some of his friends want a painting job done, he may take it rather than be idle, particularly if it be wet weather.  You will then have his neighbours reporting him for what could not be considered a very serious offence.  The amount of unemployment that will arise from workers availing of their holidays to engage in other work cannot be considerable.  I rather think the matter is too petty to legislate upon, especially in view of the suggestion that there is not likely to be anything like substantial compliance with the law, no matter what amendment is passed.</P>

      <P>I take it that Deputy Moore is aware that there is a pretty serious evil already, with which Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Beckett are, no doubt, familiar, in respect of certain workers in the building trade and electrical trade working for an employer during the day and taking on other jobs at night.</P>

      <P>The Deputy admits that there are workers in employment during the day who take on private contracts at night while the industry in which they are engaged is carrying a substantial percentage of unemployed. Deputy Moore knows that there is a substantial amount of unemployment in the building industry at the moment and the tendency in existing circumstances in the city will be, I think, for that unemployment to increase.  If you can get workers to work a normal day for an employer and do some other work at night, is there not a great danger that, during the holiday period, they will take contracts which should go to others <Col N="296" /> and compete with their unemployed brethren?  That problem has to be met.</P>

      <P>In page 10, at the end of Section 19 (5) to add the words &ldquo;and shall be liable to pay to such worker in respect of the period of the annual leave a sum equal to double the amount of the salary, wages or other reward earned by such worker in respect of the period aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that a worker shall be entitled to obtain a week's annual leave.  If the employer is unwilling to give it to him, then he is empowered to proceed at law for the recovery of the wages.  That may involve him in a considerable amount of trouble and he may be a long time waiting for his week's pay for the holidays to which he is entitled.  The object of this amendment is to provide that if an employer puts a worker to the trouble and expense of suing for his pay at law, not only will the employer be guilty of an offence under the section but he shall be liable to pay the worker double the amount of the wages earned by the worker in respect of the holiday period.  This matter was discussed on the Committee Stage.  The Minister then said that he thought there was something to be said for the amendment and that he would look into it. He added that he had every sympathy with the amendment.</P>

If he asks for holidays, the employer may say that he cannot afford to give them and that if he goes off he will do so at his own expense.  There may be no wages forthcoming at the end of the week.  The worker will then have to obtain the services of a solicitor, show the solicitor that the employer has contravened the Act, issue a summons against the employer and claim a week's wages.  The case will be heard in the courts and, in the end, the worker will get only a week's wages with, perhaps, costs, although he has been subjected to very considerable inconvenience.</P>

Section 19 (5) says: &ldquo;If any employer fails to allow annual leave to any worker in contravention of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section.&rdquo;  I want to add to that that he will be liable for double wages.  If the Minister accepts this we will know that the employer is liable to pay for two weeks' holidays if he causes all that difficulty to the worker. A judge may hold the circumstances only entitled the worker to a week's wages.  But there should be some deterrent placed upon the employer, so that he should not captiously refuse the worker his holidays.  He might well agree to pay a week's wages rather than give the holiday.  It is to deal with the obstreperous employer who will not act in accordance with the Bill that some penalty should be laid down if he does not comply with its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the source of information is the dissatisfied worker. If he does not get his leave, he will report to the Inspector, who makes an investigation, and if it is found that the employer fails to allow the worker to take his leave, he will be prosecuted. But if the worker knows that unless he claims his holidays he will not get them at all, he may be tempted to put things off; he may not claim his holidays, and allow the employer to commit an offence.  There will be a temptation to do that if the worker knows that by reporting the matter he will recover two additional weeks' wages.  I do not like to put that temptation in the way of the worker, or to induce him to do anything but claim his holidays.  I think it would be undesirable to have the position otherwise than it is.  If the worker wants the benefit there is only one way of getting it, and that is by taking his holidays.  The Deputy's amendment would provide an alternative to recover three weeks' wages.</P>

The employer says: &ldquo;I cannot pay next week; if you <Col N="299" /> go you will get no wages from me.&rdquo; The worker exercises his right under the Bill, and on the following Monday does not present himself for work. Then later he asks the employer, what about the week's wages for the holidays I had last week?  The employer says: &ldquo;I told you last week I could not pay you,&rdquo; so that the employee-does not get his wages.

      <P>Of course there is.  The employee must go to a solicitor and have the case decided before a judge in court.  That is the right the Minister gives the worker.  I think if the worker is compelled to go to court he ought to be entitled to get something more than he would be entitled to if the employer respected his duties under the Act.  It is no innovation.  It is already a well-known policy in respect to employment insurance where an employee may recover against an employer who refuses to stamp his card.  The employer who refuses to stamp the card of his employee will be compelled to stamp it and will not get any assistance to meet his liability.  The same thing applies under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment in its present form I would be quite satisfied if he looks into it and meets the principle involved.</P>

In these circumstances there is no reason to think that employers will take such a risk.  Take the other position.  If in addition to the employer suffering this penalty he will have to pay two weeks' wages to the worker, the worker might be induced to allow the offence to be committed and let the week pass in order that his employer might have that penalty inflicted upon him.  It would become a source of gain to the worker if the employer failed to do his duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a worker for salary or wages is allowed by his employer any <Col N="302" /> annual leave to which he is entitled by virtue of this Act, such employer shall pay to such worker, in respect of each day of such leave, salary or wages at whichever of the following rates is applicable, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of a worker whose ordinary remuneration is wholly calculated by reference to time, at the rate at which such remuneration was payable immediately before the commencement of such anunal leave, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a worker whose ordinary remuneration is wholly piece-work wages, at the average daily rate of his earnings (exclusive of pay for overtime) in the period in respect of which he is allowed such annual leave, and</P>

      <P>In page 10, before Section 21, but in Part II, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Every employer who is required by this Act to allow annual leave to a worker shall give to every worker to whom he is so required to allow such annual leave notice in writing <Col N="303" /> of the day on which such annual leave will begin, and shall so give such notice not less than one week before such day.</P>
    <P>(2) A notice given in pursuance of this section to a worker may be given either by handing such notice to such worker or by exhibiting such notice in a prominent position to which such worker has access in the place in which he is employed.</P>
    <P>(3) Every employer, required by this section to give to any worker such notice as is mentioned in the preceding sub-sections of this section, who fails or neglects to give in accordance with this section such notice to any worker on any occasion on which he is so required so to do shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Norton that it would be undesirable if the position were left in such a way that the employer could notify the worker at mid-day on the Saturday, when paying him his week's wages, that he must take his holidays in the following week.  Consequently, we are proposing to provide here that at least one week's notice must be given to the worker as to the period during which he must take his holidays.  That notice can be given either in writing or by publication of a notice in an accessible place in the factory, which, I take it, will be the ordinary practice. I should imagine that in an ordinary factory the practice will be to publish a notice early in the year indicating the period at which each employee will get his leave.  The third sub-section here merely provides for penalties in the event of default.</P>

      <P>That enables the employer to sail down closely to the week. Visualise the position of a worker who may be told on, say, Monday morning: &ldquo;You are to take your week's holidays from next Monday.&rdquo;  The worker <Col N="304" /> might want to arrange to take his family away for the week.  He might want to arrange some other details as to where his family would go, and at what price they would get there.  He might want to arrange with some other member of the family to go with him. All that will have to be done in a week, during which the worker will be employed.  I think a week's notice of the time at which they must take their holidays is very inadequate.  I had hoped that the workers would get much longer notice, and, in fact, there is no real difficulty for the employer in giving it.</P>

If he can get longer than a week's notice that is good enough.

I think a week's notice is inadequate.  I think if the Minister were to provide for a month's notice the employers would find very little difficulty in adjusting themselves to that.  It is done at present in many cases where workers get holidays; they generally know a considerable period in advance.  If that can be done by good employers, with good organisation, there should not be any difficulty in others finding it possible to accept the same standard.  A good employer will give reasonable notice. An employer who has been accustomed to giving holidays to his staff will give adequate notice, but the inefficient employer, who has no conception of his social responsibility, who has got an inefficient outlook, and who dislikes a Bill of this kind, will <Col N="307" /> squeeze the last right that he can get out of this Bill.  The tendency will be to give the minimum notice rather than the maximum.  I think the Minister should substantially increase the week's notice.</P>

      <P>In looking at this section I think that Deputy Norton approaches it from an entirely different angle to that of the average employer.  I should like him to consider just where this point is leading. There is no doubt that in most employments holidays are arranged as far ahead as possible, and in many cases employees&mdash;and I consider very properly&mdash;get two or three months' notice when their holidays will come on.  But all sorts of unforeseen circumstances turn up.  For instance, the lining of a furnace may fall down and leave a factory idle.  I suggest to Deputy Norton that if he is too hard on employers in emergencies, he may force them to shut down, instead of giving notice of holidays.  If Deputy Norton wants longer notice, it should be stated that cases of emergency were excepted, because these are really the cases where employees will be cut down to the minimum of a week.  I am sure Deputy Norton would be the last to contend that in industry at the present time all sorts of unforeseen circumstances do not turn up.  The lining of a furnace might fall down, there might be a serious fire on a ship during the night or a ship might founder in some other part of the world.  As all sorts of circumstances crop up, I suggest to Deputy Norton that he should either leave this matter alone, or put in a saving clause dealing with cases of emergency.</P>

In certain cases risk would be involved if the machines for any period were left otherwise than under observation by the skilled workers concerned.

      <P>To get back to the amendment, at present a worker can get out during the rest interval.  He may be engaged in circumstances that make his work very fatiguing and very strenuous, and if he gets out for 15 minutes during the shift the worker is getting nothing very extraordinary from the Minister or from the employer.  If there is any danger of anything happening a machine, that might injure the worker or his colleagues in the industry, the worker may be relied to be fully alive to that danger.  Of course any sensible worker in these circumstances would remain on the premises.  Ordinary common sense would suggest that he should take steps to avoid any possibility of such a catastrophe occurring.</P>
      <P>I think the section is quite all right as it stands.  It allows a worker 15 minutes' rest in each shift.  It reads: &ldquo;Every worker shall be allowed at least 15 minutes' rest in each shift not less than three nor more than four hours after the commencement of such shift.&rdquo;  That is as much as anybody could reasonably require.  But the Minister is not satisfied with that.  A person may be working at a boiler or at an open fire; he may be working in a fetid atmosphere or in a place which few of us would care to choose as a place for industry.  But he is not to be entitled to go out for the 15 minutes' rest.  The Minister says in his amendment: &ldquo;but shall not be entitled to leave the premises of the employer during such period of rest without the permission of the employer.&rdquo; If Deputy Dillon had any justification for talking about Hitler methods he has it in this amendment with a vengeance. One would think the worker had no rights at all.  At present he can go out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is even worse.  You would expect common sense and equity in what a sergeant-major would do. This is an amendment to keep the workers in during the 15 minutes' rest.  I think it is an outrageous proposal. I do not believe the employers thought the Minister would accept this when they submitted it.  They said they found the Minister most pliable in the matter.  He was prepared to agree to introducing the amendment to keep these people in during the period of the rest interval.  The amendment is a most unfair one.  No employer could reasonably expect more than is in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might make a case for the amendment if he stated that some terrible catastrophe had occurred while the workers were out, but no such case has been made.  All we are told by the Minister is that the employers wanted it done, and therefore he agreed to do it.  He is not prepared <Col N="313" /> to let the present position alone.  What is the difficulty in leaving it alone? If some of them stay in, they may stay in for a good reason, and if others go out, they may go out for a good reason. Why not leave the present position alone instead of compelling the worker to remain in even during the 15 minutes which he is going to get out of a nine-hour day?  That is the prospect the Minister is offering them.  He is not satisfied with the present position but would worsen it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the amendment is bad in principle.  It does not effect the purpose the Minister has in mind.  What the Minister has in mind is that in very exceptional cases, where constant supervision of dangerous machinery is necessary, employers can depend upon an employee to stand by.  These can be the only circumstances under which it would be justifiable to restrict the freedom of the employee in his free time.  As Deputy Dockrell said to me a moment ago when speaking to him, the fact is that these matters only give rise to difficulty where you meet a curmudgeon employer or a curmudgeon employee, and in 99 out of every 100 cases it will be just as much the solicitude of the employee to keep his machine in order as it is of the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, instead of a general provision purporting to keep the employees within the premises, unless the employer permits them to leave, he should introduce some provision whereby individual employees, on the application of the employer or themselves, might have a certificate permitting the employer not to grant this 15 minutes as a statutory right, and then whatever compensating relaxation there should be would become a matter of personal arrangement between the employer and the employees.  It would mean that, in general, factory employees are entitled to 15 minutes' rest, but in special cases, where employees are engaged with dangerous machinery, the employer could get a certificate in respect of them relieving him of the statutory right to give them any rest, and they would be <Col N="314" /> left in the same position they were in before this legislation was passed, which, as we all know, means that, in fact, they do get some free time during a shift which is taken in a way which conforms to the convenience both of employer and employees.  That is a practical proposal to get out of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, in spite of all his Socialist indignation, knows well that there is a difficulty here, because if you have a cantankerous workman who insists upon his statutory rights at every turn, he may walk out and leave an important machine unsupervised, and serious damage may be done.  He would be able to defend himself by saying that he had a right to leave the factory during the 15 minutes' rest.  If this is inserted it will inconvenience thousands of men, whereas all we want to do is to provide for perhaps half-a-dozen exceptional cases.  The practical way to get out of that is to leave everybody free and to make provision that a certain man can opt out of the 15 minutes part of the Bill where the Minister is satisfied that a reasonable case is made for allowing him so to opt out.  If the Minister will adopt that course he will save himself from the fury of Deputy Norton, who will feel constrained to make several violent speeches describing the Minister as what I really believe him to be&mdash;an Irish Hitler.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister led the House to believe by what he said when moving the amendment that the parties responsible for the suggestion looked upon this as a most important matter concerning them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate he has clearly led the House to believe that cases had been put to him that men and women who were not under some kind of statutory discipline of this nature would recklessly go away from their machines and leave these machines probably to be smashed up or something like that.  I am sure the Minister has no definite evidence in his possession from any big industrialist that that kind of recklessness has been going on.  Therefore I do <Col N="315" /> not see that there is any case for the insertion of a provision of this kind in this Bill.  I think the Minister might leave it to the ordinary disciplinary rules of industrial firms to deal with a cantankerous workman, as Deputy Dillon said, who would be so reckless as to leave a machine and ignore the fact that by doing so he was going to upset the working of the concern.</P>

Were they representatives of the Saorstát Federation of Industries or representatives of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce?  Let us have the arguments put up to the Minister in support of the insertion of the amendment in a Bill which, as far as I can see, otherwise provides for decent working conditions for people and the continuance of harmonious working conditions between employers and employees.  There are men in charge of the firms which will have the obligation of administering an Act of this kind and it should be left to the heads of the firms and the foremen and others to co-operate to such an extent as not to require the insertion of a mandatory disciplinary provision of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will give you the case of a sugar cooker in a sugar factory.  His business is to watch the sugar boiler and to read the index. There is no labour, so to speak, involved; his sole labour is the adjusting of a tap or two to keep the boiler right.  He can take his meals, and he can even read the paper while he is doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He can perform his duty.  The employer says:&ldquo;If we give the man the right to leave the boiler, then an entirely new shift must come on to take his place, because the boiler cannot be left neglected or unattended; if it is left unattended there may be an explosion and other places may be affected.&rdquo;  The same would apply to such places as gas works.  There would be a definite danger, not alone to the people engaged in the particular industry but to other people engaged in other industries.  Then, take industries governed by this particular section. The practice has been that the workers take their meals and their rest periods adjacent to the machines they are watching.  It is proposed to continue that.  It is not proposed to confine the workers in the factory.  The provision <Col N="317" /> is that they cannot leave the premises without getting the consent of the persons in charge, and I think that it is such a reasonable provision that it is ridiculous to describe it as a proposal to cage the workers.  It is an obviously sensible proposal and I am quite certain that, in the regulations governing sugar factories, and other such factories, in Russia, or in any other country, similar provisions apply.  This is not a question of restricting the opportunities of workers, but it is a question of securing reasonable working conditions for the workers, subject to the conditions of the industries in which they are engaged, because, if these industries are not carried on, the workers concerned will not have any work.  This section is designed for the protection of the employees, and if the employees want it to be deleted, we will delete the section altogether. If the Deputy wants this attempt to regulate the employment of these workers stopped, I will stop it.  I am not prepared to force these improved conditions on the workers if they do not want them.  Personally, I think they do want these improved conditions. But, if they do not want these improved conditions to be enforced as a statutory right, I am prepared to agree to that.</P>

Well, if so, it is no use to tell me that they are enjoying 15 minutes' rest if they are still watching the gauge <Col N="318" /> in the sugar factory or the gas works, as the case may be.  If this provision is made, that the man in the gas works, or the sugar-cooker, will stop watching the gauge for 15 minutes a day, the result is that the employer can say to these workers: &ldquo;Well, if we have to give that 15 minutes' rest, you must spend that 15 minutes' rest watching the gas gauges.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that great damage might be done by a man leaving his work in such a case, and that, if the Minister was not prepared to make a concession with regard to this amendment, it would mean the employment of a completely new shift of sugar cookers for that period of 15 minutes' rest.  If that is the purpose the Minister has in mind, this amendment is calculated to do away with the whole 15 minutes' rest in practice, and means that an employer can take away the privilege.  I think that there may be cases in which men ought not to have a statutory right to 15 minutes' rest-cases where it might not be practicable &mdash;but where such cases do exist, I suggest that representations can be made to the Minister, and that he can certify that certain people, doing such work, would be entitled to a certificate and would be in the same position as they would have been before this legislation was passed.  I would like to pass over the 15 minutes' rest for the vast majority of cases, but the inevitable fact remains that, in certain cases, as the Minister must confess, it is not practicable to deal with all these cases. If the Minister would give us the particular cases he has in mind, then we <Col N="319" /> would know where we are; but, under this system nobody is going to be satisfied.  The employer is going to be inconvenienced and Deputy Norton is going to address himself in Ringsend to the people there about the Hitler proposal in this present Bill.  I make that practical suggestion, and the Minister must agree that it is a practical suggestion, and one that will get over the difficulty he has in view, and at the same time deprive everybody of any sense of grievance.</P>

      <P>After all that has been said on this amendment there are one or two points that I want to clear up. Is it only necessary to get the permission of the party in charge of the worker if effect is to be given to the terms of the amendment?  As it is the amendment is perfectly meaningless for the employee should go and seek his employer and get permission from him.  If the Minister wants it to mean the representative of the employer he should say so in the amendment.  As it is the employee on each separate occasion should seek the permission of his employer in advance; or is he to get agreement in advance as to the particular hours he would be entitled to leave the premises during each period of rest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it would be necessary to have the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo; inserted there and it would also be necessary to know if he could have this permission for every day of the week.  Otherwise, he would be brought back to the position of his schooldays.  The amendment seems to envisage a lack of confidence or trust in the workers for it suggests that they would recklessly go away and leave the machinery unprotected and uncared for.  It must mean that they are so reckless and irresponsible in regard to the care of the machines at their disposal that they would go out and seek the fifteen minutes' period of rest without the permission of those <Col N="320" /> in charge of the undertaking.  Those who suggested the amendment apparently looked at the workers from a suspicious angle.  In the past the men had to take their meals and the meals period was much more important than this fifteen minutes' rest period. And in the past there has been no case where the worker has done anything to show that he did not feel full responsibility for the machines of which he was in charge.  The Minister told us that the men had to take their meals while at work.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is carried the worker will not be allowed to go and seek for permission.  This Bill passed through the Committee Stage of the House leaving Section 27 untouched.  That section apparently then expressed the Minister's view in connection with shift work.  The Minister's advisers told him that in shift work there were adequate safeguards, and the Minister, on being satisfied that there were, allowed the section to go through the House.  He now comes here on the second Committee Stage and tells us quite calmly that the employers asked him to put in this amendment, and he has put it in for them.  The artificial fury of the Minister about watching the gauges betrays the whole weakness of his case. Section 27(1) (e) as it stands is a perfectly sensible section.  But the employers got at the Minister and, according to his own statement, said: &ldquo;You must amend this.&rdquo;  Then we have the Minister coming back and saying to the House: &ldquo;Will you accept this amendment, which provides that the worker `shall not be entitled to <Col N="321" /> leave the premises of the employer during such period of rest without the permission of the employer'?&rdquo; which, in effect, is saying that if the employer agrees, the workers may have a 15 minutes' rest in each shift, but if the employer does not agree he will not get the 15 minutes.  That is the effect of the Minister's amendment, which vitiates whatever value was in Section 27 (1) (e).</P>

      <P>The amendment gives the right to the employer to say to the worker: &ldquo;I will not give you permission to go outside,&rdquo; and Section 27 (1) (e) is rendered ineffective once the Minister adopts that attitude and refuses to allow an appeal to himself. I am willing to allow the matter to be decided by the Minister.  Let the employer make an application to the Minister that it would be undesirable that the worker should leave the machines for this 15 minutes' period. If this amendment is passed we have no guarantee that it will not be used in cases where legitimately the permission could be granted.  The most the Minister should ask the House is to give him authority to decide these cases, and I think the employers would be satisfied with that.  He told us he is inserting this amendment at the request of one set of employers.  Is the Minister sure that the employers would not agree to allow the matter to be decided by the Minister himself? I am sure the employers have sufficient confidence in the Minister to allow him to decide border-line cases.  The Minister should go back to the people who asked him to make this amendment, tell them the difficulties in the way and the vicious principle underlying this amendment, and ask them if they will be satisfied with his decision. That is a reasonable request.  The <Col N="322" /> sub-section is quite useless if the employer is allowed to refuse permission indiscriminately.  Is there to be any appeal from the refusal of the employers?  If this amendment is carried there will be no such thing as this interval except with the permission of the employer.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the charge on and payment out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof of all expenses incurred by the Minister for Finance in carrying into effect any Act of the present session, to make provision for the conversion of holdings of stock of the Irish Free State 5% National Loan, 1935-45, into stock of a new security to be created for that purpose and to provide for matters incidental to such conversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this resolution I think this is an opportune moment to announce the general terms of the conversion issue.  As I indicated in my speech on the Second Reading last night, the total outstanding amount of the loan to be redeemed or converted is £7,000,000. Holders of the outstanding stock will be asked to convert their holdings, either in whole or in part, at their option, into an equal nominal amount of stock of a new issue in terms of the prospectus to be published to-morrow. <Col N="323" /> The conversion will be a par for par conversion.  The prospectus will provide for the payment of interest on the stock at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum and for its redemption at par on 1st December, 1970.</P>
    <P>The Government of the Irish Free State will undertake to set aside on 1st June and 1st December of each year a sum equal to 2 9/16ths per cent. of the total nominal amount of the loan issued.  After deducting therefrom the amount required for payment of interest, the balance of the sum so set aside will be carried to an accumulative sinking fund which will be applied to the purchase of the loan for cancellation or otherwise invested for the benefit of the sinking fund.</P>
    <P>Both the principal and interest of the loan will be a charge on the Central Fund of the Irish Free State. The loan will be known as the 4 per cent.  Conversion Loan 1950-70 and, though as I have already said it will be repayable at par at the latest on the 1st December, 1970, the Government of the Irish Free State will have the option to redeem the stock in whole or in part at par on or after the 1st December, 1950, on giving three calendar months' notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>The stock of the loan will be a trustee investment under the Trustee Act, 1893, and trustees may invest therein even though the price at the time of investment exceeds the redemption value of £100 per cent. Dividends on stock of the issue will be paid without deduction of income tax, but the income derived from such dividends will be assessable to income tax in the hands of recipients at the rates of tax appropriate to their respective incomes.  Stock of the issue and the dividends payable thereon will be exempt from all taxation of the Irish Free State, present or future, if it is shown in the manner directed by the Minister for Finance that the stock is in the beneficial ownership of a person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the Irish Free State. <Col N="324" /> Simultaneously with the conversion offer, the banks will be further authorised to offer for cash subscription at par stock of the 4 per cent. Conversion Loan, 1950-70, to an amount which, when added to that resulting from conversions of the First National Loan, will not exceed in the aggregate £7,000,000; but the Minister for Finance may reduce the amount to be allotted in respect of such subscriptions by a sum not exceeding any Sinking Fund available for the redemption of the First National Loan.</P>
    <P>In regard to this offer for cash, I may perhaps say a word.  It is not the desire of the Government to acquire new money for the Exchequer through this conversion operation.  But it is not, in fact, so easy to avoid doing so as might be thought, and some new money for the Exchequer may, in fact, be acquired.  The original amount of the First National Loan was £10,000,000, but, as the House is aware, this has now been reduced by Sinking Fund charges and cancellation to £7,000,000 exactly.  In addition, we have unapplied Sinking Fund to the amount of £1,150,000 approximately. This arises out of the fact that for a number of years past the price of the loan has been so high that, from the Exchequer point of view, it would have been uneconomic to have bought at 105, 104 or 103 stock, which, in a comparatively short time, would be paid off at par.  Thus the Sinking Fund Appropriation was invested instead in other securities and has been held against the day of redemption. Accordingly, while the total amount of stock outstanding is £7,000,000, the net debt to be dealt with does not exceed £5,850,000.  The result is that if our offer of conversion is accepted to a greater extent than £5,850,000 the Sinking Fund becomes surplus by the amount of the excess over that figure, and it will be wholly surplus if the conversion offer is accepted to the extent of the outstanding £7,000,000.</P>
    <P>If the Government were an entirely free agent in the matter the natural and simplest course would be to accept applications for conversions only to the extent of £5,850,000 or thereabouts and to apply the Sinking Fund in <Col N="325" /> repayment of the balance of the stock of the First National Loan.  This might be done either by accepting the first applications aggregating £5,850,000, or by scaling down all applications <i>pro rata</i> to this figure.</P>
    <P>But the rights of the investor must be recognised.  So far back as the 1st September last, when the redemption of the First National Loan was announced, it was intimated to holders that they would be afforded an opportunity of converting their holdings into stock of a new loan.  Even if no announcement to this effect had been made, most investors would have presumed that a conversion offer would be forthcoming.  We feel that it would be unfair to investors and would injure the credit of the State if we were now to make an arbitrary reduction in the number of conversion applications to be accepted and to cause loss and inconvenience to investors who have refrained from realising their holdings and have lost thereby opportunities for new investment.  It would be still more indefensible to make a proportionate reduction in the amount of all conversion applications received and redeem a part of each holding only since the expense of reinvesting a small amount is proportionately very heavy.  We, therefore, acquiesce in the decision that all holders who apply for conversion of their existing holdings must be given a full allotment of the new stock and that if the aggregate of such applications exceeds the £5,850,000, which is the approximate amount of the net debt outstanding, the Sinking Fund will to that extent prove surplus.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply, though not so forcibly, to the question of cash applications received from persons desiring to invest in the new Conversion Loan.  We would prefer to accept cash subscriptions only to an amount that would, with the available Sinking Fund of £1,150,000, cover the amount of the First National Loan for which application for redemption is made. But this may be nothing at all and in any event will probably be a very small sum.  We have to recognise, therefore, that it may be desirable to <Col N="326" /> withhold the Sinking Fund in whole or in part and to accept the cash applications of those investors who wish to invest in the new State security.  At the same time, I wish to make it clear that it is not our intention to accept cash subscriptions to an extent that would, with the amount completed, bring the new stock to a figure in excess of that of the old stock to be dealt with.  To the extent that the Sinking Fund proves surplus to requirements it will be drawn back into the Exchequer exactly as if it were the proceeds of new borrowing.</P>
    <P>To sum up, then, on this point, when the conversion operation is completed on the 1st December next, the amount of the new conversion stock in the market will not exceed £7,000,000 and may be as low as £5,850,000 or thereabouts.  We are prepared to guarantee to all existing holders of the stock of the First National Loan the right to convert into the new security.  We cannot give as comprehensive an undertaking to new cash subscribers, and in their case we propose to be guided by events.</P>
    <P>With regard to the manner of subscription, cash applications may be either fully paid, in which case the whole sum payable must be lodged on applications, or may be instalment applications.  In the latter case it has been arranged that the instalments will fall on dates which are likely to suit the investing public.  The first dividend on the new stock will be paid on the 1st June, 1936, and will be at the rate of £4 per cent. per annum (i.e., £2 per cent. actually) on holdings resulting from conversion, and on holdings created in consequence of fully paid cash applications. The dividend on holdings created in consequence of instalment applications will be at the rate of £1 12s. 0d. actually, this being the created amount accruing on the instalments to be paid on the dates fixed.  Dividends due on the 1st December next on stock of the First National Loan will be paid in the usual way to holders.</P>
    <P>The House may have noted that the redemption period of the new loan has been fixed at 1950-1970.  This <Col N="327" /> period has been chosen largely because the respective redemption periods for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th loans either coincide with it or fall within it.  Looking ahead it may happen that some future Minister for Finance, 20 or so years hence, may find it advantageous to convert and consolidate the several State issues into one loan and for that reason it has been thought desirable to adhere so far as possible to the redemption periods fixed for our other loans.</P>
    <P>As to the merits of the issue, I feel that after what has been said in regard to it by Deputy Cosgrave, Leader of the Opposition, and Deputy Thrift few words of mine are required to recommend it to the public.  There is, however, one aspect of the issue, to which Deputy Cosgrave last night was good enough to direct public attention, which I should like to stress for the benefit of holders of the existing loan.</P>
    <P>If they redeem their holdings they are likely to find it expensive to re-invest their capital.  On the other hand if they convert their holdings they will immediately have, at no expense to themselves, a gilt-edged investment giving a return of four per cent. for a minimum period of 15 years.  And, of course, they will have absolute security in regard to their capital.</P>
    <P>With regard to intending cash applicants it is important that they should realise that if they unduly delay their applications holders who desire to convert and the Sinking Fund may come in ahead of them. It is therefore important that they should apply early, as indeed should existing holders whether it be for redemption or conversion.  Again, I have to thank all sections of the House for the cordial spirit of cooperation which they have manifested in regard to this conversion operation. I am sure that with such whole-hearted assistance it will be the success we all wish.</P>

      <P>(e) where an application under paragraph (b) of this sub-section is made after the 23rd day of November, 1935, and before the 1st day of January, 1936, and the Minister is satisfied that the failure to make such application on or before the said 23rd day of November was unavoidable owing to the absence from Saorstát Eireann of the person or one of the persons by whom such application is made, the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, direct that such application shall be received and that such steps as he may specify shall be taken to give effect to such application as if it had been made on the said 23rd day of November, and thereupon the Bank of Ireland and all other persons concerned shall carry out such direction and shall have in respect thereof such indemnity and discharge as if such direction were contained in this Act.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to meet a point which was brought to my notice by Deputy Good, that is the case of those who may be unavoidably absent from Saorstát Eireann at the date for which the conversion has been announced and who may therefore not be in a position to take advantage of the offer or to avail of the opportunity to redeem their holdings.</P>

      <P>There is a point which I wish to raise in connection with the Minister's statement regarding application from persons who are <Col N="329" /> investing in the loan other than persons who are converting.  The date mentioned in the Bill up to which applications can be made is &ldquo;not later than the 23rd November.&rdquo;  I take it that the Minister is going to open his lists on the 23rd November. If a person pays in full on that date he is a week without any dividend on the 4 per cent. basis.  That I confess might give rise to questions in another country, but here, apparently, a week is not considered a very long time to be out of investment money.  Still, in justice to these people, they are entitled to be paid interest for the full time even though there is only a period of a week involved.  A bank may charge interest for that time.  It does not appear to be fair that such a person should get interest only as from the 1st December.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), to delete in line 10 the words &ldquo;and for no other purposes&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Provided that out of these funds a sum equal to the income of these funds during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of the transfer of these funds shall while the existing committee maintains the present Fever Hospital be paid to the existing committee during each year on the same dates as the said income from these funds accrued.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I did not hear what the Parliamentary Secretary said with regard to the Ministerial amendments, nor did I hear what he said in connection with amendment No. 13.  I do not want to delay the time of the House.  Is he accepting this amendment?</P>

      <P>The provision outlined there contemplates that the existing committee shall agree with the corporation in respect of the period between the handing over of the <Col N="333" /> Sweepstakes money and the day appointed for the dissolution of the committee, that the yearly expenditure of the committee shall not exceed a specified amount and if the amount is not available from the ordinary sources of income of the existing committee, the deficit shall be met by the corporation.  In the event of the corporation endeavouring to restrict too closely the expenditure of the committee, an appeal to the Minister is provided for and any payment by the corporation in respect of a deficit will, in pursuance of the present Section 8 in the Bill, be paid by the Sweepstakes money contributed by the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time ago since this question was raised, and the funds which are now to be surrendered by the committee were invested and brought in a certain income and that income was necessary in order to balance the accounts of the committee. It is proposed in this Bill to take from the committee all these funds and, consequently, all the revenue derived by the committee from the dividends that they got on those funds.  The proposal of the Parliamentary Secretary, if I read it correctly, is that there is to be a discussion between the committee and the corporation in respect of any shortage by reason of the taking of this fund from them and the dividends in respect of the fund, and that in the event of a disagreement between the two the amount will be fixed by the Minister, and such expenses, which I expect mean the expenses in so far as the funds of the existing committee are insufficient to defray them, shall be defrayed by the corporation.  It raises one question in connection with the administration of the local authorities and that is that the less dealings local authorities have with one another the better.  At least that was my experience when I had any contact with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell the House if the committee of the Cork Fever Hospital is satisfied with this arrangement? This Bill has been put down at very short notice.  I have not had an opportunity of looking up the correspondence <Col N="334" /> I had with the committee at the time, but as matters stood, the dividends they would have obtained from their invested moneys left them in a position which it was their own business to regulate.  Now when these moneys are taken from them, the bigger question arises of the insufficiency of income and if, as a result of the new arrangement, there is a conflict&mdash;and, as I say, I have not looked at the correspondence for some time&mdash; between the corporation and the committee, it would be a pity.  Such a conflict should be avoided.  On the other hand, if the two bodies are satisfied with this proposal, I have nothing to say on it, but I think the committee was justified in drawing attention to the fact that their income had been very considerably reduced and that, at least, until they were reliever of their responsibilities they ought to get the dividends which their invested moneys were bringing them in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The practical difficulty of giving them a fixed sum, based on the previous year's expenditure, might be that if that fixed sum were not sufficient, it would not meet their liabilities.  If it were more than sufficient, there would be a surplus. The provision proposed ensures that their liabilities will be met in full, but if, for example, the committee thought it would be a good thing to increase their staffs considerably in the transition period, or to increase the remuneration of their staffs, I think it is only reasonable that the corporation, who will ultimately be called upon to pay these staffs, should be consulted.  On the point as to whether there has been complete agreement between the corporation and the committee, I am not in a position to say definitely that there has been, but so far as I know there has not been any disagreement.  We have not had any representations, either from the committee or from the corporation, disapproving of this particular amendment. I believe there is agreement and that there is not any objection to the scheme as set out here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is a short Bill which regularises a position that has arisen in two towns, Trim and Ballyshannon, where elections arose but no nominations were made.  Whenever a local authority is dissolved and its powers and duties transferred under Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1925, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is required to cause a new election of members to that authority to be held and on completion of that election the powers and duties are transferred back to the local authority.  It has already happened that at an election to a dissolved local authority no candidates were nominated, and the continuance of the transfer had to be regularised by Acts passed by the Oireachtas applicable to the particular local authority concerned. Elections were directed to be held in Trim Urban District and in Ballyshannon Town in 1934, but here again no candidates were nominated, and the continuance of the transfer of the powers of these two local authorities requires to be regularised.</P>
      <P>This Bill is intended to regularise the position in Trim and Ballyshannon and at the same time govern any similar case that may happen in the future.  This is preferable to the alternative course of legislating for each local authority in which such a difficulty may arise.  The Bill provides that if at an election to a dissolved local authority, the number of candidates nominated is less than the quorum for meetings of that local authority, the election will not be proceeded with, and the dissolution order will continue in force for a further period not exceeding three years, but without prejudice to the power of the Minister to order an election at any time during that period.</P>

      <P>The class of industry affected here is a very small class and is a continuous process industry.  It must be run, not for eight hours, but all the time.  Where there is interruption of the working of the shift, for the purpose of providing a rest interval, I think it is reasonable to require that the worker should not leave the premises without the permission of the employer.  There are certain classes of process industries in respect to which the permission of the employer would be readily given, but in quite a number the permission of the employer would not be given.  In such cases either of two things can happen: Considerable risk would be <Col N="346" /> run by leaving machinery, parts, tools and things of that kind about, or it would be necessary to employ another shift for the purpose of replacing the one at work.  In this process industry it is necessary that rest should be taken on the premises.  The actual work done is not heavy work; it is important work but rarely heavy work. There is little hardship imposed upon the workers by the restriction that they should remain on the premises.  That is the practice at the present time, and it is in no way intended to depart from that practice, except after an examination of all the circumstances in conjunction with employers and employed. If, after such consultation, it is considered desirable that the existing practice should be altered and the conditions of employment improved. there is power to do that.  If it is felt, on the other hand, that the provisions of the Bill are too onerous then, after consideration, there is power to exempt an industry from that observance. Having regard to these two provisions&mdash;the power to alter one way or another the actual proposal in the Bill&mdash;I think it is necessary to meet the obvious difficulty by this amendment to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me that these continuous process industries represent about 5 per cent. of the total industry of the country. They are the exception rather than the rule?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that, in dealing with those people, it would be more expedient to say that where he is satisfied it is essential that they should remain in constant attendance they should not be subject to this part of the Bill at all; they should be taken out.  Otherwise you are going to have continuous dissatisfaction arising. If he constitutes himself the judge of the special circumstances in which persons can legitimately be asked to remain constantly on duty, no reasonable complaint will be left to anybody.  It is not going to be a very onerous business, because as he himself knows, very few of those people are to be seen.  It will remove a considerable sense of grievance from a number of other people, and will make the whole thing work easily.  I would urge on the Minister that he is mistaken in standing pat in regard to this particular amendment.  He always has the remedy, if he proves to be right in face of the whole rest of the House&mdash;the whole rest of the House is <Col N="348" /> against him&mdash;of bringing in further amending legislation, and steam-rolling it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  That is the remedy&mdash;but a remedy which I do not want.  If that amendment is not in then the only power we would have of dealing with the circumstances in this particular case would be to exempt those industries from the whole of the section, which would be obviously against the interests of the workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the only remedy.  However, I do not propose to weary the House.  I have put my case, and Deputy Norton has stated his view.  I can only say that I think the Minister is imprudent in not undertaking to review the matter between this and the Report Stage, if he is not prepared to come the whole way and accept a compromise solution such as I have proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Number 57 is a similar amendment to a similar section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we hear from the Minister why he is not prepared to agree to an amendment, the object of which will be to require that he should be satisfied that it is necessary for workers to remain on the premises?  If he is satisfied that it is necessary the Minister could make a regulation requiring that workers should remain on the premises.  In the vast majority of cases I think it will not be possible to satisfy the Minister that it is necessary to keep workers in a factory, but some captious employers may refuse their workers a few moments' recreation during the licensed shift period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no different from the present position.  What I want to make clear is that in any event there is no change and no worsening of the position of the workers.  In so far as an employer gives permission to leave the premises he can do so.  Presumably he will continue to do so.  There is no reason why he should not.  What we are aiming to do is to leave the present practice undisturbed unless it should become necessary to make an exclusion order in reference to that section following consultation with the parties. The reason I think these words should be in is because their absence would make it practically necessary, in the case of a number of responsible industries, to make an exclusion order under section which would be very undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to go to that extreme at all. Under the Bill as it stands, the worker is entitled to a certain rest interval.  Apparently the Minister thought he should have that rest interval when the Bill was circulated, and passed through Committee, because he did not propose to amend it then.  He proposes to amend it now in such a way that although the worker is given the rest interval, he cannot leave the premises unless with the permission of the employer.  I think that is an unfair amendment.  It ties the worker down to the premises, while the employer is not required to show to anyone's satisfaction that it is necessary to keep the worker on the premises.  If an employer can say that he can refuse the worker permission to leave, then that employer automatically vitiates whatever value there was in the Bill as it passed through Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not appreciate the fact that there are industries in respect of which it is not possible to let workers leave the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the gas gauge and the sugar gauge for argument, supposing it can be shown that it is necessary to prevent workers leaving premises where they are engaged watching these gauges, can the Minister not deal with that problem in respect of these or any other industries, where their presence is constantly necessary, by making an order in the terms that they cannot leave without permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The only order I could make would be one excluding <Col N="351" /> that class or work from Section 26, but not from the operation of the section which relates to the rest of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not serious in that.  What is to prevent him from leaving Section 27 (1) (e) as it stands and saying that on application from the employer, or after consultation with both sides, he may make a regulation providing that it is an offence on the part of the workers to leave or that they shall not be given permission to leave during the rest interval?  What is to prevent the Minister saying, if certain representations are made to him that it is necessary to keep workers on the premises, that he has power to make a regulation? That regulation would be just as effective as any phraseology in this Bill.  Is not that the simple way out? Would it not enable the Minister to get constant attention, where it is shown that constant attention is necessary, without at the same time giving the employer the wide and promiscuous authority that is given in the amendment, to refuse the worker permission to leave the premises during the rest interval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be practically impossible for a Minister in such a matter to act contrary to the advice of an employer.  If any employer came and said that in his opinion it was necessary that an employee should be on the premises, there would be a great risk if the Minister made an order contrary to that advice.  He would be in a very curious position if he was wrong, or there was an accident involving loss of life or destruction of property, in consequence of that order. No Minister could take the responsibility of acting in that matter except he either had, on the one hand, first-class technical advice or, on the other hand, was prepared to accept the opinion of those interested in the matter as employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a case for taking this excessive precaution. Surely the Minister can get the advice which he needs.  The Minister has people on his staff qualified presumably, <Col N="352" /> to judge of the merits of a claim of that kind made by an employer.  If there was the remotest danger of anything going wrong on account of a worker leaving a machine, most sensible people would say that the machine must be watched at all cost, because of the possibility of some catastrophe occurring.  But it is the patent case, where there is no justification for keeping a worker on the premises, that I want to safeguard against.  I would not mind if the Minister used his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you assume that an employer is going to keep a worker there when there is no reason for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he can do it and there is nothing to prevent his doing it unreasonably under the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you not take the power which we suggest you want to decide these difficult cases?  The whole principle of this amendment is wrong. The language of it belongs to the Constitution (Amendment) Act and not to a Conditions of Employment Bill.  The whole principle underlying it is vicious. The Minister is asked to decide the issues in a dispute.  He can decide in favour of the employer where he is satisfied and, if he is not so satisfied, he can decide in favour of the worker. But he is legislatively too lazy to do that.  He will not put a provision in the Bill saying he will examine the merits of the dispute.  He says: &ldquo;No, let the employer do it and do not trouble me with these administrative details.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In a matter of that kind the employer, whether the employer is a private individual or a company or the State, must be the person to determine what is required in the interests of the industry.  The employer in this case need not necessarily be the bloated capitalist the Deputy is always attacking.  The employer may be a Department of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike very much the mentality behind the amendment, because there is no doubt that the language of the amendment and the mentality disclosed by the Minister in the discussion shows that it is a purely militaristic mentality, the mentality of the sergeant-major when dealing with a body of soldiers on parade.  The Minister admitted&mdash;he was frank enough on that, but he has not been frank on other questions&mdash;that he had been approached by a body of employers and that it was as a result of his leg being pulled, either by the Saorstát Federation of Industries or the Chamber of Commerce, represented by Deputy Good, that he seeks <Col N="355" /> to insert this amendment.  The meaning of the amendment, and I am not attempting to exaggerate, is that he does not trust a certain type of workmen engaged at a certain type of machinery to carry out the spirit of an understanding as to when they should leave work and whether they will go out a minute before or remain out a minute after they are due to attend to certain machines.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House frankly what kind of case has been put to him by the body of employers which convinced him that this amendment was necessary?  Will he give the House the case made to him?  It is the House he has to convince.  The absent Deputies do not want to be convinced.  They will stroll in and register their votes like putting a penny in the slot.  Will the Minister give a case where any cantankerous or careless workman left a machine and allowed the machinery to be upset or any damage to be done to the factory?  If he cannot give a case of that kind, he should at least trust the workmen who are going to come under the terms of the Bill that they will do in the future what they have done in the past.  If there is a cantankerous or careless workman who is going to evade the spirit of a measure of this kind as between himself and his employer, surely the Minister knows well that there are disciplinary measures which can be taken by employers rather than by bringing in an amendment of this type.</P>

      <P>The Minister thinks that any man who leaves his work a minute before or remains out a minute after the 15 minutes' rest must be compelled by the wording of this section and that as a result of that he is going to be a better workman than he otherwise would be.  Legislation of this Public Safety Act type is not going to make better workers in the future than in the past.  In any case, the Minister should give the House any cases put forward by Deputy Good or some unnamed body which persuaded the Minister to put in a section of this <Col N="356" /> kind.  I do not believe any sensible argument of any kind was put up to the Minister but that he was merely approached or written to by the Secretary of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, or by some of those people who speak for these new industrial concerns set up in this country, and led to believe that the workmen who attend to machinery are a reckless and careless body of men and cannot be trusted, and that the only way to make them do work in an efficient and conscientious way is to bulldose them with a section which should be contained in a Public Safety Act.</P>

      <P>A statutory right to this rest, and we are limiting that right in a manner which is necessary in his own interest as a worker as well as in the interests of his associates. Why say we are compelling workers to do one thing or another?  We are doing nothing of the kind.  We are saying that these workers are being given from the date upon which this Bill becomes law this right to a rest on a statutory basis.  Deputy Davin says that if a worker walks away from a machine he can be punished by an employer in some other way.  He can at present, but after this Bill goes through, unless the amendment is adopted, the employer will commit an offence punishable by a fine if he attempts to interfere with a worker leaving his machine, no matter what may happen.</P>

      <P>There is one way out, and that is to put the responsibility of deciding whether or not it is possible to leave the machine unattended for the rest interval upon those running the concern.  That is being done at the present time, and it is being <Col N="357" /> done when the workers have no statutory right to protect them.  The fact is that the whole of that section is conferring, as of right and by law, upon workers certain limitations upon the conditions of their employment which a number of workers enjoy at the present time because of voluntary agreement between their employers and the representatives of the employees. In future that will be a matter of law, and it is necessary, in future, that one should have these statutory provisions ringed round with the necessary safeguards to ensure that the machinery of industrial production will work and that, in relation to machines which must run continuously and must run under proper supervision, it is not possible to allow these workers to leave the premises.  It is not done at the present time and it has never been done.</P>

      <P>This section has a marked difference from sections of a similar nature in another Bill.  We were then dealing with continuous processes in industries and it seems that we are now dealing with industrial workers.  There are types of workers engaged in continuous processes, such as railwaymen, who have to deal with the safety of the line. The men I am referring to might be, perhaps, 40 miles away at the time they are supposed to get this 15 minutes' rest.  If a man of the type I am referring to is to get his 15 minutes' rest, is it intended that he must sit down under the eye of his employer or his foreman?  What would be meant by &ldquo;the premises&rdquo; in a case of that kind?  Should there not be some discretion with regard to this question of the 15 minutes?  I hold that there ought to be some elasticity if you are going to give the worker 15 minutes.  If you are going to give the man 15 minutes' rest, it should not be done under a rigorous code.</P>

      <P>I agree; but take the case of a railway company which wants to build a bridge which can only be built by a continuous shift process. My impression was that such work must be done and that, where the workers concerned are away some distance they would not be entitled to this 15 minutes' period of rest, unless they are under the eye of the foreman. I hold that the measure is not going to confer a benefit on such workers, if that is the case.  The man wants a period of relaxation and rest and, according to this, it would appear that he has to walk a distance from his place of occupation.  Who can construe what are the premises?</P>

      <P>There is one question that has emerged from the discussion on this amendment and on the previous amendment on the same section, and that is that the amendment, apparently, is designed to meet certain exigencies in certain industries. The cases of sugar cookers and the watchers of gauges in gas companies have been mentioned.  When I saw the Minister and Deputy Norton billing and cooing on this matter, I thought there was some agreement, but it seems to me that, in order to avoid further divisions, I should like to point out that there are relatively very few things to decide.  Would it not be better, in view of that fact, to legislate for the few occupations to which this amendment would apply&mdash; which are, relatively, very few, in relation to other occupations for which the Minister caters.  I suggest that the Minister should agree to add, at the end of the section, some such words as &ldquo;save and except these occupations and trades&rdquo;&mdash;and then to name the cases to which the section should or should not apply.  I suggest that this is a way out of the difficulty. The Minister has been good enough, on many occasions, to consider the views put forward by members of all Parties and I hope that, in the same spirit, in this case he will give this suggestion the same consideration.  I think that very good suggestions were put forward by Deputy Norton and other members of the Labour Party. While there is so much good in the Bill I do not want to see a whole lot of controversy over some sections, and I think some <i>via media</i> might be arrived at whereby these difficulties might be got over.  I know that the Minister has become rattled by the rather schoolmasterly style in which Deputy Norton proceeded to lecture him and I am sure it is because of that that we cannot now proceed in the peaceful and helpful attitude under which we were previously discussing the Bill.  I put it to the Minister that he should accept this qualification to his amendment&mdash;&ldquo;save and except the following occupations or industries&rdquo;&mdash;which could be set out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, at the end of Section 30, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing contained in a shift-work licence granted in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall operate so as to disturb any agreement either expressed or implied relating to the hours of work, rates of pay or conditions of employment subsisting between the person to whom such licence is granted and the workers employed by such person.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed on the first Committee Stage.  I think it is an eminently reasonable amendment.  It does not prevent the person obtaining a shift-work licence and it will not prevent the working under a shift-work licence.  All it does is to endeavour to ensure that shift work licences cannot be issued in such a way as to constitute an infraction of agreements relating to hours of work, rates of pay or conditions of employment.  On the first Committee Stage the Minister undertook to look into this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment cannot be accepted.  The granting of a shift-work licence will not or need not <Col N="361" /> affect the rates of pay.  There is nothing in the Bill which suggests that these should be affected.  But it will almost certainly affect the hours of work and the conditions of employment. If the industry is one that for any purpose is to be transformed into a shift-work industry then there are going to be alterations in the hours of work, and so on.  These are matters that will have to be considered before the licence is issued and it is to provide that the representatives of the workers shall have ample opportunities of putting forward their case that I moved a previous amendment.  A shift-work licence will alter the hours of work.  It will actually increase the hours.  Workers under the Bill as it stands may be worked for longer hours than in the case of an industry which can only be divided into a certain number of shifts.  There may be variation of the working hours if a man is given a shift-work licence.  We cannot provide automatically that there will be no alteration of the hours.  There may be alterations upwards or downwards but all these matters will be taken into consideration before the licence is issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not do so.  The shift-work licence may upset existing agreements where it results in improvements in the conditions of work.  But so far as this particular question of a licence for shift work is concerned, there is no doubt that if an industry which has been working on the day system is transformed into a shift-work industry, there is going to be variation in the existing agreements whether that is done voluntarily or under licence.  What we are providing for is that a change-over cannot be effected unless the licence is issued and the licence will be issued only after all the parties are consulted.  If such a change takes place whatever alterations are involved in the conditions of employment will be known beforehand.  It is after that knowledge that conditions in the issuing of the licence will be laid down.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say what is the effect of clause 3 of paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 31, which reads:</P>
      <P>The time on any ordinary working day when such adult worker has completed nine hours' work on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would travelling time be regarded as time worked for the purpose of computing what time a worker had worked?  I take it that this section is intended to cover in future all ordinary employment that has not been specially exempted, and while 48 hours is quite long enough, at the same time I think that these working hours for any one day are not sufficiently flexible.  On the <Col N="366" /> Committee Stage of the Bill instanced the case of a worker who had to catch the mail train in the morning. I agree that under paragraph (a) a male worker can now catch the mail train in the morning, but at the same time there are instances in which, on a particular day, there would be a very long period of travelling to and from, and, possibly, a very short period of work.  For the sake of argument, let us say that there might be six hours spent travelling to and six hours travelling back again, with two hours of work.  Would the Minister say how that is to be accomplished in a single day?  I do not suppose the Minister wants to legislate for every case of an employer who has a very small and highly skilled job in which case the work has to be done a very long way from his base.  Would the Minister say what is to happen at 8 p.m. if the workman has not returned home?  Has he to stop a motor car or a train to get out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this amendment, during the discussion on the Committee Stage I indicated that it was my intention to propose a general recasting of the provisions of the Bill relating to overtime.  Arising out of that statement, I think there was practically no discussion of this section in Committee.  The original proposals, as set out in Section 32, were framed for the purpose of keeping our legislation in conformity with the international convention.  The international convention provided for the control of overtime working by regulation.  We were anxious to keep as close as we could to the convention but we found, when we went into the matter in great detail, that it was undesirable to do so in so far as the making of regulations was going to create considerable difficulty and, therefore, we decided to depart from the terms of the convention and bring forward our own proposals for dealing with overtime.  These proposals are set out in amendments Nos. 69 and 73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals are practically these. We propose to fix a certain percentage of normal working which can be worked by way of overtime without seeking specific sanction for the doing of it.  That is called for the purpose of identification in these amendments &ldquo;uncontrolled overtime.&rdquo;  It is proposed to set out how many hours in the day or how many hours in the week may be worked at overtime, automatically, at the discretion of the employer, subject to the payment of overtime wages and also to provide for the granting of permission in special cases, after due application has been made and due consideration has been given to the matter, to work in excess of the uncontrolled overtime <Col N="368" /> while at the same time taking power by regulation to abolish uncontrolled overtime or to limit uncontrolled overtime in any particular trade.  The position, therefore is, that when the Bill becomes law there will be power to work overtime as set out in amendment No. 69&mdash;a power, however, which may be limited by regulations made subsequently, after consultation with the representatives of employers and employees in any particular trade, or which may be abolished in relation to that particular trade.  On the other hand, there will be power in exceptional cases to extend the amount of overtime work.  That is in my opinion the most satisfactory way of meeting this particular problem.</P>
    <P>There may be some question as to the amount of uncontrolled overtime that may be worked.  The proposal in the Bill is, roughly, 10 per cent. of the normal working time, that is with certain outside limits with respect to each day, each week or the whole year, but having regard to the fact that that section is going to have general application to all industries, irrespective of circumstances, and that in some industries the working of overtime, and even a considerable amount of overtime is almost inevitable at certain times of the year, I think it is advisable to leave that general percentage there, seeing that we have power, if the concession should be abused, to limit it by regulation after these consultations and also having advertence to the fact that if it is necessary in particular cases of an exceptional kind, to work longer than the overtime permitted in the uncontrolled overtime section, we can issue a permit for that purpose also.  It is the system which will create least administrative difficulties and impose least hardship on either workers or employers in the matter of overtime.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, we wish to discourage the working of overtime as a regular policy and if the proposals here regarding uncontrolled time in relation to any industry, result in overtime being worked regularly, when an increase in normal staffs should be effected, then I would propose to use the powers which we are taking to limit the uncontrolled <Col N="369" /> overtime in such cases, or even if necessary to abolish it altogether, permanently or temporarily.  It is desirable that it should be known that I intend these powers to be used for the purpose of discouraging and preventing the working of overtime except in exceptional circumstances or in relation to such industries where, because of the seasonal nature of the business to be done, overtime working cannot be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to understand further the Minister's proposals on the question of overtime, both uncontrolled overtime and the overtime which might be worked after the period of uncontrolled overtime had been exceeded.  I think most people would desire that a pretty ruthless measure should be adopted to eliminate the evil of some persons working overtime while others are unable to find any employment whatsoever.  Any powers which the Minister takes in the second portion of amendment No. 69 to intervene in the case of industries which are working overtime regularly, or which are abusing the uncontrolled overtime provisions of the amendment, will, I think, have the hearty support of everybody who desires to eliminate the evil of overtime in any shape or form so long as or in cases where it is possible to grapple effectively with that evil.  I think, however, that in amendment No. 69 the amount of uncontrolled overtime which the Minister will permit to be worked without any licence or any control is somewhat excessive.  Two hours a day may not be very much in an emergency. Conceivably 240 hours in a year, which is about 10 per cent. of the normal year's working, may not be excessive, but 12 hours in a week is excessive.  It is another day and a half in the week.  Twelve hours in the week is too long to permit as uncontrolled overtime because in that trade while you are giving an average of 10 per cent. in respect of the whole year, you are running up 20 per cent. in respect of the week.  I think 20 per cent. is too high in respect to a particular week.  If that is true, as I believe it is, in respect to sub-section (a) of the amendment, it is increasingly <Col N="370" /> true in respect to young persons who are to be permitted ten hours' overtime in any week&mdash;that is 25 per cent. of the normal working week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that could not go on every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but it could go on unchecked under the first portion of this amendment until 200 hours in the year had been reached, and unless the case were then brought to the notice of the Minister and he put in operation the machinery provided in the second portion of the amendment. I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to reduce the 12 hours in the week.  I am not complaining about the general 10 per cent.  If he must have overtime it is not an unreasonable percentage, though we would like to eliminate the evil as far as possible. Two hours in a day are not, in an emergency, a great evil either, although one would like to be able to eliminate that completely.  But running overtime for a young person for ten hours a week, which represents 25 per cent. of a normal day, is, in my opinion, excessive and it infringes the overriding average of 10 per cent. for the whole year.  You might conceivably, under this amendment, and in perfect conformity with the amendment, have the case where an adult worker might work the normal 48 hours and another 12 hours, making a total of 60 hours a week, and he might do that until such time as the 240 hours had been reached for the year, and then they might be passed on to some other worker in the same employment. This overtime may not apply to all workers at the same time.  By a series of relays, employing different workers on overtime, considerable abuse might be possible, although there might be no infraction of the amendment.  I think the Minister should consider this matter with the object of reducing the amount of uncontrolled weekly overtime.  In the case of the adult worker and the young person it is 25 per cent., whereas the Minister is aiming at a national average of 10 per cent.  A good case can be made for the reduction of overtime in a week, but a specially strong <Col N="371" /> case can be made in the case of young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is much objection to having 12 hours in the week.  If you permit two hours in the day it is conceivable that overtime might be worked for the whole week, making a total of 12 hours.  One of the difficulties in this matter is, of course, that it is very frequently the case that the worker as well as the employer wishes the overtime to be worked.  That is the evil of it and that is why it is necessary to have limitations imposed, otherwise the workers would probably never complain about being asked to work overtime, particularly when they are secured by law in future in regard to the overtime rate.  The question is what is the wisest allowance to make that will apply to all industrial concerns. We must have some general provision and that is what is set out in amendment No. 69.  If that general provision is too great, having regard to the circumstances of particular industries, we can reduce it.  If it is not sufficient to deal with the circumstances of other industries, it can be extended under the proposed new section, amendment No. 73.  I do not think there will be many cases where it will be necessary to extend it, except to deal with entirely abnormal circumstances which might necessitate an abnormal amount of work in some trade for a limited period, perhaps a period that might never recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For ordinary overtime work so as to allow employers that liberty of action which is essential to enable work to be completed and occasional rush orders to be met and contracts to be completed on time, the 10 per cent. margin is, I think, reasonable enough, provided the yearly 10 per cent. can be made a larger percentage for particular periods where extra work has to be done. Ten per cent. of a 48 hour week, 4½ hours, would be of very little advantage if that was all the overtime that could be worked.  It is necessary to allow a much higher percentage in the week, knowing, however, that as regards each week in <Col N="372" /> which the full permitted overtime is worked, each such week brings earlier the period in which no overtime can be worked.  Employers will, on the whole, I think, endeavour to economise on uncontrolled overtime.  It is only rarely that there is an inducement to an employer to arrange overtime.  In the majority of trades in which overtime is worked occasionally there is no advantage to the employer except in so far as he completes a contract or avoids penalties by getting the work done in the time arranged.  It is only rarely the economy of capital equipment which the working of overtime permits is of sufficient advantage to the employer to offset the higher rate of wages.  In these circumstances, I do not think the power of uncontrolled overtime will be used unreasonably.  If it should be, we have adequate powers under sub-section 2 of the proposed new section to limit it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Beckett referred to the Christmas season.  I know that <Col N="373" /> last year and the previous year certain people engaged in the confectionery trade were working overtime in order to deal with the particular rush of business at that time, and they worked that overtime even though they were being prosecuted for it and they paid the fines that were imposed upon them on prosecution.  They could not avoid working overtime if their contracts were to be completed.  That circumstance will arise in such industries from time to time almost inevitably.  We should try to prevent it and make these employers plan their activities and operations in a way which will prevent unusual overtime having to be worked. But when the circumstances do arise, there must be power for the particular week or two in which the abnormal circumstances arise to deal with them.  I do not think ten or 12 hours in a week, uncontrolled overtime, is unduly high. If it should prove to be, we have power to reduce it.  For a general overriding limit applying to all industries, I think it is safe enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we make a reduction in sub-section (2) of amendment No. 69, that alters the uncontrolled overtime generally.  In so far as amendment No. 73 is concerned, we are giving a permit limiting the time to an individual concerned to work permitted overtime for the period of the permit.  But the permit has not general application; it has application only to the firm that gets the permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that if the Minister does reduce the weekly period of overtime provided in amendment No. 69, he can, if any firm represents special difficulties to him, grant that firm a permit under amendment No. 73.  True, it has only application to a particular firm, but if a particular firm feels that there is an emergency in the matter of staff which requires to be met by permitted overtime, there is not very much difficulty in making an application for a permit, <Col N="374" /> and still the Minister would be maintaining the reasonable maximum overtime in amendment No. 69.  The Minister has power in amendment No. 73 on a good case being shown to allow the maximum to go up to ten or 12 hours.  Under amendment No. 69, the difficult case could then be provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that there might be a compromise as between Deputy Norton and the Minister.  Deputy Norton's main point, I take it, is that if ten hours a week overtime is worked by a young person and a further ten hours period in the next week, it puts an undue strain on the constitution of a young person.  If the Minister put in the ten hours period in the first week and then said that for the second week, while working consecutively, not more than six hours overtime or something of the kind were to be worked, it might bring Deputy Norton and himself together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the circumstances are likely to arise in which these powers will be considerably abused.  I said earlier that employers will be influenced by self interest in the majority of cases and it is very rarely in the interests of an employer to work overtime.  It is in the interests of the worker.  In these matters, it is the worker who wants to work because of the additional earnings he gets; the <Col N="375" /> employer usually only does it when he has to, and he does it knowing that his costs of production arc going to be increased merely to enable him to fulfil a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the employer docs not want overtime because he is then paying higher rates, but what struck me about Deputy Norton's argument is that a young person may be anxious, and probably always very anxious, to get overtime and possibly a young person working for two consecutive weeks at overtime may be impairing his health.  For that reason, I thought a compromise might be reached between the Minister and Deputy Norton, in the shape of a provision that he or she should not be allowed to work the maximum overtime for two consecutive weeks.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, Section 34 (1), line 32, after the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or young persons who have attained a specified age.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, I think, an improved revision in relation to Section 34.  Section 34 <Col N="377" /> gives the Minister power to authorise young persons, who are employed as assistants to adult workers, and without whose assistance those adult workers could not carry on their work, to be regarded as adult workers for the purpose of the maximum working week.  It is proposed to amend the section so that the powers of the Minister can be exercised, not merely in relation to young persons as a class, but in relation to young persons who have attained a specific age.  Thus, the Minister could limit a permit to young persons between the ages of 17 and 18 or the ages of 16 and 18 years instead of merely to young persons generally.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, to add at the end of Section 34 (2) the following words &ldquo;and in any event no such regulation shall have effect in respect of any industrial undertaking if the number of young persons employed to do industrial work in such undertaking bears to the number of other workers so employed in such undertaking a proportion greater than 20 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to deal with the position which is created where the Minister, on being satisfied that young persons are necessary as assistants to adult workers and that the work could not proceed without their being employed, may by Order make regulations, in accordance with the section, directing that young persons <Col N="378" /> while employed on such form of industrial work shall be deemed to be adult workers for the purposes of the Act.  There may be cases where it is necessary to say that a certain kind of operation which is being done by adult workers and on which a young person is assisting cannot effectively be done if the young person ceased employment through the operation of the provisions of Section 33.</P>
    <P>One of the objects of this Bill is to endeavour to restrict the number of young persons in industry and to get a better balance as between men and women and youths and adults and, while I think some case can be made for examining a case where the fact that a young person left off work earlier than the adult might cause inconvenience and dislocation, I think that firms who are given facilities to retain young workers in such circumstances ought to be able to show that they are not employing a predominantly large number of young workers. In order to qualify for whatever benefits they will get under Section 34, they ought to be able to convince the Minister that all their workers, or a substantial number of them, are not. in the category of young workers.</P>
    <P>An amendment, therefore, which limited the benefits of Section 34 to such firms as employed a substantial proportion of adult workers would, I think, encourage the employment of adult workers and, at the same time, eliminate the difficulties which will inevitably be caused where applications under this section are received from firms who employ a very substantial number of young workers.  In order to qualify for benefits under Section 34, the firm should be able to show that it has no greater proportion of young workers than one to five. If it has one to ten, it should be treated very differently from a firm which has only one to five.  Under the section as it stands, it is possible for a firm employing a very large number of young workers to make this application and present the Minister with difficulty in refusing it, whereas the amendment, if accepted, would recognise the special difficulties in the case of a firm which had young <Col N="379" /> workers in no greater proportion than one to five.  I think the Minister should examine that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment should be accepted.  I dislike Very much inserting limiting provisions of this kind when nobody knows precisely what the effect of them will be.  I could not say straight off what the effect of the amendment would be in relation to particular industries.  I can imagine circumstances in which it might be desirable to grant the concession contemplated by Section 34 in a case in which the percentage of young workers to adult workers was higher than 20&mdash;say 25 per cent.  That might be the case where, for every three adults there was a young worker employed, the employment of that young worker being necessary to enable the work of the adults to proceed.  What we provide is that each individual case be examined by the Minister on its merits.  Before he makes any decision he must consult the interested parties&mdash;representatives of the employers in the industry concerned and representatives of the workers&mdash;and obtain their views.  It is only after hearing their views and considering the application on its merits that he will make his decision.  I think that it is much better to leave the matter like that than to impose in the statute an overriding limitation on the Minister's powers when you cannot say exactly how the imposition of that overriding limitation will work out in practice.</P>

      <P>The principle of the amendment is, I think, important if we are going to have, as, unfortunately, we have to-day, a large number of industries employing a considerable number of juveniles.  It would be most unfair if they were to introduce one or two adult workers and say that it was necessary to have all these young persons in order to feed with work the couple of adult workers.  Instead of working for 40 hours, the employers may say that they will make application to have these juveniles deemed adult workers and work them up to 48 hours.  The excuse will be that the <Col N="380" /> juveniles are necessary to the work of the adults and the employment of a couple of adults will bring the employer within the scope of this section.  I think that that would be most unfair. The Minister may say that he objects to the proportion of one to five, but he should fix some proportion.  Otherwise, this section may be used as an excuse by firms employing a few adults and a large number of juveniles for extending the hours of work of the juveniles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>Another question arises on this amendment.  There is increasing difficulty in finding employment for young persons in the City of Dublin.  I happen to be connected with the juvenile department of the labour exchange, and we have some 6,000 applications every year from juveniles. We have an increasing difficulty in finding employment for them.  In fact, we cannot find employment for half the number who apply.  If we are to have a large number of young persons out of employment, we shall have difficulties in other connections.  Tradesmen have told me, over and over again, that one of the reasons why Dublin is so expensive for men with large families is that they cannot get employment for the members of their families, as they can in industrial centres.  If employment cannot be obtained for the young people, naturally it is more expensive for the head of the family to support them.  That aspect of the question does not, I am afraid, get the consideration in the Dáil that it deserves.  On all sides, at present, we find young persons unemployed.  We have difficulties of all sorts arising out of that unemployment. That is a question which will become very serious in the near future.  I ask the Minister to be very careful as to what he does in the way of restricting employment for young persons for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what the unit is for which the regulations are to be made.  Is the unit to be a particular industry or a particular firm engaged in an industry?  If it is to be an industry, it seems to me that it would be very difficult to decide the number <Col N="381" /> of persons&mdash;juveniles or others&mdash;to be engaged in that industry.  One firm engaged in the industry might have a certain proportion of juveniles and another might have a different proportion. I should like the Minister to make plain what the unit will be.</P>

      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section and subject also to the restrictions imposed by this Act on the employment of women and young persons at night but notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an employer may employ a worker to do industrial work in an industrial undertaking for a longer period on any particular day than the period permitted in that behalf by this Act (other than this section), but subject to the limitation that the length of time by which such longer period exceeds the said period so permitted as aforesaid shall not exceed:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  prohibiting the employment, under the next preceding sub-section of this section, of workers or any specified class or classes of workers to do any particular form of industrial work in an industrial undertaking for a longer period than the period permitted by this Act (other than this section);</P>

      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for an employer to employ a worker to do any form of industrial work on any day on which such worker has done any form of industrial work for another employer, except where the aggregate of the periods for which such worker does industrial work for each of such employers respectively on that day does not exceed the period (exclusive of overtime) for which such worker could lawfully be employed to do industrial work for one employer on that day.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage, I think it was fairly generally suggested from all parts of the House that it should not be lawful for an employer to employ a worker to do any form of industrial work on a day on which that worker had done industrial work for another employer in circumstances which would bring the total amount of the work done in excess of the total amount permitted by the Bill, and that it should be made an offence on the part of the worker or the employer thus to exceed that limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult for an employer always to know whether the man he is employing has been working for somebody else earlier on that same day.  Suppose the employer is told &ldquo;I have not worked for anybody else to-day&rdquo; and on that undertaking the employer gives him employment.  As the section stands the employer will be liable.  It is entirely against the general principle of the law that a man should be deemed to commit an offence unless he has had an opportunity of really knowing it.  I suggest to the Minister that he would meet that point by putting in the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The putting in of that word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; would place upon the Minister, or his officers concerned, the obligation of proving that it was done knowingly.  The plea that it was done unknowingly would undoubtedly be the grounds for the defence.  It would be a very difficult matter to prove that it was done knowingly, as distinct from proving that it was done.</P>

      <P>Could not the Minister meet it to some extent by saying something to the effect &ldquo;Unless the employer shows that he did not know,&rdquo; thus putting the onus on the employer?  It does not appear to be equitable to make the employer absolutely responsible in a case like this where he himself might have been deceived.  I am sure the intention is that a man shall not be deemed to have committed an offence unless he has in fact broken the law knowingly?</P>

      <P>It is really a matter of dealing with the evidence. If the Minister will tell the House that he will consider what suitable alteration might be made in the wording in order to meet that point I shall be perfectly satisfied.  I do not like the idea that a man who acted in perfect innocence should discover that he has committed an offence.</P>

      <P>That is undoubtedly the case.  As Deputies who were present at the discussion on the Committee Stage are aware, I am not very enthusiastic about this provision, because I see considerable difficulties in its enforcement.  There is apparently a general opinion that the power should be there to prevent this type of employment, which interferes with the normal working of certain businesses. Probably the building trade, the motor-repairing trade, and one or two others, are particularly affected.  The intention is to prevent a worker who has been employed during the day from doing for a private employer at night work which would ordinarily be done by his day-time employer in the ordinary commercial way.  There is a point, undoubtedly, in what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said.  I do not know how we can meet that point, but I will consider the matter.</P>

      <P>Take Deputy Beckett's case.  Suppose a man comes to the employer and says: &ldquo;I am unemployed.  Will you give me this job?&rdquo; and he is given the job.  Now, if he is in fact out of work, the man who employs him has committed no offence; if in fact he has been working that day the man who employs him will, under this section have committed an offence. If he has genuinely deceived the person who gives him work it seems to me to be rather hard that the person whom he has deceived should <Col N="388" /> be convicted.  However, if the Minister will think the matter over I will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>In page 17, before Section 40 (5), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  Every worker employed on industrial work who is present on the premises of his employer while industrial work is being done on such premises shall, unless he is so present on such premises in contravention of the orders of such employer, be deemed for the purposes of this section to be present on such premises for the purposes of doing the industrial work on which he is so employed.</P>
      <P>This amendment was suggested by Deputy Norton, and I think it is desirable. It provides, where a worker is found present on the premises of an employer while industrial work is being done, that he shall be deemed to be there for the purpose of doing that industrial work.

It is possible that if an inspector went into factory premises after the working hours and found workers present while they might not be actually working, the employer could say that they were not working and thus evade the obligation to cease work at a particular hour.  The purpose of the amendment is to give the inspector the right to assume that if workers employed to do a particular form of industrial work are found on <Col N="391" /> the premises at any time, they are deemed to be there for the purpose of doing work, unless the employer says they are there in contravention of his instructions.</P>

      <Col N="393" /> This is really a drafting amendment.

      <P>(d)  industrial work excepted from this sub-section by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with representatives of employers interested in such industrial work and with representatives of workers so interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is desirable to have this provision. As the section stands, workers are permitted to work on Sundays and holidays when engaged in continuous process shift work, such as printing newspapers or working in creameries. There may be other industries of which we have no cognisance at present, or there may be industries established, in respect of which work on Sundays and public holidays may be as necessary as in the case of the industries mentioned. Consequently, there should be some section which would enable an order to be made extending the scope of these industries after consulting with the workers and the employers concerned. Otherwise we would have to promote amending legislation and that is, I think, not desirable when the possibility can be provided against by an amendment of this kind.  I cannot at the moment mention any such industry. If I could mention the industry that might be brought under this amendment, I would insert an amendment in the Bill to cover it.  I do not know that there are any such in respect of which this power will have to be used at present, but there is always the possibility of some new industrial development taking place of a kind which would justify the making of an order under the proposed amendment to unable work on Sundays and public <Col N="394" /> holidays to be done, subject, of course, to the usual provision in respect of another day off, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Minister one of the cases he is thinking of. Apart from continuous process and licensed shift work, there is work that has to be done on Sundays and holidays in relaying the line.  That is done on Sunday for a period of eight or nine hours, and it is additional to the working week of the operatives, who in their agreement have a guaranteed week of six days.  Occasionally they have to do this relaying, or work in connection with bridges, and they are paid at the rate of time and a quarter.  That is not in conflict with their agreement for the 48-hour week.  I want to know if the concluding portion of the section will be applicable to these men, that they will have to be laid off for 24 hours before the Sunday, in case they could not do this work of relaying on any other day, and that the result will be that they will work on Sunday for time and a quarter and be laid off on some other day of the week, so that they will have to work on the Sunday for just the extra quarter time.  That will mean a hardship on the workers and dislocation of the company's organisation. These staffs are not drawn from the particular area where the operation is taking place, and having to make arrangements for the laying off of these men for a day is going to cause considerable dislocation.  The point arises whether the Minister contemplates that they should be paid for the day they are laid off.  If the effect is to be as I have stated, it is going to cause hardship to the men concerned and great dislocation to the organisation of the company's work, because these are regular employees who cannot be replaced from outside as they are semiskilled men trained for this work.  I should like to know from the Minister if my interpretation is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact that particular class of work was brought to my notice by representatives of the railway companies. I indicated here before, I think, when some reference was made to it that it would have to be met by an exclusion order under Section 22. <Col N="395" /> It would mean that that class of work would be excluded from the operation of this section.  But there may be classes of work which we would permit to be done on Sundays, but in respect of which we would like to attach the obligation to give a day off in lieu of Sunday.  If we did not make this amendment, the only thing we could do in relation to such classes of work would be the same thing which we contemplate doing for the class to which Deputy Keyes refers&mdash;to exclude them from the section, in which case the obligation to give a day off would not arise.  It might be preferable in these cases, instead of excluding them from the section, to include them in sub-section (1) by an order under the amendment, in which case the obligation of sub-section (2) would be attached and the day off would have to be given.</P>

      <P>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the next preceding sub-section of this section, an employer may employ an adult male worker to do, on any Sunday, for a period not exceeding three hours or for two or more periods not exceeding in the aggregate three hours, any industrial work to which the prohibition effected by the said next preceding sub-section applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that it was represented that in certain trades it is necessary for a worker or two to attend at the factory premises on the Sunday for a short period, perhaps an hour or two hours, to do certain necessary work where chemical processes, etc., are in progress, and that in such a case it was not in the interests of the worker that that attendance upon Sunday for an hour or two should operate to require that he should get a complete day off during the week.  Consequently, I am proposing to insert a section to make this prohibition apply only in respect of work exceeding three hours in duration.  That will permit of these <Col N="396" /> casual supervision jobs, which it is necessary to do upon Sundays, being executed without dislocation in respect of the organisation of the work, or without hardship to the worker in the matter of reducing his weekly earnings.</P>

      <P>I do not think that this amendment is quite clear for one section of the workers.  The amendment does not bring you any further in one respect because when you come to amendment No. 86 it deals with the case of a worker &ldquo;whose ordinary remuneration is calculated by reference to time, at such rate per day as shall be the average earnings of such worker for the last six working days immediately preceding such public holiday.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> And then it proceeds to deal with piece-work.  Now, there is another class of workers who are paid nominally by the hour, and who work 44 or 48 hours per week at an agreed rate. The practice, in most of these trades, is to work five days at a longer period and, on the Saturday, at a shorter period.  Now, if the bank holiday falls on a Saturday, at what rate is the pay to be calculated?  I would say that it was to be calculated at the number of hours that would be normally worked on a Saturday, but the employee might contend that he should receive payment on the basis of the longer day's pay, namely, at the rate of the ordinary working day of the week.  I would like the Minister to clear that point up.  I take it that, in the case of that class of employee, no difficulty will arise about what his pay for the week will be, because he will get 44 hours; but, in the case of the bank holiday falling on a Saturday, is it to be calculated as if he were working on a Saturday or as if he were working on an ordinary day of the week?</P>

      <P>It says that the day's pay shall be calculated at the rate which would be applicable if the public holiday concerned were a day of annual leave, and the method of calculating the days for annual leave is set out precisely and it is averaged over the last six working days immediately preceding the public holiday concerned.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Dockrell's point is that if a public holiday falls on a Friday it would be calculated in the ordinary way, but that, if the public holiday falls on a Saturday it should be calculated in the same way.  His contention is, as it appears to me, that that is not just to the employer, because, if it were not a public holiday, the worker would be kept on.  It is not specified in the Act what should be done in the case of a public holiday falling on a Saturday instead of an ordinary week-day.  Is that your point, Deputy Dockrell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is complicated by the worker working on an occasional rating.  If the Minister's contention is to stand, and if it is a question of an average rate, it will then be a case <Col N="400" /> of what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and, instead of getting eight hours' pay for a full bank holiday, the worker will only get a somewhat lower fraction.  I think that it would be better if the Minister would clear that point up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced a Bill to give holidays of six days with pay.  Now in this amendment you are providing for at least 12 days pay for non-work.  In a very large number of employments in this country at present bank holidays are at the workers' expense.  In very few cases are these holidays at the employers' expense. This amendment provides for the payment of the workers for every bank holiday.  I think that is a mistake.  To introduce this section now for the payment of public holidays is, I think, <Col N="401" /> unwise.  It may happen in this country that at various times the Government may decide to proclaim other public holidays, and then the question will always arise whether they are to be paid for or not.  That sort of thing creates friction, and friction is not a matter that should be allowed to enter into this thing at all.  When the Bill was introduced it was amongst other things a Bill providing for a definite number of holidays.  But now this amendment alters that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was before us in Committee this question as to whether public holidays should be paid for or not was discussed at considerable length.  The Bill, as introduced, does not provide for the payment of public holidays, and it was urged here from all sides of the House that it was a doubtful benefit to give the workers additional public holidays throughout the year unless provision was made for payment.  I found myself in the position of having no argument that I considered really effective against the argument advanced, and after due deliberation I decided to introduce this amendment.  It provides that the workers covered by the Bill should have their holidays paid for. That, I admit, is imposing an extra charge upon the industries in which they are employed.  It is not a very heavy charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be more heavy in some cases than in others, but it is difficult to suggest reasons against it, otherwise than the one argument that it effects an increase in industrial cost. This obviously is a matter upon which differences of opinion will exist according to the outlook of the individual. But it is justified.  It does not put any individual employer at a disadvantage as against his competitor.  That is because of its general application.  It might put the nation as a whole at a disadvantage against competitors in external markets, but the percentage of increase in cost in relation to any industry is not of sufficient importance to create really an adverse effect upon the national trade.  The proposal was <Col N="402" /> one which would have come forward at some stage.  I contemplated originally the development in the industrial holiday idea would come in two stages. The first was to be provided for in the Bill as introduced in which the obligation to provide a statutory weekly holiday in the year would be imposed for the first time, and the second one in which the obligation to pay for public holidays would be imposed.  However, having regard to the representations that were made, and apparently having regard to the general opinion which existed throughout the House and which was expressed by spokesmen of all Parties, this obligation to pay in respect of public holidays was imposed. My own feeling was that it was a reasonable thing to do and a difficult thing to oppose and I brought forward this amendment.  I think it is one which has been fairly generally welcomed, and it is likely to commend itself to the House.  I did not myself intend that this provision should operate when framing the Bill originally.  The introduction of the amendment is, I think, an improvement in the Bill.  It is an improvement which it is easier to effect in so far as it appears to be one which is generally desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of this will come in in a rather difficult way. Suppose there is a question of special employment during the holiday season. The Minister may take it that a firm is going to put on extra men for a week.  The question will at once arise as to whether there is a holiday in that week.  Difficulties unfavourable to the workers will be created.  I think this should be done in some other way.  If a firm wants to put on an additional staff of men to do a certain amount of work, say, on the Thursday before Good Friday, until the following Tuesday, they will have to pay a certain additional amount of money. An extra day will have to be paid for the four days.  It would be far better, I think, to make provision otherwise. The Government may proclaim a day a public holiday at any time.  It is not that I grudge the men payment for the day, but I can foresee how it is going <Col N="403" /> to work to their disadvantage.  It is going to create very large difficulties. Public holidays have for long been established.  In some parts of Ireland public holidays are bank holidays, while in other parts they are Church holy days.  I take it that this amendment, as the Bill stands at the moment, will not provide for Church holy days to be paid for in country districts unless the employer elects beforehand that these will be public holidays. Even I question then that they will be paid for.  The workers in the country are on a different basis from those in the city.  I take it that Church holy days will not come under this Bill.</P>

First of all, it seems that if there is no holiday on a Saturday <Col N="404" /> a man will get paid for four hours. Why, if there is a public holiday on the same day, should he get paid for seven and one-third hours?  In other words, why should he get more if he is not working than if he were working?  I do not begrudge the man what he will get, but I would like the Minister to justify the section more than he has done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has stated would be the case if Saturday were a normal short day for a particular worker.  It is for the majority of workers, but it may not be for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>But if Saturday is a public holiday he will get paid for seven three-quarter hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have to make a general provision.  There are six public holidays which may occur on any day of the week.  We say, in relation to these days, that payment has to be made on the same basis as payment is calculated for the purpose of the annual leave.  That may work out to the advantage of the worker when the holiday falls on a Saturday, and it may not.  The worker may be employed in an industry in which the short day is on some other day of the week, in which case he gets the advantage if the holiday is on that other day of the week and not on Saturday.  Taking the average for seven years, there will be no great advantage to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>You must assume that the worker always, has a slight advantage because he is not working at all on a public holiday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's ruling that, in the case of a worker who is paid by the hour, his average day's pay is to be the number of hours that he worked in the week divided by six?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The day's pay is calculated for the purposes of the annual leave.  That is his average daily earnings over the period concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he is going to <Col N="405" /> receive less than the day's pay if the holiday falls on an ordinary day and more if the bank holiday falls on a Saturday.  According to the Minister's argument, apparently the day's pay in calculating his leave would be not eight hours but seven and one-third hours.  I think that many workers will begin to scratch their heads and wonder why they receive less than a day's pay for a day's pay.  I think it would be well if the Minister made the position a little bit more clear in the Bill because I fear this is going to lead to a good deal of friction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may, but he is going to get less than what he considers his day's pay for eight hours, and he is going to get that every time this question of leave arises.  Perhaps the Minister's way of dealing with this is the better way, but I fear it will lead to a great deal of friction.  According to the inexorable arithmetic laid down by this section it does not deal with the worker who is paid by the hour.  At least, it does not mention him specifically.  It is going to be seven one-third hours or the number of hours worked divided by six.</P>

      <P>No agreement comes under the scope of Section 42 until there is a joint application by both parties to it for the registration of it and until the Minister has agreed to accept it as suitable for registration. In the event of a certain situation arising, as the Bill stands, that does not impose any obligations on the Department of Industry and Commerce, but it gives the workers who are concerned in the industry to which the agreement relates certain rights against the employers if the employers should not observe the agreement.</P>

      <P>I should like to get clear on this.  The point has been raised that there are at present operating certain agreements with regard to wages under which public holidays were not paid for.  Now that provision has been made that there will be a statutory obligation to pay workers in respect to public holidays, do I understand that some of these agreements in regard to wages will have to be reopened because the principle of payment for public holidays has been established?</P>

We hope that we shall get all these problems in relation to industry considered as a whole and agreements recorded which will be implemented through the various sections of the Bill, by the different regulations or by the registration of agreements.  The Bill does not come automatically into operation.  It can be applied part by part, or it can be brought into operation in relation to particular classes of work.  Generally speaking, it does not effect any substantial change in the prevailing conditions except in certain cases.  The changes will really come when the regulations under the Bill are made.  One of the changes that will come automatically into operation is this one relating to payment for public holidays or the provision for annual holidays.  They are automatic in their operation and will apply to all workers operating in activities within the scope of the Bill.  They will be enforceable irrespective of what is embodied in existing agreements.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 1) (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1935, made on the 18th day of June, 1935, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Quota No. 1 Order, as Deputies will remember, regulates the importation of a certain range of sizes of outer covers for motor tyres.  That quota order was made with a view to ensuring to the Dunlop factory at Cork the whole, or approximately the whole, market in those sizes.  The factory found itself in a position to be able to undertake the complete manufacture of certain sizes, of the more popular sizes, in the first instance, and in order to prevent licences which were issued under the Quota No. 1 Order being used for the importation of these sizes of tyres, it was decided by the Executive Council to make this amendment order.  Its effect is to remove from the scope of Quota Order No. 1 the more popular <Col N="411" /> sizes which the Dunlop factory was commencing to manufacture, so that in the quota period which commenced on 1st July, 1935, licences issued under the Quota No. 1 Order were not valid for the importation of the popular sizes.</P>
    <P>The next resolution on the Order Paper deals with the quota order which was made simultaneously and which covers the sizes of tyres which were excluded from the No. 1 Order by the amendment order which the Dáil is now being asked to approve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it did.  The Quota No. 1 Order applied to all motor car tyres of the sizes mentioned in it. When Dunlop's factory started they commenced to make a certain range of sizes, but not all the sizes mentioned in the first order, and therefore it was decided to have two orders instead of one, one relating to the sizes of tyres that the Dunlop factory were making and the other to the sizes of tyres they were not yet making.  The effect of the amendment order was to exclude from the first order the particular sizes which the Dunlop factory had commenced to make and another order was made dealing with these sizes, so that licences under the original order could not be used for the importation of the sizes that were being made.  Such licences were restricted under the Quota No. 19 Order and for very limited quantities.</P>

Only a nominal quota has been fixed under that order, and even that nominal quota will disappear in the next quota period.  I could not say precisely to what extent the manufacture of the other sizes has been proceeded with, hut it is being proceeded with, and at some stage a reduction in the quota under the main order will also be effected.  I understand there are 500 or 600 hands at present employed in the Dunlop factory at Cork, but not all of them would be employed on the manufacture of tyres affected by this order.  They would be employed on the production of other goods produced there.  I could not say the number engaged on the production of this range of goods only.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 20) Order, 1935, made on the 18th day of June, 1935, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
      <P>This order relates to tomatoes, and under it the importation of raw tomatoes into the Saorstát is prohibited. The order was made at the instance of the Department of Agriculture, and was designed to restrict the importation of tomatoes during the season of home production with a view to securing the full market for the home produce.  The period of home production is approximately the period from 24th June to 31st October in each year.  Under the quota order this period covers approximately the preliminary period and the first and second quota periods.  In the preliminary periods, which extended from the 19th June to the 14th July, licences to the extent of 11,425 cwts. were issued.  In the first quota period, which extended from the 15th July to the 31st August, licences for 5,500 cwts. were issued.  In the period from 1st September to the 31st October licences for 7,088 cwts. were issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quantities in each case were fixed <Col N="414" /> in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, and were such as were believed by that Department to be adequate, with the help of the home supply, to meet all the normal requirements of customers.  For the third quota period, which commenced on the 1st November and ends on the 23rd June, 1936, and during which no home grown tomatoes will be available, a quota of 56,000 cwts. has been fixed. That will meet all requirements without restriction during that period. There are 84 importers of tomatoes on the register, and they have all received licences allocating the quota amongst them in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might have given us some information why the quota was imposed in such a way as to create all the confusion for traders that was created.  I think the Minister must have some recollection of the very great confusion that was caused in the trade.  As far as I know, quite a number of traders suffered substantial losses through the way in which their business was interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not our information. We were informed that a number of traders made excessive profits, and that was the whole trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be well, if that were so, that the Minister would let us know something about it, and clear the minds of Deputies.  The whole public position created at the time conveyed the impression that the importers of tomatoes were thrown into a very great state of confusion and that they did, in fact, suffer losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister, arising out of the circumstances, has had any further consultation with the Department of Agriculture as to whether the period of the quota is the period of home production.  The Minister, or, at any rate, the Minister for Agriculture, will probably have received complaints from some of the tomato growers in the South that towards the end of October they were left with substantial quantities of surplus tomatoes on their hands.  Some explanation, I <Col N="415" /> think, might be given, too, as to why, if this is a very protective system, the quota for tomatoes to be imported during the September-October period this year allowed for an import of a bigger quantity of tomatoes than were imported into the country during the same period last year and why, during the period that is now fixed, the third quota period, extending to 23rd June next, there still is a bigger quota fixed than the total import during the same period last year. If the thing does bear upon the increased agricultural production and increased earnings for the agricultural community, now that the quota order has got into a systematic way of working, as far as tomatoes are concerned, and the confusion that arose in the earlier part of the year is not likely to arise again, it would be interesting to hear how the quota which is larger than the imports of last year is going to improve the situation for the growers of home tomatoes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the market is concerned, there is evidence that the consumption of tomatoes is increasing considerably here.  In fact, in this year, despite the restriction of imports during the period in which home-grown tomatoes were available and despite the increased production of home-grown tomatoes, the actual quantity imported was not less than last year, and it is anticipated that the total quantity that will be imported during the year will be in excess of the quantity imported last year.  Whatever the cause of it&mdash;whether it is due to change in taste or any other reason&mdash;the consumption of tomatoes is increasing considerably.  The quota order was made on 19th June and the restrictions operated immediately.  It was, however, apparent that, due to adverse weather conditions and to the fact that the home crop took somewhat longer to ripen and to prepare for market than was anticipated, there was a period immediately following the making of the order in which imports were being restricted and home supplies were not available.  That situation <Col N="416" /> could not quite have been foreseen and it caused some confusion, confusion, however, which was, I think, exaggerated by certain importers for the purpose of securing higher prices for tomatoes they had imported and making undue profits.</P>
      <P>That is a situation, however, which is over now and which in any event is not likely to be repeated, firstly, because the working of the quota machinery is now better known by everybody, and, secondly, because there will be a much higher production of home-grown tomatoes in the next year.  The Department of Agriculture has, as the Deputy is probably aware, a number of schemes for the encouragement of tomato growing, and particularly schemes for granting loans for the growing of tomatoes in Gaeltacht areas.  A number of these loans have been taken up and tomato production is being undertaken on a fairly large scale in these areas.  The market for tomatoes is quite a considerable one and there is no reason why the whole of it, or a very substantial part of it, should not be supplied from home sources.  It is true that we could not produce tomatoes at home as cheaply as they have been sent in from some countries.  That is why the Control of Imports Act restrictions on imports are necessary rather than that the import duty should be raised for the purpose of restricting imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is better that the duty should be maintained and imports subjected to quantitative regulation which permits of the imported tomatoes being kept off the market except in limited quantities. There are periods of the year in which the Irish supply is available so that the Irish supply can be quickly disposed of and at other periods of the year, like the present, imported tomatoes are allowed in in practically whatever quantity the public may desire to bring them in.  It is not intended that there should be any restriction whatever on the importation of tomatoes at this time of the year and that is why a very large quota has been fixed, and even that quota, can be increased if there is any evidence that it is not sufficient to enable all requirements <Col N="417" /> to be met, until June of next year when the home supply is again available and when restriction will again come into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the position, so far as this year is concerned, is that either traders in tomatoes were considerably inconvenienced and lost a certain amount of money, or Irish purchasers had to pay through the nose for their tomatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Imports (Quota No 21) Order, 1935, made on the 12th day of July, 1935, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Order, the importation, of soap, soap powders and soap substitutes is prohibited.  Substantial progress in the development of the soap industry had been made before the <Col N="418" /> imposition of quota restrictions, and these restrictions were imposed with a view to securing the utmost possible degree of production within the country.  The annual imports of the commodities affected by the Order in 1934 amounted to 27,400 cwts.  During the preliminary period, from 13th July to 18th August, licences amounting to 834 cwts. were issued to cover goods in transit, and also to meet what was regarded as a fair proportion of the requirements of importers during the period.  For the first quota period, from 19th August to 30th November, a quota of 3,500 cwts. was appointed. That meant a reduction of approximately 80 per cent. of previous imports during the same period of last year. For the second quota period, from 1st December to 31st May, a quota of 3,270 cwts. has been appointed, effecting a reduction of approximately 75 per cent. of the imports during the corresponding period of last year.  In arriving at each quota, we have taken care to provide a sufficient quantity to enable adequate quantities of indispensable soap, soap powders and soap substitutes not yet manufactured in the country to be imported.  There are a large number of importers on the register&mdash;83 all told&mdash;and the essential requirements of these importers are being adequately met by the licences issued.</P>

      <P>Unlike tomatoes, the consumption of which is going up in the country, when we are dealing with soap, and candles, which are the subject of the next quota order, we are dealing with commodities the consumption of which is apparently going down in the country.  In putting before us quota orders reducing, so far as soap is concerned, the import to 20 or 25 per cent. of what the imports of last year were, we should like some indication from the Minister as to what is happening in the industry with regard to production, the number of persons employed, the wages paid, and some explanation as to why it is that the consumption of these articles appears to be going down.  Since the Minister is putting these orders before the House, the House would like some information on those points, which are <Col N="419" /> sticking out, in relation to soap and candles.</P>

      <P>There is sufficient production of soap here to meet all the requirements of the country, whatever these requirements may be and however they may vary from time to time.  I cannot give precise figures as to the employment at different periods.  The Deputy has, I think, been supplied with figures as to employment up to the last date for which reliable statistics are available. The industry has no difficulty in supplying all the requirements of the country except requirements in certain classes of soap which are used in small quantities for industrial purposes and which are being imported under licences which we have issued under the quota order.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that up to the latest date for which statistics are available&mdash;1933&mdash;the consumption of soap and candles has gone down by 11 per cent.  If the Minister, in introducing the quota, examined the situation, is he able to tell us what the increase in employment is going to be or whether the position is that, because of the durability of the soap, there will be a falling-off in the consumption?  Is employment in the soap and candle industry likely to be stabilized at the present numbers?</P>

      <P>This order deals with candles.  It was made at the same time as the order affecting soap.  Soap and candles are generally made by the same firms.  It appears that some tapers and night-lights, required here, could not be made here.  Only nominal quotas were fixed in the earlier periods.  Similar reductions to those in the case of soap are being effected in the import of candles.  There will be a reduction of 8 per cent. in the quota period which extends to the 31st May next.  Certain types of tapers and night-lights are not manufactured here and, in so far as there is any demand for them here, the quota fixed is more than adequate to enable them to be, supplied by the importers.</P>

    <P>Under this quota order, the importation of raw onions is prohibited.  Like the order I have already dealt with in regard to tomatoes, this order was made at the instance of the Department of Agriculture with a view to procuring a market for home-grown onions during the period of production <Col N="421" /> here.  Licences were issued during the preliminary period to 1st September for 8,987 cwts.  During the first quota period, which extended from the 2nd September to 31st October, 20,000 cwts. were appointed as the quota, this being the quantity estimated by the Department of Agriculture to be sufficient, when supplemented by the home supply, to provide for all the normal requirements of the country.  The licences issued for the first quota period provided for 19,996 cwts.  During the second quota period, which commences on the 1st November and extends to 31st July, 1936, a quota of 148,000 cwts., has been appointed.  This is estimated to be sufficient for all the normal requirements of importers without restriction during the second quota period.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton gave notice yesterday that he would raise a question on the adjournment to-night arising out of the reply to Question 28 on yesterday's Order Paper.  The question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is now in a position to announce a decision of the claim for increased wages submitted to him by the Post Office Workers' Union in September, 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my question to the Minister yesterday in the hope that, after 13 months' cogitation, the Minister would be able to indicate what decision he proposes to communicate on the claim submitted to him. It may be necessary to remind the Minister of the events which preceded the submission of that question.  In September, 1934, the claim was submitted to the Minister.  In November, 1934, he said it was being examined. In December, 1934, he said he was hoping to have a discussion with the.  Union early in the New Year.  In January, 1935, he said it was deemed advisable to have consultations with the Department of Finance before carrying the matter further.  In April, 1935&mdash;seven months after the claim was submitted&mdash;a discussion took place between the representatives of the Union and representatives of the Minister.  As I have said, the Minister had then had the claim under consideration for seven months, and most people would believe that a claim that <Col N="423" /> was under consideration for seven months could be decided without further delay.  However, that is not so in the case of the Post Office. After questions had been addressed to him between April, 1935, and June, 1935, the Minister eventually&mdash;on the 27th June, last&mdash;stated that he hoped to be in a position to announce a definite decision on the claim by the end of July.  I am sure the Minister is sufficiently familiar, with the phraseology used by his Department and other public departments to realise that, when he stated in that letter that he hoped to be in a position to announce a definite decision on the matter by the end of July, he was perfectly convinced in his own mind that a decision would not be delayed beyond that date.</P>
      <P>I should be surprised if the Minister would contend that the hope expressed in that letter was a lightly-expressed hope, or that he had any doubt that he would be able to fulfil the hope so expressed.  That was in June, 1935; and there was then every indication that a letter written in such specific terms and, I presume, after a very considerable consultation, would be ultimately implemented by taking a decision on the claim at the end of July.  The end of July came and passed.  On the 19th of August, the Minister was reminded that it was then three weeks since the promised decision was to be arrived at.  On the following, day the, Minister indicated that the hope expressed in his letter of the 27th June, in regard to the decision on the wage claim, had not owing to unforeseen circumstances, been realised; but the Department, he added, fully realised the desirability of an early decision and was making every effort towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was on the 20th August.  The Minister was further pressed to communicate the decision to the Union, but up to the 13th September no decision was received from him.  It will be clear, I think, from what I said, that not only had the Post Office Department accepted the claim in September, 1934, and examined it between September, 1934 and June, <Col N="424" /> 1935, and not only did they promise a decision in June this year, and further reiterated that promise in August this year, but that never once during that whole period of nine months did the Minister or the Department make any single reference to the fact that the decision on the claim was in any way related to the Civil Service Commission of Inquiry.  Never once was it suggested that the Report of the Civil Service Inquiry had any bearing on the decision.  The Department had accepted the claim, negotiations had gone on on the claim, and a promise of a decision had been given, but never once did they say that the acceptance of the claim, the negotiations in connection with the claim, or the promise of a decision upon the claim was, in any way, contingent on the receipt by the Government or the Post Office Department of the Report of the Civil Service Commission of Inquiry.  Never once during all that period was even the existence of the Commission of Inquiry referred to on a single occasion.  Never was it even hinted that the existence of the Commission or its deliberations in any way affected the decision or the Minister's promise in connection with the wage claim.  In any case, there was no reason why the existence of the Commission or its deliberations or inquiries should affect the claim for the increased wage submitted on behalf of the Post Office staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that the Post Office staff, as represented by the Post Office Workers' Union, did not give evidence before the Commission, and he is aware of the circumstances that induced them not to give evidence before the Commission. In view of the fact that the Minister know that the Post Office Union had not submitted their case to the Commission for Inquiry, and in view of the fact that in seven months he never said the existence of the Commission of Inquiry was in any way related to the wage claim, I think the dragging in of the report of the Commission at this stage is nothing but the very flimsiest excuse to delay a decision being come to on the Union claim.  It is nothing but a dodge on the part of the Government <Col N="425" /> to connect the report of the Commission of Inquiry with the claim of the Post Office staff.  It was only on the 14th September that the Minister realised that the Commission of Inquiry was in existence at all.  On that day he wrote to the Union saying that it had been ascertained that the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service claims was on the point of reporting, and that it was decided to postpone the further consideration of the wage claim until the report was received and examined.  Whatever justification, if there could be any justification, for a letter of that kind when the claim was first submitted, there was no justification whatever for sending a letter of that kind to the Post Office Union exactly 12 months after their claim was submitted.  The Minister might have some pretence for saying that he was awaiting the report of the Commission if he had indicated at the beginning that there could be no decision until the Commission of Inquiry had reported.  Never once did he indicate that the decision of the Commission of Inquiry, or its deliberations, or terms of reference had relation to the claim.  Never once was it even hinted that any delay would be caused merely by the existence of the Commission of Inquiry.  The whole plea for the delay was that the claim was a comprehensive one, of considerable complexity and of considerable magnitude.  When the comprehensive character and the complex character and the magnitude of the claim had been exhausted, as an excuse for delaying the decision, the Minister then said that the reason why the decision cannot now be given is that the Commission of Inquiry is on the point of reporting.</P>
    <P>I believe, and thousands of members of the Post Office staff believe, that the production at this late stage of the Civil Service Commission of Inquiry as a cause for the delay is just a subterfuge, and I am sorry to say a mean subterfuge, for delaying a decision upon this matter.  The Minister ought to be aware of the fact that there is need of a speedy decision, and that after 13 months of consideration the decision ought now to be announced. He should be aware of the fact that there is need, not merely for a speedy <Col N="426" /> decision, but for a favourable decision. Over three thousand members of the Post Office staff have a rate of wages not exceeding 25/- per week.  Over 4,000 members of the staff, or more than half of the entire staff, have a rate of wages not exceeding 30/- a week; and even in the case of those whose wage rates exceed those I have just mentioned, they are constantly faced with the problem of trying to make ends meet on a miserably low rate of wages with the low maximum that is the lot of every worker in the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Department is a great public Department; it administers a great and vital social service; it is the one Department that intimately touches the every-day lives of the community, of those engaged in trade, industry and commerce.  It seems to me nothing short of a shame, and a standing disgrace, that so great a public service should be nothing more, from the standpoint of the rate of wages paid, than simply a gigantic sweat shop where members of the staff are working at rates of wages that would be disgraceful if paid even by the most greedy and unscrupulous employer. To-day there is more need than ever for a substantial increase on these wage rates.  They are lower to-day than at any time in the past 18 years.  It should only be necessary to remind the Minister of the enormous reductions they have suffered in order to bring home to him the need for a speedy decision.  If I mention that a person who had a wage of £4 12s. 9d. in 1921, has now been reduced to a wage of £2 14s. 3d. the Minister will have some appreciation of the gigantic sacrifice which the Post Office staffs have already suffered in respect of cuts in their wages.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Department boasts that at one time it was losing well over £1,000,000 per year, and that now for the third year in succession it is yielding a surplus, this year to the extent of £35,000.  If the prognostications of the Minister are to be realised, next year the surplus will be greater, and probably for the following year it will be even still greater.  If the Minister will look at the Public Estimates for 1922-23 and compare them with the <Col N="427" /> Public Estimates for this year, we find that that surplus of £35,000 has been made only by cutting the wages of the Post Office staff, and that they and their wages and their conveniences have been sacrificed in order to wipe out a large portion of the deficit on the Post Office which existed in 1922-23. The Post Office ought to be ashamed to make a profit while its staff are paid such miserably low wages, and it owes an abject apology for every penny profit which it makes while its staff are underpaid, and many of them under-clad and under-fed. That is a state of affairs in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can find little consolation.  That is a state of affairs in which the Executive Council should find no cause for consolation or for complacency.  There is a crying need for a substantial increase in the wages of the Post Office staff.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, from his experience and knowledge of the staff, and from his knowledge of their wage rates, must be aware that the rates of wages which they are being paid are rates of wages which do not justify the State in claiming that it is a model employer.  Far from being a model employer in the Post Office Department the State is a sweated employer, and the rates of wages which it pays there compare most unfavourably with those paid in many outside industries. Abundant evidence to prove that contention has already been submitted by the Post Office Workers' Union to the Minister's own Department.</P>
    <P>The claim has now been under consideration for thirteen months.  There can be no valid excuse for any further delay.  The Civil Service Commission of Inquiry is only a flimsy excuse to delay a decision on the matter.  In view of the fact that that question was never raised until the claim had been under consideration for twelve months, I suggest that in all fairness and in all decency the Post Office Department, through the Minister, should communicate a decision on the wage claim.  At all events, notwithstanding any apology or attempt at explanation which may be made, I regard the Minister's letter of the 27th June last as indicating that a definite decision <Col N="428" /> would be convoyed to the Union before the end of July.  In view of the fact that he has had the claim for 13 months, in view of the letter written to the Union on the 27th last, and in view of the fact that there was no question whatever of the existence of the Commission being in any way related to the decision on the claim, I hope that the Minister will now, without further delay, announce a decision on the claim.  After thirteen months the staff cannot be accused of any impetuosity or any impatience.  They have borne this delay with considerable patience, but there is a wave of discontent and a wave of dissatisfaction permeating the Post Office service at the delay in communicating a decision on their claim.  The Minister can allay that discontent and allay that dissatisfaction by giving a speedy and favourable decision on the claim.  I now want to give the Minister an opportunity of replying in the time that is available.</P>

      <P>I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that when he was upholding the claim in this House he took the extreme case. He based his claim entirely on the rates of wages paid to the worst-paid part of the service, that is, the auxiliary postmen who work part-time, forgetting altogether, or at least not reminding the House of the fact, that the claim embraced several classes who, in the present circumstances of the world, cannot be regarded, from the nature of their employment, as being, as he says, employed in a gigantic sweat-shop, and paid in a way that would bring shame even to a greedy and unscrupulous employer.  I think, as he has got so much publicity <Col N="429" /> for his side of the story, it is time that the actual claim itself should be made known to the House.  The claim has been made on behalf of several grades. It starts with Post Office assistants, Grade A.  Those are divided, according to the class of office to which they belong, into Grades 1, 2 and 3.  I want to give the average rate of pay of those grades.  In Class I offices there are 158 Grade A male assistants.  The average pay of those officials is 71/10 per week, and it is sought to increase that to 89/5, which would mean an increase of £7,246 per annum.  In Class II offices there are 67 officers concerned.  Their present average wage is 66/10, and the claim is for 84/5, which would mean an additional annual cost of £3,073.  In Class III offices there are 133 officials.  They are at present paid an average wage of 61/10, and the claim is for 79/4, involving an increased cost of £6,072 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to female assistants, Grade A, there are 20 officers in the first-class offices, and their present average pay is 57/5 per week.  The claim is for 77/6, involving an additional cost of £1,058 per annum.  In Class II offices there are 10 officials, who receive an average wage of 54/8 per week.  The claim is for 73/1, which would mean an increased cost of £481 per annum. In Class III offices there are 69 officers. Their average rate of wages is 51/2. The claim is for 69/8, involving an increased annual cost of £3,330.  We now come to the Grade B male Post Office assistants.  There are 106 officers in the Class I offices.  They are at present, receiving 66/2 per week.  The amount claimed is 89/5, which would amount to an additional £6,428 per annum.  In Class II offices there are 42 officials.  Their present average rate is 61/10.  The claim is for 84/5, and the additional cost involved amounts to £2,473 per annum.  In Class III offices there are 194 assistants, whose present average wage is 57/5.  The claim is for 79/4, and the additional cost involved amounts to £11,090.  In regard to Grade B female assistants, there are 51 officials in the Class I offices.  Their present average wages amount to 52/9 per week.  The claim is for 77/6, and the additional annual cost involved is <Col N="430" /> £3,293.  In Class II offices there are 24 officers.  Their present average wages amount to 49/8.  The amount claimed is 73/1, and the additional cost involved is £1,466.  In Class III offices there are 177 officers.  Their present average rate of wages is 46/6.  The amount claimed is 69/8, amounting to an additional annual cost of £10,696. All those figures, of course, include cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>In regard to postmen, Grade A, there arc 217 officers in the Class I offices.  Their average wages amount to 56/10.  The claim is for 75/-, which would mean an increased annual cost of £10,282.</P>
    <P>In Class II offices there are 34 officers, weekly wage 52/4, and the claim is for 69/-, meaning an increase of £1,479 per annum; in Class III offices there are 61 officers, weekly wage 48/10, the claim is for 65/2, which would mean an increase of £2,599 per annum; Postmen, Grade B, 476 officers, average weekly wage 51/2, the claim is for 66/2, which would mean an increase of £18,624 per annum; in second-class offices there are 152 officers, weekly wage 46/6, the claim is for 61/2, which would mean an increase of £5,814 per annum; in Grade III offices there are 1,127 postmen, weekly wage 43/5, the claim is for 58/8, which would mean an increase of £44,826 per annum.  Of telephonists in Class I offices there are 127, weekly wage 46/6, the claim is for 60/7, which would mean an increase of £4,664 per annum; in Class II offices there are 53 officers, weekly wage 44/3, the claim is for 58/1, representing an increase of £1,912 per annum; in Class III offices there are 56 officers, weekly wage 41/11, the claim is for 55/6, representing an annual increase of £1,983.  These are the best paid officers.  I have not time to go over the whole list.  Coming to lower paid people, I will not have time to reply to points dealing with the skilled workmen class.</P>
    <P>These are all the permanent classes I am referring to and I will have to skip over some of them.  There are 278 skilled workmen in Class II offices whose average wage is 58/1 for the lowest class in that grade.  The claim is for 66/10, which would represent an <Col N="431" /> annual increase of £6,345.  The total increase for whole-time staff would mean an extra £170,706 per annum. Then we have the part-time people. Part-time telephonists are paid by the hour.  In Class I offices they receive 10½d. per hour, and the claim is that they should receive 1/2¾; in Class II offices they are paid 10d. an hour and they are claiming 1/2.  Part-time telephone learners are paid by the hour. Then we have the poorest paid people, that Deputy Norton always makes most of when he raises this matter.  In Class I offices there are 44 auxiliary postmen paid 11½d. per hour.  The claim is for 1/5¾ which would mean an increase of £1,692 per annum; in Class II offices there are 34 auxiliary postmen paid 10¾d. an hour, and the claim is for 1/3½, which would mean an increase of £807 per annum.  There are 2,536 auxiliary postmen in Class III offices paid 10d. per hour.  The claim is for 1/2¾ per hour which would represent an increase of £62,343 for that class.</P>
    <P>The allowance deliverers are the lowest paid class but they work the least time.  In Class I offices there are none, but where they would be at work there is a claim, for 1/5¾ an hour.  In Class II offices there is one allowance deliverer paid 9¼d. per hour, and the claim is for 1/3½.  In Class III offices where practically all these people are employed there are 973 of them paid 9½d. an hour while the claim is for 1/2¾, which would mean an annual increase of £17,451.  In all, the claims would amount to £263,817. I told Deputy Norton when the Estimate for my Department was before the House that I was not prepared in the present state of depression, not only in this country but all over the world, to ask the Minister for Finance to tax the people in that amount.  I am not prepared to do it while other people are paid so much less.  As to Deputy Norton's complaint about delay and that we brought in reference to the Commission of Inquiry at the last moment, and that that was absent from the mind of the Government all the time because his Union saw fit to flout that Commission, I know undoubtedly that Deputy Norton's Union represents the majority <Col N="432" /> of the workers, but other organisations in connection with the Post Office gave evidence before the Commission. When the Department wrote the letter in June last it was hoped that a decision would be given any time at the end of July.  I frankly admit that I thought there would be a decision.</P>
    <P>I should remind Deputy Norton that in these matters two Departments are concerned.  The Department responsible for the raising of finance is the Department of Finance, and its opinion has to be taken into consideration. It was hoped that the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service would have reported at an earlier date. There were reasons why it did not, so that it did not require specific mention. I do not say that Deputy Norton is entitled to say that we ignored the fact that at the time the wages claim was put in a committee was inquiring into this.  When the Department of Finance, which is the Department responsible for wages and conditions in the Civil Service, learned that the Commission was about to conclude and report, they decided&mdash;and I agreed with the Minister for Finance when he put it to me&mdash;that as they would have the advantage of their deliberations we ought to agree to await that report, especially as we were informed&mdash;and I think Deputy Norton knows this&mdash;that they were about to report.  Consequently we are awaiting the report of that Commission.  What the decision is going to be is another matter.  I indicated to Deputy Norton what we proposed to do.  I repeat what I said during the debate on the Estimate for my Department, that in the present state of the country, and having regard to the depressed state of this and other countries in the world, I am not prepared to ask the Government to impose taxation to the extent demanded in this claim.  I certainly hope that we will soon have the report of this Commission.  I understand that we are to have it soon.  Deputy Norton may be able to hurry it up, because there arc representatives of Labour on the Commission.  We cannot induce the Commission to present its report any quicker than it is going to do so.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, November 6th.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total number of applications, if any, which have been made for licences to import thread and ply yarns made wholly or mainly of cotton, flax or hemp, or of a combination of these materials, without payment of the duty of 100 per cent. imposed by the Finance Act, 1935, and the quantity and value of such articles sought to be imported under such licences; and if he will state the total number of such licences issued and the total quantity and value of the articles authorised to be imported under such licences, and the reasons for permitting this import without the payment of duty; and if he will state the total number, if any, of such applications refused, and the total amount of such articles covered by the applications so <Col N="252" /> refused, and the reasons for the refusal of licences in these cases.</P>

      <P>The preparation of the detailed information asked for in the question would involve an expenditure of time and labour which would not be justified.  Numerous applications have been made to my Department for licences for the free importation of the goods mentioned in the question.  All such applications for normal quantities of the goods are granted if evidence is produced that supplies of cotton yarn are not obtainable from the Irish Sewing Cotton Co., Ltd., Westport, or linen yarn from the Irish Linen Thread Company, Dublin.  Certain types of cotton threads and ply yarns which are not being produced here at the moment are being permitted to be imported free of duty under licence in normal quantities.</P>

      <P>The preparation of the detailed information asked for in the question would involve an expenditure of time and labour which would not be justified.  I may say that numerous applications for licences for the importation of the goods in question were made and granted for the reason that goods of Saorstát manufacture were not procurable.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to my reply of the 19th June last, in which I indicated that the issue of licences for the <Col N="253" /> importation, free of duty, of cotton thread for re-sale was suspended.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of applications, if any, which have been received by him for licences to import almonds, and almond preparations, without payment of the duty imposed by Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 72) Order, 1935, and the value of the almonds and almond preparations sought to be imported under such licences; and if he will state the total number of such licences issued, and the total value of the almonds and almond preparations authorised to be imported under such licences, and the reasons for permitting this import without the payment of the duty; and if he will state the total number, if any, of such applications refused, and the total amount of the almonds and almond preparations covered by the applications so refused, and the reasons for the refusal of licences in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences for the free importation of the preparations included in the Order are not being granted unless satisfactory evidence is produced that goods of Saorstát manufacture cannot be procured.  In one instance the issue of a licence was recommended for the importation of 20 tons of almonds on which further processes of manufacture were to be carried out.  A licence was also recommended for the free importation of a consignment of a half-ton of dutiable almonds which were in port at the date of the duty.  Licences have been refused in other cases in the absence of evidence that articles of Saorstát manufacture were not procurable.  The rest of the information asked for in the question could not be supplied without an expenditure of labour which would not be justified in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that the labour involved in compiling the detailed information asked for would be justified.  I may say, however, that generally I am recommending the issue of licences for the free importation of such goods included in this Order as were not liable to duty prior to the making of the Order but which are now dutiable provided satisfactory evidence is given that such goods or suitable substitutes of Saorstát manufacture are not yet procurable.  At the moment, I am considering certain representations for an alteration of the licensing arrangements pending the production of the goods in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Numerous applications for licences for the importation, free of duty, of leather, have been received in my Department.  It would not be practicable, however, to state the number of such applications and the value of the leather sought to be imported under such licences without an expenditure of labour which would not be justified in the circumstances.  The issue of licences has been recommended in all cases for the importation of normal quantities of such leathers as were not liable to duty prior to the date of the Order for the reason that goods of Saorstát manufacture are not yet procurable.</P>

      <P>As regards tennis racquets, licences were confined to firms already engaged or about to engage in the stringing of these articles and licences were only granted for unstrung racquets.  Seven such applications were received but I am not in a position to state the value of the consignments. The number of applications granted was seven.  Licences were recommended in these cases for the purpose of maintaining the employment on the stringing of racquets pending the manufacture of the racquet frames in the Saorstát.  In all cases the licences were issued in the light of the previous importations of the applicants.</P>
      <P>A few licences were granted for complete hockey sticks which were in transit or on order prior to the imposition of the duty.  No applications have been received and no licences recommended in respect of cricket bats and component parts.  One application for posts for use in games was granted on the grounds that the goods were in transit at the date of the imposition of the duty.  No licences were refused for these goods.</P>
