      <P>The whole question concerning the matters raised by the Deputy is the subject of consideration between the Gárda Síochána and my Department at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Accident Statistics for 1934 have only been received from the Gárda Síochána this morning and they will be examined without delay. There is no information at present available as to whether the accidents happened in daylight or dark, in crowded thoroughfares or in the open country.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the repayment of loans for the purchase of additional half-acre plots for cottiers in the area, negotiated by the Kilmallock District Council in 1912, has been completed since last September, and if he will <Col N="339" /> state what authority, if any, there is for the County Limerick Board of Health in continuing to demand payment of 15/- per year as heretofore in respect of those plots from the occupying tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>A loan of £10,000 was obtained in 1915 by the Kilmallock Rural District Council for the purchase of 470 allotments to be let to agricultural labourers in the district.  It was repayable in 17 years at 4 per cent. and appears to have been paid off in 1932.</P>
      <P>The board of health and public assistance is empowered by the Labourers Acts, which incorporate portion of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act (Ireland), 1860, to charge rents for all lettings made under the Labourers Acts.  The allotments are the property of the board. The payments at the rate of 15/- a year per allotment by the tenants did not cover the outgoings of the local authority during the currency of the loan.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that allowances made by municipal authorities in respect of blind persons under the Welfare of the Blind Scheme are taken into consideration when estimating the means of applicants for pensions under the Blind Persons Act; further, that in many of these cases where such blind persons were in receipt of 10/- weekly from the State under the Blind Persons Act, such pensions have been reduced or suspended in view of payments under the welfare of blind schemes, with the result that boards of public assistance have had to come to their aid at additional expense to the ratepayers; and whether he intends to introduce proposals for legislation at an early date to enable blind persons in receipt of allowances under the Welfare of the Blind Scheme to receive the full State pension of 10/-per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was raised recently by a pensions officer as to why a deduction should not be made from a State blind pension granted to a blind married man resident in Dublin County Borough on the grounds that when his allowances under the Corporation Scheme in respect of children are taken into account his means would be in excess of the statutory limit and that he was not therefore entitled to the full State pension. I have been advised that the extra children's allowance under the scheme must be regarded as part of the means of the pensioner.  As regards the second part of the Deputy's question I understand that in a few cases in Dublin County Borough State blind pensions have been reduced in view of the fact that the pension officer takes into account in ascertaining means for State blind pensions purposes allowances granted in respect of children under the Dublin County Borough scheme for the welfare of the blind.  The inquiry contained in the third part of the question might be appropriately addressed to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that a sewerage scheme was passed by the local authorities concerned for the village of Blarney, Co. Cork, some years ago, towards the cost of which a Government grant of 50 per cent. of the cost of the scheme was asked by the board of health at that time, who were offered only 33? per cent. of the cost, and that the scheme as a consequence was not then proceeded with; further, if he is aware that the present board of health has also passed the scheme and have asked for a Government grant of 50 per cent.; whether any plans in this connection have been submitted by the engineer of the Cork County Board of Health to his Department, and, if so, when and with what result.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question a sewerage scheme was proposed by the board of public health in 1932 but upon consideration of a report made by the board's engineer at that time the board of health decided to take no further steps in the matter. An application for a grant of 50 per cent. of the cost was made.  No grant was allocated.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question an order was made by the board of health in December last that the plans be prepared and submitted to the Department.  No plans have yet been received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the preparation of plans took a considerable time and that they were not submitted to the Department in final form until all grants for the present financial year had been fully allocated.  No further funds will be available until the financial year commencing 1st April next. I cannot anticipate a decision of the Dáil voting such funds in the coming year and I therefore cannot state the amount of any grant that may be allocated towards a specific scheme from such funds when voted.  The matter referred to in the last part of the Deputy's question is one for the Tipperary Board of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether regulations have been issued under which persons who have lodged appeals against the assessment of their means under the Unemployment <Col N="348" /> Assistance Act are denied an opportunity of signing the vacant book pending the determination of their appeals, and whether, if no such regulations were issued, he is prepared to instruct officials of his Department that such claimants are entitled to prove by their signatures that they were continuously unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants for unemployment assistance may prove that they are unemployed by attending at local offices of my Department and signing there the prescribed form, or by sending the prescribed form through the post if they reside over six miles from a local office of my Department.  The officials of my Department are instructed accordingly. In cases in which, by reason of their inability to fulfil the statutory conditions for receiving unemployment assistance, or for any other reason, it is clear that unemployment assistance cannot be paid on the applications their position under the Act is explained to the applicants with the object of saving them fruitless journeys to prove unemployment. If, notwithstanding the explanations, the applicants still desire to prove in the prescribed manner that they are unemployed, the officials of my Department have instructions to permit them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person is entitled to receive a rate of assistance calculated in accordance with his certificate as and from the date he proves himself qualified to receive it, any modification as a result of his appeal does not entitle him to receive <Col N="349" /> retrospectively the payments which he might have received if the certificate for the larger payments had been got in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to issue figures relating to the business of a particular company, but I may say, for the Deputy's information, that in the four sugar factories during the last campaign about 70 per cent. of the total coal consumption was native coal.  The company has had its boilers fitted specially so that the highest possible percentage of native coal can be consumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the public business was last adjourned we were discussing Estimate No. 52, and I asked the Minister to make a comprehensive statement in connection with the terms upon which the beet growers in the Cooley area were going to be asked to grow beet and to explain to the House why, when the Government stipulated, as I think they ought to have stipulated, for a living wage for the operatives in the factory, they did not insist on a price for beet which would make it possible for the producers thereof to pay the agricultural labourers a living wage as well, and why it is that the Minister for Agriculture is prepared to say in that connection that 24/- a week for a 54-hour week is a fair wage for an agricultural labourer when he is prepared to sustain the thesis that 42/- a week, or even more, is not in any sense excessive for a 44-hour week in the case of a factory operative.  I do not think that the terms of employment enjoyed by the factory hands in the beet-sugar factories are in any way too generous, but I think that they throw into very striking relief the standard of living which the Minister for Agriculture sets up for that section of the community for which he is primarily responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should also take the opportunity on sub-head O9 to give us some further information about the future that he sees for his wheat scheme.  He knows, and most of my colleagues know, that I regard the wheat policy of the Government as a pure fraud, calculated to get our people nowhere.  It is at present being heavily subsidised by the State; I believe it is being materially subsidised by the consumer and it is being partially subsidised by the ratepayers through the county committees of agriculture.  I think the responsibility devolves upon the Minister to tell the House and the <Col N="358" /> country what advice he has to offer to the farmer who planted wheat in 1934 as to what he should plant on the same land in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938 and, having advised him in that regard, I think the responsibility also rests upon him of telling farmers generally how they are to dispose of the crops that will be growing in the four years to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is interesting and striking how the present Administration are beginning to learn sense.  I remember the time when I was told that to suggest that we should cultivate an agricultural surplus for the purpose of exporting it and selling it on the markets of the world with a view to purchasing the requirements we wanted, was high treason, playing England's game.  Now I discover that the doctrine of an agricultural surplus is not so heretical as it at first seemed.  I see the Minister for Industry and Commerce broke out on Monday night and declared that under any circumstances we must have foreign trade and, in fact, during our reconstruction period, our purchases abroad of raw material and of industrial equipment must tend to increase rather than to diminish. Nevertheless, he added, our aim has been to use our powers as a purchaser of manufactured goods to insist that we be allowed to pay for our imports in whole or in part in agricultural exports.  Then he goes on to describe how the exports of this country must be for a very considerable time our agricultural surplus.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Agriculture to tell the people what steps he is taking, or proposes to take, in order to secure for them a market wherein to dispose of that agricultural surplus which his colleague considers is indispensable and which he, by the instructions he is giving to the farmers, is compelling them to produce. Does he stand over the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking at the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association that, having made trade agreements with Germany, Belgium and Spain, we are now in <Col N="359" /> a position in which we can consider confining our trade relations to countries with which such arrangements have been made?  Does that mean that the Government intend to inform the people that the extent of the alternative markets which they have been able to secure comprises the German, Belgian and Spanish markets, and does it mean that our only alternative markets in the future to the British market are those three, and if it does mean that, are the Government going far enough along the road of common sense to realise that if the country is to survive at all the British market must be recovered for our people and that the commodities which the Minister for Agriculture is compelling our people to produce must be disposed of in that market and, if they are not so disposed of, not only is agriculture but industry and every other branch of the body politic going to crash to the ground?</P>
    <P>If he has realised those things, when is he going to bring pressure to bear on his colleagues to make them do something?</P>
    <P>I see with reference to sub-head O13 that the Minister for Agriculture has come in for encomiums from a member of the British Research Society who says that he has led in the way of distributing the surplus of a particular agricultural produce amongst the poor of the country.  I did not notice that the expert went on to congratulate him and his colleagues on having increased the ranks of the poor to such magnificent proportions that there would be provided in this country a consuming power for free beef adequate to consume the surplus we are producing.  I consider that the situation created in consequence of the distribution of free beef is extremely undesirable.  I have already pointed out in this House that it calls to mind one of the most unattractive elements of a period in the history of this country which had better be forgotten.  It is demoralising and shocking to the sensibilities of our people to be reduced to a condition in which they have to return to the soup <Col N="360" /> kitchen that obtained 70 or 80 years ago and it is creating in the country a general impression that the Government are acting in a grossly irresponsible way.</P>
    <P>I was recently informed of one household which, under the terms of the various enactments made by this House, has become entitled to 21 lbs. of beef per week, and two members of the household have to be sent into town every week to carry home the free beef. Such an administration of any scheme is calculated to bring, not only the Government, but this House into gross disrepute.  It is perfectly manifest that a scheme which results in nearly two stone of meat being carried home to a country house every week is not meeting the real necessities of the situation. It is a most slipshod, unsatisfactory and wasteful method of administering relief and is probably resulting in deserving people being unable to get all they are entitled to, while those who do not want it and should not get public relief are having it thrust upon them.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O14, we have money appropriated for travelling expenses, incidental expenses and fees to valuers under the Tobacco Act, 1934. I want to know what value we are getting for this tobacco legislation.  The last time this matter came before the House, I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that the original policy of the Government in connection with tobacco was that there was to be no interference of any kind with the Revenue authorities.  In fact, President de Valera, who is so fond of talking of mandates, got a mandate to introduce legislation which would put an end to all supervision of the tobacco business by the Revenue Commissioners.  When I quoted this in the House the Minister for Agriculture interrupted and said: &ldquo;I do not believe that.  I do not believe President de Valera ever said any such thing.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan's reply was: &ldquo;Why does the Minister for Agriculture deny that President de Valera said something which is quoted, when he does not even know where the quotation comes from?&rdquo;&ldquo;I would not believe it&rdquo;, said the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="361" />&ldquo;because it is too foolish&rdquo;. Let me assure the Minister that folly is no criterion whereby to judge past dicta of Fianna Fáil Ministers or of the President of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I am in a position now to quote the words used by President de Valera in an interview published in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of June 19, 1929, and those words are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that the growing of tobacco here should be altogether free from duty, and there should be no Governmental interference or supervision.  The removal of officials now on the inspection and assessment work associated with Excise regulations will, of course, obviate anything in the nature of administrative cost to the Government. That is one advantage over any scheme of direct subsidy...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy O'Reilly may get ready to bow, because President de Valera invoked him.  The President went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the present duty is removed in accordance with the terms of the motion submitted by Mr. O'Reilly, a member of our Party, there need not be permanently any great loss to the revenue.  If there is any loss in the first years it will be due to the fact that a valuable Irish industry is being resuscitated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we are faced with a Supplementary Estimate to finance the operations of an extremely complicated Tobacco Act which strictly restricts the growing of tobacco by Irish nationals in Ireland and there are no motions being set down in the name of Deputy Matthew O'Reilly from the County Meath, nor is the President on the floor of the House to explain to us that regulation of this kind is folly and that the proper way to encourage the tobacco industry is to withdraw all Government or Revenue Commissioners' interference with the industry altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, having undergone a period of three years' education at the hands of the Opposition, has come to the conclusion that such language is incredibly silly.  I <Col N="362" /> quite agree with him.  But the misfortune for this country is that it takes three years to teach the Minister for Agriculture that such things are incredibly silly, and after three years more the Minister for Agriculture will be telling us that the economic war was incredibly silly.  But really his education is becoming monstrously expensive. It is running, not only into six figures, but into seven figures and may run into eight figures, before we make him conscious of the follies that he and his colleagues have been guilty of, both before they came into office and since.  But Deputy O'Reilly is giving no assistance to educate the Minister for Agriculture.  He must be unrepentant.  He will not charge me with any discourtesy when I say that the Minister's language suggests that he was probably the clown at the circus six years ago.  I suggest that Deputy O'Reilly ought to tell the Minister for Agriculture that he is wrong and that Deputy O'Reilly is right and was right; or else Deputy O'Reilly ought to say to the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;I realise I made an ass of myself six years ago and I made President de Valera make an ass of himself, which is worse.  Ought we not both mend our hands now and try and make some compensation to the people for the folly and the fraud we perpetrated on them when looking for their votes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish, Sir, to go back over the matters which arose when I first opened on the Estimate but I do request the Minister to give us full particulars with reference to sub-head M 8, which deals with the butter purchasing scheme, and M 9, which deals with the purchase and export of eggs. I feel that whatever benefits may be accruing as a result of trade agreements for the disposal of eggs, they are not being distributed evenly throughout the country.  My experience is, in regard to the German market in any case, that the trade seems to be centred in the hands of a few shippers here in Dublin.  Being under that impression, I may be labouring under a misapprehension, but at least I think I can justifiably charge the Minister with not having <Col N="363" /> communicated to the registered egg traders of the country full particulars of the means whereunder they can share in whatever quota we have secured in the German and Spanish markets.  I should like also to draw his attention to the fact that the German market is at the present time apparently demanding that nothing but the equivalent of extra selected and selected eggs should be sent there, and are rejecting the &ldquo;mediums&rdquo; and the lower grades.  Now, for good or ill, our principal egg market is going to be the British market, and it is highly undesirable that this trade agreement with Germany or with Spain should be allowed to create a situation under which all the best eggs of our production should go to Germany and the Continent and the leavings&mdash;the &ldquo;mediums,&rdquo; the &ldquo;trades&rdquo; and the pullets eggs, if there still are pullets eggs&mdash;should be going to England.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister made any stipulation in the trade agreement which he concluded with Germany, that they should take eggs according to the grades we ship and should take a fair proportion of each grade we had to offer.  If we did not, I think the time has come to make representations to the German Government pointing out that if the trade agreement provides for eggs it is not open to the German Government, in pursuit of that agreement, to exclude certain classes of eggs and to constrain us to ship them nothing but the top grade at the expense of our other customers. There is a wide field to be covered in answering on this Estimate and I trust the Minister will take the fullest advantage of the occasion and inform the House and the country as to what his intentions are in regard to the matters which fall under the sub-heads contained in the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, at various intervals in the last few years, been discussing ever increasing Estimates for the maintenance of agriculture. One gets tired of repeating oneself in arguments on the economic war and like matters and I do not intend to refer to them on this occasion.  We <Col N="364" /> have in the Estimate presented to us an increase under several sub-heads, notably for the improvement of the creamery industry.  There is an additional provision for the improvement, reorganisation and extension of the creamery industry by the purchase of creameries and associated businesses. Then there is an additional Estimate for the butter purchase scheme, for the Horse Breeding Act, for the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act and there are various other additions to the already heavy expenditure on agriculture.</P>
      <P>I dare say that this Vote like all other Votes for Agriculture will be passed by this House.  Any Vote, even one providing for the most extravagant expenditure, would in present circumstances be passed by the House but one has to express regret that the huge sum, amounting to millions, which the Government has spent in the last few years could not have been devoted to better purposes, that it could not have been spent in strengthening our hold on the world's biggest market, the British market, to the detriment of other exporters to that market.  We might easily have doubled our exports to that market were it not for certain circumstances.  Other countries have increased their exports to it but we, the nearest country, instead of improving our position, have shown a lamentable falling off in our exports. One hesitates to blame the Minister for Agriculture for that state of affairs.  He is rather the victim of circumstances than anything else.  The Minister reminds me forcibly of a person lost in a forest whose every fresh step only further increases his troubles.  He is walking more or less in a circle round the fringe of things.  Practically every effort he made to help agriculture has been, except on one or two occasions, barren of results, in the sense of advancing the prosperity of agriculturists.</P>

    <P>The position in agriculture has often been referred to in this House in the past 18 months and those references need no repetition now.  We had a notable admission from a prominent member of the Government Party in another place yesterday when he <Col N="365" /> candidly stated that the position of the agriculturist was so bad that he was at the moment a prey to any influence brought to bear on him, even to break the law.  It comes to this, then, that we have an admission from a leading member on the Fianna Fáil Benches that the position of the farmers is probably worse than it was at any time in the history of the State or even before the Free State came into existence, so bad, in fact, that the ordinary decent farmers are liable to be influenced by indiscreet statements, to commit acts which one reasonably might expect them not to commit.  One sees no real hope in the situation.  It will not serve any useful purpose to discuss the various Estimates line for line and word for word.  That has been done on several occasions in the last two years without advancing the position in any way.  There seems to be only one real solution for the agricultural difficulty. It is a solution that the Ministry hesitate to adopt and there does not appear to be any prospect of their adopting it in the near future.  Until they do adopt it, the position of the Minister for Agriculture in this House is not going to be an enviable one.  With our chief market for agricultural products materially damaged and, in fact, rapidly disappearing, any artificial efforts that the Minister makes to help the deplorable position make only a small inroad on the damage created.</P>
    <P>Personally, I see no light on the horizon except that some miracle will persuade the Government to admit candidly that their policy is a failure. To continue in the policy of shutting out the market that we possessed two or three years ago can only mean that there can be no hope whatever for the resuscitation of agriculture and that any money we vote in this House will be, in the main, useless expenditure. We have had three years' experience of continual experiments, of the taking of steps and retracing of steps, of passing measures and so on, all designed to benefit the farmer.  Despite all these efforts, the farmers' position has got gradually worse and will continue to get worse until the step about which I have spoken is taken.  Where <Col N="366" /> is the hindrance to taking this step? In mentioning this, one has to appeal to a larger audience than that represented by the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture, however, is not without his individual influence, and perhaps it is his Department that is suffering more from the action of the Ministry than others.  One can only hope that it is not useless to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to encourage his colleagues to take the one step necessary.</P>
    <P>Reading over the financial returns of the various Colonial States, we have found that, despite what one might call quotas and other methods of restriction, nearly all of them have managed to increase their exports to the British market.  We alone, who ought to have been able to take advantage of the position more readily than any distant Colony, are in the position that our exports to Great Britain have fallen off lamentably. Personally, if one is permitted to allude to the national aspect in this particular debate&mdash;and I expect one is not&mdash;I should be prepared to dish any hopes of a particular Republic, or to dish any dreams even of an ideal in national status, if some method could be found of improving the present position of the unfortunate agriculturists.  I do not know if Deputies opposite realise fully the position of the farmers.  They surely ought to by now.  I know of cases of old men who have been driven prematurely to their graves by the anxiety of the present situation.  It must be familiar to everybody in this House who thinks, that old people's deaths have been hastened by the nervous endeavour to maintain themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>We have had it thrown at us from the Front Benches opposite&mdash;it has been thrown at me particularly&mdash;that we were in such an excellent position that there should be no necessity for us to make the case that we could not pay our liabilities.  In the present circumstances, I do not think that anybody in this House, or outside this House, who is engaged in agriculture, ought to be ashamed to admit the circumstances that prevail even so far as <Col N="367" /> he himself is concerned individually. I have had it levelled at me from the Front Benches opposite that I have been enticing other people by my example to repudiate their debts.  My position, as I have stated in this House on several occasions, is no better, and perhaps a little worse than that of many of my unfortunate fellow-sufferers.  If the Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister who presides over the Land Commission, will agree to take a look at my financial returns, I shall gladly give them to him.  If the Minister for Agriculture, after looking at those returns, should be willing to undertake that a cheque issued by me to pay my Land Commission commitments, my rates commitments, and my other commitments of that nature, outside my purely private debts, would be honoured, well, I am willing to draw the cheque.  Unfortunately, however, I cannot find myself in that particular position.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of unfortunate people in this country that I knew two years ago to be very well off; men that I would not have hesitated to face two or three years ago and borrow anything from £100 to £1,000. These men have come to me in the last three months with stories of misfortune that would appeal even to Deputy Norton or any of the leaders of the Labour Party.  Their position is practically worse than that of the neediest recipient of outdoor relief and free beef.  I know of an instance &mdash;I shall repeat it in this House and it bears repeating&mdash;of an industrious, hard-working farmer, with seven or eight little children&mdash;a man whom I saw myself at a late hour in the night doing work that was woman's work, cleaning and washing and putting to bed those little children.  That should have been a mother's work, only that there was no mother; but it should have been another woman's work, if the money could have been provided for the purpose, but the money was not there.  This man is one of the sufferers from the campaign we have had to collect the land annuities.</P>

      <P>I would call <Col N="368" /> the Deputy's attention to the fact that on a Supplementary Estimate the Committee is confined to a discussion of the items of that Estimate.  I should like to know to which particular item in the Vote the Deputy could relate his remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, this particular man to whom I have referred is a dairy farmer, and one of the hardestworking and best dairy farmers in Limerick&mdash;a man who was able to provide for himself and his family in comfort and whose home, up to two or three years ago, would have delighted anybody to enter.  That home was mainly maintained out of the profits of dairying and supplying milk to creameries.  We have had to increase the Estimates to maintain that particular industry in the last two or three years and we have additional expenditure in this particular Estimate.  My point is that the net result of all this expenditure to that particular farmer is that his position is considerably worsened and that he is driven to desperation.  I maintain that there are hundreds like him whose position, despite all this expenditure, is practically desperate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not weary the patience of the House by attempting to go on painting a picture which ought to be familiar to everyone, but I appeal, in God's name, to every Deputy, whether on these benches, the Fianna Fáil Benches, the Labour Benches or the Independent Benches, to use every atom of strength, and to make the greatest appeal that is possible to the Ministry, to take the one and only step that will bring about a return of prosperity to agriculture, making some arrangement by which this country will return to the position it was in three years ago, when there was free entry into the world's greatest market. and to do it now before it is too late. If an arrangement is not made now, or if the chance is delayed, other countries will continue to enter that market to our detriment until, finally, we will arrive at the position that there will be no market left for our goods, and neither the expenditure <Col N="369" /> this House votes, nor any efforts of an individual Minister, will save the situation for the farmers in the not far distant future.  As far as my voice can appeal to any Minister, without reference to party politics, I urge that now is the time to act.</P>
    <P>We have had expressions from a Minister in another country that the door is open.  We have also had expressions from the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in this State that he is hopeful for further arrangements on the lines of the recent trade agreement. If the door is open on one side and if the leading Minister on the other side is full of hope for the betterment of the position, there should be no material hindrance to a settlement.  If it can be brought about no one here will withhold whatever credit can possibly accrue to the Ministry.  I venture to say that much of the sufferings of the last three years amongst the agricultural community would be forgotten, and that some of us who have said harsh things of the Government will refrain from repeating them.  It is practically impossible for a Deputy who represents farmers to view the sufferings amongst the various sections of the industry and restrain himself sufficiently from committing some slight indiscretion of speech for which he might be made to suffer the penalties of the law.  It is in order to save the position that I appeal to the Ministry. Even though we have appealed in vain on many occasions during this year there are particular reasons why we may expect that the people on the other side of the Channel would be more amenable to a settlement.  The Government should take the necessary steps to make the only arrangement that can ever resuscitate the agricultural industry here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have an explanation from the Minister of the item of £45,000 in this Estimate dealing with the purchase and export of cattle.  Has that item a reference to the Minister's purchase and sale of cattle at 11/- a cwt.?  In connection with this transaction, is the Minister paying the scheduled price fixed in <Col N="370" /> the Act, 22/- per cwt.?  It is a very serious matter if the Minister who, under the Act, is a dealer, so to speak, is losing 50 per cent.  on such transactions. I do not want to go over ground that has already been covered, but I want an explanation as I know that the Minister is selling cattle at 11/- per cwt., delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions have been addressed to the Minister designed to ascertain what his Department has done towards ensuring that the price fixed in the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act is being paid to farmers. We have been told by the Minister that persons aggrieved can sue the purchasers for the balance which they should have received in respect to the sale of cattle.  But nothing very effec tive appears to have been done by the Department in the matter.  The Minister has added about 120 supervisors to his staff under this Act, and I am sure these officials cannot be going around the country without knowing that there are complaints, which I believe are well-founded, that farmers are not being paid the prices fixed in the Act for cattle sold to butchers.  I can hardly imagine the Minister not being aware that the terms of the Act are being evaded by butchers, who are squeezing farmers because they know that in any event the cattle must be sold, and that farmers in such circumstances are often prepared to take any price they can get, rather than press for what they are entitled to.  I should like the Minister to tell the House what has been the experience of his Department; to say whether he is perfectly satisfied that the fixed prices are being paid; and, if not, what steps he proposes to take to deal with the situation.  It is simply absurd if the Legislature is to pass an Act to provide fixed prices for farmers' cattle if that can be evaded with apparent immunity by people outside.  While cattle are being bought at less than the fixed prices the price of meat to cash customers has been raised.  on the pretext that the butchers must now pay fixed prices.  Is the Minister quite satisfied that the increase in meat prices to cash customers is justified, <Col N="371" /> in view of the fact that there are universal complaints that the provisions of the Act are not being complied with?</P>
      <P>The House will remember that a keen controversy developed recently between the Beet Growers' Association and the Sugar Company as to the price to be paid for beet.  In the course of the controversy the Department of Agriculture stepped in, and proceeded to supply to beet growers particulars of the estimated cost of producing beet.  One of the most striking features of the statement furnished by the Department was that it was estimated labour could be obtained at 5d. per hour.  The statement was issued officially by the Department.  It was not issued by the Minister, but I should like to know if it was issued with his authority, and if it is the official policy of his Department to stand over a wage of 5d. per hour for labour in the production of beet.</P>
      <P>What is the experience of his Department? Are they satisfied with the fixed price paid?  If the Department of Agriculture considers that 5d. per hour is a reasonable rate to pay agricultural labourers engaged in the production of beet I wonder would the same Department give those people a prescription as to how to live; as to how a man is to keep his wife, feed, clothe and house his children on a wage of 5d. per hour. If the Minister's Department considers that a reasonable wage for a man engaged in beet production, the Department ought to be able to put its cards on the table and show that it is a reasonable, Christian wage.  If it is not a Christian wage the Department has no right to issue this as its estimate of cost in the name of the community producing beet.  I hope the Minister will repudiate that statement.  Every one knows that 5d. per hour is a starvation wage.</P>

On a point of order, what I respectfully submit is that it is relevant to this Estimate to discuss the general question of wages and prices paid for sugar beet, and also the question of wages and the prices paid for beet in the Cooley area, because we have here under one head the appropriation of money specifically for that purpose&mdash;&ldquo;Additional sugar beet grown in the Cooley district.&rdquo;  That is a grant apparently to facilitate the growth of <Col N="374" /> beet in this area, and the submission I make, and the submission that Deputy Norton was making, was that the conditions in which the beet was grown are a public scandal; that to sanction money to encourage the growing of beet under slave conditions would be a public scandal, for which this House should not vote public money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an item providing for additional payment of a bounty on home-grown millable wheat.  When I observe that we are making provision for a bounty on home-grown wheat of millable quality and, that in various other Estimates before the House, provision will be made for the payment of bounties upon various kinds of agricultural produce, I call attention to the fact that all these provisions are in respect of bounties to the owners of the produce and seem to take no cognisance of the necessity of securing decent returns to the agricultural workers engaged in the production of these commodities.  Statistics are issued from time to time showing what the Department of Statistics regards as the rate of wages paid in the different provinces for agricultural labour. The most noticeable feature is the fact that there has been a constant decline each year since 1925.  Anybody who has examined the figures and relates these figures to the actual circumstances in these provinces and counties knows perfectly well that those statistics give a fallacious notion as to what the real rates of agricultural wages are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether any provision is to be made by his Department in way of insuring that a decent rate of wages will be paid to those engaged in the production of those subsidised agricultural products.  Is the intention of his Department to allow people to <Col N="375" /> secure those bounties from the State, for the production of certain cereals, while those producing them are paying to their agricultural labourers extremely low rates of wages? Because it is manifestly unfair that the State, acting in the name of the community, should provide bounties, subsidies and markets and assist with quotas, all those engaged on the employers' side of agricultural industry while at the same time doing nothing whatever to protect the agricultural labourer from exploitation by means of low wages.  Many of the agricultural labourers working to-day are getting less in wages than they would get under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Many of these people to-day are compelled to work for rates of wages which are coming perilously near pre-war rate of wages.</P>

      <P>Many of these agricultural labourers are working for rates of wages which are less than the rates paid under the Unemployment Assistance Act and everybody knows that those are low enough, and, indeed, much too low.  Yet, the Department <Col N="376" /> which is providing bounties for wheat, bounties for beet and guaranteed markets and quotas for other root crops, has apparently so far not felt itself bound to do anything in the way of trying to raise the level of wages for those who are the real producers of agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister if he will tell the House in what way he thinks prosperity can be restored to the agricultural industry.  It is a mistake to imagine a prosperous agricultural industry when agricultural workers are paid their existing rates of wages.  There can be no prosperity in the agricultural industry when such rates of wages obtain and the Minister ought to take some steps to ensure that these rates of wages are not only protected against further reduction but that some effort is made to raise them to a standard comparable with a standard which will provide a decent scale of sustenance for the worker.  I think representations have been made to the Minister already to establish an agricultural wages board, and I should like to hear from the Minister what are the proposals of the Government in that respect.  I hope that the Minister will give the House some indication that it is at last being realised by the Government that something must be done to stop the continued reduction in the rates of wages of agricultural labourers. If the Minister does that, he will have done a better day's work for agriculture than by the payment of some of these bounties and the imposition of some of these quotas and restrictions.</P>

      <P>It is on the Estimates&mdash; call it what you like.  Deputy Norton has spent a year or so displaying his eloquence in this House, and out of it, upon the growing of wheat and the growing of sugar at a fixed price, at a price which regulated the remuneration right down the line, because you cannot take more out of a pint measure than a pint and you cannot take more return out of a ton of beet than the cash value fixed by the legislative act of this House, for which Deputy Norton voted.  The cost of seeds, manures, land annuities, rates, etc., is included in the price of that ton of beet.  That ton of beet will produce a certain quota of sugar&mdash; from 15 to 18 per cent.  The price of that sugar is fixed&mdash;I think, by the Government&mdash;at a very high figure, but when Deputy Norton is speaking to another audience he says it is monstrous that the retail price of sugar should be 3½d. per lb. and the wholesale price 3d. per lb., but it must be that price in order to keep up the price which Deputy Norton voted for here.  That price which he voted for cannot afford to give any more wages than 5d. an hour for a 60-hour week. That is what Deputy Norton and his Party voted for in this House.</P>

The Deputy voted and tied himself down, step by step, as he went along, and it is not in one strait-jacket the Deputy is but in many strait-jackets all along the line.  It does not do to come here and make a propagandist speech for the gallery.  Will the Minister, in giving <Col N="378" /> bounties and subsidies, see that a proper wage is paid to agricultural workers, so as to give them a proper standard of sustenance and so on? Will the Deputy come out and get behind a plough with me and show how it can be done?  He will not nor will anybody else.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue that argument any further, but the Minister, in introducing this Estimate, referred to the export of eggs to Germany. I should like him to elaborate <Col N="379" /> that a little further in his concluding remarks.  He said that this item was introduced as a token to give authority for the export of eggs to Germany.  I wonder is this part of the £1 to £3 agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand we are buying £3 worth of goods from Germany for the £1 worth that they buy from us.  I wonder if we are to buy from Germany what is the usual exchange?  Are we dealing on a gold basis?  Have we a gold basis with them?  Of course, we will have to do it by bills of exchange.  Are there sufficient of these bills of exchange about to help us to carry on the trade?  There will be more room for that in another place.  Now there is an item of £40 to help to settle people on the land in Meath. The leader of the Labour Party has just criticised the Ministry for, if not recognising, at all events, winking at a wage of 5d. an hour.  As a matter of fact, I know that wages in Meath are not 25/- a week, yet here we are asked to vote £40 to help land settlement in that county.  There are people resident in Meath who cost this State nothing. I would ask Deputy O'Reilly to contradict this statement if he can&mdash; that agricultural wages in Meath do not exceed 25/- a week.  Yet here we are asked to give money to help to carry out land settlement in Meath where wage conditions are so bad. There is so much money asked for the administration of this Cattle and Sheep Act.  Deputy Norton wanted to know from the Minister if the farmers are getting the price fixed under this Act.  The Minister knows well that the farmers are not getting the price fixed.  He knows perfectly well that this Act has been harmful to the farmers.  The Minister knows the fatal statement he made&mdash;a statement that cattlemen who knew what they were talking about begged him not to make.  These men who could then sell their cattle at 19/- or 20/- a cwt. begged the Minister not to make the statement which they knew he was to make and which he did make.  The result of that statement by the Minister was that cattle went <Col N="380" /> down 50/- per head.  I would ask the Minister to contradict that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, we will wait for the record.  The price has gone down for our meat.  This Act which was passed to stabilise and raise the price of meat does not seem to have served the purpose intended.  We are <Col N="381" /> asked now to vote money to finance this Act which has not served its purpose. The Minister has now admitted that the price of meat went down since the passing of this Act.  Previous to the passage of this Act, a certain price was obtained for meat on the export market through the ordinary laws of trading.  Now the Minister comes along and asks for money.  I hold no brief for the traders as such but I know the prices that were paid here and the prices charged by the traders.  The traders were prepared to show their accounts and to show the profits they were making.  They were trading under ordinary trade conditions, buying as cheaply as they could and selling as advantageously as they could.  They were buying at 17/- to 18/- a cwt.  And the Minister came along and said to them &ldquo;you must buy at 25/- a cwt.&rdquo;  The Minister admits that the selling price on the other side went down.  How could trade be carried on under those conditions?  To finance this Act he now wants some money and I suppose he must get it. I am not raising those points by way of throwing unnecessary obstacles in the Minister's way.  The Minister has admitted the fall in price.  That is the substantial point I make.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I could agree with the criticism of tobacco growers. I do not agree with charging no duty on home grown tobacco.  If that were the case there would be a rush to grow tobacco now but there would be a terrible loss to the Revenue.  This grant of £850 is, I take it, for the carriage of beet from Cooley to the Carlow factory.  Is not that where the Cooley beet is manufactured&mdash;Carlow?  What is the subsidy per ton&mdash;is it 2/-?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the fixed price for beet is the same for Cooley, I take it, as for the other districts.  There was a matter raised by Deputy Dillon when this Estimate was being discussed the last day and, if I am permitted, I would like to go as far into it as Deputy Dillon went.  I do not want to question the size of the wage fixed in the beet settlement; I do not <Col N="382" /> want to criticise either side.  We are called upon, not only to subsidise the growing of beet but the production of dear sugar generally, because sugar is now costing the consumer at least twice as much as it might cost if we imported sugar and did not bother about manufacturing it.  This is the only opportunity the Minister has had since that agreement was made and I think it would be very useful if he gave his views on the principle involved in that settlement&mdash;namely, a flat price for beet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to help the price of beet to the Cooley growers we are asked to pay a subsidy of 2/-.  I do not want to raise the matter in the spirit of the ordinary debate here.  I raise it merely to hear the Ministerial view on that principle, because that principle adopted there, in my opinion, takes away a great incentive which would make sugar production from beet an economic proposition, which it is not at the present time in any country in the world.  That incentive, to be paid according to sugar content, is eliminated now because of the flat rate.  I am sure the Minister and every farmer here appreciate this, that we would want about 5 per cent. more of a sugar content in our beet strain to make it an economic proposition and provide sugar for the masses at a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>All right, I am satisfied. I would like the Minister to inform the House when he proposes to pay the bounties on wheat.  There was a case recently where a man's cattle were seized for annuities, sold by public auction, and the Minister owed him more against his claim for wheat bounties than the man owed the Land Commission for annuities.  Many people have asked me to raise a question here and to find out when the Minister expects to be in a position to pay the wheat bounties.  I hope the Minister will give some indication as to how the matter stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in regard to this Estimate.  I notice there is a considerable sum of money transferred and it is set out here as &ldquo;anticipated savings on original provision under this subhead in respect of salaries, wages and allowances; factory expenses and compensation for animals slaughtered.&rdquo;  The whole amount comes to £102,045.  It has been transferred and there is credit taken in this Vote for that amount.  It was intended, I understood, to set up a tinned meat factory.  I know that many poor farmers had old cows and they keep them for the purposes of this factory in the hope of getting a few pounds on them.  The people were led to believe that the factory would be working before February. That factory has not been established and the result is that whatever little stock of fodder the farmers had has all been consumed and they still have <Col N="384" /> the old cows and the animals are not worth as much now as they were then. This is a very serious ground of complaint. In some parts of the country, at any rate, farmers have suffered considerably; they have been misled by the promise that the factory would be in operation in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking generally on the Vote, I do not think there is much to be gained by discussing it at length.  I appreciate the difficulties that the Minister is up against.  He is doing the best he can to stave off the evil day that is approaching all too fast and which must inevitably overtake agriculture.  The Executive Council succeeded in one night in turning off the source of power to that industry by diverting the water from the mill and they gave the Minister for Agriculture the difficult job of trying to keep the old mill running.  I certainly sympathise with the Minister because he is trying to carry on a task that is absolutely impossible. Any medical man will tell you that the best way to treat a disease is to remove the cause.  Instead of doing that the Minister is treating the symptoms. My advice to him would be to remove the cause.  But for the fact that I am afraid to mention the economic war in this debate, I would say that the economic war was the cause of the whole trouble and that only by removing the cause is there any hope of saving agriculture.  Agriculture, if we compare it to a mill, is just kept running, not by the little relief by way of bounties and Votes that have been passed on to it, but because of force acquired before the source of power was cut off.  The little that is being given to it now is just helping it to carry on for a little longer, but it is only for a little longer.  I can only compare the Minister to a man who, when the water is turned off from a mill, would start to draw water with a bucket to try and keep it going a little longer. This is something similar to that; but sooner or later the industry must come to a standstill.  While there is time to do something to remove the cause, I would appeal to the Minister, <Col N="385" /> because after all he is the Minister responsible for agriculture, to do whatever he can to remove the cause of the whole trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer and a representative of farmers I cannot allow this Vote to pass without making a few remarks.  I am sorry to say that the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act has been of no use or assistance to the farmer.  Farmers at present are getting less money instead of more for their beef cattle.</P>
      <P>I am a stall feeder myself and sent a wagon of cattle to the Dublin market last week.  Under the Act we are supposed to get 25/- a cwt. for our cattle. I have not seen 25/- paid for any cattle so far, and I would wish to see it, both for my own sake and for the sake of the agricultural community. I had great difficulty in obtaining 20/- per cwt. in the Dublin cattle market last Thursday for my wagon of beef cattle.  I had to pay, roughly, 4/6 per cwt. for the transport of the cattle from Leix to Dublin, so that I really only got 15/6 per cwt. for my cattle. I have to say with regret that since the Act came into operation the sale of cattle has been a losing proposition for the farmer instead of a gain.  We all hoped that the cattle trade was going to be revived.  We do not want to become millionaires but we want to get what would pay decent wages to our labourers and a decent price for the fodder necessary to maintain the cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been 120 supervisors appointed under the Act at a salary of something like £6 a week.  I should like to know for what purpose they are going round the country.  Surely they are not doing the cattle trade any good.  At a recent fair in Leix a man was selling a beast which was not being bought for beef, but for a different purpose altogether.  One of these inspectors came along and said that 22/- per cwt. would have to be paid for the beast.  &ldquo;Then.&rdquo;  said the buyer.  &ldquo;I am finished.  I was not buying the beast for beef but for another purpose.&rdquo;  The man who owned the beast had to take it home again and it has to remain there until <Col N="386" /> the next fair, when probably the same inspector will come along and operate in the same way.  I think that if these inspectors looked after the prices paid in the Dublin cattle market they would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>With regard to sugar beet, I grow a certain amount, some six or eight acres, and I can tell you that the price is not very good.  I thought that we might succeed this year in getting a better price, but a flat rate of 37/6 is very poor.  The House can understand, however, that a lot of people at present are eager to grow beet because they get the seed and the manure and a little money in the summer.  That is very useful to people who are not in a position to buy seeds or manures or to stock their lands.  In these circumstances, I do not blame the small farmers for rushing to the factories to enter into contracts.  To me it is a sign of poverty when I see people undertaking to grow beet at a flat rate of 37/6.  In my own area when 54/- per ton was being paid for beet, I knew farmers who refused to sign contracts at that price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton speaks here of a wage of 5d. an hour for labour.  That, I admit, is not a good wage for beet pulling.  The pulling of beet is carried on usually in the month of January when a man can only work five or six hours a day.  He would probably work on the average less than four days a week.  No farmer would ask a labouring man to go out and pull beet for 5d. an hour under these conditions.  The man would not earn salt for his potatoes at 5d. an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer that question later on.  With regard to the beet crop generally, I am sorry, having regard to the deplorable position in which the farmer is now placed, that he would not be paid a proper price for the raw material of that industry, if we can call it an industry.  I was always a supporter of the beet factories and last year, in the area of the Thurles factory in which I live, I did everything I possibly could to get <Col N="387" /> the requisite acreage for that factory, but I think that the beet growers are deserving of a more reasonable remuneration for their efforts than they are now allowed.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I should like to call attention has reference to the wheat bounty.  I asked the Minister a short time ago a question in reference to this bounty and he answered me fairly and justly.  He told me that the Department would speed up the payment of the bounty and that the wheat growers would be paid by the 1st March.  I have to compliment him on the performance of that promise.  Many wheat growers in my county have been paid the bounty recently though there are some who have yet to receive it.  I compliment the Minister on speeding up the payment of that bounty.</P>
      <P>I should also like to call his attention to the position of the tobacco crop.  The crop for last year has been handed over by the farmers to the rehandlers but at the present time the farmer has got practically no return for his crop.  He is advanced only 10 per cent on his tobacco by the rehandlers.  I should like to know how the farmer is to put down his seeds and prepare his stocks for the coming year when he has not been paid or does not know what he is to receive for last year's crop?  The tobacco crop is just like any other crop in that the earlier it is planted the better the crop will be.  A crop must be placed between 1st April and 1st May to give the best results.  How is a grower to prepare for the 1935 crop when he does not know yet what the 1934 crop will bring him?  It is not just to the farmer to expect him to sow this crop when he does not know what he is going to receive for last year's crop.  I would ask the Minister to say when, where, or how, or by whom growers are to be paid for last year's crop.  Deputy Davin smiles but the Deputy never did much tobacco growing.</P>

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that later.  I would ask the Minister to state whether it is the rehandler or the Government is to pay the farmer for his tobacco crop.  Many farmers do not know where the money is to come from.  There are many farmers who grew excellent crops in the past year but they are in doubt, having regard to the fact that they have not yet been paid in full for last year's crop, whether they will sow any this year.  It would be some enlightenment to them if they were informed when they are to receive payment for that crop.  I shall conclude by asking the Minister to give us some information in his reply as to how the tobacco crop for 1934 stands in regard to the price and payment for the crop.</P>

I was asked, in the beginning of the discussion, a question as to the nature of the instruction to be given in connection with the special settlement scheme in Meath.  An assistant agricultural overseer, one of the officials who is accustomed to deal with small farmers in the congested districts, is being put there to instruct the farmers who are being migrated in the growing of certain crops.  He will instruct them in the growing of all ordinary crops that the land may require.</P>

I want to say that there are many newspapers in this country which are very strongly opposed to the Government and who criticise Government policy on every issue that comes up, but we have not withdrawn the wheat advertisements from them.  We did withdraw the advertisements from two papers because in their criticism of our scheme they published certain figures which we asked them to correct and which they refused to correct.  It was on that account that the advertisements had to be withdrawn.  In fact, we do not object to the Opposition newspapers criticising the wheat scheme in a fair way in their leading articles, but we did object when they used figures which were not correct and when they refused to make the corrections when asked to do so by us.</P>

Deputy Dillon asked me a question about the price of butter in Germany.  I have not got the figures with me, but I did answer the Deputy before when asked this question and I did prove in the <Col N="390" /> reply given to him that we were getting a better price for our butter in Germany than we would get in Britain&mdash; in fact, that we were getting a better price than if there was no tariff charged on our butter in Britain.  I do not want to make the case that the price is better because we have to pay a tariff on our butter going into Britain but that we are getting a better price without taking the tariff into consideration.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon asked why, if we were making a profit, it was not shown in the appropriations-in-aid. We do not show a profit because the way in which our butter exports are carried on under the subsidy scheme is that there is a different subsidy given for exports to many countries. There are certain ordinary traders who have a small trade in butter with Egypt, for instance, and there is a different export bounty for butter going there than for butter going to Britain.  There is even a different bounty for butter going to the Isle of Man than for butter going to Britain. All these subsidies are regulated so as to try to get the exporter the best possible price and at the same time give him as good a return as if he were exporting to Britain.  The Government subsidy was less on butter exported to Germany than on butter exported to Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>If a question is put down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not remember the figures exactly at the moment. Deputy Dillon also asked why, instead of spending the money on advertising wheat, we do not spend some of this money on winter dairying.  There is, as Deputies are probably aware, a very big increase in winter production of butter in the last two or three years. We have become very much nearer to being self-supporting in our production of butter this winter than we were three years ago.  The reason is that we are giving very big encouragement to it under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act.  Under that Act a certain levy is payable by creameries on their production.  That levy is only collectible for eight months of the year. There is no levy from the 1st December to the 1st April, so that, during the four winter months, the effect of that is that creameries get about 40/- per cwt. more for their butter than they get in the other months.  That has had the effect of stimulating production.  I am sure that farming Deputies quite realise that a matter like that is bound to be slow, because it is not so very easy for a farmer to change his cows into autumn calving cows instead of spring calving cows.  Deputies will realise that it takes a few years to bring about that change, and it is quite possible that the movement in that direction may be felt more in the next few years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not so much as that at all.  The present price&mdash;at least, the price about two days ago when I saw it last&mdash;would be about 80/-, and the average price for the summer months last year was 72/-.  We take the summer months, as far as butter goes, as the eight months of the year from 1st April to 1st December, and we take the four winter months as from 1st December to the 1st April inclusive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>During our winter their exports are higher.  With regard to the question of the German Agreement, the matter was raised by certain Deputies here that it was unfair to export the eggs through the Newmarket Dairy Company because that company, being owned by the Government, would get whatever advantage there might be, if there were any advantage, of a possibly higher price in Germany than in Britain.  I do not think that such would be the case. For instance, if we, in the Department, feel that a merchant could realise, say, 3d. per great hundred more in Germany than in Great Britain, taking tariffs and so on into consideration, then we would fix the bounty on eggs going to Germany at 3d. less than on those going to Great Britain.  The effect of that would be that there would be no more benefit to the merchant trading with Germany than to the merchant trading with Great Britain.  That, of course, was taken by some Deputies here, on the last night that we were discussing this matter, as depriving the producers of the benefits of the German market. It is not so, however, because the position we are in really&mdash;the position that I am in as Minister for Agriculture&mdash;is that I get a certain amount of money for export bounties, and although I am, in law and by regulation, subject to the Minister for Finance in the spending of that money&mdash;subject to his sanction and so on&mdash;still, if I can make a saving of, say, a small amount in the bounty on eggs going to Germany, that small amount of saving will be put to the benefit of eggs in general.  In that way, all producers will get whatever benefit there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if we were to give the same bounty and, instead of saving the 3d. said to the merchant that it should be passed on to the producers, what would probably happen in the first place is that the <Col N="393" /> merchants would not pass it on, and if they did pass it on, it would be passed on only to a certain selected few producers and not to the whole lot.  Deputies will realise that that would be very unfair.  Surely it would be much fairer, if we can get a better price out of the German or the Spanish market, to make the saving and to spread it over the whole lot, if the saving is large enough to do so.</P>
    <P>I was asked if there was a quota on eggs going into Great Britain.  There is.  I was asked why there were no regulations issued.  Now, we think, or at least we hope, that with the amount of eggs going to Germany and France &mdash;which will amount roughly to about 500,000 great hundreds&mdash;with that amount taken from the general export market, we may not have too much of a surplus for the British market over the amount allotted to us.  With that in view, we are anxious to avoid bringing in regulations as far as we can.  We believe that if we bring them in they will have the effect inevitably of lowering the price, because the suppliers will get the idea that there is a restriction on export and that they will not be able to sell their eggs unless they sell them quickly.  The exporters are likely to take advantage of that feeling and press the suppliers to sell, with the inevitable result that prices would go down.  So, for the present, at any rate, we are exporting our eggs without regulation.  If, however, we exceed the quota allotted to us for the first three or the first six months, we may have to issue regulations then in order to make the numbers right.  I hope, however, that may not be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember exactly, at the moment, the number of great hundreds to Great Britain, but I should say that unless we export a considerably greater quantity than in 1934 we will not have any difficulties this year&mdash;that is, taking all exports into account.  Deputy Dillon also <Col N="394" /> raised the point that we were only allowed to send the best eggs to Germany, and he concluded from that, therefore, that we would only have the leavings for Great Britain.  Really, that is a very irresponsible statement to make.  It is quite true that we are only allowed to send the best eggs to Germany, but for the last eight or nine years&mdash;I think since 1924&mdash;this country has not sent anything but the best eggs to Great Britain.  Under our own Export of Eggs Act we have examination of all consignments at the ports, and if there are any bad, stale, or broken eggs, or any under-weight eggs, they are taken out of those cases, and very often the whole case is confiscated if there are more than five or six eggs that would not pass the inspectors.</P>
      <P>I am continually getting complaints from inspectors that in the last three or four years we have been far too strict about eggs going to Great Britain.  I am sure that while very great care has been taken to see that none but eggs of the very best class are sent to Great Britain that Deputy Dillon knows that.  I think it was a very irresponsible statement for him to make or to allow to go out that we were going to palm off inferior eggs on Great Britain because we were sending the best eggs to Germany. It is not true.  We are not sending inferior eggs to any country and we do not intend to do so.  In fact, I think we may be more strict with regard to good eggs going to Great Britain, with regard to size, and that we definitely have our eggs classified and graded on a higher standard than in the past.  I understand that the Ceann Comhairle does not agree that we should discuss the beet question now, but I want to say that I agree with the flat price because, in the first place, the technical advisers in the factory stated that the flat price was all right and had no dangers, while the farmers supplying three of the factories voted practically unanimously in favour of the flat price.  When you have the technical advisers and the farmers advocating the flat price I do not see that any Minister for Agriculture should interfere.</P>

We have produced seeds of different varieties and we can have them tested to see how they get on.  We are likely to go more into the question of the production of seeds here.  We can hope that within a reasonable time&mdash;three or four years &mdash;we will be able to tackle the question of growing our own seeds.  Deputy Belton is in touch with the County Dublin farmers who for many years have been seed growers for cabbages, brussels sprouts, etc., and I am sure he realises that there is a big difficulty in the growing of the seeds of certain root crops here, because our climate is not altogether dry enough. We may be able to get over that by experiments.  The Deputy will agree that we have in the Albert College technical officials who have made a success of the growing of certain other seeds, and that we may hope that they will succeed in this matter.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with varieties grown here.  Some Deputy drew attention to the fact that in our costings we gave 24/- as an agricultural wage.  It is quite true that we did so.  But I do not think we can be accused of giving any approval to that wage.  We were called in as a third party, to advise on the costings of beet growing.  Suppose the Department had not been called in, but that an auditor or a costings officer was called in to estimate, is it not quite natural that he would take the all round rates of present labour charges?  Nobody would accuse the costings officer of approving of that wage.  Such an officer would not attempt to criticise the wages or salaries paid.  In estimating the costings he would go on the wages paid.  I have no hesitation in saying that the wages of agricultural labourers are far too low.  It does not do any good to say we all believe that. Farmers are paying certain wages and it is on these wages the costings were made.</P>

      <P>The costings of the manufacture of sugar from beet were not estimated in the same way, because a definite wage was laid down for labour by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the manufacture of sugar.

      <P>Another Deputy also raised a question about wages. Deputy Norton says that in all the subsidised crops&mdash;wheat, beet and tobacco&mdash;for which there are guaranteed prices, we should fix the wages for labour.  I am not a great student of labour questions, but I imagine that it is a bad labour principle to advocate that men should be paid a fixed wage for work of one character and not to bother what is paid for work of another character.  We have to deal with the general agricultural rate.  If the Dáil so decides we would then have to have a fixed wage for agricultural wages all round.  That is a question that must be dealt with at some other time.  I was asked by Deputy Dillon whether we intended to transfer the cost of the wheat scheme to the consumers.  From circulars that were before the flour millers, and which were published in the Press about the 1st week in January, it was quite obvious that that was the intention of the Government. A Bill will be introduced before Easter&mdash;it may not be discussed until after Easter&mdash;which will have that as one of its main objects.  The millers will pay the average price for what they receive from the farmers, and will pass on whatever is the increased price to the purchaser of flour.</P>

      <P>Scarcely.  I was asked if I could suggest a good rotation in the case of a farmer who sows wheat this year as to what he would sow next year or the year after.  Certain Deputies appear to believe that we cannot increase our land under wheat unless we increase our land under root crops.  The question is then asked: what will we do with the root crops? Deputy Dillon talks so much and knows so little that he makes a lot of mistakes.  We find that in 1934 we had 665,000 acres under root crops.  In many counties in Ireland and in England they have a four years' rotation, leaving out hay.  They have two cereals, one root crop and then a cereal with grass seed.  When I was young and innocent I saw in the County Wexford a five year rotation&mdash;three years cereals, one root crop and one year's cereal with grass seed.  Of course, there was artificial manure used on the second year's cereals.  If we had three years cereals and one root crop we could have about 2,700,000 acres under tillage instead of the 1,500,000 acres that we have at present.  That would give us an increase of 1,200,000 acres.  If we had that rotation, it would be sufficient to provide us with all the wheat and barley that we need: the wheat to supply us with all the bread we require and the barley to substitute all the maize that is being imported at present.  Our tillage requirements could be filled by having a four year rotation.  We need not increase our root crops at all.  We are going to increase our root crops this year for more beet but only to a small amount. Our area under potatoes is almost as low as it can go.  Our exports are <Col N="399" /> very low.  They only amount to about 15,000 or 16,000 tons in the year.  That figure is not likely to go lower. Mangolds actually increased last year in spite of all the talk about the bad conditions as regards cattle.  Turnips went down by about 10,000 acres. Taking root crops, apart from looking forward to any great increase in connection with the production of industrial alcohol, we could, without increasing the area under them, grow all the cereals we require and have no problem to deal with as far as that goes.</P>

      <P>In that event I will require to get notice of the visit.  When this sheet was published some time ago it was pointed out very promptly by certain Opposition newspapers, and afterwards, I think, by certain Opposition Deputies, that our area under tillage was actually going down.  Of course, that was a very misleading statement to make.  When you take hay with tillage it has gone down. When I sat on the Opposition Benches I remember saying&mdash;I repeat the statement now, when I cannot be accused of making the point in support of Government policy&mdash;that the worst sign of a farmer was to see him increasing his hay.  When you see a farmer do that you may conclude that he is on his last legs, because an increase in his hay crop shows that he cannot afford to till and that he cannot afford to graze his land.  The worst sign one could see in the country was an increase in the hay acreage.  In the last few years the position has been that the acreage under hay has gone down, while the acreage under tillage has gone up.  It was because people were reading tillage plus hay together that the total had gone down.  The actual position is that the acreage under tillage has gone up, while that under hay has gone down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Belton will examine the figures he will see that there were only 278,000 acres of first <Col N="401" /> crop hay.  We had 665,000 acres of root crop, and a little under half that acreage represents first crop hay. Therefore, people are not going out of tillage and going back into hay.  I think there is no doubt but that there is ample room for a big increase in cereal growing without any change in root crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If land was not going under first crop hay, people tilled it again and it went back to another root crop.  It is not necessary for a farmer to sow root crop.  It is if he is up against the problem of growing as much cereals as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time the people get the opportunity they give us a bigger vote.  The Deputy knows that well. He left the sinking ship after the last election.  Deputy Dillon went on to speak of the free beef scheme and said he heard of one household that was drawing 21 lbs. of beef in the week. There are abuses under that scheme as there are likely to be under any scheme of the kind.  I do not think they are many or that they are very grave.  I think it will be necessary, in the near future, to have certain amendments made in that scheme.  In fact they are being considered.  If any are made one would be to meet abuses of that kind&mdash;the maximum amount of beef going into one house.  The point was also made that while we were paying out £45,000 for cattle we were only receiving £22,000 for those sold to Germany.  In fact, the official organ of the Opposition had a special article dealing with the bounties, in which they tried to make out that we were going to lose heavily on this German trade.  That is not so.  It has to be remembered that we close our accounts on the 31st of March.  At that date we <Col N="402" /> will have spent £45,000 on cattle for Germany, but it has to be remembered that there will be three weeks' payments due from Germany at that date. These will come into the next financial year's account, so that there will not be any loss at all on the cattle going to Germany.  I was also attacked because there is no need for us to pay the bounty on the cattle going to Germany.  I was asked why we did not pay it and give the benefit to the producer.  My answer is that that would not be the fairest way of doing it.  What would likely happen is this: that if we were to do that we would be giving to the producers of the cattle going to Germany very much more than anybody would be getting for cattle going to Great Britain or for cattle killed at home.  The fairest thing to do is to save the bounty off the cattle going to Germany.  That saving will enable us to raise the bounty all around on cattle later on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Curran said that in one case we sold cattle at 11/- a cwt., having paid 22/- a cwt.  That is a case which I mentioned in introducing the Estimate. We sold cattle to the Waterford Co-operative Meat Factory for experimental purposes in canning.  We were anxious to ascertain if the Kerry cattle from the Kerry cattle area would be suitable for this purpose, because they were a type that were very hard to sell otherwise and were commanding only a very poor price. We had an idea that they would be suitable cattle for canning because they are matured cattle and not fat. They would be classed as stores and not forward stores at that.  We had them tested and found that they were admirably suited to this purpose.  We bought them at store-cattle value.  We did pay something more than people had been getting for them up to that stage but we only bought for the purpose of this experiment.  That experiment was satisfactory and should enable us, in the canning of meat in the future, to give some sort of preference to Kerry cattle from the Kerry cattle area.  That would be extended to mountain cattle from other areas, according to the capacity of the factory.</P>

      <P>That is why we are trying to tackle the matter in another way. Deputy Norton asked if I thought the Cattle Act was being effectively administered and the minimum price being paid.  I am quite sure that the minimum price is not being paid in many cases.  Daily, the section of my Department which is administering this Act gets letters saying the minimum price is not being paid.  Our difficulty up to the present has been that, when the necessary request is made to the seller of the cattle to sign an affidavit that he received less than the minimum price, he declines to comply.  We have never been able to get a seller to do that up to the present, and we have, therefore, been unable to take action against any butcher.</P>

Neither did the Government fix the <Col N="404" /> price of sugar.  The price of beet is a matter for the company.  The price of sugar is a matter for the retailer. He gets the sugar at a certain price from the company and I suppose competition fixes the price at which he sells.</P>

Deputy Belton says that the price of cattle went down since the Act was passed.  That is quite true but Deputy Belton ought to admit that at this time last year we were getting 25/- to 27/- a cwt. for cattle exported.</P>

      <P>It was 23/- or 25/- when the licences were issued.  At the same time, the people who sold to the home butcher were only getting 15/- or 16/-. That was why the Act was brought in &mdash;to compel the butcher to pay as much as the exporter.  I claim that we have achieved that.  The home butcher, although he is not paying our minimum price in some cases, is paying as much as the exporter is paying, on the whole.  The price of cattle in England has gone down very considerably.  Unfortunately, we cannot help that.</P>

Deputy McGovern raised a point about old cows being kept over by farmers.  I am sorry if I gave any impression that the factory dealing with old cows would be started by now.  I may have had some hope that it would but I was rather careful not to give the impression to the public that it would be started at any particular time because I was afraid that what Deputy McGovern has mentioned would happen.

      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £10 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na blíana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1935, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Iascach Mara agus Intíre, maraon le hIldeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for salaries and expenses <Col N="409" /> in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>I should like to give an explanation as to how the item E.E. (1)&mdash;Losses, £3,694&mdash;arose.  It is in connection with the service between Galway and the Aran Islands.  About the year 1912 the former Congested Districts Board, with a view to facilitating communication between the Aran Islands and the mainland, advanced to the Galway Bay Steamboat Company a sum of £7,500 for the purchase of the S.S. &ldquo;Dun Aengus.&rdquo;  Repayment of the advance was to be by half yearly instalments over a period of 27 years; and on that basis, the total amount due to be paid in principal and interest would be £10,069 10s. 8d. Nothing was received from the Company since 1933; and, at that time, £6,376 0s. 2d. had been repaid, leaving £3,693 10s. 6d. outstanding.</P>
    <P>Apart from the capital provided for the acquisition of the steamer, a subsidy of £1,100 per annum was paid to the Company and this continued up to 1926.  In 1926, an investigation into the working of this scheme was made by officers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and as a result certain rearrangements were decided upon. The Company were allowed to suspend payment of their loan instalments for the four years ending 1929 and to advance correspondingly the date for repayment of the final instalment. Subsidy at the rate of £1,000 per annum was continued until 1929. Towards the end of 1929 the Company undertook the working of a tender for the Galway Harbour Commissioners in connection with liners visiting Galway; and as the crew of the &ldquo;Dun Aengus&rdquo; were mainly employed on this work, the loss on the working of the Company was reduced.  This enabled the subsidy to be reduced to £500 for the year 1930 and £600 for the year 1931.</P>
    <P>In 1932, a specially heavy overhaul of the &ldquo;Dun Aengus&rdquo; necessitated the subsidy being increased to £1,000 for that year.  The arrangement for a varying subsidy has never been regarded as satisfactory.  Subsequently, <Col N="410" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, arranged to have the balance on the loan account remitted in full and the annual subsidy fixed at a reduced amount.  The reduced subsidy has been fixed at £300 per annum and will continue to be paid in respect of the years 1933 to 1939.  It will continue thereafter unless the arrangement in regard to the Galway-Aran Service is terminated by six months' notice to be given either by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or by the Company, subject to the proviso that should this subsidy prove to have been insufficient to cover the aggregate loss on working in the five years, ending 31st December, 1937 or in a subsequent period of five years, the Company shall be recouped the amount by which expenditure upon necessary overhaul, beyond what is recoverable from Insurers or third parties, shall exceed £1,200.</P>
    <P>The second item in this Supplementary Estimate to which I wish to refer, is sub-head F. (1.)&mdash;Grants to Boards of Conservators.  Under Section 14 (1) of the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Act, 1934, every board of conservators within whose district there are tidal waters to which the Act applies is entitled to a grant in each fishery year equivalent to the amount of fishery rate on the fisheries in such tidal waters that obtained on the 1st day of January, 1933.  In the Ballyshannon fishery district, the amount of such rates for the standard year, as specified, in respect of the fisheries in the tidal waters was £540. As a result of the decision in what has come to be known as the &ldquo;Erne Fisheries Case&rdquo; no rates were received by the conservators for the tidal fishery during the fishery year 1st October, 1933, to 30th September, 1934, and, accordingly, the sum of £540 falls to be paid to the Ballyshannon Board.  From the amounts now submitted by way of Supplementary Estimates namely, £3,694, plus £540, making a total of £4,234, we must deduct a sum of £3,706 representing <Col N="411" /> an excess in the Appropriations in Aid of the Vote, as estimated for the current financial year.  That reduces the amount required to £528, and deducting from that figure certain savings which will be effected on other sub-heads, amounting to £518 in all, leaves the net total required by way of Supplementary Estimate at £10.</P>

      <P>Do I gather from the Minister that the £540 is for the loss of rates during the year 1933-34 and that no provision is being made for loss on rates during the current year 1934-5&mdash;the year beginning October 1st last?</P>

      <P>On that point, there was a matter I mentioned several times to the Minister with regard to the provisions of section 13 of the Act of 1925.  The time has now practically expired. Sub-section (6) of that Act, which sets out that the provision by which rates on valued fisheries go to the board of conservators instead of to the local authorities, expires at the end of nine years from 1st April following the coming into force of the Act of 1925.  Therefore that provision ceases on the 1st April next, so that if legislation is not introduced at once, extending that provision of the 1925 Fisheries Act, we are reverting to the position in which we were before that Act was passed&mdash;that is, the local authorities will be entitled when striking their rate as they do I think in April each year, to strike rates on the locally valued fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact a very nice question will arise as to any outstanding rates during the current fishery year.  Under the fishery laws these rates must be struck in December.  Some of them may not be paid on the 31st March and then a very nice question may arise as to whether any rates outstanding on the 31st March would be payable to the <Col N="412" /> conservators or whether the local authorities could not claim that any rates falling after 31st March next should come into their coffers instead of into the coffers of the conservators. That is a matter into which the Minister should make inquiries in his Department so as to ascertain what is being done about it.  As far as the Galway Bay Steamboat Company is concerned that was an old standing liability which we inherited from the old Congested Districts Board.  I am not sure whether the subsidy of £300 is sufficient to maintain the services to the extent that these require.  I think I saw from the papers that that was supplemented at present by the Sea Fisheries Association.  I am not cognisant of affairs there at present but if that £300 is supplemented by the Sea Fisheries Association this subsidy may be sufficient.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this Vote, might I suggest to the Minister in connection with the Erne Fishing Company another way in which the money could be got?  My information was that when the case was before the High Court in 1929 the Erne Fishery Company were working that fishery. I understand that since the decision of the Supreme Court was given last year no application has so far been made for a return of the working of the Erne Fisheries for the time the case was before the High Court and pending the appeal.  I think the only person who can make application on that matter is the Attorney-General. If there have been any profits during those years, and if they have been lodged, the Attorney-General might let us know.  If such is the case I do not see why these moneys should not be available.  If there were any profits derived from 1929 to 1934, then that is the source that the Minister should tap in order to provide the rates that he is trying to make by this Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, there is a question in connection with the general subject of several <Col N="413" /> fisheries, analogous to that raised by Deputy Brady, on which I would like to have some information.  The Minister for Defence said here on a previous occasion that the Government seriously considered acquiring the fishery rights in this country and making them the property of the State.  We are all aware that the Erne Fishery decision created a new situation with regard to the several fisheries in this country.  It is neither desirable nor permissible to comment on the decision in that case. But it seems legitimate to say this: that it seems highly desirable that the State should take some recognition of the fact that these several fisheries were occupied for a very long period by persons who believed themselves to be the proprietors of them.  These fisheries were transferred from one person to another for very substantial value at different times.  It is apparently true that legal appeals have accepted the view that the fundamental title to these several fisheries was unsound.  I want to know would the Government consider the desirability of acquiring these several fisheries for the State and compensating the existing owners?  It may be that some of them might be discovered not to belong in law to the people who believe themselves to be the owners of them at the present time.  It may be that others will be found to be legally vested in these several fisheries.  But grave hardships will certainly ensue if the letter of the law is to be enforced as regards the ownership of any several fishery in the country the title to which is faulty.  I would be glad to know from the Government if they now propose implementing the undertaking given by the Minister for Defence in the House on a previous occasion&mdash;that is, to acquire those fisheries and legally compensate the owners, or the putative owners, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Lynch as to the expiry of the provision whereby rates go to the conservators rather than to the local bodies, that matter has not been lost sight of.  But we had hoped to have a report of the commission sitting on the inland fisheries before <Col N="414" /> doing anything definite or bringing in any temporary Bill to deal with the situation.  I expect that we may have the report within the next few weeks. Otherwise I fear we may have to deal with that position in the very near future at any rate.  As regards this other question&mdash;how far do the rates from the several local licences go to meet this bill for rates?&mdash;I have to say that it does not meet fully that amount. But it must be remembered that we were only in a position to issue those special licences when a good part of the season in the Erne Fishery district was over last year.  Therefore, we could not charge as much for the special local licences as we could for a full year.</P>
      <P>I hope in the coming year to be able to get enough to meet the full demand for the rates from the special local licences.  Deputy Brady raised the question with regard to the point that the Erne Company were working on behalf of the court pending the appeal. I believe that is true, but I do not like to go into it further because it is a very delicate and complicated legal position, and I think we might leave the Attorney-General to deal with it.  I am sure he will safeguard the interests of the State.  If there is money due or if it can be recovered he will see to it.  In answer to Deputy Dillon, I wish to say that we are in the position of awaiting the report of the Fisheries Commission so as to see what they recommend with regard to private and several fisheries, and so on, and also to see if the Government would agree with its recommendations. Personally, I think we should keep always before us the consideration that the occupiers of a number of these fisheries have been there for a long time, believing themselves to be the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we took over the land which was required perhaps under somewhat similar circumstances, we did not victimise the owner of the land by taking it from him, confiscating it without compensation.  I think the same should really apply to those fisheries, and I am sure that, whatever the commission may report, they will not be unmindful of that.  Whatever they <Col N="415" /> may report we will keep it in mind; we will not be unjust to the present owners in any way.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,020 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for bounties on sugar made from home-grown beet, on tobacco manufactured from home-grown leaf, and on home-made mineral hydrocarbon light oils, on which drawback is paid.</P>
      <P>This is an additional Estimate for the current financial year, and it is in respect of a new Vote.  It is required to meet the payment of compensation bounties on sugar made from home-grown beet; tobacco manufactured from home-grown leaf and home-made mineral hydrocarbon light oils, on which drawback is paid.  In respect of the bounties on sugar made from home-grown beet, the sub-head has been opened to provide for the payment to manufacturers of goods containing sugar of bounties to compensate, in respect of goods exported on drawback, for the loss which will arise consequent on the use of sugar made from home-grown beet, the Excise duty on which is 16/4 per cwt. less than the Customs duty on imported sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for payment of compensation may briefly be stated to be due to the following reasons:&mdash;(1) The duty-paid price of sugar to the manufacturer in Saorstát Eireann is the <Col N="416" /> same for home-grown and for foreign sugar; (2) the rates of drawback payable are (a) in respect of foreign sugar, 18/8 a cwt.; (b) in respect of home-made sugar, 2/4 a cwt.; (3) the exporter is consequently at a disadvantage in the foreign market to the extent of 16/4 a cwt. by the use of home-made sugar.  The rate of compensation bounty has, accordingly, been fixed at 16/4 a cwt., which represents the difference between the Customs and Excise rates of duty on sugar of a polarisation exceeding 98 degrees.  The actual periods during which the reduced drawback rates based on the Excise rate of duty will be operative during the year 1934-35 are somewhat conjectural, owing to the existence, when the Excise duty of 2/4 a cwt. was imposed on 13th October, 1934, of stocks of manufactured and partly manufactured goods and of imported raw sugar, all of which will rank when exported for drawback at the rates operative on that date and of the grant since then of special import quotas to certain manufacturers in respect of sugar exceeding 98 degrees polarisation.</P>
    <P>In view of recent developments, it is advisable to make provision for possible large purchases of home-made sugar by industrial users, some of which may rank for bounty before the end of the current financial year.  To be in a position to deal wth any sudden rush of claims for bounty payments in respect of early special exports of goods manufactured from such recent purchases, a provision of £5,000 has been made.  The whole of that sum may not be required.</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply in respect to tobacco.  As regards the bounties on tobacco manufactured from the home-grown leaf, this compensation to tobacco manufacturers is necessitated by the fact that, although the price, inclusive of duty, paid by manufacturers for any particular grade of tobacco leaf is uniform, the drawback allowable in respect of stalks and other refuse thrown off in the processes of manufacture is less in the case of home-grown leaf than in that of imported leaf.  As stalks represent some 10 per cent. of the original leaf on <Col N="417" /> which duty is paid, the consequential financial loss to manufacturers would be appreciable if no compensation were available.</P>
    <P>The basis of the bounty is the difference between the Customs and the Excise duty rates.  In general, this difference is 10d. per lb., and as the quantity of leaf thrown off as waste is about 10 per cent. of the original purchases the relief to be afforded is 1d. per lb. on the home-grown leaf taken for manufacture.  Under the Tobacco Act, 1934, the whole of the home-grown crop is to be absorbed by manufacturers, and the total relief in respect of the 1934 crop will necessitate payment of £3,750.  So far as the current financial year is concerned, there is little likelihood of home-grown leaf from the 1934 dutiable crop being manufactured before the close of the year and a token provision of £10 has been made in consequence.</P>
    <P>In respect of home-made mineral hydrocarbon light oils, this sub-head has been opened to provide for the payment of compensation to exporters of home-made mineral hydrocarbon light oils which will be mainly exported in aircraft or motor vehicles.  The basic reasons are similar to those applying in the case of exporters of home-made sugar.  Owing to the fact that the Excise drawback is 2d. per gallon less than the Customs drawback, home-made mineral hydrocarbon oils are penalised to this extent in competing for use abroad.  The present rates of duty are Customs, 8d. per gallon, and Excise, 6d. per gallon.  The rate of compensation has, accordingly, been fixed at 2d. per gallon.  At present the average quantities exported on drawback are 55 gallons monthly.  With the Excise duty operative from February 1st of this year, bounty will fall to be paid for only two months in the current financial year, and the suggested provision of £10 should prove ample to meet all requirements.</P>

      <P>I would also like to ask him, in connection with the special price that this sum is designed to maintain for sugar in this country, a question that I addressed to the Minister for Agriculture to-day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in arriving at these figures of 18/8 and 2/4, was led to them by the price determined upon by the Executive Council as a reasonable price for sugar in order to finance its production.  In making that calculation he provided for a certain scale of wages to be paid to the workers in beet sugar factories, and the protection he afforded to sugar was largely appropriated to that end.  When he was making that calculation in his costings, did he take into consideration the wages that were to be paid to the agricultural labourers who were going to raise the beet, or did he leave the costings of that portion to the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price to be paid for the beet was taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this scheme was first adumbrated it was explained that the old scheme was a direct subsidy and that the new scheme was that everyone was going to be asked to make a contribution, and by raising the price of sugar, increasing the efficiency of manufacture and reducing the price of beet, a joint contribution was going to be made to make it possible to manufacture the sugar without any contribution from the central exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was concerned in the price that the Executive Council would <Col N="419" /> permit to be charged for this commodity. He was concerned to investigate the efficiency in the industrial units that would manufacture the commodity.  Did his interest go further than that, and did he look into the costings of the production of beet in order that a fair contribution from the beet growers might be fixed upon when the reduction in the price of beet was under contomplation?  If he did, I want to ask him this question: Why did he insist&mdash;I think he was right when he was insisting upon this &mdash;upon trade union wages inside the factory if he was not prepared to go on and say, &ldquo;A scheme in the promotion of which I am concerned will also provide a similar standard of living for the agricultural labourers who produce the beet?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You have secured for the labourers who manufacture the beet trade union wages and conditions which will, say, afford them a wage of approximately £2 or 50/- for a 44-hour week. But the men who are producing the beet itself, an essential element in the operation of producing the sugar, are getting, with the approval of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, 25/- per week for a 54 or 60-hour week.  How do the Government stand over that differentiation between two bodies of employees, both engaged in an essential part of a scheme for the costings of which the Government themselves are responsible? Surely the time has come when the Minister should press upon his colleagues the absolute necessity of so revising that scheme as to ensure that labourers employed in the production of beet will get just as good a show as the labourers employed in the manufacture of the sugar.  I put that suggestion to the Minister in all sincerity because I think it is a gross injustice that you should have an agricultural labourer, who is unorganised and comparatively defenceless, working under conditions which approximate to slavery, while his organised neighbour, who is working inside the factory, is getting a decent wage.</P>
    <P>The inability of the agricultural <Col N="420" /> labourer to organise effectively should commend his cause to the Executive Council and should make them peculiarly solicitous to secure his rights.  Unless the Executive Council are prepared to exert themselves to that end there is no bottom to the depth to which the agricultural labourer can be pushed in order to leave, out of the 37/6 per ton which has been given for beet, some margin of profit to the farmer.  There is only one way out of this problem and that is to provide for the farmer a higher price for his beet on condition that he will give to the labourers producing it a reasonable rate of wages. I am perfectly satisfied that there will be no difficulty whatever in securing that if the Government will secure for the farmer a price which will make it possible for him to pay the labourer such a wage as this House would wish him to get.</P>

      <P>That question I understand was to put the Minister for Agriculture by Deputy Dillon on the Vote for the Minister's Department, but, of course, Deputy Dillon could not sit in to hear the Minister's reply.

      <P>I just rise to point out to Deputy Dillon that in determining the finances of the beet sugar scheme the Government assumed the payment of rates of wages in the sugar factories in future similar to those which had prevailed in the Carlow factory in the past, and the payment of wages to agricultural workers continuing as at the date on which the decision to extend this sugar manufacture was taken.  I do not think it is practicable to devise any scheme and to operate and supervise a scheme designed to secure that agricultural workers employed upon beet production will be paid at substantially higher rates than agricultural workers engaged on any other form of agricultural production, I take it that what Deputy Dillon is contending is that the general level of agricultural wages is too low, irrespective of whether the labourers are <Col N="421" /> employed on beet production or wheat production or any other form of agricultural production.  I am inclined to agree with him on that.  The task, however, of securing an all-round increase in the wages of agricultural workers is not going to be an easy one, and I invite the Deputy on some occasion to give us the benefit of his suggestions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that to draw an analogy between the situation with which he found himself confronted in Carlow with the old factory and the situation which obtains now is quite fallacious? The Carlow factory was a purely experimental undertaking and his predecessors in office took the view that the thing was absolutely uneconomic and unworkable and determined to go no further with the development of beet sugar manufacture in this country.  His Government took a diametrically opposite view and determined to make sugar manufacture from beet a permanent factor in the body politic in this country.  Now, when the Minister determined to do that he must accept responsibility for making the thing a fair proposition. He did not attempt to make it an economic proposition.  He jettisoned all hope of that, but he ought to have ensured that everybody would get a fair crack of the whip out of it.  If he did not, the scheme is a rotten one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the scheme covers the beet from the moment of planting until it comes out as sugar into a bag.  If his scheme, costing, as it does, the community over £1,000,000 per year, provides a decent livelihood for only 20 per cent. of the people affected by it, surely he cannot maintain for a moment that it is a defensible scheme. Surely the responsibility devolves upon him, who fathered it, to devise a method by which all the people who are affected by this enormous expenditure of public money will get a fair deal.  It is unreasonable for him to say: &ldquo;You who decided that the plan is uneconomic and determined to oppose it and to turn your back upon it must propose to me a plan for <Col N="422" /> making my scheme effective although you warned me when I first embarked upon it that it would not work.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £470,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935 to increase the Agricultural Grant (No. 35 of 1925; No. 28 of 1931 and No. 1 of 1935).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate involves no new expenditure and its presentation is purely formal.  As is indicated on its face prominently, the Estimate is in substitution of the Supplementary Estimate for the same amount passed on the 18th December, 1934.  At that date the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1935, had not become law.  The further amount to be provided for relief of rates by the Act was fixed at £470,000, and it was considered desirable that this additional money should be made available before the Dáil rose for the Christmas Recess.  A Supplementary Estimate for the amount was accordingly passed on 18th December, 1934. When, however, that Estimate was being framed, the statute authorising the expenditure of the additional money, not being law at the time, could not be quoted in the ambit (Part I) of the Estimate.  Moreover, the effect of the Act was to amend the Acts of 1925 and 1931.  Accordingly, to meet that situation all references to statutes were excluded from the ambit <Col N="423" /> of the Supplementary Estimate, with the result that the purpose of the Estimate was &ldquo;to increase the Agricultural Grant&rdquo; without qualification as to the manner of distribution of the money.</P>
    <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1935, is now law, and it has been thought necessary to introduce the present revised Estimate containing in the ambit the former references to the Acts of 1925 and 1931 with the addition of the Act of 1935.  An appropriate reference to the Act of 1935 is also now made in Part III. The effect of the quotation of the statutes in the ambit of the Estimate is definitely to restrict the expenditure of the money provided by the Oireachtas to the specific method of distribution laid down in the statutes.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for an advance to the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will enable a further payment to be made to local authorities on foot of local taxation grants absorbed in the Guarantee Fund in meeting arrears of land purchase annuities since funded under the provisions of the Land Act, 1933.  The original Estimate for this service for 1934-35 was a sum of £300,000.  Taking account of the £300,000 voted in this year's original Estimate, the Exchequer has already paid out in respect of funded arrears a sum of £1,916,000 which, with the sum of £250,000 that the Dáil is now being asked to vote, makes a total of £2,166,000.  The Land Act, 1933, provided for the funding of all arrears of annuities in respect of the period of three years ended with the May-June gales of 1933.  The arrears under the Act of 1891, and subsequent Land Acts, so funded total £4,218,000 approximately.  Of this amount £1,844,847 6s. 10d. relates to arrears on foot of the May-June, 1933, gales, <Col N="425" /> which were made good from the Vote for 1933-34 for the Land Commission. The balance, £2,373,253 2s. 1d., represents the funded arrears already made good by means of local taxation grants absorbed in the Guarantee Fund.  In respect of these funded arrears amounting to £2,373,253 2s. 1d. a sum of £1,916,000 as indicated above has already been advanced from the Exchequer, leaving a balance of £457,253 2s. 1d.</P>
    <P>Prior to the funding operations, these arrears have been made good at the expense of the local authorities by means of draws on the Guarantee Fund and during the progress through the Oireachtas of the Land Bill of 1933, the Minister in charge indicated that recoupment would be made to the local authorities from time to time. No specific provision for such recoupments was made in the Act, but as mentioned in June last year, it has been the intention of the Department of Finance that payment would be made as and when the finances of the local authorities appeared to require it, and the Exchequer's position permitted it.  Such recoupment is in fact the reason why funding annuities are payable to the State to be appropriated as public revenue.  It is common knowledge that the finances of many county councils continue in an unhealthy condition due to the large volume of uncollected rates and the absorption of local taxation grants in the Guarantee Fund on account of land annuities in arrear this year. It is in these circumstances that the present Estimate for £250,000 is being brought before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that in regard to funded arrears of land annuities, there has been already made good to local authorities a sum of £1,900,000.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we should like to have that further explained. My recollection of the matter was that there was a sum of £300,000 made available last year and that, in so far <Col N="426" /> as funded arrears and remitted debts of annuities were concerned, a sum of £1,900,000 has been made good to the county councils under that heading. There is the further sum of £250,000 at the present time which will fill only a very small portion of a very big gap.  I understand that the loss to county councils generally will be round about 35 per cent. of their grants&mdash;from 30 to 37 per cent. &mdash;and this will only go a very small way to meet it.  I think if the Minister really considers that there is such a large sum of money due to local authorities as he has mentioned just now by way of the funded arrears of the remitted annuities, now would be the time to make that good to some extent.  I do not at all anticipate&mdash; if the county councils continue to lose, at the rate at which we are officially informed they are losing&mdash;they will be enabled to continue their administration by the distribution of this £250,000.  In a question which I put down to-day I asked the Minister to state upon what basis this distribution was to be made and I asked him also on what basis the distribution of £300,000 was made last year.  The Minister did not tell me on what basis they were made.  He said that a statement of the amounts paid to each county council was being prepared and that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to adjustments that were necessary in connection with draws upon the Guarantee Fund, at March, 1934, regard was had to the amount of the annuities funded in each county.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a rumour abroad part of the time&mdash;I do not know how correct it was and I hope it was not correct &mdash;that the county councils were really considered on their overdrafts.  I know there was an intimation from the Local Government Department that these allocations could not be used for overdraft accommodation, and I certainly would not hold with giving money according to overdrafts because it would be putting a premium on inefficiency.  With regard to this present vote of £250,000, if the Minister allocated £300,000 last year on a proper <Col N="427" /> basis, he should be able to tell us what the basis of allocation this year is to be.</P>
    <P>Generally, I should like to know from the Minister if a distribution of £1,900,000 has been made by way of meeting the funded arrears, or, generally, where it has gone, or when it has been allocated, and in what way, unless the Minister means that the additions to the Agricultural Grant in the ordinary way have been made in respect of that. If that is so, I do not think that there is any credit to the Minister for it, or any credit to his Government, because, as a matter of fact, they lessened the Agricultural Grant when they came into office.  Accordingly, I do not think that there is any credit to them for anything they have done at the present time by way of funded annuities or paying back to the county councils in that way, and I think that something more ought to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a rather misleading statement for the Minister to speak of this sum of £1,900,000 being voted to local councils. All that the county councils have got in respect of arrears of annuities, which the Ministry, in the Bill that was introduced here, either funded or wiped out, is the sum of £550,000&mdash; £300,000 last year and £250,000 now. That is all the hard cash they have got. The arrears amounted, probably, to £100,000 more than that.  The Ministry, when they came along and said, &ldquo;We are going to wipe out arrears over a certain period,&rdquo; must have remembered that they were wiping out a debt that was due to another person than themselves; and this is tardy recognition of the fact.  If the funded arrears represent an asset&mdash;and apparently, in the minds of the Ministry, they do&mdash; they have got no right to hold that asset while people who have contributed towards its making up are left without the money.  At least £660,000 has been deducted from the Agricultural Grant over a period, and now all that has been returned is £300,000 last year and £250,000 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated, in the course <Col N="428" /> of his remarks that the money would be distributed according as the county councils required it or as the Exchequer position permitted it.  The Exchequer position does permit it at the moment, and certainly, from all one can read or hear of, the county councils require the money.  It seems very strange that, at a time when they are in much need of money, two separate distributions of this money should take place, and it is difficult to follow what the policy of the Ministry is when they tell the county councils that this money is to be utilised in the reduction of overdrafts.  The word &ldquo;overdraft&rdquo; is capable of a great many explanations and a great many variations in the way in which it can be described. If a county council requires £20,000, or gets £20,000 in the reduction of its overdraft, and if it has to increase the overdraft in the following week by that amount of money in order to keep the social services going, is it not a joke to describe it in the way it has been described here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that county councils, in making up their estimates and striking the rates, take into account all matters, including the overdraft. Was it intended that this sum of money should not be taken into account when making up the estimates or striking the rates?  From the way we have heard it described here&mdash;that it was to go in the reduction of the overdraft&mdash;it would appear as a kind of asset that was not to be taken into account in the general balance sheet of the local authorities.  The Minister referred to the fact that £448,000 was deducted from the Agricultural Grant last year.  Now, that money was for a particular purpose.  It was to have been utilised in connection with unemployment insurance, and it was stated that it would relieve local authorities by reason of the fact that their home assistance charges would not be so great.  Now, it was not used during the year.  Consequently, it came in as a sort of credit to the Exchequer. Surely, the time when local authorities find it difficult to collect rates is the time when some consideration ought <Col N="429" /> to be given by the Ministry in helping them.  The rate position, at the present moment, is not satisfactory in any part of the country, and the county councils have not at their disposal what the Ministry has.  The Ministry must have found some difficulty in collecting land annuities even with all the forces and resources at their disposal. Certainly, they cannot blame rate collectors for not being able to do any better than they did themselves, and it is quite possible that the rate collectors have done better.  At any rate, this sum is not a sufficient sum.  It does not make it what the Government or what the Exchequer hope to gain from the funding of those annuities, plus the amount that was wiped out, and the Minister ought to consider getting a Vote of the full amount that was either funded or wiped out so as to leave these county councils no cause for complaint.</P>

I do not see any difference between them, because <Col N="430" /> if a man gets a sum of money in ordinary business, and if he is unfortunate enough to have an overdraft that goes to the reduction of the overdraft. It helps him with his credit, if he wants another overdraft, when he has paid off so much.  This is some of the funded money.</P>

In this financial year we will have £300,000, plus £250,000, that is £550,000, and that will liquidate, I believe, about 75 per cent. of the amounts that will have to be deducted from these county councils as a result of the non-payment of land annuities.</P>

      <P>With regard to overdrafts, which are causing a heavy load of additional expenditure on local authorities, and on which very heavy interest has to be paid, it is a counsel of perfection to say that if county councils could do without overdrafts they could reduce the rates.  As they have to provide for the payment of interest, they should try, as far as they can, to avoid overdrafts.  The reduction of overdrafts means reduction of expenditure. I suppose it is a sign of the credit or good standing of a body when they are able to get overdrafts.  Many people in business think it good business to work on overdrafts.  I do not regard it as good business on the part of local authorities.  They should provide, as far as they can humanly do so, for expenditure during the current year out of revenue, and make provision accordingly.  I know that in times like the present, when rates are not being paid as promptly as they should be, and when land annuities are not being paid, it is particularly difficult for county councils to foresee what their actual financial position is going to be.  As to land annuities, they cannot know the actual sum affected.  This year some of them have been badly hit, but they are getting back from the Exchequer assistance which amounts to 75 per cent., at any rate, of what landholders in each county have failed to pay.  The distribution of the £300,000 was made on the basis of the payments to the credit of county councils in the way of land annuities in previous years. The same basis will be used in the distribution of the £250,000.</P>

      <P>That a further Supplementary sum not exceeding £130,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for Export Bounties and Subsidies, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second Supplementary Estimate in this financial year for export bounties and subsidies.  The original sum provided for export bounties and subsidies on agricultural products in 1934-35 was £2,130,000.  A Supplementary Estimate was taken in December last for £763,000, which included £738,000 for bounties and subsidies on agricultural products. The aggregate provision at present available is £2,868,000, but a further sum of £130,000 is now required, as it is anticipated that the total expenditure from the Vote on export of agricultural produce will by the 31st March next have reached practically £3,000,000&mdash;to be exact £2,997,000.  The increased provision is due to increases on foot of dairy produce, dead poultry, cattle and calf skins. Deputies may claim that a second Supplementary Estimate would not be necessary if there had been good estimation at the beginning.  It should be appreciated that it is very difficult to estimate for export bounties, because exports vary during the year, not so much now under quotas, but it is sometimes necessary to make changes to meet a certain situation.  At the time the first Supplementary Estimate was prepared a number of changes in the rate had just been made, but it was at <Col N="434" /> least four or five weeks before these changes became operative, and certain claims had to be dealt with.  Claims are sometimes a month in arrear.  In fact we may take it that on the average payments are a month in arrear before the different requirements are fulfilled which entitle persons to claim.  It is anticipated that the expenditure will coincide with the Estimate, so that the total for the export bounties will be £3,000,000. This Supplementary Estimate is for a sum of £130,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not given us very much information regarding this matter. There are many things we would like to know about these export bounties and subsidies.  The Minister was unusually brief in telling us as to how he is going to administer them.  We have had complaints all over the country about the payment of them.  We have had complaints and allegations with regard to the licences under this system.  I do not know what the Minister thinks about the position with regard to these licences, or what he knows about it.  If he knows as much as the people who attend the cattle market, then he ought to do something to remedy the state of affairs that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that export licences have been offered for sale in the cattle market as if they were gilt-edged securities.  Indeed, some people are amazed that they have not appeared in the stock exchange quotations.  I think the Minister and his Department ought to see that only those entitled to get licences will get them. I really do not like saying much about them, because to my mind this is about the grossest piece of work that ever was perpetrated in the country&mdash;the grossest injustice.  It is bad enough to be getting a bad price for our cattle, to have lost our market, and to be paying a penal tariff of from £4 to £6 to Britain, but what are we to think when we have people going about offering export licences for sale &mdash;blood suckers and parasites cadging them about the cattle market, and <Col N="435" /> remember that it is the producer who is losing all the time.  In my opinion there is something very loose about the administration.  When some cases came into court the references made to these bounties were not very complimentary to the Department.</P>
    <P>I hope an effort will be made by the Minister and his colleagues in the Executive Council to end the state of affairs that makes this Vote necessary. We have those export bounties, and apparently they have been carried on the backs of live stock exported to countries where there are no tariffs against us at all.  There has been a good deal of gossip&mdash;some rather shady things spoken of&mdash;about cattle that went to Germany, the sums that were paid for them, and the way the bounties were paid.  I think the Minister will agree that the sooner he endeavours to end the situation that makes the payment of bounties and subsidies necessary the better, because fundamentally the thing is wrong.  I agree that in any country in which an effort is being made to control a situation such as we have here, there may be a necessity from time to time to have in operation a scheme for the payment of bounties and subsidies, but what I want to emphasise is that no country can possibly continue to subsidise its main industry.  It simply cannot be done. The main industry represents the greater part, and it cannot be subsidised out of the lesser.  I think it is time for the Minister to realise that the country is demanding some legislation or some settlement that will put our main industry in such a position that it will be able to pay its way. It cannot pay its way if bounties and subsidies are to be a general feature of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the position that it is only the export portion that is being subsidised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately that is so, but the remainder is being sold at home at an even greater loss.  If we have to go on subsidising the main industry of the country then Deputy <Col N="436" /> Moore and others who may be connected with business as well as every other class in the community will have to come down to the level of what agriculture can afford.  All will have to come down&mdash;the labourer, the workman and the manufacturer.  The purchasing power of all is bound to find its level through the main industry and it is going to stick there. As Deputy Moore has pointed out, it is only the export portion of our main industry on which the bounties are payable, but as I have said the remainder is sold at home at a greater loss to the producer.  If there is any Minister who ought to be anxious to see an end to the present situation it is the Minister for Agriculture because he is supposed to be the watch-dog of the farmers.  At least he ought to be. It is his job.  If agriculture goes down, it does not matter how he may endeavour to place the responsibility for that on other people's heads; he will not be able to do it.  It is his job.  What is he doing about it?  Even if the Minister were able to purify the system in operation in connection with bounties and subsidies, the situation still would not be right.  The whole system is a hateful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has failed to recognise the fundamentals of our main industry. I am sure there are many Deputies on the Government Benches who see as well as I do that there is no use in endeavouring to carry on a short-sighted policy of the kind we have in operation.  Deputies must take the long view.  Any man can enjoy a period of high living for a short time if he realises all his available assets.  He can live and enjoy himself well while the money lasts.  That is what we are doing.  We are shelling out money on export bounties and subsidies, on doles and free beef, but where is it all coming from?  It is all coming out of the main industry of the country.  We are drawing upon our resources, we are realising our assets and we are going down.  The sooner we realise that the better.  I hate to talk about this in a party spirit.  The position is too serious for that.  If the Minister thinks that he can subsidise the main industry of the country out <Col N="437" /> of itself, then I tell him it cannot be done.  The sooner the Minister endeavours to end the present situation the better for himself and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is some slight confusion in Deputy Brennan's argument.  Deputy Brennan said that the situation is fundamentally wrong, that agriculture, being the main industry, cannot be subsidised out of the other and smaller industries.  That statement induced me to interrupt and inquire whether it was not exportagriculture only that was being subsidised. Deputy Brennan agreed that that was so but, nevertheless, he continued his argument on the line on which he had started&mdash;that agriculture as a whole was being subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Agricultural produce as a whole is being sold at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the two things should be treated separately. If the people of Ireland are getting agricultural produce below the cost of production or below the point at which there is a reasonable profit to the producer, that is one problem&mdash;an entirely separate problem from the problem of export.  No Minister and no Government can regulate the prices for exported goods.  Deputy Brennan is not facing the issue, because if he and his Party were to come back to power to-morrow they would find that a great deal of the agricultural produce of the country would still have to be exported.  In practically all cases, unless world conditions changed, the price obtainable for that exported produce would be less than the cost of production.  If the giving of bounties and subsidies be fundamentally wrong, then Deputy Brennan and his Party, if they were in power, would have to find a substitute for that system.  The Deputy has not suggested a substitute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Brennan holds that subsidies and bounties are fundamentally wrong, he would have to find a substitute for them in, at least, the case of butter.  He has not suggested what that substitute would be.  I do not like the licensing arrangement which is an adjunct of the bounty and subsidy system.  Nobody likes it.  It is quite likely that the Department of Agriculture will have to find some means, other than the licensing scheme, of paying bounties and subsidies.  How ever, no better system than the bounty system has been suggested, and it has enabled the export of agricultural produce to continue.  It is a pity that we must export produce at prices that do not pay us, but many countries are in the same position.  The situation is one for which we are not responsible. It is a situation which may not be remedied in our time.  There is no sign of any remedy.  There is every sign that competition in those things that we have for sale will be intensified. Until a better system than the system in force is suggested, we must support that system.  It has been a great encouragement to the people to have those subsidies and bounties, and it has enabled us to tide over the very serious position that prevailed with regard to agricultural production without a serious crisis.  It is admitted, I think, that the situation is not satisfactory to farmers or even to the community, but, failing an improvement in world conditions and failing a suggestion as to a better system, we shall have to give our support to the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any of us will envy the Minister in having to face up to his share of the responsibilities of the so-called economic war. <Col N="439" /> Never before in this House have the figures been put so clearly by the Minister.  He has given us figures amounting to £3,000,000, being the sum required to pay subsidies and bounties. That is rather a sacred figure, seeing that it is the figure on which so much of the dispute depends.  I think that we would not gain anything by taking Deputy Moore's view&mdash;that we should examine this matter in a broad way instead of bringing it down to the point at which the Minister had it when he started out to provide bounties and subsidies for present needs. The bounties and subsidies are voted by this House to meet the tariffs.  The proper angle from which to regard the matter is as to how far they are effective in meeting the need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have stated in this House that the bounties are no use whatsoever.  I do not think that anybody who is familiar with the situation, anybody who is exporting, would, in his calmer moments, agree with that.  But the question is whether the people who have to shoulder the burden of these tariffs are getting the full benefit of the bounties.  Part of the Minister's explanation in introducing this Vote was that there was an increase in respect of dairy products, eggs and dead poultry. That is an end of the agricultural economy which must be provided for. But, to most of us, the big end is the cattle end so far as these bounties and subsidies are concerned.  The Minister did not tell us that previous to this year he had three rates of bounty on cattle.  The top rate was 35/- and that was payable where the tariff was £6.  Then, there was a £1 rate as against the £4 tariff and a 15/- rate as against the 50/- tariff.  The Minister has done away with those rates as from the 1st of January of this year.  The only bounty being paid on cattle at present is £1 on maximum-tariffed cattle. That is to say, £1 as against the tariff of £6.  Looking at the matter from the farmer's point of view, how are these bounties meeting the tariff? Perhaps I shall be pardoned for relating <Col N="440" /> a personal experience.  I do not stand up to say that I have been badly treated in this matter.  I suppose I have got as many licences as I was entitled to for the cattle I exported, according to the Minister's system.  I am not making any point about that. I had two licences a month ago and I exported two fat beasts.  On them I paid £6 per head, which was £12. As the Minister says, it takes about a month to examine the returns and pay the bounty.  On last Saturday I got an order for £2.  I paid £12 in tariff and, to meet that, I received £2.  On those figures, I do not think it will be suggested that we are getting a fair share of the bounties in respect of the cattle.  It is absurd to say that we are being helped to the fullest extent when we are getting only one-sixth of what we have to pay in tariffs.  There is another point which has been emphasised in many quarters, by many county councils, many public bodies, and many farmers' associations, and that is the whole system of licensing.  It seems absurd in many cases that those bounties go to help the man who does not produce the stuff.  In reality, the system is not helping either the person who produces, or the person who exports.  The middleman, somehow or other, gets the benefit in a way that no one seems able to explain.  A good many strange things go on.  Let me give an illustration.  Some time ago there were three men in the vicinity of Dublin market.  One man had a bullock, another had a licence, and the third man had some money.  The man with the money gave £5 to the man for the licence and gave £7 to the other man for the bullock and then proceeded to export it.  That may be an exceptional case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>The price may be exceptional.  It is not always that £5 can be got for a licence but, all the same, it is gilt-edged.  I knew one man who came into our market after having paid £100 for fifty licences.  How could he afford to pay the maximum price to the producers?  He would have to <Col N="441" /> buy so much cheaper.  These things ought not to be.  If we are going to fight in this matter surely the sinews of war ought to be given to the men in the front-line trenches.  Somehow or other the licences find their way to men who neither produce beasts nor export them.  I do not know how that system works, but that is how it is administered.  It is only natural, as Deputy Moore pointed out, quite candidly, that when these animals are being sold at less than the cost of production the people who do the work should kick against such a system.  The Minister should see how far he can put the licences into the hands of the people who produce the animals and who should at least get the full benefit of those export bounties.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be far more honest to deal with licences in a systematic way so that they should not get indiscriminately into the hands of persons who cannot use them, and who just merely turn them into cash. There is another way to meet the administration of the bounty in respect to beef cattle&mdash;paying a subsidy on the weight of the animal.  In that connection, instead of paying a round figure on a beast, whether 6 cwt. or 15 cwt., to pay, for example, 2/6 a cwt. as bounty on the animal would seem a more equitable way to meet that situation.  Deputy Moore says that a great many countries are like ourselves, exporting at a loss.  Still, I do not think there is any country acting as we are.  We all may have, at times, to sell at a loss in order to get clear: but there is no country, within the ambit of our knowledge, that first of all raised a barrier against itself in a quarrel of about £3,000,000, and then raised from its legislation £3,000,000 to meet that, and only allowed one-sixth of it to go to the benefit of the sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point that calls for consideration is the cost of production. At the present moment, those who look to the soil, like the tillage farmer, raise their crops and feed their stock. In this country the only economic course to follow is that what we produce <Col N="442" /> must be fed to live stock.  But the whole course of things at present is tending to raise the cost of production at one end and to reduce the actual price at the other.  As I say, I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister in the position he finds himself but, so far as the granting of licences and the putting on of those export bounties and subsidies are concerned, the system calls for reform and that immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes one about these bounties is that though the amount provided for bounties this year is greater than last year, or the year before, yet, as far as one can see, there is not the same bounty paid.  Last year we had bounties paid against a high tariff and two lesser tariffs.  The highest bounty was 35/-, and then we had the £1 and 15/- bounty.  Now we have only £1 on cattle as against 35/- last year. The amount in bounty last year was only slightly over £2,000,000.  Now it is about £3,000,000 this year.  Where has the extra £1,000,000 gone to, seeing that the bounty on exported cattle has diminished?  There is one thing that we are beginning to see.  The Government argued for two or three years against a certain principle which they now have to serve, and the Minister is driven to service of it in this mode. Deputy Moore talked in an irrelevant manner about the depreciation of agriculture, and said that we were all in the same boat.  That kind of talk is good enough for a political platform, but when we come to talk business in a parliamentary chamber there is no use in putting forward statements of that kind.  We know that there has been depression in the world for the last ten years due to financial and economic causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But whatever general depression there is in the world there is on top of that, and the Minister has had to admit it by the efforts which he is making to alleviate or ameliorate the position by these bounties, the special depression produced here by the economic war.  I asked a question here of the Minister on the 18th December.  In effect, I asked&mdash;I have not the question, <Col N="443" /> but the Minister will remember it from a summarised description&mdash; whether he was not aware that the farmers were bearing the cost of the economic war, and whether he would not consider the setting up of a tribunal to inquire into that position.  He said he did not agree that the farmers were bearing any more than their share of the economic war, and that, consequently, there was no need for the tribunal asked for; but he is recognising it now.  He will not attempt to deny the figures given by the British Chancellor, and I will go so far as to say that he is not able to deny them. He is not able to accept or reject the figures of the British Chancellor.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that there is no bookkeeping in this country&mdash;and it should not be very difficult&mdash;which accounts for what the British deduct in special tariffs on our goods sent over there, and I will go so far as to say that if the British said they collected only £1,000,000 in tariffs, we are not in a position to contradict them.  The British have said that they collected £4,500,000 or a little more, last year.  I presume that the same will be collected this year.  That is the depression&mdash;that sum of £4,500,000 which is not a tariff in the ordinary way but which is a levy on our produce after that produce is sold in a world market.  It is a levy on the general price of our goods.  The Minister puts against that £3,000,000 this year.  I presume the same will be collected by the British by way of the levy in the current year and the Minister is putting £3,000,000 against that.  On his own showing, that sum of £3,000,000 is to relieve a certain situation.  The same situation existed last year and the Minister gave only £2,000,000.  A similar situation existed the year before for nine months and the Minister gave only £622,000.</P>
    <P>It is nearly three years ago&mdash;July, 1932&mdash;since the British declared that they would collect these moneys from our produce, which meant from agriculture, from the farmers.  At a farmers' meeting, I put it to them that as the British were going to collect <Col N="444" /> that debt from the farmers, that should be the end of the debt and it should be considered paid then.  The Government at that time were in what approximated to agreement with that view.  I regret very much that at that period people who claimed to speak for the farmers opposed that view. They have changed their minds recently and I heard of that change of mind in this House last week.  They have now come to the view&mdash;two and a half years late&mdash;that when the British collected their special duties, the farmer's debt was liquidated and the Government is coming near that position also.</P>
    <P>Presumably, the British will collect £4,500,000 this year.  As a set-off against that, assuming that the principle of giving the money by way of bounties is the best way&mdash;and we will come to that later&mdash;the Minister is parting with £3,000,000.  The people have to pay the £4,500,000 to meet a certain charge which is not theirs, and which, no matter whether the British view or the Irish view is correct, is not directly and immediately a farmer's charge or liability. If the British view is right, it is a charge on our Government; if the British view is wrong and the Irish view right, it is not a charge on the Irish Government or on any Irish citizens.  But no matter who is right or wrong, the farmers have to pay £4,500,000 odd.  As a set-off against that, the Minister is giving only £3,000,000 and because people say that they have paid the full annuities, they are imprisoned.</P>
    <P>There is there a discrepancy of £1,500,000 which, on that direct transaction, the farmers lose, and that is £1,500,000 by which the wholesale prices are depressed.  The wholesale prices are depressed by another £1,500,000 on the home market.  That is another £3,000,000.  Let us assume for the moment that this system of bounties is a good way of recouping agriculture for the British special duties.  Has not agriculture a perfect claim to be recouped pound for pound the amount levied on it by the special duties?  I put it to the Minister that <Col N="445" /> it should be his aim, and not only his aim, but, as Minister for Agriculture, his duty, to secure that amount of money.  We will be asked where it will come from.  The total amount will be about £4,500,000.  Our Government is collecting half the annuities, that is £2,000,000.  Our Government is also getting between £600,000 and £1,000,000 local loans paid into the Exchequer every year both by the local authorities and by individuals.  The Government is also levying taxes that would make up, together with the local loans and the annuities the balance of the claim the British Government are making.  Now all that money is going into Revenue and none of it is paid out.  That would amount to a sum that would liquidate the local loans and the pensions&mdash;a sum of £2,000,000.  And you had in addition £2,000,000 for the annuities.  There are £4,000,000 which the Government has in hand to pay out £4,500,000 in bounties.</P>
    <P>In 1931-32 when the present Government came into power, the income from Customs was a little over £7,700,000.  Now it is £10,500,000, or at least it was that much last year.  That is a further imposition on agriculture. In these last figures you have an increase of £2,500,000 and most of it comes out of the agricultural industry. Even if you take only 60 per cent. of it as coming out of the agricultural industry you have £1,500,000.  All taken together that would give you £5,500,000.  Then there is the £4,500,000 which the British are collecting.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to meet the farmers fairly they would meet every grievance that is reasonably felt by agriculture.  The only thing then that would remain as far as agriculture was concerned would be the settlement of the economic war.  But the economic war is a big national issue and I admit that it has been decided by a general election.  I must admit that the electorate as a whole gave the Government a mandate for that economic war.  Having got that mandate the people must abide by the consequences. Even though our Party was beaten we must bear with it, for <Col N="446" /> if people are not prepared to work in that way they must be prepared for anarchy and chaos.  But I say this, that whenever any one section of the people is suffering loss, their losses should be recouped to them by the people as a whole seeing that it is not any one section but the people as a whole who are responsible for the economic war.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept the bounties as the best way to meet the situation, if our Government gave £ for £, agriculture would not have any particular grievance. But are bounties the best way?  I doubt if bounties get right down to the producers.  I know there was a time when the bounties were really harmful.  That was when the British purchasers manipulated the market in Birkenhead and took counter-steps to every step taken here in the way of an advance in the bounties.  I was speaking recently to a number of exporters and they said that money given in bounties was lost money part of the time, especially in the beginning.  Even now they would not say whether it would be any loss to the farmers if the bounties were reduced.  Personally I do not know enough about the trade to say whether the system of bounties is the best way of disbursing the money.  A very thorny point has been raised by previous speakers.  That is the matter of licences.  It is certainly a disgrace &mdash;in saying this I am not making any personal references&mdash;but it is a disgrace to the Minister to see the way the licences have been handled.  People with cattle for sale cannot get a licence.  But people with cattle for sale can buy licences off a drover in the Dublin cattle market.  I am sure the Minister knows all about that.</P>
    <P>Every Bill introduced in the last couple of years in connection with agriculture bristled with pains and penalties.  The Bacon and Pigs Bill which would keep this House occupied until Christmas, is coming up next week and all over it there is running pains, penalties and fines.  Why does not the Minister bring in a Bill here dealing with the handling of the export quotas, and dealing with the <Col N="447" /> manner of handing out export licences?  Why does he not provide pains and penalties for people trafficking in those licences?  Why not, if necessary, make it a criminal offence to negotiate any of those licences?  It is quite easy by a mark or number on the licences to trace the licence to the user.  At all events the user of the licence could be made to endorse it. If he is not the man to whom the licence has been issued then the licence can be withdrawn or cancelled. Why should school teachers, shopkeepers, drovers, and every kind of people except the people who are producing the animals get licences?  Why not give the licences to the people who are producing the live stock and not to people like these?  The Minister should not have tolerated that system for one week.  To-day Deputy Haslett gave instances of what is going on in the whole country in this respect.  I know traders who go down the country to fairs, but they will not go unless they are able to buy a score or two of licences before they start.  Why should they be able to buy a score or two of licences when, as I understand it, the system now is to give the licences to the producer? The producer alone should be given the licences.  It is he who should have been given the licences from the very beginning and I believe, in theory, that is the system now.  It is due to this House and to the country if this House wants the country to have any respect for it and it is due to the Ministry of Agriculture themselves if they want any respect to be felt for them in the country, that the Minister should explain in detail the system by which he allocates these licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under previous Acts which have been passed in this House and in the Bacon and Pigs Bill which is now coming before us, public registers must be kept of the business carried on and anybody can, on paying a fee, come in and inspect these registers. The Minister was asked here <Col N="448" /> why should he not provide a public register in his Department in which would be registered every person who gets a licence for the export of cattle, and then anybody who feels aggrieved can consult that register on the payment of a fee of 1/- or 2/-.  What is the objection to that?  See what it would be worth in restoring some kind of public confidence in the administration.</P>
      <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Haslett pointed out, that a man going to a fair in the Deputy's town may buy 50 licences at £2 each.  He does not lose that £100.  He buys 50 cattle and on each of them he pulls back £2. Where does he pull it from?  It comes from the pocket of the producer, the man from whom he buys the cattle, the man who was responsible for the rearing of that calf until it had reached a more mature stage.  Who is responsible for taking that £2 out of the farmers' pockets?  The Minister for Agriculture, because he has not formulated a proper system for the administration of those licences.  I hope the Minister will deal exhaustively with the question of those licences and their administration. I hope he will be able to submit convincing arguments that his system is a good one.  If he considers it a good system, will he explain how licences can get freely into the hands of people who have no cattle to sell, who never had any, and who are merely trafficking in those licences? I would like him to deal with the suggestion that no licence is transferred. He should make that a condition on issuing a licence.  If a man wants a licence, let him get it by all means, but if he does not want to use it, it should be like a crossed cheque, no good to anybody else; let him send it back to the Minister and have it cancelled. So far as I can see there is hardly any other way in which you will prevent trafficking in licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to state what objections, if any, he has to keeping a public register of licensees. It may be urged that that would be exposing people's business.  It would be very easy to camouflage that if <Col N="449" /> necessary.  On the other hand, it would be no greater exposure of a man's private affairs than the Minister proposes to make in the Pigs and Bacon Bill.  I think if the Minister gives us an assurance on those points he will cover most of the grievances existing amongst the agricultural community to-day.  I am pretty well acquainted with the grievances in the cattle trade.  Has the Minister considered any alternative method of recouping the agricultural community other than by the bounties?  Of course the bounty system is a camouflaged method of paying another debt. I am not going into that.  I recognise that the Government have authority for doing it in this way, but I would like to know if the Minister has considered any other method of meeting the situation as distinct from bounties. If he considers the bounty system the best, then I would like to ask him why he does not make that bounty equal to the product of the British tariff. He can have no objection from the point of view of finance, because the Minister for Finance is making more than the £4,500,000 that the British are collecting out of this dispute and out of consequences and conditions arising from that dispute.  I would like to hear the Minister's plans.</P>

The Minister for Agriculture gets up to-day to tell us what we have been telling him for the past two years; to tell us the very thing that he and his colleagues <Col N="451" /> have been denying off every platform in this country.  The same Minister, who is now looking for £130,000 for additional subsidies, got up in this House last week and said he considered 22/- per cwt. for the best fat cattle in the Dublin market to be so good a price that it was unnecessary to pay any bounty.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister what he paid in the Dublin market for cattle exported to Germany and the Minister replied, &ldquo;I paid 22/-.&rdquo;  I asked did he pay a bounty on these cattle, to which the Minister replied: &ldquo;The price I was getting was too good to make it necessary to pay the bounty.&rdquo; Whatever price the Minister got, he paid the people who sold him the cattle 22/- per cwt.  He gave an undertaking in this House that every penny of the bounty should pass through the cattle dealer to the producer of the cattle.  Here he himself was going out as a cattle dealer to set the example of the way in which the bounty should be used.  It was his duty in that capacity to pay the farmer an economic price for his cattle as compared with the price he was going to get for the cattle in Germany, and to that economic price to add the bounty that we had provided in the Budget and Supplementary Estimates since.  The Minister for Agriculture confesses that the standard he has set for the cattle trade in this country is 22/- per cwt.  He thinks that is so good a price that it would be a shame to contribute one single penny of bounty to increase it.  How on earth can any representations in regard to the fundamental facts of agriculture make any impression on a mind like that?  If a man is so absolutely dead to the elementary needs of the simplest farmers in this country, so absolutely ignorant of the fundamentals of the economics of cattle-raising in this country, how is it possible to illuminate him into a state even of mediocre competency for the position he professes to occupy?</P>

He has heard the allegation made that these licences are being sold <Col N="453" /> in the public market place by persons who had no intention of using them for the purpose of exporting cattle. That charge he has not repudiated or dissented from.  That gives rise to a situation which demands the fullest publicity.  I am perfectly entitled to ask the Minister to place the full facts before the House and the country.  In making that request, I am conscious of the fact that the difficulties of checking statistics of that kind are almost boundless.  It is extremely difficult to track down transactions of that kind. Will the Minister suggest that he will place any information at our disposal which will inform us where these gentlemen to whom Deputy Belton referred got the licences which they were able to traffic in in the Dublin market?  Were these licences issued direct to the drovers, or where did they get them?  Can the Minister make any suggestion?  I am informed that not only are drovers selling licences in the Dublin market but that men are selling licences in the Dublin market who never shipped a beast out of this country in their lives.  Where are those men getting the licences and through whom are they getting them?  Are they walking into the Department of Agriculture and asking the permanent official in charge of that Department to give them licences?  If they are, does any reasonable Deputy imagine that somebody who is in no way connected with the cattle trade can go into the Department and get licences for the asking?  If they are not getting them in that way, who is introducing them to the Department of Agriculture?  I want to say this: If any member of this Party has brought a man into the Department of Agriculture who is in no sense legitimately connected with the cattle trade and secured for him licences for the purpose of selling them for profit I will be glad to have his name published, because I do not want him as a colleague.  I am glad to think that there are men in this Party who have been in the cattle trade and contributed to its prosperity for a long period and who are entitled to licences.</P>

      <P>I would be glad to know if there were, and that the name of that person should be published.  I have asked for a licence in a case where a particular hardship was being inflicted on a hard-working farmer in East Donegal, and I must say that my application, when I put the facts before the Department, was fairly and reasonably considered.  I like to give credit where credit is due.  I know that that man, who did not happen to be a political supporter of mine, got a licence which, according to the letter of the law, he was not entitled to because his was a case of peculiar hardship.  The Minister is faced with the fact that there is indisputable testimony that licences are being bartered on the Dublin market by men who never shipped a beast in their lives.  Where are they coming from? How are they getting into their hands? Is it reasonable to allow a situation like that to continue when Deputies are being approached by <i>bona fide</i> farmers who cannot pay their rates and land annuities because they cannot sell their cattle and they cannot sell their cattle because they cannot get a licence to ship them?  That is certainly creating an atmosphere of distrust and it is something which the Minister should put an end to without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out to you, as Deputy Belton has pointed out to you, that there is a simple way of settling it: get your licences for store cattle and your licences for fat cattle in numbered <Col N="455" /> series in a book and when you issue licences Nos. 1 to 10 to a citizen of the State, put his name down in a register as Patrick Clarke, or whatever the name may be, as having received licences Nos. 1 to 10.  Then you can put down &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo; if he happens to be the next applicant, and let him appear as getting licences Nos. 11 to 20.  Unless that is done, scandals, such as have been mentioned in this House to-day, will continue and public distrust will continue.  It is not relevant to go into the general question of licences and I must confine myself to the licences under the administration of the Department of Agriculture, but all that we have said in regard to the registration of Department of Agriculture licences applies with equal force to licences issued by every other Department of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Estimate provides for bounties on agricultural and industrial commodities. That includes eggs.  At the present time the price obtaining for eggs is lower than has ever been remembered before in the egg trade. At the same time the bounty has been reduced by nearly 50 per cent.  If that continues&mdash;and mind you we are at a period of the year when the tendency for egg prices is to fall&mdash;the egg industry will be wiped out of existence in this country in a very short time.  I do not know why it is but the Department of Agriculture always seem to wait until disaster is upon them before they take any steps whatever to protect an industry of that character.  Somebody must have directed the attention of the Minister to the fact that the price for eggs at present is 5s. to 5s. 6d. per long hundred and that the shipping price is down to 4s. for &ldquo;mediums&rdquo; and less for &ldquo;trade.&rdquo;  Unless the bounty is restored at least to the figure which obtained 12 months ago, people will simply go out of egg production. If they do in any considerable numbers, it will be no small job to recover what is one of the most valuable industries in this country.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are asked to appropriate money for export bounties is <Col N="456" /> in itself evidence that this Government believes that if the economic fabric of the State is to be held together, we have got to retain our foreign markets.  In the words of the Minister for Agriculture himself&mdash;and this is a quotation which I would specially commend to Deputy Smith&mdash;</P>

One of the most formidable Senators of the Fianna Fáil Party emerged in the <i>Western People</i> on the following week with the magnificent advertisement: &ldquo;Let us bury the hatchet.  Best Wigan to be had at MacEllin Brothers, Balla.&rdquo;  I suggest <Col N="457" /> that spirit should spread further through the Fianna Fáil Party, that they should take example by Senator MacEllin.</P>

      <P>I take it when the Minister for Agriculture, who is responsible in these matters, has definitely told his supporters that this is, and will forever be, their best market, the time has come to consider whether the hatchet should not be <Col N="458" /> buried in respect of other things as well as coal.  If it was possible to make a Coal-Cattle Pact, if it was considered worth while to give Britain the monopoly of our coal trade in consideration of an extension of our cattle trade with her, if that was considered on its merits to be a good bargain by the Fianna Fáil Government, surely it will be possible for them, with the support we are quite prepared to give, to do a little better in future.  The lines along which I suggest they should travel is to enter into negotiations for a wider and larger quota for our cattle in Britain.  We have succeeded on foot of that agreement in getting a quota which approximates almost exactly to the entire number of store cattle we exported heretofore.  However, there still remains a very substantial reduction&mdash;37 per cent, I think&mdash;on our quota of fat cattle.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that he and the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to bring pressure to bear on the snag, whatever it may be, with a view to removing it from the path of further negotiation and further settlement along these lines in order to recover for our people the entire quota at least of the 1931 shipments.  If he can get that&mdash;and it is purely, a question of trade negotiation&mdash;a very large part of the sum mentioned in this Estimate will become unnecessary because cattle dealers, and such men as the Minister, will not be free to go in and pay the minimum price in the Dublin cattle market.  The Minister will find when he goes back dealing in the cattle market that he will not be able to buy at 22/- per cwt. because the increased demand for our cattle will raise the price to something closer to the price obtaining in Northern Ireland and Great Britain than at present obtains here.</P>

    <P>We are told that this Estimate is partially for the financing of trial consignments, but we are never given any details of these trial consignments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, I think it will be admitted that it is a little bewildering, when an Estimate is presented in printed form, for the Minister to be free to say at any juncture: &ldquo;Well, part of the printed Estimate simply is not true.&rdquo; It is like the kind of riddle where you are asked some such thing as: &ldquo;What is it that has four legs, barks, and has feathers on it?&rdquo; You are told that the answer to the riddle is that it is a dog, but when you reply that a dog has no feathers, you are told that that was only put in to make it more interesting.  The Minister cannot blame us for failing to understand him if he cannot be more cogent with this House. I take it that the Minister is using some of this money to finance the transactions of the Newmarket Dairy Company.  The Minister referred to certain transactions in respect of eggs which are being shipped to Germany, which transactions are confined to the Newmarket Dairy Company.  I cannot remember his having given the House any particulars of this transaction either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I always listen with great interest to the Minister's speeches, as I say, but I must confess, however, that I find it very difficult to follow the Minister's ratiocinations from day to day and from week to week. Unfortunately, however, the Minister's activities affect the welfare of every individual in this State.  The only consolation is that there is still hope that some day a complete reversal of his activities may result in a change in the fortunes of us all. Deputy Belton spoke of a method whereby the Minister could devise a scheme to ensure that those export bounties would find their way back to the producer.  There is only one way whereby the surplus value of these cattle can find its way back to the producer, and that is to secure a market for them.  If there is a demand for cattle, the farmer will get the full price.  If there is not a demand for cattle, it does not matter what expedients you resort to the farmer will not get the full price for them. Let us not lay the soothing unction to our souls that at the present time the farmer is getting 22/- or 25/- a cwt. from butchers for his beef.  The <Col N="462" /> fact is that I seriously doubt whether any butcher in the City of Dublin to-day, with the exception of two or three limited liability companies, is paying 25/- a cwt. for all the cattle he buys, and I positively deny that butchers are paying 25/- a cwt., or anything like it, to the persons from whom they purchase cattle in the country.  Despite all the inspectors&mdash; and I do not know how many there are&mdash;that the Minister has careering around the country at the present time, there is no means by which they can compel the butcher to pay that price, and there is no means to enable the farmer to hold out for that price unless and until they can secure a market in which the farmers can dispose of their cattle freely.</P>
      <P>The average price being paid for beef in rural Ireland to-day does not exceed, I believe, 15/- a cwt.  Put it at its best, and I would say that it is between 15/- and 16/- a cwt.  I do not believe that the average price being paid for beef in the Dublin market to-day exceeds 18/- or 19/- a cwt.  The impression that the Fianna Fáil Government would desire to create throughout the country is that they are not only securing a minimum of 22/- a cwt., and 25/- a cwt. for domestic consumption, but also providing on top of that a bounty which goes back to the producer of the live stock.  It is astonishing what effective propaganda can put over.  It is amazing the extent to which people can be bewildered and deceived.  I freely confess that in the history of the country, so long as I have been able to study it, no such successful campaign of fraud and deception has ever been carried out on this country before as that which the Fianna Fáil Party has carried out.  I freely confess that you have managed to masquerade as Republicans.</P>

      <P>The Vote before the House is one for export bounties and subsidies and proposes that a supplementary sum not exceeding £130,000 be granted &ldquo;to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment for export bounties and subsidies.&rdquo; On a Supplementary <Col N="463" /> Estimate it is most unusual to attempt to cover the whole field suggested by the original Vote.

      <P>I quite agree that the facts are as put by you, Sir, and demonstrate that I have strayed somewhat from the immediate relevance of this Supplementary Estimate, and I hasten to correct the error.  Certain specific queries have been put to the Minister in regard to his administration, and in regard to the bounties and licences involved therein: The Minister will remember that by his own declaration, and by the declaration of the permanent head of his Department, he has inextricably associated the question of bounties and licences.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember his declaration that if bounties were not used in a certain way by cattle shippers he would see that they did not get them.  The Minister might well make the case that parts of the bounties were not used in a certain way, and were handed to others, but some explanation should be made with regard to the licensing situation; the general attitude towards the bounties question, and what the Minister intends to do in respect of the rate of bounties at present paid on eggs, so that people may have some idea of what the future holds for them.  In <Col N="464" /> regard to bacon, I take it that it would be better to defer the question until we are considering the Bacon and Pork Bill.  When replying the Minister might say whether he intends any part of this money for varying the existing bounties on these commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have explained over and over again how licences are issued.  There is no use explaining to Deputy Dillon, who makes some scurrilous speeches and then goes away to the restaurant or perhaps to write letters.  He does not wait for any reply.  The Deputy likes to hear himself talk.  He does not want to hear anyone else, as long as he can hear himself talk the <i>raimeis</i> that we have to listen to.  A man who talks so much and who knows so little is bound to make mistakes.  I explained over and over again that licences are issued under the basis of the exports for 1933.  An exporter who drew bounties on cattle in 1933 got a certain number of licences in 1934.  A Consultative Council was set up and they agreed that certain areas in Connaught, Kerry, Donegal and a few other places should get special consideration. They got more than they were entitled to.  That was done with the consent of the Consultative Council, and also with the consent of the council, certain men, who, owing to illness or other reasons were not able to export during certain months in 1933, were given licences in 1934, as if they exported right through.  The Consultative Council saw the lists showing how the licences were issued. If there were 40,000 licences, and if you deal with 45, 44 or 43 per cent. for half of a month, inevitably some <Col N="465" /> licences must be left over, perhaps 200, 100 or 50.  These are the only licences over which the Department had any discretion.  These licences are issued from a list which is put up to me of individuals considered to be the most deserving, amongst them being members of this House.  I do not mean that they were given for constituents but sometimes for themselves and for those considered to be deserving of them.  That is why I should like to put to Deputy Dillon this question: How many members of his Party got licences for themselves and not for constituents&mdash;and perhaps of this Party?</P>

      <P>This year, licences were issued to those who drew licences in 1934.  No one is getting a licence who did not ship cattle.  They cannot get licences if they did not draw bounties.  That should cut out people who drew licences and sold them. The licences are not numbered.  Where numbers were sent to us, in which there was traffic, we looked them up and in every single case the particular person concerned will never get licences again.

      <P>I have been told, and I have no reason to doubt it, that licences are being sold.  It is really difficult to stop that.  There are farmers entitled to get licences, who have been visited by inspectors, and perhaps there are three issues of licences before their reports come back.  If a man is to get two licences on the 1st February, two in the middle of February, and two on the 1st of March, perhaps in the meantime be clears the cattle, and when he gets the licence there is no greater temptation, instead of sending them back to the Department, than to sell them for 10/- or 15/-.  He thinks they are his property and he keeps them.</P>

We want to be fair to farmers.  Supposing we give them £3,000,000 out of the £4,500,000, they are losing only £1,500,000, and against that we gave them the land annuities.</P>

    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic <Col N="468" /> war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934/35.&mdash;(Deputies T.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>When moving the adjournment on last Thursday night I was dealing with this important question of the relief of rates.  The five or six minutes at my disposal were hardly sufficient to enable me to deal fully with it.  Therefore, if I to some extent cover ground that has already been gone over I hope the Minister and the House will have patience with me, and that if I quote figures rather extensively they will see the necessity for my doing so in support of the case that I propose to make.  When speaking on the last occasion I explained then that in normal circumstances I would not be in favour of complete derating.  My outlook on the matter is that the security of this State depends on an equitable contribution from all sections.  Hence, I would not be in favour of transferring entirely to the backs of the taxpayers the liability for local services.  But, in present circumstances, I am in favour of complete derating for one year.  I am influenced to a great extent by a statement made by the Minister for Lands at Maryborough on the 10th February.  His statement, as I interpreted it, was to the effect that the non-payment of rates, leaving the local authorities without the necessary finance, would mean the end of all ordered government in this State.  It is to avert what I regard as that impending catastrophe that I support this motion for the relief of rates for the 12 months period 1934-35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I go rather deeply into the history of this grant I hope the House will bear with me, and that it will also grant me its indulgence if I outline in some small way how the local authorities are financed.  The local authorities are financed by a direct levy of local rates, and by supplementary grants from the State.  The first of these grants is called the Agricultural Grant and, as its name implies, its purpose is to relieve agriculture. <Col N="469" /> I do not take it that that is a grant at all.  Prior to the Act of 1898 the local authorities had no claim to full rates from a holder of land.  He was never liable for more than 50 per cent. of poor rate and in many cases considerably less.  Under the Local Government Act of 1898 the State came in to relieve the landlord of all liability.  It took over on itself liability for the landlord's share: that is 50 per cent. of the poor rate to be levied by the local authorities.  That has gone on and has been called the Agricultural Grant.  That obligation was fulfilled up to the time of the Treaty by the British Treasury.  The payment of this grant to the local authorities was a statutory right.  It was not an optional matter with the Ministry. That was proved in a number of cases that went into the courts, but I am going to appeal rather to the sense of justice of Deputies for support for this motion than on quotations from legal decisions in the courts.</P>
    <P>At any rate, one thing is quite clear and it is: that the agricultural ratepayer was never at any time liable for what is called the first Agricultural Grant or for the 50 per cent. relief which it gave.  Therefore, I do not think that at this stage our own Parliament&mdash;and particularly in the case of a statutory obligation of this sort&mdash;or our Minister for Finance, should now be entitled to tear up all the agreements dealing with these grants.  Nobody knows better than the Minister for Local Government that to maintain the standard of public services demanded by the country, and which he has done his best to keep up, is very costly.  It bears very heavily on the ratepayers.  This was fully seen in 1925 when the late Government doubled the Agricultural Grant, the grant which I have referred to as a statutory obligation on the State, equal to a sum of £599,911.  From the point of view of convenience I shall refer to it as £600,000.  In 1925 the late Government doubled that Agricultural Grant, giving, approximately, another £600,000.  But even that was not <Col N="470" /> sufficient.  The irritation caused by the burden that was being placed on the rates was so great that what became known as the Derating Commission was set up to inquire into the whole question.  That Commission unanimously reported against complete derating.  The minority, of which I had the honour to be Chairman, reported that together with doubling the first Agricultural Grant equity demanded for the ratepayer that at least £1,000,000 more should be given from the Treasury.  By no one was that report more enthusiastically supported in this House than by the President of the Executive Council and the Deputies who are now his Ministers.  That was their attitude when in opposition. What is their attitude to-day in circumstances incomparably worse than the conditions then prevailing?</P>
    <P>The collection of the rates is becoming more difficult.  The amounts transferred temporarily, as being uncollectable, are becoming greater.  In these circumstances the Minister for Finance last year deprived us of £448,000 of the doubled agricultural grant.  There was then no trace of an organised attempt not to pay annuities. If I localise this question and deal with it as it affects my own county perhaps the House will grip its effects more accurately.  Last year we prepared our estimate of expenditure.  We passed all the statutory requirements for the local hospitals, road works schemes, the payment of the labourers employed on the roads, etc.  When all that was done and could not be undone, we had notification from the Ministry that they were going to deduct from us as our share of the £448,000 the sum of £56,000.  That was a severe shock to the ratepayers of our county, as the deductions in other counties came as a shock to the ratepayers of those other counties.  At the end of the year, there was deducted in respect of unpaid annuities a sum of £48,000 and, in addition, a sum of £11,000 in respect of probate and death duties, for which we had taken credit, would not be paid.</P>

The Minister who has primary responsibility for the administration of local services, the Minister on whom the welfare of the ordinary person in the country depends, the Minister who is responsible for the maintenance of the services of public institutions, home assistance and so forth ought not to be dominated by mere questions of law when the maintenance of these services is at stake.

The Minister should remember that he and I will have to appear before the court of public opinion on the issue of the maintenance of those institutions on which the welfare of this State depends.  The Government admit that the welfare of the State depends upon <Col N="472" /> them.  If the Minister chooses to be hide-bound by the letter of the law and does not use his powers to try to mitigate the hardship in the case of these institutions, he must accept responsibility for what will follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen no evidence anywhere in County Cork or in the other counties I travelled of a disposition not to pay rates.  I have seen the very poorest men struggle in order to pay their rates.  &ldquo;Whatever about the annuities,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have got to pay our rates.&rdquo;  There was an impulsive Irish feeling in favour of maintaining the people who were not able to maintain themselves.  That feeling was not confined to Cork but was common to the State.  Let me continue the case I was making.  There was an increased liability on us for that year of £115,000.  I admit that the first £56,000 could be foreseen, but the subsequent amount could not and no provision could be made for it.  The county council was enabled to carry on only by the generosity of the bank in increasing their overdraft.  I know that the Minister will point to the sum of £300,000, our share of which was £24,000.  The Minister did not tell us that that £24,000 was in full and complete payment of the cumulative arrears of £63,000 and that we are to expect no more.  That is the story of last year's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is before us this year?  On Thursday last we got notification that we were to have deducted from us a sum of £118,000.  I shall deal with that <Col N="473" /> point briefly.  Leaving aside for the moment the disastrous effects on the rates of the Minister's action in connection with the unpaid annuities, what is the position of the Guarantee Fund to which the Minister has referred?  The Guarantee Fund, as its name implies, was created to repay out of moneys due to the local authorities the principal and interest on bonds held by people who advanced money to the Irish tenant farmer and thus enabled him to buy his land and become the owner of his farm.  The Guarantee Fund was established for that purpose and no other.  When that liability is publicly accepted by another authority, when the two things covered by the Guarantee Fund are being met by another authority and no other obligation is placed on that Guarantee Fund, I question the necessity for a Guarantee Fund at all.  What was the Fund created for?  To repay principal and interest on moneys advanced to the Irish farmer.  That is being met by the British authorities, as has been publicly admitted.  Therefore, the object of the Guarantee Fund ceases.  Does the Minister accept that in answer to his question of a few moments ago?  I go somewhat farther. When the liability which the Guarantee Fund was created to meet is met in the way I have described, it is doubtful whether there can be deductions for any other purpose.  In my opinion, deductions for any other purpose are unjustifiable.  The Minister's exercise of his power does not justify his action.  But the Minister has not yet finished with us.  For the conditions which have been brought about, the activities of the Minister are far more responsible than the activities of the non-paying ratepayer. The Minister sends us Orders by which we are compelled to repay certain borrowed moneys.  We borrowed from the British Board of Works sums of money to build hospitals, cottages and similar structures.  We have those buildings.  In this case there can be no claim of inherited right, as in the case of the annuities.  This was an ordinary contractual obligation between borrower and lender.  We are now fulfilling our obligation.  As the <Col N="474" /> Minister knows, if we do not pay by a certain date, we are charged penal interest and even compound interest in respect of that penal interest.  We transmit to the Minister £67,000 every year in this regard.  Does the Minister transfer that money to the purpose for which it is owing?  On what grounds does he hold it?  As I said, there is no claim of inherited right in this case. It is an ordinary transaction between borrower and lender, but the Minister holds the money and uses it for Treasury purposes.  If, in his opinion, it was not good tactics to transmit the money at the present time to the proper authority, surely, knowing our financially embarrassed position, he might have left it with us.  What is the use of blaming the ratepayer when the Minister acts as he did in this case?</P>
    <P>We hold that the least that might be expected from the Minister would be not to collect that money from us but, above and beyond all, we hold emphatically that the Ministry has no power to devote that money for purposes for which it was never intended.  In many other ways, the Minister has increased our liabilities by indirect taxation, by Customs duties on medicines and requirements for hospitals and by the coal duty of 5/- per ton.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his late activities, by applying protection and by various subsidies is increasing the burden upon the ratepayers.  Then his recent stamp duty is another imposition. All this goes to prove that by every means, such as the withholding our grants and compelling us to pay moneys which are devoted to other purposes than that for which they were intended, and by a load of indirect taxation the burden on the ratepayers is greatly increased.  And although the burden of the local authorities was foreshadowed by the Minister for Lands on February 10th, the Minister for Finance must accept the premier responsibility.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health in his demands for increased services has contributed something; not much.  I support the Minister <Col N="475" /> when his demands are for services that are in the interests of the State. Considering the power of the ratepayers, I shall support him with that limitation.  I say that he and his Department&mdash;I hope he will not take it in any offensive way&mdash;have my most sincere sympathy because the activities of the other Departments of the State are rendering his Department practically impossible to carry on.  I would like to point out to the Minister, as he must be aware, that he has the premier responsibility for the welfare of the local authorities of the country. After all, we are one great unit of which the Minister and his Department are head.  The people in the country are contributing to the work of his Department and the least we may look for is protection from the marauding excursions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The sum of £30,000 was deducted from our grants in 1933-34; £60,000 in 1934-35; and this year the estimate is £80,000.  In his confusion and in his desire to protect himself the Minister for Finance has deducted these sums. What better proof could there be of the inability of the ratepayers to meet their obligations?  These amounts which should have been paid to the local authorities were agreed to by all sections of the community and the Minister's own Department sanctioned them.  What better proof could there be of the need for these grants than the acquiescence of the Minister and his Department and of every member of our County Council that these sums should be transferred?  By his action he has himself agreed that the ratepayers are unable to meet their liabilities. I am aware that the Minister is going to give a supplementary grant of £30,000, little more than one half of a month's requirements.  It will help, but it is very little, considering what the Minister for Finance has deducted in the last two years&mdash;practically £230,000.</P>
    <P>Here is one of my principal reasons for supporting the motion before the House.  The Minister is aware that when these grants are given they are applied altogether to agricultural land. When they are withdrawn the loss falls <Col N="476" /> on the general body of the ratepayers. The people in an urban area are made liable for the unpaid rates and the unpaid annuities in the county.  They have no redress at all.  The taxpayer, even with the least bit of furniture, is liable to have it confiscated for a debt for which he is not liable.  That is quite wrong.  It is quite sufficient for the ratepayers to try to meet the obligations for which they are liable without having to pay the unpaid rates and annuities of other people.</P>
    <P>As I said, one of the reasons why I support this motion is the utter helplessness of the local authorities to protect the ratepayers.  I have dealt with the effect of the deductions made by the Minister for Finance from local authorities, and I have dealt a little with the efforts of the Minister for Local Government to deal with these matters.  I do not want to deal with the general policy of the Minister in depriving people of the power to find redress.  I confine myself merely to pointing out that the only answer we get from the Ministerial benches is their weakness to enforce the payment of rates and annuities.  That is an exaggerated and indeed a nonsensical claim.  All the evidence is to the contrary.  The Government were presented with a petition and a resolution from my own County Council, moved and drafted by a supporter of the Ministry, bearing evidence of the admitted distress of the community. Even in the court yesterday a former Minister for Justice in the present Government bore testimony to the impoverished condition of the people. What further evidence is necessary?</P>
    <P>What is the use in saying there is an organised attempt to withhold the payments of rates and annuities?  I know there was some slight, despairing and futile efforts by some people to resist seeing the danger of their livelihood and the security of their families being swept away.  These indiscretions gave the Ministry a kind of smoke screen to hide behind in order to cover up the disastrous effects of their own policy.  One of the things that we get from the Government Benches when they try to explain away the position is that some people are <Col N="477" /> trying to destroy the credit of this country.  No man can destroy the credit of this country; no politician and no agitator can destroy the credit of this country.  The credit of this country was built up by the generations that went before us, availing to the full of all the opportunities offered by external trade.  The millions invested outside the country, the millions on deposit, the Savings Certificates all guarantee that, as a nation, small as we are, we stand unrivalled in the amount of our assets over liabilities, so do not hurl at us again the accusation that we destroyed the credit of the State. What we are doing is questioning the misery that has been brought on the country.</P>
    <P>As to our internal welfare, there is the embarrassed position of local authorities, the uncertain position of everybody on whom the welfare of this State is built&mdash;farmers, business people and workers, and everybody who in any way contributes to the upkeep of the State.  I do not want to develop that any further, but the Minister, the House and the country thoroughly understand the implication.  Everybody on whom the State is built up is embarrassed. What is it to them individually&mdash;the credited position of the country I refer to?  There is no use telling a business man who has no credit and who is being pressed by people who gave credit to him, that this country is a creditor country and there is no use in telling it to the unfortunate farmer who is bringing home his stock from the fair, with the sheriff waiting for him, and when he cannot get any credit or meet his liabilities.  What does it matter to the worker of a local authority which cannot pay him whether the national budget is balanced or not?  He knows that he cannot balance his own.  Is there any necessity to deal with that any further?  There is not a member of the House, no matter on what bench he sits, who is not as well aware of the facts as I am and who could not tell harrowing incidents as well as I could. Why then cover it up?</P>
    <P>Up to the year 1922 there were no deductions from the agricultural grant. From 1922 to 1932 the amount deducted from my county in respect of unpaid <Col N="478" /> annuities was £13,000.  In the last two years the Minister has deducted £164,000.  There is not a representative of a local authority on any of the benches who is not aware of the impending collapse of local authorities through the activities of the Minister for Finance and the inability of the ratepayers in present circumstances to carry the burden.  Every one of them, it matters not on what bench he sits, will appear before the investigation committees now being got up in every local authority to appeal for mercy for people unable to pay their rates.  It is quite evident and everybody knows it.</P>
    <P>It is only a few short months ago since they all&mdash;we all, if you like, and I am one of them&mdash;appealed to the electors for a mandate to preserve the public services which they require and to preserve the institutions they require.  I challenge any one of them to deny that in present circumstances these institutions cannot be helped and I put it to them: Are they now going to repudiate the undertakings they gave to the electors or are they going to bring pressure to bear on the Minister to give the necessary finances to maintain those local authorities?  I do not wish to delay too long, but as I see the position and from the figures of deductions which I have given&mdash;and I submit no one can challenge the figures&mdash;the Minister has three courses open to him.  The first is to accept the motion.  The second course is the course in respect of which I appeal to the representatives of local authorities who got the confidence of the people in their efforts to preserve the services essential to a civilised State, to bring pressure to bear on the Minister, so that, if he cannot see his way to accept the motion, he will refund the entire grants due to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with as intimate a knowledge as any man in this House can claim, with as keen an association with, and as active an interest in, local government, knows that I have given unstintingly of all I was capable for eight or nine years, since the new state of things arose in this country, and I did it for one reason&mdash;I could not stand under the accusation levelled by others that we were unable to govern ourselves.  I said that it did <Col N="479" /> not suit me to be in public life. Politics had no attraction for me, but the honour of my country appealed to me and when it was hurled at us that we were unable to legislate for or govern our country, I said: &ldquo;It is clearly my duty to go in and do what I possibly can.&rdquo;  The Minister knows well that, for eight years, I have given unremitting attention and I point out to him now, with this knowledge, that there are three courses open to him&mdash;acceptance of this motion, returning to us our grants or the total collapse of the Ministry and the public services committed to his care.</P>

      <P>He has run away, with all the speed of which a man of his weight and years is capable, from his own signature to the report of the commission that sat for a long time to investigate local government in all its aspects and, as he has just told us, decided unanimously against complete derating.  Deputy Broderick agreed on behalf of the County Cork and the farmers of County Cork included most of the ratepayers in that county.  Now, he comes here to <Col N="480" /> tell us that we must derate, knowing, as he does know better than most people and better probably than most people in this House, because of his intimate knowledge of local affairs, that if complete derating is to be adopted as a principle in this country, it would end the system of local government, as we know it.  The Deputy knows that as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Because what I have said has reference to the one year, 1934-35.  I regret that the exceptional circumstances of the moment demand it, but as a policy of derating of national implications, I am totally opposed to it.</P>

A couple of years ago the Deputy signed a report recommending that we should not have derating.

      <P>I should be glad to hear what somersault I made.  I suppose some of the Deputies here read the report of the Derating Commission. Some Deputies, at all events have read it, and any Deputy who has not, and wishes to do so now, will find the name of Deputy W.J. Broderick to it.  There was a considerable number of farmers representative mostly of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on that Commission. These were men who were backers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and they gave very solid reasons why there should not be derating.  They were people with long experience, some of them longer than Deputy Broderick's; they were men with a knowledge of local government. There were others who dealt with the matter from other aspects&mdash;from the point of view of the central Government and from the point of view of the central finances in a national way, and they all agreed that complete derating would not be a good thing for this country.</P>

      <P>Unless Deputies Curran and Broderick and others in <Col N="482" /> this House want local government wiped off and done away with&mdash;that is what it means&mdash;they will not vote for derating.  Complete derating would mean the end of local government.

      <P>Yes, in other directions. Many Deputies during the course of this debate have talked about these matters.

      <P>That is one of the minor things that comes into it.  We have had this derating on every occasion in the House and we know now fairly well what the mind of the House on this matter is.  We all know this, that you cannot preserve the present system of local government if you have derating.  I think that will be admitted by all.  If complete derating is adopted the probability is that you would have everything directed from Dublin, from the headquarters here. You would have managers put in, you would have the county councils abolished and all the elected bodies would probably go.  In every local authority you would have a manager. The boards of health and the committees of the mental hospitals would go, and so would all bodies like that.</P>

With regard to that, I will say that as Minister for Local Government and Public Health I am bound to see that the local services are brought to the highest possible pitch of efficiency.  Everywhere I speak I encourage local authorities to improve the local services, to instal everywhere they can proper water supplies, proper sewerage schemes in both town and country.  I encourage them in every way, but the final word rests with the local authorities.  If they wish to improve local services and have better public health services, they have the final word.  If they do not send up schemes we cannot oblige them to do so.  I have obliged them in some counties to appoint county medical officers of health.  I plead guilty to that much.  Certain counties have refused for a long time to appoint them.  I am bound by law to see that these county medical officers of health are appointed.</P>

      <P>Farmers everywhere have suffered grievously.  I know some people who have suffered very much.  In America, for instance, I know of one man who was a very wealthy man, probably wealthier than any farmer in this country, and to-day he is anything but well off.  I am aware of very wealthy men who, five or six years ago, could have five or six motor-cars in their houses.  To-day American agriculture is in such a state that these men are being put out on the doorstep.</P>

Deputy McGovern gave us figures the other night.  I could not hear him very well, but may be that was not his fault.  I could not make head or tail of how he made up his figures, but the impression I got was that they were like the kind of puzzle or riddle that used to be given to us when we were schoolboys: &ldquo;Think of a number, double it, take your first thoughts away from it, and I will give you your answer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As far as I could see, there was absolutely no foundation or basis for any set of figures I heard him read the other night.  As I said earlier, I admit that the prices of cattle and the difficulty of getting rid of the stock on the land are problems.  They are problems for those who devote themselves to the rearing of cattle and of cattle only.  It means that they find themselves in difficulties; but, on the other hand, those who go in for tillage, and those who in the last year have been rearing pigs, poultry and sheep, growing wheat, oats and other cereals, have not found themselves in a difficulty at all compared with those who might, I think, without disrespect, be called nowadays stick-in-the-mud cattle men.</P>

The Deputy or anybody coming along with a certain amount of capital and with some practical suggestion for starting an industry will get a warm welcome and a sympathetic hearing.  Much play was made by Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Brennan and one or two others on the subject of speeches made by President de Valera during the general election campaign in 1932.  They quoted statements made by the President, if I remember aright, in Kells and in Newcastle West in the early part of 1932, and they read into those statements a definite promise of derating.  I heard the statements read by Deputy O'Higgins which were made by the President at Kells and Newcastle West, and I say in neither case did Deputy de Valera, as he was then, promise derating.  He did say that with that money we could derate.</P>

      <P>You, if you have paid your taxes, and the rest of us. That is where it comes from.  Where else does the Deputy think it comes from?  I think there is too much talk of defeatism from members of local authorities.  There is too much of a defeatist attitude.  They want to give the impression that this country is beaten and cannot stand up, that it cannot continue the struggle that has been made, is being made and will continue to be made.  This same issue, all this same fight, was carried to the electors in the local elections of last year.  Every Deputy who has spoken, and, presumably, all the others who will speak, went before the farming community in the local elections last year, and you got your answer.  If the farmers of the country had not backed Fianna Fáil, we would not have got a majority, as we did get, in counties in which we never had a majority before.  Is not that correct?  I know that we did not get a majority in County Cork, but we got a majority in many other counties where we did not have a majority before.</P>

And just as they gave us a return with an increased majority in the general election of 1933, so did they give us an increased majority in the local elections in June.  And they gave us that increased majority after all the clamouring from the opposite benches urging us to face the people in the local elections.  Deputies opposite were terribly anxious that we should face the electorate before all the people could get an opportunity of voting&mdash;before the Bill which has just now been passed could come into operation, the Bill giving all the people power to vote in local as well <Col N="500" /> as Parliamentary elections.

      <P>I shall try to make my statement as short as possible. Last year I sold 45 cattle and paid to the British Government £4 a head, <Col N="501" /> taking the bounties and so on into consideration.  That would be £180. My land annuities and rates put together would not come to that amount.  The Minister made reference to tillage.  I have 60 acres of tillage and I employ about seven men. The Minister says that I refused to pay rates or land annuities.  I did not refuse to pay either, but the situation in the country is so bad that I stood loyally with the farmers who were in a position to put up a case to the Government for the unfortunate people who were not able to pay.  I want to make it very clear that the majority of the farmers are not able to meet their liabilities and to pay their annuities or rates.  That is not their fault.  It is the fault of the Government.  I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says that he stood by the people.  He stood by the people who wanted to smash local government in the country and to deprive roadworkers of their pay and to deprive the local authorities of the money to carry on their services.  He did everything he could, by making speeches and encouraging these people, to smash local government.</P>
