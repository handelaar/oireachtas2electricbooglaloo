      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he can state if a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Unified Society in respect of the period ended December 31st, 1933, has been made under Section 36 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, and, if so, whether it is his intention to publish the report of the actuary at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that insured contributors cease insurance at the expiration of 12 months of continuous unemployment; that on re-entry to insurable employment subsequently, they are disqualified for receiving such additional benefits as they were entitled to receive before ceasing insurance; that the additional benefits provided by approved societies heretofore included such excellent and necessary services as dental benefit, hospital benefit and optical benefit; that the loss of these benefits inflicts grave hardship on people who are unemployed for a considerable period, especially as the fund out of which they are provided was created in part by the contributions of the people who, because of unemployment, <Col N="1730" /> are precluded from enjoying them and whether it is proposed to amend the law so as to provide that unavoidable unemployment will not deprive insured persons of the benefits provided under the Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts an insured person ceases to be insured and his membership of his society terminates at the expiration of 12 months from the end of the last week of employment, but the date of cessation is extended by any period of duly notified incapacity.</P>
      <P>If such person resumes employment within 12 months after the date of cessation of membership and rejoins the society within a prescribed time, he is on rejoining in the same position so far as additional benefits in kind, such as dental benefit, hospital benefit and optical benefit, are concerned as if his previous membership had not been terminated.  As regards the ordinary cash benefits, sickness, disablement, maternity and marriage, he must requalify after the lapse of the necessary qualifying periods in insurance by payment of the necessary number of contributions.  Any additional cash benefits are payable only when he requalifies for ordinary cash benefits.</P>
      <P>If he does not resume employment within one year after the termination of his membership his previous right to additional benefits is not taken into account and he must requalify for all benefits.  The actuarial basis of the additional benefits scheme does not provide for making additional benefits available for persons who do not resume employment within a period of 12 months from the date on which they ceased membership and rejoin the society within the prescribed time.  It is proposed to review the financial structure of the Acts when the result of the next valuation is available, and the matter referred to in the latter part of the question will be kept in mind when doing so.</P>

    <P>That as regards any Act of the present Session to make provision for the control and regulation of the production and marketing of bacon and to make provision for divers matters connected therewith, including the regulation of the price of pigs, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any sums required by the Minister for Agriculture for the making of loans under such Act and <Col N="1751" /> any other expenses incurred by the Minister for Agriculture in carrying such Act into effect.</P>

      <P>The House would like to get some information as to what the cost of this proposal is going to be and there are some other things which the House would like to hear something about in dealing with this resolution. On Friday week last there was very little time to discuss some of these things as the House wished to convenience the Minister by concluding the Second Reading in order to allow the Bill to go to the Special Committee quickly.  I asked the Minister at that time whether the Excise duty on the killing of pigs was going to continue. I pointed out that the Excise duty brought in nearly £300,000 last year, 5/- being put on in May, 7/- about October, and 10/- in December, and, if the Excise duty at the rate of 10/- was to continue, that a sum of £500,000 would be raised over a normal year and would be borne by the bacon consumers. The Minister indicated that as far as he was concerned there was no necessity for the Excise duty imposed by the Emergency Order to continue after the Bill had come into operation, when the funds to be raised by the operation of the Bill were available. Nevertheless, I think it desirable that the Minister should tell us what amount of money is going to be raised under the Financial Resolution passed in connection with this Bill.  I know it may be somewhat outside the scope of this discussion as the resolution before the House deals simply with the cost of administration of the Bill.  In view, however, of the limited discussion which took place on this matter, and before the Bill comes before the Special Committee, I think the House should get an answer on this point and also should have some idea as to what the cost of the administration of the Bill will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the capacity of the people to bear burdens of this kind is being reduced year by year.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that there was a Budgetary surplus of £1,100,000.  But £300,000 was raised as <Col N="1752" /> an Excise duty on the killing of pigs, and paid by the consumers of bacon during the year, which was not estimated for by the Minister for Finance when introducing his Budget.  We generally look to the taxation paid in Excise to give us some indication as to the purchasing capacity of our people. It has been indicated that the amount received in Excise duty during the last 12 months was greater than that received during the 12 months before. But the amount actually received was £42,000 less than the amount estimated for, although £300,000 went into the Exchequer in Excise duty that was not budgeted for at all.</P>
    <P>Figures have recently been issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicating that during the year 1933 the people spent one-eighth less on boots and shoes, one-fifth less on hosiery, nearly one-eighth less on soap, candles and furniture, and one-fifth less on jam and sugar confectionery than they did two years before. So that when we are dealing with the raising of moneys that will have to be paid by the taxpayers on the one hand and by the bacon consumers on the other, we have to realise that we are dealing with people whose purchasing power is gradually being reduced. That is all the more reason why the Minister should give us some idea as to the financial effects of this measure from the point of view of this resolution, which deals with the administrative costs, and from the point of view of the Bill itself, which deals with the amount of money that will be raised by fees charged by the Bacon Board and by the Pigs Board.</P>

      <P>The expenditure under this Bill, as far as public funds are concerned, will not amount to more than £15,000 or £16,000 as estimated.  The biggest item of expenditure will be the veterinary inspection.  In a full year that is estimated to cost about £14,000.  The administrative expenditure under this Bill, as far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned, will not be heavy, because most of the work will be done by the boards that are being set up under the Bill.  I do not think that the <Col N="1753" /> administrative expenses of the Department will be more than £1,500.  The total expenditure, therefore, will be between £15,000 and £16,000.  In addition to that, of course, there are the two Boards.  The administrative expenses of these two Boards are estimated at between £4,000 and £5,000 each.  Under the Bill it is provided that these Boards may carry out certain experiments and do certain research work.  It is difficult to say what the expenditure may amount to if they do any research work or carry out any experiments.  I do not believe, however, that it will be very heavy. Probably it would not amount to more than a few hundred pounds or perhaps £1,000.  The big item, however, both of receipts and expenditure of whichever Board may have the administration of it, is this matter that has to be settled on the Committee Stage of what might be regarded as the stabilisation fund.</P>
      <P>This Excise duty collected on bacon was for the purpose of increasing the bounties on exports.  It did not give the Minister for Finance any additional income so far as the Budget forecast was concerned.  He had already allocated all that was estimated for in his Budget for export bounties, and whatever came out of this Excise duty on bacon was also devoted to that purpose over and above what was already allocated. It is not true to say either that the duty realised £300,000.  That would be the estimate for a full year.  What was actually received in the financial year was a good deal less than that.  I do not know what the exact figure was, but I think it was somewhat under a quarter of a million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is passed, and if certain amendments which are being put down are agreed to, it will be possible to have the stabilisation fund and to get rid of this Excise duty altogether.  In that case I think the Minister for Finance has no intention whatever of continuing the Excise duty for revenue purposes.  I cannot give an estimate of what that levy for stabilisation purposes may amount to, because it will depend entirely on the relative prices of pigs here and in Great Britain, and of bacon here and in Great Britain.  It <Col N="1754" /> is impossible, of course, to forecast what these prices may be.  The levy raised by whichever Board is administering this would not, I believe, amount to more than £300,000, and indeed it may prove to be much less. I do not see that it would have any great effect from the point of view of the producer here, because the idea is to collect a levy at times when the bacon curer can pay more, taking the price of bacon into consideration, and to pay out from that fund at times when the bacon curer is losing on his business.  In fact, if you like, it is a regularisation of the position which was there heretofore, where the bacon curer himself lost at certain times of the year and gained at other times.  It is transferring that loss and gain over to the Board, to effect, if possible, that the bacon curer would get an ordinary reasonable profit the whole year round, and that the Board would stand this occasional loss and reap this occasional gain which the bacon curer has been getting up to the present.  I do not think it affects the consumer to any great extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way is the new Board to be financed?  If they are going to be financed out of levies, and if the levies are alterable, then I am afraid we will find the position will be not that the consumer pays but that it will be taken out of the producer. When you put on a levy for the purpose of stabilisation, it is not put on to the consumer so much as taken out of the producer.  That is how we view it.  We would be very interested to know how this Board is going to be financed, whether it is the Pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board.  We should like to know what way the fund is going to be manipulated. They are going to have powers under the Act to go into business. How will the business be financed? Will it be financed out of levies, which <Col N="1755" /> will either put it on to the consumer or take it out of the producer?  We ought to be told what is going to happen, if there is any general idea at the present moment as to how the thing is going to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy Brennan to see the distinction between what I have called, for convenience, the stabilisation fund and the administrative expenses of the Board.  In the case of the administrative expenses of the Board, which will amount to only twopence or threepence per pig in each case, the buyer of the pig can deduct the levy which is payable to the Pigs Board, but he contributes to the Bacon Board without deducting.  It amounts, I think, to the same thing; either the producer or the consumer must pay.  There is a specified amount put down; he must pay, say, threepence to the Pigs Board and threepence to the Bacon Board.  On the published price he can deduct the threepence which he pays to the Pigs Board, and the other threepence theoretically comes out of the bacon factory.  The stabilisation fund is a different matter. Suppose it is felt by the Pigs Board that the bacon curers can pay 3/- or 4/- more per cwt. for pigs, considering the price of bacon, they might come to the conclusion that it was inadvisable to make them pay that, and, instead, make them build up a fund for a rainy day.  At a time when the bacon curers say that they cannot possibly continue paying the present price for pigs, the Pigs Board might say &ldquo;Continue paying that price and we will subsidise you for the time being out of the fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going on many years' experience of the cycle of prices. We know from bacon curers themselves that there are certain times of the year when they make money, and other times when they lose money.  We want <Col N="1756" /> to continue the level of prices.  Instead of the bacon curer having his own stabilisation fund, the intention is to let the Board have it.  That is what it amounts to.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that what will determine the collection of money for the stabilisation fund will be consideration of the price of pigs and bacon in Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister then is this stabilisation fund a fund with an entirely different function from, say, the function of the butter stabilisation fund?  In the case of the butter stabilisation fund the general principle is that you keep the price to the producer here up to the price payable to the producer outside, but that the price to the consumer here need bear no relation at all to the price paid to the consumer outside; that is, the producer is looked after at the expense of the consumer, with the result that people here pay 5d. per lb. more for butter than in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Do I understand that in the operation of the stabilisation fund under this Bill the price of bacon here will not be raised in that particular way to the consumers, compared with the price charged to consumers in Great Britain and the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill would enable the Board to work in much the same way as in the case of butter, but I think there would be no intention of doing so.  In practice I think bacon should be somewhat cheaper here, but it is hard to give a forecast.  I think it should not be dearer at any rate under this scheme than in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to walk pretty warily in regard to this matter.  I do not know whether the drop in the price of pigs has any relation to the coming Bill, but there has been a rather severe drop recently.  Of course, our experience is that whenever there are levies, licences or registration fees to be paid by bacon curers or anybody else they will be taken out of the producer in the first <Col N="1757" /> instance.  I should like the Minister to keep that in mind, and watch how matters are going at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there was a rather artificial rise in the price of pigs about a week or two ago, because as the Bill stood when introduced the qualifying period for factories was stated to be 12 months prior to the passing of the Act, or the appointed day&mdash;I forget which.  I announced here that we were changing that to the year 1934.  While the qualifying period was to be 12 months prior to the passing of the Act, there was rather a contest between factories to get pigs and put up their numbers.  I think there is an easing off in that regard; it was only temporary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the present levy on bacon will stabilise prices.  In my reading of this Bill I do not see where that is effected at all.  My reading of the section mentioned by the Minister is that it is a mechanical device to keep prices fairly level, especially not to have big day-to-day jumps.  I take it that the latter part of the Bill dealing with the Pigs Marketing Board is drawn more with an eye to marketing than to fixing the price to the consumer or the price for export&mdash;stabilisation of pig prices rather than bacon prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a terrible lot of work to be done with this Bill, and if a fair percentage of the amendments are to be adopted the Minister will not know his own Bill.  What I am interested in is the purely financial side of the Bill.  Anything that is to be known about the Bill is in the Bill and we can read it, but we have no information of what the Minister's estimate of the cost of administering the Bill is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested to know that, and I should like the Minister not to be too niggardly in his estimate, and neither is he to be extravagant. <Col N="1758" /> I should like him to approximate as nearly as possible to it. I do not think Deputy Mulcahy need be so nervous about the consumer. Things like this do not come from the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>None of Deputy Mulcahy's consumers would care to change places with the producers.  If they did find themselves in that position they would not have waited until now for a general strike in the City of Dublin. They would have struck long ago.  I question if there is a single man on strike who has not been in receipt of more money than any pig producer, and I am quite sure he is eating more bacon than the pig producers can afford to eat.  I think the Minister computed the financial cost of the Bill at from £15,000 to £16,000.  He did say that the cost of inspection which would be about the biggest item would be about £14,000.  I forget just at the moment whether that inspection will be borne on the price?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then there is a big hiatus there.  If the cost of inspection is about £14,000, there is another £1,500 which I take it would be the cost to the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take it at that.  Then you have the cost of each Board at between £4,000 and £5,000.  If we take it at the larger figure I think it will be found very near it.  There will be the chairman of the Board to be paid, the secretary will be paid, and officers will have to be provided for both.  The expenses of the members of each Board will have to be borne, and the members of one Board will get remuneration in addition to their expenses, and then there will be two secretaries. Neither the chairman nor secretary of these Boards will need to be duds. They would need to be men of good capacity.  They must be good men. In addition, there will be a staff if the chairman and secretary are to do any good.  It will be like the county medical officers of health.  At first we estimated <Col N="1759" /> the cost at only £700 or £800, the salary of one individual.  But we find now where they are functioning properly that there is a huge establishment with assistant county medical officers of health and that a whole staff is necessary.  Then there are other officers down the line in order to utilise the services to the fullest extent.</P>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the county medical officers of health now, but here we are setting up an organisation for the pig trade.  Taking it at the limited estimate of the Minister at £16,000, there will be, exclusive of that, £5,000 for each of the Boards.  With £1,000 for research that will make £27,000.  I do not know whether the Minister has taken in all the costs in making his estimate, but to my mind it would be a conservative estimate to place the figure at £30,000 a year.  Now that will have to come out of the industry. The pig industry will have not only to bear this extra charge but it will have to produce an efficiency that will have to bring in a return for this extra charge of £30,000 in addition to something more in order to stabilise the whole industry.  Apart from these remarks, I do not want to criticise the Bill.  I just want to get from the Minister an idea of the financial costs, because I recognise in all the circumstances surrounding this Bill and the evidence given before the Pigs Tribunal, as published in their report, that there was nothing else left for the Minister but to produce a Bill of some kind.  Whether this is the most suitable Bill he could produce is a matter that we will have to look through during the next few weeks.  I suppose a Second Reading discussion on this motion is hardly in order.</P>

I do not want to discuss the matter any further, as we will be discussing it tomorrow in Committee, but I suggest that the Minister should consider seriously if with such an association two independent Boards might not be equally efficient if not more efficient, and that they might be less expensive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> Where the terms of a contract of service provide that milk is to be supplied free by the employer to the employee, milk supplied by the employer to the employee under such contract shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act not to have been sold by the employer to the employee.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet the case mentioned by Deputy Belton on the Committee Stage, where a farmer arranges to give a free supply of milk to an employee as part of the employee's remuneration for his services.  There appeared to be some doubt as to whether such a contract would be deemed to constitute a sale of milk and the amendment definitely provides that such an arrangement will not bring the farmer under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little more explanation of this.  Does it really mean that a farmer will be free to give any milk to his employee, as part of the contract of service, and that such milk may not be protected at all or does it mean that a farmer who does not supply any milk except to his employees does not come under the Bill?  In the latter case, I have no objection, but, in the former, I think it would be open to grave objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if Deputy Rowlette reads the amendment in conjunction with Section 7, he will find that it speaks for itself.  The section refers to a farmer occasionally supplying milk to persons for consumption by such persons and their families, the selling of such milk not forming part of his ordinary business, and then the amendment sets out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the terms of a contract of service provide that milk is to be supplied free by the employer to the employee, milk supplied by the employer to the employee under such contract shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act not to have been <Col N="1762" /> sold by the employer to the employee.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy reads the amendment in conjunction with paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 7, he will see that it is only the occasional supplier of milk who is excluded from the provisions with regard to registration.  I think this amendment is merely intended to cover a case in which a farmer makes an arrangement with his labourer to give him, say, a pint of milk in the day as part of the contract of service.  He is not really a seller of milk in the ordinary sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that Deputy Rowlette's fears are unfounded because, if a farmer is an ordinary purveyor of milk in any other respect, he must be registered and must be subject to all the rigours of inspection? The only person it really applies to is the person who is not registered.</P>

      <P>I should like some assurance as to the operation of sub-section (1) (a) of this section.  The amendment proposes to change the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; to &ldquo;sells.&rdquo;  I am afraid that, as that stands, the efficient administrators are going to injure the people they represent instead of helping them.  I think it was on Second Reading that it was hinted&mdash;at least that is my interpretation of it&mdash;that pasteurisation would be a substitute for clean milk.  I should like to hear <Col N="1763" /> unequivocally from the Parliamentary Secretary, who, fortunately, is a medical man, if pasteurisation is intended to be a substitute for registration and clean production of milk.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would explain exactly what is effected by this alteration. I am not sure whether it makes the section wider or narrower in its scope.  If it in any way renders more free of control the supply of milk to the creameries, I would be disappointed. I hope that is not the intention of the amendment, which, I confess, I fail to understand.  The creameries are already a very grave danger to the live stock of the country.  Section 20, as it stands, gives them, as it seems to me, unnecessarily complete immunity in regard to inspection of their supplies, and I should like to know whether this amendment increases or diminishes that immunity.  If it increases the immunity, I shall be very sorry.</P>

      <P>As to Deputy Belton's question about pasteurisation being a substitute for registration, I thought we had discussed this matter so often on the various stages of this, and the previous, Bill that Deputy Belton would now be perfectly clear on the matter.  If a creamery purports to sell designated milk&mdash;let us say, for the sake of discussion, pasteurised milk&mdash;such a creamery must be licensed to produce pasteurised milk, and the creamery will be subject to all the restrictions regarding the pasteurising of milk to which any other pasteurising concern will be subject.  It will be subject to the same regulations and will have to instal such pasteurising plant as may be prescribed by the Minister by regulations made under the Bill.  The substitution of &ldquo;sells&rdquo; for &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is merely a drafting amendment.  It is considered by the draftsman to be better phraseology. It does not affect in any way what the Deputy looks upon as the immunity of certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The real answer of the Parliamentary Secretary is that pasteurisation will act as a substitute for registration, because what designation licence can a creamery have but a <Col N="1764" /> pasteurising licence?  If it is a special designation licence, all byres and cow sheds must be registered.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that.  If my suspicious are correct, what is intended there is pasteurised milk, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that that is really his answer to my question.  I have here a report of the Milk Commission of Great Britain, which is about the last word in an investigation of this matter, and here is what they say about pasteurisation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Pasteurisation is not, and never can be, a substitute for clean production, and the same care should therefore be exercised in the production of milk that is to be heat tested....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, of course, is pasteurisation, raising it to 60 or 65 degrees centigrade, keeping it there for half-an-hour and suddenly cooling it.  In the evidence before the Pigs Tribunal it was stated that very few creameries, if any, in this country have up-to-date pasteurisation plant.  Whether it is up-to-date or not, this is the Milk Commission's very definite statement of opinion in regard to pasteurisation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and the same care should therefore be exercised in the production of milk that is to be heat tested as is required to be observed in the production of milk that is to be consumed in its raw condition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that, excepting the grading of milk, there is not a single thing contained in this Bill that he has not power to do already, if he wants to use that power, and there is not a single obligation that will be imposed by the Bill that we are not administering to the last letter in County Dublin at the moment.  We have about 600 registered dairies in County Dublin, and they have to comply with the Dairies and Cowsheds Order of 1908.  We have a complete inspection.  We employ a full time veterinary surgeon, paying him a good salary and travelling expenses.  If anybody who is not registered dares to sell milk in the county, we are after him at once and we put him out of business unless he is prepared to register.  When <Col N="1765" /> a person registers we make him comply with certain standards of sheds and his herds are inspected at least four times a year.</P>
    <P>There is a clinical examination of the herds.  The registered dairies in County Dublin represent over 8,000 cows.  We have to pay for that complete inspection.  We have to make the milk producers produce milk under the conditions imposed by the Dairies and Cowsheds Order.  Dublin County is the only county in Ireland with a whole-time veterinary surgeon carrying out that work.</P>
    <P>After we go to that expense in order to put a good article on the Dublin market, the Minister allows cheap milk, produced under bad conditions, to come into our market and undersell us. Even in the case of the institutions that our rates are keeping up, we are cut out by the cheap milk vendors.  In the case of this Bill there has been a definite tinkering with amendments and you can drive a coach and four through the measure now.  The Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that the whole thing can be scrapped, that registration can be scrapped and that pasteurised milk fills the bill.  If that is so, why should we be paying £700 or £800 a year to a whole-time veterinary surgeon, £200 or £300 a year to part-time district veterinary officers, and why should we employ a number of dairy and cowshed inspectors? Further, the reports of these officers make it incumbent on the milk producers to overhaul their sheds so as to meet the conditions of the Dairies and Cowsheds Order.  After undergoing that expense we tax them in order to keep up certain administrative machinery so that a good article is produced. The Parliamentary Secretary has now stated that if you pasteurise your milk it will be all right.  Why not scrap the whole service that we now have working and erect pasteurising stations over the county?  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as a medical man that if there are any germs killed by pasteurisation the dead bodies will still be in the milk and any dirt that gets into the milk will remain there, so that the milk is very little improved, if at all after pasteurisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> The measure will have serious reactions on County Dublin because the ratepayers will not stand for the maintenance of a costly, efficient service that will be doing them no good, but will be, instead, doing them positive harm.  I hope some effort will be made to improve this Bill before it becomes law and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that its provisions will be carried out better than the provisions of the Dairies and Cowsheds Order of 1908 and the public health services generally.  Does he intend to carry them out uniformly all over the country?  I think I can say without boasting that he can take County Dublin as a standard.  Will he insist that all counties will put up as efficient a service as County Dublin? Even before this Bill becomes law he is obviously winking at the evasion of its provisions.  In effect, heating milk will do for all these inspections.  All the veterinary services, all the improvements in cow houses, all the cleanliness and ventilation that are required can be scrapped and it does not matter how much much is in the milk&mdash;bring it in, heat it and it will be all right. If that is the standard that is going to be set, we might as well scrap the expensive service we have in County Dublin.  We are not going to continue paying for a good service if we are to be put into competition with people who do not attain the same high standard.  If we are to compete let us compete with an article produced under precisely the same conditions and give us a fair chance to sell our goods.  If the Minister does not devote his attention to those matters he will not have the boards of health, the county councils and other local authorities responding in the way they should respond if the provisions of this Bill are to do any good.</P>
    <P>I shall have more to say on the Final Stage, but there is no use in criticising it.  If the Minister admits that my interpretation is correct I say that the thing will not work.  We could talk and criticise it for hours but that would not help the Bill, unless the Minister takes cognisance of the points raised.</P>

Amendment No. 9 is practically a repetition of that except in so far as it mentions being convicted for the third time.

In neither case can anybody be restored to the register without the consent of the Minister.  Amendment No. 8 sets that out clearly.  If amendment No 9 purports to be something that will compel the local authority to take certain names off the register, I do not think it should be done in that way.

      <P>In page 17, line 13, before Section 43 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a person, who has had access to milk sold by a dairyman, has been, for a period exceeding forty-eight hours, unable owing to illness to carry out his ordinary occupation and if he has not been examined by a qualified medical practitioner and if he shall subsequently be found to be suffering from one of the diseases to which this Part of this Act applies, the dairyman shall be considered to have failed to exercise ordinary care.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to endeavour to make the control of sickness amongst dairy workers a little more strict than is provided for under the terms of the Bill as it stands. When a man is out sick I think it is not unfair to ask that the duty should be imposed upon a dairyman to satisfy himself that the sickness which has kept a man out for over two days is not sickness which might cause a danger to the consumers of his milk. One knows that some diseases at least which are likely to be conveyed by milk are not infective in their early stages and that it is important to get such diseases under control and under treatment at the earliest possible date. I think it is right that the dairyman, when sickness has occurred amongst his employees, should take steps, if he wishes to protect his customers, and if he wishes to protect himself from the provisions of such a Bill as this, to ensure that the cause of the illness is known so far as it is discoverable in the ordinary way by a qualified medical practitioner.  If that is not done, it is possible that illness which may be comparatively temporary, lasting only three or four days, in the case of a <Col N="1773" /> particular man, may still be conveyed to others when that man returns to work.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of cases where the illness may be comparatively slight as regards the first person affected, but of which he may act as a carrier immediately afterwards.  If the illness is such as to entail two days' disablement on the worker, it is proper that some investigation should be made.  The investigation here suggested is of the lightest possible nature&mdash;that he should be examined by a qualified medical practitioner in the hope that such diseases as scarlatina, infective ton-silitis, diphtheria and others should not be brought back to the dairy by a man recovering after two or three days' illness.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is willing to accept the principle of that it is quite possible that he would prefer his own working of the amendment, as I do not claim to be an expert draftsman.  I hope, at any rate, that he will consider the principle of the amendment sympathetically.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that this amendment would impose too great a responsibility on a dairyman, especially as regards the subsequent development of the disease in a person who has had access to the milk.  The subsequent development of a contagious disease might mean the development of that disease within any period of time.  It might be a fortnight or a couple of months, or it might be held to be even a longer period of time, and I am afraid that the dairyman would be let in for serious responsibility under the terms of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, however to draw the Deputy's attention to Section 43. There has been considerable amendment of this particular part of the Bill on the Committee Stage, and unfortunately Deputy Rowlette was not present.  He will find in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 that a person who has been infected with a disease to which this Part of the Act applies will be guilty of an offence if he knowingly gains access to the milk subsequently in a dairy; or if he has been exposed to infection; or if he resides in the same <Col N="1774" /> house as a person who has been infected by a disease to which this Part of the Act applies.  I think that in the light of Section 45 Deputy Rowlette, if he looks more carefully into the terms of that section, will feel satisfied that the position is adequately safeguarded and that the onus is put on the employee, the person under the circumstances on whom it should appropriately be put, rather than on the dairyman.  I do not think that this amendment could be accepted, and I do not think that in the light of Section 43 the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, and I agree with him that Section 43 covers probably fairly effectively any possibility of conveying infection knowingly to the milk.  The point of my amendment is that it may occur unknowingly and that steps should be enforced to secure that that should not take place and that the illness of a workman over a period longer than 48 hours should call for some investigation before he again approaches the milk, which he may possibly infect.  I am not complaining of the provision as regards what is done knowingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, with the Parliamentary Secretary, that we might be responsible for inflicting very serious hardship on dairymen by this amendment, because very often people may get periodically ill, or may be suffering to some slight degree from something or other which would not be an infectious disease of any consequence.</P>
      <P>It might happen on another occasion that he would have developed diphtheria. In a case like that I think it would be very unfair to inflict a fine on a dairyman for not having him examined on that particular occasion. I think Section 43 really covers all the important points which need to be covered in that regard.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 6, before Section 46 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> If any animal has appeared to be ill or has failed to eat her usual food for a period exceeding 48 hours or has yielded milk which was abnormal in colour or consistency, such animal shall be presumed to be suffering from one of the diseases to which this Part of this Act applies unless she has been examined by a qualified veterinary surgeon and has been certified by him not to be suffering from one of these diseases.</P>
    <P>I dare say the Parliamentary Secretary will draw my attention to Section 46, and tell the House that it covers what is necessary in regard to the control of the health of animals, but again I want to impress on him that it is necessary to tighten it up to some extent.  A duty should be put on the dairyman to make inquiry as to the cause of ill-health in his dairy cows.  A dairyman should be ready to take every precaution to inquire into the health of his dairy cattle.  It is not, I think, asking too much that where a cow shows evidence of serious illness, such as the symptoms suggested in the amendment, he should exclude her milk until she has been examined by a veterinary surgeon who is satisfied that she is not suffering from any of the diseases enumerated in the Bill.  It puts a dairyman to very little trouble.  It is, I think, what careful dairymen, such as there are in the County Dublin, would do in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not think they will run away from their careful habits as rapidly as Deputy Belton suggests. I do not think it is asking too much that the dairyman should take that amount of care with the health of his animals, and that until he is satisfied that an animal is not suffering from one of those diseases he should exclude her milk from his supply stock.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  In my judgment it is altogether too drastic to be incorporated in the Bill.  There is no doubt <Col N="1776" /> that it would involve dairymen in very considerable expense.  I think farmers in the House at any rate will agree that cows often suffer from indigestion and minor complaints which might prevent them from taking their usual food for a period of 48 hours.  If a veterinary surgeon had to be called in every time a cow went off her food there is no doubt the dairyman would find himself involved in very considerable expense.</P>

On the question of abnormal colour, cows may yield milk which is abnormal in colour or consistency, and yet the milk may be perfectly safe from the point of view of human consumption. I feel sure that Deputy Rowlette will realise the unreasonableness of this amendment, and the utter impossibility of accepting it.  I have gone a long way towards meeting the Deputy in relation to many of his amendments, some of which I was not very keen on, and some of which undoubtedly did improve the Bill.  I do not think the House can seriously consider the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that none of those diseases could develop so rapidly if the services which ought to be there now were there.  In other words, if his Department did its job there would be veterinary machinery for periodical examinations&mdash;at least three or four examinations in the year &mdash;and no hardship could result from the adoption of this amendment put up by Deputy Rowlette.  The only hardship that would arise would be where somebody, apparently with the connivance of the Ministry, would be trying to sidetrack this Bill.  Of <Col N="1777" /> course, this would be an awkward and expensive provision to have then, but if the law as it is now, without this Bill at all, were properly enforced, Deputy Rowlette's amendment would inflict no hardship; in fact, it would hardly be wanted.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot accept it. Perhaps, he does not understand the workings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In face of what the Parliamentary Secretary said a while ago, I would be against this amendment, but unless the Bill is going to be administered as it appears here I would be in favour of the amendment.  The Parliamentary Secretary has quite obviously stated that he is not serious about this Bill.  According to him, if you half boil the milk it is all right; all the other conditions which occupy the whole Bill can be wiped out.  Half boil the milk and it does not matter how it is produced.  It does not matter if a cow gets a blast in the udder and there is congealed milk, causing poisoning.  Half boil the milk and it is all right according to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 10, at the end of Section 58 (1), to add the words: &ldquo;or their English equivalents.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment.  The object of sub-section (1) of Section 58 is to give protection to purchasers of milk by putting a label on the can, showing the nature of the article which they are buying.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the protection which I suggest for the less educated section of the population who are not able to read Gaelic. After all, I think it would be unfair that those who, through advanced years or some intellectual disability, are unable to read the Gaelic tongue should be exposed to the dangers of <Col N="1778" /> certain classes of milk, from which their better educated fellow-citizens are protected.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that those cans should be labelled in the English tongue, at any rate, in English-speaking districts.  If my suggestion is adopted, the English equivalents will give protection to the entire population, as there must be very few people in the country who cannot read either Gaelic or English. I would draw attention to the fact that in many countries on the Continent it is customary to print public notices in four or five tongues, and I do not think it is extravagant to ask that those labels should be printed in two languages at least.  There are even some Members of this House who might be misled by those labels if they appeared only in Gaelic.</P>
    <P>One Deputy has told me that the second label in the Bill would suggest to him that the milk was watered.  I believe that was a mistranslation, but such is the ignorance as to Irish of some Deputies in the House. That was what the words &ldquo;Uachtar ar diol&rdquo; meant to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Bill would have to be printed and that the last stage would be taken later on.  On the Second Reading of this Bill the case was made that there would be assistance from State funds to finance it.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to that and to other very important matters bearing on a serious flaw that the Parliamentary Secretary admitted is in the Bill.  In paragraph 143, page 146, of the Report of the Reorganisation Commission for Milk&mdash;that is the British Commission&mdash;we have these words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential to the well-being of the milk industry that the public in general, and the medical profession in particular, should have assurance that the supply of ordinary milk is produced under reasonably clean conditions, and is as far as possible <Col N="1782" /> free from infection.  The encouragement of confidence in the quality of the milk supply is one of the best means of stimulating demand.  To these ends, steps should be taken to secure&mdash;(a) the effective and uniform administration of the Milk and Dairies Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I raised that matter on the Second Reading debate I was not then even aware of the existence of this recommendation but I knew from experience, and particularly from the disclosures, that there was no uniformity in the administration of the Dairies and Cowsheds Order and public health law.  As a matter of fact, I was amazed when I found Deputy after Deputy complaining of the cost of the things provided by this Bill that we have been doing for years here:&mdash;&ldquo;The effective and uniform administration of The Milk and Dairies Order; the compulsory routine clinical inspection of all dairy cattle; the institution of a roll of Accredited Producers; County and County Borough Councils should have power to take over the responsibility for the administration of the Milk and Dairies Order in those cases where uniform and more effective administration is likely in that way to be secured; the routine clinical examination of all dairy cattle is of as much importance from the standpoint of establishing the confidence of the public as it is an indispensable part of any scheme of milk grading and the compulsory routine clinical examination of all dairy cows for evidence of tuberculosis should therefore be introduced with the least possible delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how he proposes to grade milk if he has not those examinations, or if he gets around them.  I am afraid his knowledge of the very Bill he is piloting was very seriously at fault when he contradicted my statement that it was possible for creameries to sell no other specially designated milk than pasteurised milk.  &ldquo;For the efficient operation of the Milk and Dairies Bill and the Tuberculosis Order, whole-time veterinary service is essential&rdquo;&mdash;we have it that the Minister wants to dispense <Col N="1783" /> with it even in this Bill.  &ldquo;Provision of adequate veterinary service should be encouraged by substantial assistance from State funds&rdquo;&mdash;no State funds are given now nor are State funds proposed to be given, under this Bill.  In those counties where efforts have been made to produce the proper article it would cause a curious feeling to arise among the people who are blaming the local authority for being so severe in administering the regulations, and, after all, an order made by the Ministry of Local Government is supposed to be carried out.  We have carried it out.  It is not proposed to be carried out in this Bill.  We have a cow population of 8,000 with four inspections by veterinary surgeons in the year.  We have 40 tubercle-free herds, some of them having as many as 160 cows&mdash;are we going to let all these scatter?  We must, because we produce the article and place it on the Dublin market and if producers in other counties are not made toe the line and produce under the same conditions this Act is supposed to secure, we must fall back to their level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the ordinary commercial article that we are concerned with in this Bill.  That commercial article is crushed out of the institutions in Dublin.  It is all railway milk that is coming in, collected in depôts and creameries down the country.  All this Act and the previous Dairies and Cowsheds Order will be evaded, and the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted it, by half-boiling the milk and keeping it at that heat for half an hour and then letting it cool down.  I do not see how that is going to help the health of the community.  I am certainly against the interpretation put on this by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is a very serious interpretation for him to put on it, seeing that he is a medical doctor and knows exactly what he is talking about, and it will be a statement of which in Dublin and in the neighbouring counties very serious notice will be taken.</P>

      <P>The only objection I have to the Bill is that the cost of it is being apportioned to local authorities.  I think that is not fair in face of the recommendations of the report just quoted by Deputy Belton, but it is not fair to hang on to the statement about pasteurisation as the Deputy has done.  I would be extremely glad to think that all the milk for children would be at least pasteurised, but there is no use in playing on that word.  We know in the main that it will destroy all the germs. except tuberculosis.  That is a very big achievement.  I do not want to use strong language about some of the other milk, but I often feel I would like to.  This Bill will eliminate it, and it puts an end to a kind of shop which should be closed.  This country and this city in particular have been very <Col N="1785" /> neglectful in looking after its milk supplies, particularly of the supplies intended for children.  Pasteurisation will do two things: it will give us first, clean milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may be said that the pasteurisation system is all wrong and that the founder was a person utterly ignorant, but nobody is going to debate that here because we are not big enough or competent to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, pasteurisation will take out all the solid dirt from milk and a good deal of the fine stuff.  In the main it must improve the milk supply.  The next thing that is required to give us a good supply of milk, is the elimination of bovine tuberculosis. That cannot be done in this Bill, but it can be done by the Minister for Agriculture, by eliminating tubercular cows.  Unless that is done in conjunction with this Bill it cannot be as effective as it should be.</P>
      <P>My main objection to this thing is that where all this machinery is going to be set up if the Bill is going to be worked effectively I think the Minister ought to be asked to make some contribution towards its cost.  The Parliamentary Secretary is wrong in refusing to seek it.  It is unwise.  It is very bad statesmanship, because where the interests of the community and the community of the future are concerned the cost should be divided in at least equal shares from the Central Fund and the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I can quite agree that this Bill makes considerable advance on previous legislation and all that remains to be done is to see that it will be properly administered.  Its administration will be very much more effective and the local authorities would co-operate more closely if the Government had put this Bill on the same financial lines as some of their other legislation dealing with public health welfare and if half of the cost were borne by the local authorities and half came out of the Central Fund. That would be a considerable advance in the working of this Bill, but I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department for the work they are doing.  I am drawing attention to the faults of the Bill only because I want to put them on record, because I believe that in some future years another Bill will have to be introduced eliminating some of the faults which, to my mind, tend to spoil the efficiency of this Bill.  Again, on the point of view of public health administration we cannot overlook the fact that we have almost an entirely new service and that they are inexperienced in public health administration in the greater part of the country.  I congratulate the Department on its efforts to secure that every county in the area of the Irish Free State shall have a county medical officer of health and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the success which has met the efforts of his Department and which has resulted in the appointment of a county medical officer of health in almost every county.  But we must take into account that many of them are new to the work and that we have a great deal of distance to make up, because public health administration has, up to very recent years, been very backward in this country; in fact it has been almost entirely absent and we cannot hope for the best results from officers newly appointed to the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take a few years to get them up to full efficiency.  A great deal of <Col N="1787" /> the efficiency in the working of the machinery will depend upon the local authorities and I hope and trust that full co-operation will be given.  I wish to make particular reference to one of the faults in the Bill, the absence of the power of the health authority of urban areas to travel outside to the rural areas in the inspection of the sources of milk which reaches their towns.  I refer to what has been spoken of conveniently as extra-territorial power.  It was suggested I think by the Parliamentary Secretary that the exercising of such power would confuse the working of the rural authorities.  I think it would work quite the other way if the authorities of a city such as Dublin or Cork could make occasional visits to dairies outside their own district which supply the milk to these districts and I think that the medical officers of health in the rural district would welcome such visits from their city colleagues. It would lessen the county medical officer's work.  I think he will resent what will happen in this Bill as it stands; getting a message from a city colleague ordering him to make a report upon some milk perhaps in an out-of-the-way district.  He has his own work to do.  His programme is mapped out for the week and suddenly it is upset by getting a message to visit some dairy.  I do not think that the coming in in cases of that sort of the city authorities would be resented by the county medical officer.  It would be very much against human nature if it did.  That I think was the main argument that the Parliamentary Secretary put up that if he was going to have the Act efficiently administered he could not have the local inspectors going into the sources of supply in the rural areas.  I think he will see that his argument is wrong and he should give consideration to the point of view we are putting forward.  If he does not do it now he will have to do it later on, or some other Government will have to do it in the course of a few years.  The Deputy who has just spoken referred to the failure in this Bill to deal with the question of the milk that leaves the creameries.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not given <Col N="1788" /> any assurance that the separated milk would be pasteurised.  That is a very grave danger to the stock of the country fed upon that milk and also to the population of the country which feed on that stock.  I draw particular attention of the House to a report of the Pig Industries Tribunal which sat in 1933 dealing with the question of tuberculosis in pigs.  The Parliamentary Secretary will find on page 38:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had evidence suggesting that in certain districts in the Saorstát where separated milk from creameries is largely used for the feeding of pigs the incidence of tuberculosis is considerably higher than in non-dairying districts.  One witness who had extensive experience of veterinary inspection of pigs in bacon factories deposed that he had observed that the percentage of tuberculous infection in pigs increased each year soon after the start of the seasonal increase in milk production, the percentage being always greater in summer and autumn and during winter months when milk is scarce. He handed in figures which showed the percentage of affected carcases in the six weeks ending 4th July, 1931, to be double the percentage in the six weeks ending 20th December, 1930.  The same witness informed us that he observed that pigs coming from farms where he knew large quantities of skim milk to be used were affected by tuberculosis to a greater extent than pigs coming from farms where skim milk was not so largely used.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to point out to the House that on some occasions separated milk is used as part of human food.  I was informed to-day by a Deputy with a close knowledge of the country districts that separated milk from the creameries is largely used for the making of bread.  I do not say that that is a grave danger to the health of the community but we should see that clean milk is used.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in his spare time he ought to read the report of the Pig Industries Tribunal, pages 38 and 39.  My fault with the Bill is on those points and also about the non-granting of the extra-territorial powers which we seek, and in regard to the financial arrangements.  I believe that the present Government or some future Government in the next few years will bring in an amending Bill, and I think that the present Bill's faults ought to be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary, who has sympathetically received some of the amendments which were put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we could we tried to help to make this Bill as good as possible.  While we welcome it I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to seek some of the cost of the administration of this Bill out of the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very regrettable if this experiment to provide supplies of clean milk were not worked in the spirit in which it ought to be worked.  If that is not done, it would be better it were not attempted at all.  There is no use in tinkering with a question like this. We should either do the thing well or not do it.  Even at this stage, the Parliamentary Secretary should make an effort to get the Government to <Col N="1790" /> subsidise this scheme in some shape or form.  If they do not, I cannot foresee in the immediate future any real effort being made by the local authorities to incur further expenditure in this regard, because that is what it means. Local authorities are being heavily taxed at the present time.  Their position is far from satisfactory and it is very regrettable that the wherewithal to bring a measure of this kind into operation&mdash;a measure of national importance&mdash;should have to be raised entirely and exclusively by the local authorities.  That is, I think, a great mistake.  In the Bill an honest effort to deal with the situation has been made.  I hope that the points which Deputy Belton has raised with regard to pasteurisation are not as serious as he appears to think they are.  If creameries and dairy societies can jump the regulations to the extent Deputy Belton alleges, it will be a very serious matter.  With the exception of these two points, I think that the Bill is quite a good one.  Because the Bill is supplying such a long-felt want, even though it embodies this very grave defect which I have mentioned&mdash;that local authorities must raise the funds for its operation&mdash;I do not feel disposed to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose this Bill. It is an attempt to saddle local authorities with the cost of the erection of pounds, not as the Government thinks they are required but as the sheriff thinks they are required.  Here, again, we are having authority centralised in one officer.  He is an officer of the State and not of the local authority. The local authority will have no control over these pounds but they will have to erect them and keep them in repair.  We maintain that the erection of these pounds is symbolic of the <Col N="1791" /> times in which we live.  The Minister will not agree with that but he will, at least, admit that he is introducing this measure at a very unfortunate time.  It is, undoubtedly, very unfortunate that he should see the necessity for this measure now.  We oppose the Bill because we think it is symbolic of the times in which we live and that the necessity for it has arisen out of Government policy.  We also <Col N="1792" /> oppose the measure because it is unfair to compel local authorities to erect pounds which they do not think are necessary because some other person thinks they are necessary.  If the Government thinks that these pounds are necessary and that they should be erected at the request of an officer of the Government, then the Government should foot the bill and not the local authorities.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,002,368 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1936, for the cost of the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts; certain administrative expenses in connection therewith and expenses under the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931.</P>
      <P>I want, first of all, to draw the attention of the House to an error that appears in page 305 in connection with the Vote.  There is an item, Superannuation, etc., Vote No. 16, appearing as £465,000, whereas it should be £465. That will bring down the total from £2,641,280 to £2,176,745.</P>
      <P>The Estimates of the Army Vote for the financial year 1935-36 are based on the following establishments:&mdash;Regular Army&mdash;583 officers, 5,300 other ranks, 16 nurses, 27 cadets and 9 chaplains; Class A Reserve&mdash;4,800 other ranks; Class B Reserve&mdash;1,000 other ranks; Reserve of Officers&mdash;250 officers, and Volunteer Force&mdash;22,000 all ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Regular Army, the number of officers shows an increase of <Col N="1794" /> 23, and that of other ranks a decrease of 50 as compared with the number provided for in the Estimate for 1934-35. Of the 23 officers, 16 are cadets who will be eligible for commissions during the financial year, four will be specially recruited for the Army Corps of Engineers, and the remaining three are three of five officers specially commissioned for scientific research in connection with experiments which are being carried out in the Army.  The number of other ranks provided for has been reduced by 50, but the total number of 5,300 represents the actual average strength maintained during the year 1934-35.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the number of Class A reservists from 5,200 to 4,800 is simply due to the discharge of men whose period of service in the reserve has expired.  This factor also explains the reduction of Class B reservists from 2,500 to 1,000, but while the A Reserve will continue to be fed by transfers from the Regular Army, the B Reserve will gradually disappear, because recruiting for it has ceased, and there will not, therefore, be any further transfers to it from the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>The Volunteer Reserve and the Officers' Training Corps have been disestablished consequent on the establishment of the Volunteer Force. Officers of the Volunteer Reserve have been for the most part transferred to the Reserve of Officers&mdash;a fact which explains the increase in that arm of the Reserve from 239 to 250.  Cadets of the Officers' Training Corps and the rank and file of the Volunteer Reserve have been given the option of transfer to the Volunteer Force or of taking their discharge on terms governed by the regulations relating to those units.</P>
    <P>The 22,000 all ranks provided for under the heading of the Volunteer Force comprise the following:&mdash;12,000 1st Line Volunteers enlisted and trained during 1934-35; 5,000 1st Line Volunteers to be enlisted and trained during 1935-36; 3,000 1st Line Volunteers to be enlisted but not trained during 1935-36; 1,000 2nd Line Volunteers enlisted and trained during 1934-35; 1,000 2nd Line Volunteers to be enlisted and trained during 1935-36.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> Further in pursuance of the policy of making this force self-contained, provision has been made for the pay of 3,500 non-commissioned and 100 commissioned officers who will have undergone and passed the required tests during the financial year 1934-35.</P>
    <P>Turning from the basis of the Estimate to the financial structure which has been erected upon it, we find that the total gross cost is £1,538,556, which represents a gross increase of £35,720, or, deducting Appropriations-in-Aid, a net increase of £26,637 on the amount granted in the financial year 1934-35. The Army Estimate, as it stands at present, is not a very compact structure, representing, as it does, many additions to the original structure, necessitated by the development of the Army. Instead, therefore, of dealing with the financial aspect sub-head by sub-head, we may get a clearer idea of what it involves if we deal with the figures under the four comprehensive headings of:&mdash; (a) Pay (including Cash Allowances); (b) Maintenance (including Rations, Clothing and Quartering); (c) Transport, and (d) Warlike Stores.</P>
    <P>Analysing the figures under those headings, this is what we find:&mdash; (a) Pay and Cash Allowances absorb £935,216; (b) Maintenance absorbs £426,643; (c) Transport takes £62,290, and (d) Stores take £114,397, making a total of £1,538,546.</P>
    <P>Now, stores and transport are common to all arms of the defence forces, so that it would not serve any useful purpose to determine how much is absorbed by each arm.  Omitting those two aspects, and concentrating on pay and maintenance, totalling £1,361,859, we find on analysis that the cost is distributed as follows:&mdash; (a) Regular Army (5,927 all ranks), £980,461; (b) Reserve (6,050 all ranks), £97,580; (c) Volunteer Force (22,000 all ranks), £146,335, and (d) Civilians, £137,483, making a total of £1,361,859.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion we stated that our defence policy was, briefly, to have a small standing highly-trained Army which would serve as a pivot around which might, if necessary, be organised, developed, and trained, the entire man-power of the State.  In the <Col N="1796" /> light of the figures just given it is clear that the most economical method of carrying out that policy, and of making full use of the standing Army is to develop the Volunteer Force along the lines begun during the past financial year.</P>
    <P>The cost of transport, £62,290, is made up as follows:&mdash; (a) mechanical transport, £26,490; (b) horse transport, £15,845, and (c) rail transport, £19,955, totalling £62,290.</P>
    <P>The cost of conveyance by rail shows a decrease on that for the previous year, but the provision for horse and mechanical transport has had to be increased in the case of the former, because of the increased cost of maintenance, and in that of the latter because of the necessity of renewing cars and lorries which have outlived the period of their economic existence.</P>
    <P>As regards stores, there is also an increase due to the necessity of renewing aircraft, which has become obsolete, and has had to be put out of commission.  In connection with stores generally, it should be noted that in relation to the total cost of the Army, we are spending less on warlike material and equipment than any other country in Europe, with the possible exceptions of Albania and Bulgaria. This is principally due to the fact that hitherto we have concentrated more on man-power than on mechanical power. We are not, of course, neglecting the aspect of mechanisation, and as far as our resources permit, we are making every effort to familiarise the Army with this new form of defence.  We are, for instance, training the troops in the use of modern tanks, new mechanical fighting vehicles, the latest pattern of trench mortars, the latest models of heavy and light machine guns, and the most up-to-date methods of wireless telephonic and telegraphic communication in the field.  Our efforts in this direction have so far been mainly experimental, but we hope with the lessons thereby acquired to provide the Army gradually with the most modern equipment which our resources can afford.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the formal printed Estimate, there are a few points which would seem to require explanation.  The <Col N="1797" /> first is the provision for compensation, sub-head U.  This is not a new sub-head, but a reinstatement of an old one.  Up to the year 1928-29 compensation was treated as a separate sub-head, but from that year, as the amount required was small, it was no longer treated separately but was included under sub-head X, &ldquo;incidental expenses.&rdquo;  This year, as the amount required has again become large, it has been decided to make it the subject of a special sub-head. It includes: (a) the former provision for compensation arising out of accidents in which Army vehicles are involved; (b) provision for property commandeered or damaged by the National Army which is necessitated by the passing of the Damage to Property Act, 1931, and (c) a new provision to compensate officers or men who are killed or injured during training, and who cannot be dealt with under the ordinary Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>There is also a new sub-head for &ldquo;Honoraria to Secretaries of Sluaighte.&rdquo;  This was included under sub-head C of the previous year's Vote, but as the secretaries are not strictly either civilian or military subjects of the Department, it has been decided to make separate provision for their service.  Included under sub-head X are two new items&mdash;one for a military tattoo, and the other for assistance to athletics and gliding.  For the former a token sum of £10 is required to authorise the holding of the tattoo, and for the latter a sum of £500 has been asked to promote by means of trophies, etc., the development of sport and athletics in the Army, and to enable the Department through the Army Air Corps to assist the development of gliding.</P>
    <P>At the military tattoo, which will be held in September, we hope to be able to give a demonstration of the Sokol system of physical culture, which, under the guidance of an officer of the Czecho-Slovakian Army, is being taught for some months past at the Military School at the Curragh.  Every modern nation has realised the importance of physical culture not only for its soldiers but also for the general body of its citizens.  In CzechoSlovakia, for instance, it has been <Col N="1798" /> inculcated as a national duty, and has formed no small part in the national revival of that country.  The characteristic of the Sokol system is that it stresses the sport, games, or playing aspect of the exercises, and thus eliminates the fatigue element in them. It is obvious that such a system opens up a wide vista of possibilities for developing physical culture in this country, and it is hoped that in time we shall be able through the medium of Army instructors to introduce the system into our schools and colleges, and thus stimulate the physical development of the nation.</P>
    <P>The outstanding fact of importance in the life of the Army during the year has been the development of the Volunteer force.  Applications for enrolment have exceeded all expectations; enlistments have been so numerous that we have had to seek the help of the ordinary civil medical practitioners in examining the applicants; and barracks have had to be opened as depots to provide training centres for recruits.  The training of the Volunteers has taxed the resources of the regular Army almost to the limit, but to the credit of both officers and men it must be said that they have thrown themselves into the work with energy and enthusiasm.  Many of the Volunteers after completing their initial training, have undergone special courses of training in the technical branches of Army service, and have returned to their local units as instructors.  Under the circumstances we have had to concentrate mainly on the development of the first line of the Volunteers, but during the coming year we hope to be able to give more attention to the organisation and training of the second and third lines, the recruitment of which has also been quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The physical well-being of the Army is excellent, its discipline even under the stress of the past year has been all that could be desired, and no higher tribute could be paid to its morale and efficiency than the manner in which it has during the year faced the task of handling and training some 5,000 reservists and some 12,000 Volunteers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In putting my name to a motion that this Estimate be referred back for further consideration, I want to make it clear that nobody on this side of the House has any objection either to Army payments or Army costs and that nobody on this side of the House has any criticism to offer with regard to Army administration or the conduct of the Army.  There is dissatisfaction, however, not only here but outside, with regard to the manner in which the Army has been used for the last 12 months and is being used.  The Army of Ireland is the plaything of no politician.  It is not the personal property of any political party, and it is unfair to the Army and to the country, and to all those who are depending on the Army for their safety, to attempt to appropriate that important institution of the State as the toy of politicians.</P>
      <P>All too frequently of late we have had, at great cost to the taxpayers, and merely for the political effect in the Party sense, the Army and the unfortunate personnel of the Army hurled from point to point merely to salute the political chiefs of a political Party.  There is no objection&mdash;and it is the custom here as well as elsewhere&mdash;to the President of the State or to the Minister for Defence or to any person representing either of them, being saluted at a march past, but it is going a little bit beyond the normal expectations to have Army units hurled helter-skelter all over the country in order to pay a tribute to every member of the political party in power&mdash;members of the Executive and Parliamentary Secretaries.  I think it would have taken nothing from the nation's tribute to St. Patrick if those various salutes had been taken by Army officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in addition to that, the Army hurled around from one political meeting to another, where their presence was not required, to the discomfort of the unfortunate officer in charge and to the irritation and aggravation of those attending and addressing the meeting, for the vindictive <Col N="1800" /> political purpose alone of giving the impression that those who oppose the present Government could only hold meetings under Army protection.  We have these parades being carried out as a bellicose gesture to any and all who happen to differ from Fianna Fáil in their political policy, even to their late comrades, the I.R.A., with the result that the Army was submitted to the humiliating position of being shelled with rotten eggs, or witnessing the Army's Minister being shelled with rotten eggs, merely in an attempt to carry out a political demonstration in a county that had changed its allegiance, or merely to enter into a political squabble between two sections in that particular county.</P>
    <P>The Army and the country went through difficult times, and times of political controversy, in the past, but never before this régime was there the same deliberate and determined attempt to use the Army as the political plaything of the Party in power.  It is not good for the Army. It is not good for the Party in power, nor is it good for the country.  I am pleased to stand up here, at a time when the Army is recognised by the present Minister for Defence, just as it is recognised by myself, as Ireland's Army and as the only Army that has a right to exist here.  Too often, in the past, however, we had to listen to the same Minister jibing and sneering at Ireland's Army.  I put down my name to this motion in order to make a protest against that kind of thing.  Precedents can be established&mdash;good, healthy precedents, and dangerous, unhealthy precedents&mdash;and the present Government is neither the first nor the last Government in this country.  If we allow that type of precedent to be established and to go unchallenged, little by little others will come to use that Army more and more for political purposes and political demonstrations, relying on the discipline, loyalty, and good conduct of the personnel of the Army; but it is a thing that should be discouraged irrespective of what side of this House we sit on and irrespective of what political Party badge or label we carry on our coats.</P>
    <P>We have in advance of us a big <Col N="1801" /> military demonstration planned for Easter.  There is to be a big military parade in the streets of Dublin in order to bolster up and attract attention to, and attract the crowd for, a Fianna Fáil flag-day to be held in the city at the same time and at the same hour. The Minister has had passed on to him a splendid, efficient, and highly disciplined Army; an Army whose conduct is of the best both in and out of barracks, on duty and off duty.  It is a mistake to be playing tricks by forcing these men, who had been detached from politics, back into the arena of controversial politics.  It is neither fair to the Army nor to your Party or to this Party.</P>
    <P>The Army must be above and outside of politics.  It is a mere accident that a politician must be Minister for Defence and he should not attempt to stamp his political views on the Army. Neither should he attempt to associate the Army with his political parades.</P>
    <P>The last 12 months have shown a disastrous turn in the affairs of the Army, and a thing about which a word of warning has to be raised, and I hope that the protest I am making and the words I am using will be taken in the spirit in which they are given.  It is the duty of the Army to obey and the minister should be proud of the obedience he has got.  As a little return for or tribute to the good conduct and discipline of Ireland's Army, he should refrain from provoking anything like a spirit of tacit resentment of the instructions he issues to that Army.  He will get support; he will get obedience; and a little human charity and understanding from him is due to them.  If there were a change of Government or a change of Ministers to-morrow and some other body and some other Party sat over there, I would still resent any attempt by that Party or that Minister to march or transport the Army around from point to point in order to pay tribute to second-bench politicians or to bolster up the flag-day of a political Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister is treading on very thin ice.  His political anxieties were sufficiently pronounced in the formation of the new reserve forces.  In order to <Col N="1802" /> show that they were different from Ireland's Army and the personnel of that Army he deliberately went out of his way to provide different uniforms and to officer that new group by rabid politicians who had been so violent in their political activities that they had been leaders in arms against the Army of which he is head to-day.  Every one of us could encourage the growth and the spread and development of a Volunteer reserve in this country, but why pick out the men, bring them home from abroad, who had been in arms against the National Army in order to officer that new Volunteer reserve force?  Neither the Army nor the people over here can forget that when seats were changed we had on the Army Estimate year after year the voice of the man who is now President of the Executive Council crying out against the continued existence of a standing Army in this country and pointing out that sooner or later it had to be replaced by some form of Volunteer reserve.  Has his policy on that point changed like so many other things?  If it has not changed, is the Army to welcome this new force that the President has brought into being to wipe out the Army itself?</P>
    <P>We have listened to the numbers read out by the Minister.  This new semi-political force numbers 22,000 and the standing Army and the A Reserve and the B Reserve number approximately 7,000.  Is the Minister rapidly reaching the point where he can carry out the President's policy as enunciated from this bench?  Are members of the standing Army, who have given good service to him and his predecessors to see the day approaching when they will be told: &ldquo;Go; we have sufficient of the new force to take on your duties?&rdquo; If the Minister wants this reserve more generally supported inside and outside the Army it has to be made clear that no force is growing in this country outside the gates of the barracks that is going to tell those within: &ldquo;Get out; others will carry out your functions.&rdquo; If the Minister wants this or any other reserve more generally supported he has to see that <Col N="1803" /> it is officered by men free from rabid political views.  If we have to appreciate the fact that vested interests have been created, rightly or wrongly, and that a man taken out of a job and put into an Army appointment is entitled to some security of tenure, then I suggest to the Minister that those officering that new force should be sent into areas where they had no previous associations of a violent nature.  I think that is only fair to the people.</P>
    <P>The ordinary Deputy sitting behind the Minister, the ordinary man who wears uniform in this country, does not stand for reviving old spleens and bitterness.  It would be as unwise to send prominent members of the National Army back into areas where there was hot blood and hard fighting, and station them in some kind of semi-permanent position, as it was unwise to do what the Minister has done.  I suggest that if there was some necessity for a political gesture at the beginning the mere figures he has read out show that he has reached the point where there is no necessity for such a gesture; that it will be misunderstood; that it will give cause for uneasiness; that it will create uneasiness in the Army, as well as undermining the confidence of the public. The Minister should meet people on this side as far as possible in ensuring that Ireland's Army will get the support of all.  We stood for that in the past; we stand for it now; we want to support that Army and every uniformed branch of that Army; and it should not be made difficult for us, and difficult for recruits down the country, and as far as committees have a political complexion, and as far as the officers are definitely stamped with a political brand, that particular situation should be remedied in the interests of all.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister, when referring to the reduction in the strength of the Army reserves, say that the strength of the Army reserves had been reduced by those who had completed their service or were time-expired. From my own knowledge, I am definitely of opinion that that statement <Col N="1804" /> was not strictly accurate.  There have been many members of the Army reserve dismissed or removed from the reserve, not because they had served their period, or because they were time expired, but because they showed and exercised the citizen's right to support the political organisation of Fine Gael.  They were removed for no sufficiently stated reason, but the world knows that it is because of their support of Fine Gael that they were removed from the Army reserve.  When I say Fine Gael I include the League of Youth.  But we have not heard of any regulation or of any removal from the reserve because of reservists' associations with the Irish Republican Army.  There has got to be very strict justice at the head of the Army.</P>
    <P>There has got to be very careful handling not only of those in the Army but of reservists outside the Army. When a reservist goes out into civilian life he does not shed any of his citizen's rights or of his citizen's privileges. His support for any political party should not be made a condition of his continuing on the reserve.  A reservist has a perfect right to support a political party opposed to the Minister, and should not be penalised by losing his position and losing his few pence a day.  That has been done with an intensity and a ferocity in the past 18 months that are surprising even in the Minister for Defence.  It is just on a par with what I said earlier with regard to the use of the Army.  By every act and every gesture there is a deliberate and dangerous attempt to steep the Army in politics, or to dictate the politics of the personnel of the Army, inside and outside barracks.</P>
    <P>The League of Youth is an organisation which has a perfect right to exist.  In case there was any doubt as to whether it would be unjustly treated in the same way as previous organisations, they were not afraid to go and invoke the advice and protection of the courts of the land.  What right has any Minister to say: &ldquo;Because you belong to that organisation you will not belong to Ireland's Army?&rdquo; If he understood the minds and aims of the men who constitute <Col N="1805" /> that organisation he would understand that if the Army ever wants a friend in any crisis it will be to the members of that organisation it will turn.  The whole thing is stamped with the mark of the political tyrant at the head, dictating to the people who happen to be his subordinates for the time being. It is wrong; it is disgraceful; it is doing the Government no good, and it should cease.</P>
    <P>With regard to political meetings, it is unwise to send Army units to those meetings.  I do not know what their orders are.  I have seen violence at meetings where the Army was present, and it was quite clear that it would not do for the Army to intervene.  If it was unwise for the Army to intervene&mdash;and I agree that it was&mdash;what was the point in sending them to such meetings?  I saw a big party of steel-hatted troops at a Fine Gael meeting at Dundalk, in the Minister's constituency. Was the Minister so very solicitous for our safety in his own constituency? Did he know so very much about the elements which supported him that he thought life would not be safe?  We had the Army standing by, inactive, and properly so.  We do not care what the Army costs provided the people get value for it and provided the Army is allowed to give the value it is capable of giving, but an Army confined to barracks when evil conditions flourish in the country, an Army released from barracks only for political effect on political occasions, is not going to be of value to the people. It is not going to be subscribed to willingly by the people.  The Army is willing to protect and capable of protecting the people against any armed menance, and we are not unaware of armed menances in this country.  What is there in the Army distribution to indicate that the Army is even allowed to do its job in that regard?  We have the Army deprived of a national intelligence system.  The whole intelligence system has been transferred to another body.  The Army is left to rely on secondhand information, and is possibly drinking out of poisoned wells.  That is not a sound position in which to have the Army.  We have <Col N="1806" /> some subterranean rumblings, and very evident activity here and there, but what function or what liberty has the Army?  Towards what end is it being used?  The biggest menace I see for the people of this country comes from within and little by little we have the Army becoming concentrated at certain points.  From a purely military point of view that might be all right, but from the point of view of the county or from the point of view of the citizen who has only the Army to rely on for protection, it is anything but sound.  Now that the Army is highly trained, now that its conduct is beyond question, and that certain latitude has promoted the growth of other organisations in the country, I would suggest that the time has come when the Army should be more generally distributed throughout the country.  I know that the Army is strong enough to face and break any menance that will grow up within this country, but it will take time before contact is established.  It will take time before the Army is spread out through the various counties.  What about the taxpayer inside those counties during the interval?  Does he not count?</P>
    <P>History and experience tell us that when there is any kind of violence and that kind which will be directed against persons and property, that the last target for such activities will be the Army itself.  And we will have that interval, be it long or short, between the time when violence raises its head and the Army gets out and establishes contact.  The Army was thrown in, sucked into the central pivot, because there had been no previous time for training, because discipline had to be instilled in the troops, because perfect contact had got to be insured.  There is nobody now nervous about the discipline or conduct of the Army.  I believe that if it is to be really the type of insurance for people that the people know it could be, and if you really want to instil into the minds of the people that they have an article there that is well worth paying for, I would say the Army should be more widely distributed.  It will reassure <Col N="1807" /> the citizens throughout the counties. It will show the people what they are paying for, and the people will understand that they are paying for it.  The Army Vote and Army costs would be given more freely by the general public if the Army was more widely distributed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister, in the course of his remarks with regard to this new reserve, point out that it had increased so rapidly that civilian medical <i>personnel</i> has got to be requisitioned to deal with it.  Before the Minister stated that at all I had noticed the numbers of the medical officers in the Army&mdash;very small numbers indeed. The numbers are given in a way in which it is rather difficult to dissociate or to separate the doctors from the dentists.  The total number is 29 and I take it that there is no doctor with a rank lower than captain so that there are 23 doctors and six dentists. If the present <i>personnel</i> of that corps with the service is insufficient to deal with the present ordinary situation, should not the numbers be increased? Personally I am satisfied&mdash;it is my opinion for what it is worth&mdash;that the numbers are entirely inadequate.  If there are 23 doctors and each man is entitled to a month's leave in the year, that means that there are really always two of them on leave and that brings down the number to 21.  Rather than calling in civilian doctors I would suggest to the Minister this point: we all know with regard to recruiting that recruits and recruitment are of quite a different standard in the case of military doctors and civilian doctors.  It is an important thing for an Army to have uniformity to the very greatest extent.  If you have 1,000 men recruited according to one medical standard and another 1,000 recruited according to an entirely different medical standard you have nothing like the uniformity that is desirable in an Army.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that the strength of that particular corps should be increased rather than have the system which the Minister says has already been adopted.</P>
    <P>Then take these figures again and <Col N="1808" /> assuming that the six lieutenants are dentists, I suggest to him that the time has come when those six lieutenants should disappear and be replaced by six captains.  One profession is in no way inferior to the other.  The professions are co-equal.  The last lieutenant-doctor has been promoted captain and the dentist is a lieutenant since 1922-1923. He has been ten years there doing his job efficiently, giving satisfaction to all or he would not be there still.  Is there to be no avenue to promotion open to that particular profession?  Is there any particular military necessity for keeping the dental lieutenant down all the time? Surely he is a far more valuable man now either as a dentist or as an officer than he was ten years ago.  When this particular Estimate comes next before the House I hope we will have the number of captains increased by the number of lieutenants and that none of the present or existing lieutenants will still be lieutenants.</P>
    <P>I have heard many complaints&mdash;I do not know and I am not in a position to say exactly what grounds there are for them&mdash;that there has been a fairly deliberate pruning out of members of the Army who were previously in the British Army.  I have heard that complaint from so many different sources that I am slow to doubt it.  I want to know definitely and clearly from the Minister if those particular men who served in the British Army and subsequently enrolled in Ireland's Army are being thrown out now.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the nearest thing to a professional soldier is the man who served in the British Army and then had a ten or 12 years' period in our Army.  Leaving sentiment and all that kind of thing on one side, if the Army is as efficient as we are proud to say it is to-day, if it is highly trained and highly skilled, we have got to recognise that to a very great extent that was done by the men who had previous experience and who freely gave their experience and their knowledge to building up and making a competent and capable Army in the country.  Now because the Army is trained to a very great extent by these men, it seems like biting the hands that <Col N="1809" /> fed you to turn around and jerk all these men out of the Army and throw them aside as is done with an orange that is squeezed.  These men gave their knowledge and their services and loyalty to make the Army the credit that it is to the country, and they should get fairer treatment than we have heard they are getting.</P>

      <P>I desire to second this resolution.  The very fact that the Minister whose usual reception on his Estimates in this House had been very sympathetic in previous years has drawn on himself the criticism that Deputy O'Higgins spoke of this evening, shows the position that has arisen. The Minister found an Army which was above politics.  It was above personalities. He had a difficulty in many ways in approaching the situation, and the belief that that was so, the speeches and acts of the Minister and his colleagues up to the very date of taking office would have prevented him realising that he was approaching the administration of an Army that was, as I said, above politics and above personalities. It is to his credit that he was not long in realising that, and if there has been so little of criticism on the Army administration up to the present it is because everybody recognises in spite of his difficulties in the matter, that when he found an Army like that, he appreciated the situation and dealt with it on the merits as he found it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy, because it is a tragedy, of the present situation is that the political difficulties into which the Government have got themselves, arising out of their general economic and political policies, are of such a nature now that every expedient is tried to either meet these difficulties or overcome them, and in a despairing kind of way, it would appear that the Army during the past nine months, has been thrown into the political situation and is being monkeyed with for the purpose of seeing whether by using it politically it cannot be made help to get the Government out of some of its political difficulties.  The Minister cannot but realise in his heart that he is only <Col N="1810" /> creating additional difficulties, not only for the Government but for the country generally, and as Dr. O'Higgins said, we come to a peak point in a situation developing over the past nine months when we find the Army brought to Dublin on Easter Sunday to be made the centre-piece of a collection for the Fianna Fáil political Party's funds.</P>
    <P>This House last year in a Supplementary Estimate, voted £1,000 for the purchasing of a piece of sculpture with the intention of placing it in the General Post Office and unveiling it sometime as a monument for the men of 1916.  There was a criticism of that proposal from these benches when that Estimate was brought before us. There has been no announcement that this House knows of, that it is proposed officially to unveil the memorial on Easter Sunday, but we have seen Press notices that the Minister has met a number of persons and formed a committee&mdash;it is probably called an Easter Week Memorial Committee&mdash; to control and look after some kind of demonstration to take place in the city on Easter Sunday on the occasion of the unveiling by the President.</P>
    <P>It was announced about 21st March that the Minister had seen representatives of seven different bodies.  That they had agreed to form this committee.  We have seen notices in the papers from this committee apparently inviting persons to apply to them in connection with partaking in this type of commemoration, and taking their places in the procession. We saw in the Press of April 1st a notice that three of these bodies, although they unanimously agreed to form the committee, have dissociated themselves from it.  We do not know whether it is an official committee but whatever kind of committee it is, it now seems to be broken up by political disagreements.  We do not know whether this committee is to control and direct the Army's march on that occasion or whether the parties applying are going to take part in the procession with the Army, or whether it is a different procession, but we do know that the Dublin Corporation has <Col N="1811" /> been invited by this committee, as if it were an official committee, to take part in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Everything about the procedure of the committee and the notices that the Fianna Fáil Party intends to hold a flag-day on Palm Sunday and on other days in Holy Week, and on Easter Sunday, gives it the complexion of a Fianna Fáil Party political demonstration, and the Army is brought into the picture to be the centre-piece of the whole lot, and the Army, as far as we can understand, is to include the Army drawn from every county in the country, the new Volunteer force, as well as the Regular Army.  This is the culminating point of developments which have taken place during the last 12 months.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, the Minister has never been criticised with regard to expenditure on the Army.  Those who sit on the Front Benches had their own ideas as to what should be spent on an army before they got into power.  Speaking at Waterford shortly before he came into power, Mr. de Valera, to take the extreme, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Army was never necessary. It was kept there by people who believed they would not be left in power if Republican and Nationalist Irishmen could be in one common assembly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was three months before he took over office.  The Army was not necessary, but in March, 1932, the expenditure on it was £1,247,000.  The Minister is now asking us to expend £1,503,000.  The Estimates have risen. They were up last year and, no doubt, a considerable part of the increase was due to the creation of the new Volunteer force.  Nobody has particularly criticised the Minister in his scheme for developing the Volunteer side of the Army in the particular way he has planned.  He tells us his idea is to have a small trained Army and to develop a Volunteer force around it.  Personally, I have my doubts whether he is doing it in the proper way, but I am willing to give the Minister all the benefit of the doubt, and I am willing not to criticise his <Col N="1812" /> expenditure on the Volunteer side of the Army or in either the organising or administrative aspect of it, but we do require to know from a Minister who got an Army entirely above politics and entirely above personalities, what kind of an Army he is going to hand over to any successors of his?</P>
    <P>He need only look around him to see the type of speeches made by various members of his Party and the various units of his organisation to see that in the rest of the country some kind of an answer is wanted.  In February last, the Fianna Fáil Executive in Kerry devoted some attention to the Army, and in a rather elaborate statement issued by it and published in the <i>Irish Press</i> of February 8th, they said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Instead of `perpetuating and popularising the same Free State Army of 1922-23,' the Government has proceeded to displace it by a new Volunteer Army, built on a new system and with a predominantly new personnel.  The latter are young men who were not involved in the civil war.  Their inclusion is a more commendable step towards the noble objective of ending the legacy of hatred and disunion left by the civil war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have a Fianna Fáil Executive telling us that the regular Army is to be displaced by a new volunteer Army.  We have, as Deputy O'Higgins said, a movement which developed very definitely within the last year of getting rid of members of the League of Youth and ex-members of the British Army.  When we see tendencies of that particular kind and when we see statements made by the Fianna Fáil Executive, we are invited to ask the Minister here whether he is going to hand over an Army above politics and above personalities.  If the Minister is thinking in terms of a citizen army he should, in his administration, appeal to the manly thought and instincts that are in the country. The Minister, in my opinion, is deliberately trampling on the manly instincts of a very big part of the population, or rather he is trampling down a big part of the population and spurning them from his citizen <Col N="1813" /> force.  The Minister cannot shut his eyes to the fact that if there did arise in 1932 and 1933 a particular movement amongst certain young men in this country&mdash;that they were not going to be put down and pulled off political platforms by any particular political Party or any other crowd&mdash;that the attitude of himself and his colleagues to the political circumstances of 1932 was entirely responsible for it. He is blind to the fact that the present Minister for Justice called upon the country, as it were, to get the accursed crowd out of the way and the accursed crowd were people who went to various parts of the country to political meetings to discuss matters affecting Irish politics and Irish economics.  The Minister knows it was necessary&mdash;if a big section of our people were not to have their months shut and their minds beaten down&mdash; for some young men to come out and assist the State forces, as they did, to get freedom of public speech, a right for which this country has striven for many generations where people fought for it and worked for it.  It suited the political managers of the Minister's Party and the Ministers themselves to brand these men as forces of lawlessness and disorder that challenge their particular movement.  The Minister should remember that last year he continued to apply that brand to those who were members of the League of Youth and, in reply to a Parliamentary question in May last, he indicated that in a number of different counties he had discharged from the reserve before their time and without any reason being given 61 members because they were members of the League of Youth.  Quite a number have been discharged since. A number of these were not members of the League of Youth but they mended boots or made clothes for or had some social connection with the League of Youth and they were put out of the Army.  The Minister is aware that what Dr. O'Higgins says with regard to the ex-servicemen is only too true.  While he knows that he himself in, say, an area like West Donegal is glad to avail himself of <Col N="1814" /> the services of an ex-British soldier to train some members of the Sluagh, nevertheless, playing up to some of the lower instincts of his own political followers he runs a vendetta against members of the Army who were in the British Army.  And he has in several cases inflicted hardships on families in putting them out of the Army.  I would like to think that recently he has changed, but there are particular cases that have come to my personal knowledge and I feel that any change in the situation is brought about by the fact that he could not stand over some of the cases in which families of men who served for many years in the Army would have been evicted out of the Army houses and put on the roadside without a house or prospect of employment for the ex-soldier.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to think of the Army as a machine, not because a mere piece of machinery is going to be of any use to the country but because if the Army is not thought of as a machine, there will neither be a national spirit nor any other kind of spirit in it.  If the Army is to be the cockpit of politics, it is not going to have any national spirit but it will have all the friction and disagreement which it is possible to bring in amongst a crowd of men.  One thing will make the Army national.  It is the same thing which will make it effective&mdash;to look at it purely from the point of view of technical efficiency and sound administration, a body with a definite service to give to the country.  If it is the Minister's thought that the Army can throw open its physical instructors' training to the country, that would be a national service probably as great as the Army in 1935, 1936 or 1937 will be called upon to give.  That is a service which has been very badly neglected up to the present by the Department of Education.  Even if the Minister thinks that that service can be rendered by the Army at present, or in the next few years, then, for the purpose of rendering that service alone, he ought to keep the Army clear of the type of politics that are gathering around it at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> We do not know what to think with regard to the political tendencies of the new Volunteer reserve.  As has been already said, if it was necessary to salute anybody on St.  Patrick's Day, they ought to have saluted the military officer.  What is going to be the effect on this Volunteer force of being brought to Dublin on Easter Sunday and made the cockpit of an ugly political kind of fight?  If the Minister brought together a group of societies only two or three weeks ago for the purpose of running this commemoration and if they have split in half, does he think that no reflex of that is going to reach the various Volunteer units throughout the country?  It is quite impossible to think that it will not reach them.  I should like to know from the Minister what exactly is to be the function and the position of the Army on Easter Sunday next.  Again, I remind the Minister that he has never been exposed to criticism of any kind on his Estimate here.  We do realise that, approaching the Army with wrong views about it, he took the situation as he found it and that, in the early stages of his administration of the Army, no complaint could be made.  He has obviously reversed his thought with regard to the Army and, if we criticise him now, it is because we see he is developing in a direction which is going to leave us with an Army which not only will be no use but which will have lurking in it all kinds of serious dangers.</P>

      <P>Now that all the experts have voiced their views, I think it is time that an ordinary back-bencher should have an innings.  The experts have intervened not for the purpose of improving the situation but for the purpose of throwing sand into the cogs of the machine.  Deputy Mulcahy made use of the historic words: &ldquo;The Minister found an Army above personalities and above politics.&rdquo; It would be well if the sponsors of that Army&mdash;the sponsors who attempted to justify their actions in the past in regard to the Army&mdash;were as much above personalities and politics as is <Col N="1816" /> the Army for which they pretend to speak.  &ldquo;The whole thing is stamped with the political tyrant in the saddle.&rdquo; There you have personalities; there you have politics.  Would to God those men who attempt to speak for the Army would follow the example of the Army and avoid personalities and politics.  &ldquo;The whole thing is stamped with a political tyrant in the saddle.&rdquo; Who is the political tyrant who is in the saddle?  Is it the present Minister for Defence?  During the past two years I have been speaking to several members of the regular Army.  They were ordinary privates and one and all assured me that conditions in the Army had improved tenfold under the régime of the present Minister for Defence. A little human charity, Deputy O'Higgins said, would not be out of place.  He ought to adopt that advice. I never heard such a vitriolic farrago of nonsense as I heard from Deputy O'Higgins on a number of occasions here.  His very manner, his aggresiveness and his tone of voice, would turn blood to gall in any man's veins.  A little human charity would not be out of place in the case of Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the regular Army&mdash;scores of them&mdash;during the past two years have told me&mdash;they were not members of our particular political creed&mdash;that the conditions in the Army were tenfold better under the régime of the present Minister for Defence than they were under the régime of the last Minister for Defence.  So much for the human charity of which Deputy O'Higgins speaks so soothingly.  &ldquo;The whole thing is stamped with the political tyrant in the saddle.&rdquo;  Is there any human charity in that? &ldquo;Physician, cure thyself.&rdquo;  So far as the Volunteers are concerned, they have come to stay.  Deputy O'Higgins's speech, from the first word to the last, was an attempt to drive a wedge of discord between the Volunteers and the regular Army.  It was a deliberate and malign effort of which he only would be capable.  He referred to &ldquo;Ireland's Army.&rdquo;  Ergo, the Volunteers are not Ireland's Army.  Why not call it the Irish Army?  I say emphatically that the <Col N="1817" /> Volunteers are Ireland's Army.  They are here and they have come to stay. If there is one criticism I would offer, it is that their remuneration is not nearly sufficient for their service&mdash;the service they have already rendered and the service which, I am sure, they will render in the future.</P>
    <P>The regular Army has, as a matter of fact, welcomed the Volunteers. Captains, lieutenants and other officers of the Volunteer corps who foregathered with the National Army on the occasion of the inception of the Volunteer scheme told me that the National Army received them with open arms, that there was perfect cordiality, amity and agreement between them.  That agreement has remained.  Deputies on the opposite side have sought to introduce the apple of discord&mdash;Deputies who, save the mark, pose as champions of the Army. They are not in a sweat about the Army except in so far as it affects their own interests.  Their sole grievance is that they are where they are now and that we are now where they were and where they will never be.  That is their grievance.  We are told: &ldquo;You found the Army above personalities and above politics.&rdquo;  The Army is as much above politics as it ever was.  But that does not suit the book of Deputies opposite.  They talk of military panoply and of the Army being used in connection with some function on Easter Sunday.  Has it every been used in connection with other functions &mdash;in connection with Cenotaph functions, for instance?</P>

      <P>I merely put the question and I am glad it found a billet.  The Volunteer force has been subjected to malign criticism from the opposite benches.  Remarks have been made about men having been brought from abroad.  I wonder why that is so much harped upon.  The men brought home from abroad are as popular in their <Col N="1818" /> areas as any men could be.  I can vouch for that.  The Volunteers are officered by men who fought for Ireland and I think the Volunteer units should not be subjected to undue criticism. They are here and they will stay here. Fantastic theories have been put forward with a view to discrediting the present Army administration.  It is a good old lawyer maxim&mdash;&ldquo;throw mud and some of it will stick.&rdquo;  If I were to deal with some other aspects of the criticism of Deputies opposite, I might say too much.  I do not want to do that.  I should like the Minister to look into the question of the adequacy of the remuneration of the Volunteers.  They are the nucleus of Ireland's Army.</P>
      <P>The idea was a brilliant idea and the inception of the Volunteers was also brilliant.  I see no reason why the Volunteer scheme should not become even a more brilliant success than it is. Everywhere they went, the Volunteers impressed the people of the country. The Volunteers' organisation is not a fool-proof organisation.  No more is the regular Army, or any other army.  The Volunteer movement was hastily got up.  It has been only a year or two in existence, and I think the Volunteers have fully justified the ideas of those responsible for the scheme.  I submit to the Minister respectfully that he should recompense the Volunteers a little more generously than he has hitherto done.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>From this side of the House, adverse criticism has often been directed at the Government for failure to carry out the promises contained in the speeches of its members before it came into power.  I want on this occasion to congratulate the Government on not having carried out its promises or threats of that time.  Many people thought that, when the present Government came into power, it would take certain action with regard to the Army which would have been disastrous.  I myself had no fear upon that score because I knew perfectly well that when Fianna Fáil came into power it would necessarily and inevitably realise that the Army is the one thing that stands between this country and anarchy.  Consequently, I think <Col N="1819" /> the Government was moved by commonsense in that it maintained the Army as it had been maintained before and very largely avoided bringing a political complexion into it. Consequently, my criticisms are not going to be in any way acrimonious and not going to be the sort that would excite my friend, Deputy Kehoe who seems to be excitable.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to raise.  The Minister says, and, I think, quite rightly, that the Army should be a small nucleus, a very highly-trained body of men, around which would be built a loose framework of men who will not be given that highly specialised training.  In his remarks on the points of expenditure involved in the Estimate, he referred to 16 cadets.  Obviously, an Army formed in the way the Minister says must have very highly-trained officers.  The highly&mdash;trained professional officer cannot be got through the ordinary channels of recruitment and promotion. He must be got quite young and given a training specifically directed towards the capacity he will fill as an army officer.  I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the 16 cadets.  One or two things during the last couple of years, including statements by the Minister himself, led me to believe that the system of recruiting cadets, that is to say, having a young man come up at the beginning for training as an officer and, then, commissioned as an officer and to continue that training during his officer career, had been given up and that there was some proposal of getting men to join the Volunteers and ultimately absorbing them into the regular Army and making officers of them.  I hope I am right in understanding from the Minister, when he refers to these 16 cadets, that that system of recruiting by examination and by interview and giving cadets the training that was previously given is being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel for the Army, for certain people not in the Army and for myself, a certain indignation and certain amount of grief by reason of <Col N="1820" /> the treatment the Minister gave to a body of civilians, into whose selection political considerations never entered, who came forward to do very useful and very necessary work, for men in the Army to-day and men who were in the Army but who are no longer in it.  In the case of the ordinary soldier, no provision is made for his retiring on pension.  He does not get a large gratuity and a great many men, having given good service in the Army, particularly at a time when the Army was most immediately necessary, went out, having lost their place, as you might say, in civilian life and, in their new condition of civil life, were at a definite disadvantage through the service they had given in the Army.  We had no provision for assisting them out of State funds and we asked people to come forward and organise some machinery for giving financial assistance to such of those men as might need it.  That organisation was in operation when our Government went out of office. I presumed, and I was justified in presuming, that the new Government was going to behave as we did and have much the same attitude towards the Army as we had.  It was justified 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Committee of the Army Benevolent Fund, one of their means of operating was to run, in Horse Show Week, a dance, the proceeds of which, which were very considerable, were to be used for assisting necessitous cases amongst the men and their families who had been in the Army and who had gone into civil life.  That committee was no respecter of one Government more than another.  It set out to do really good work and the members were perfectly prepared&mdash;there was no question of their resenting the change in the control of the Army&mdash;to carry on just as before.  The Minister refused to co-operate, although, in his position as a Minister of the Government, he must have recognised that he was beholden and indebted to those people. Not so much more than a year ago, to my knowledge, communication after communication was sent to the Minister <Col N="1821" /> which he had not the ordinary decency to answer.  The last I heard was that this committee, being unable to get an answer from the Minister and not being assured of the co-operation of the Minister, decided that there was nothing for them to do but to dissolve.</P>
    <P>That was an affront to people who had come forward to give selfless service on behalf of men who needed such service, and it was also most unfair to those men who may need that assistance.  This Army Benevolent Fund Committee ran a number of things in addition to the Horse Show Week dance, and the moneys thus got were distributed to the assistance of those men.  So far as I can gather&mdash;I am quite ready to be corrected by the Minister&mdash;as a result, not of the Minister's action, but of his failure to act in a manner which certainly would not have hurt him in any way, the men are deprived of that assistance which they previously got and which they probably need as much now as they ever did before from that Army Benevolent Fund Committee which has gone out of existence.</P>
    <P>When the Minister took over, there were various branches of the Army. The Volunteer force had been started, but only in Dublin, I think, and I personally was glad to see that the Minister took advantage of his particularly advantageous position as compared with mine to extend the Volunteer system in the Army.  I am not being political or Party or anything like that because every Fianna Fáil Deputy here knows it perfectly well when I say that if, for instance, we had run the Volunteer force in the various parts of the country as the Minister is doing at the moment, there would have been definite and active hostility led by the Fianna Fáil clubs and by the Fianna Fáil leaders to it.  When we started the O.T.C., Fianna Fáil supporters proceeded to make trouble in University College, Dublin.  I am very glad to know that the Volunteer force is going on as well as it is.</P>
    <P>The O.T.C. was drawn mainly from students at the universities.  The average life of students at the universities happens to coincide with the very <Col N="1822" /> best time for training for military service. These young men, presumably, have their minds already trained and made apperceptive by higher education. While students they are young and their day's work and their year's work is not as continuous as it is in the case of men earning their living.  They are, by the fact of their education, as I say, particularly apperceptive for training and for acquiring the knowledge that is required.  I do not quite know what the Minister's attitude is, but I do know, and I am speaking now of individual cases, that during the last year, two members of the O.T.C. whom I happened to meet complained that they, being members of the O.T.C., knew that normally, under the regulations of their membership, they were due to be called up to go to camp for, roughly, a fortnight during the year. They knew also that, at the end of that fortnight, they were to draw a sum of money&mdash;a payment, gratuity or honorarium or whatever you like to call it&mdash;and, therefore, in the economy of their year's life, they anticipated that fortnight which they would spend in camp and the sum of money they would get at the end of it.  I do not know what the Minister ultimately did, but I do know that, as last year progressed, some members of the O.T.C. hung about and postponed their holidays. They were unable to make arrangements because they were not quite sure when they were going to be called up, and month after month went by without their knowing when they were going to be called up or if they were going to be called up.  Neither did they know whether or not they were going to get the money which they had anticipated having as of right.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the importation of outsiders as officers for the Volunteers.  I personally resented that because that act was an act of injustice to officers in the Army.  There are men who are lieutenants and second lieutenants in the Army&mdash;I am not quite sure what the position is; the Minister knows it better than I do&mdash; who have been in that position for a very long time, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the Army, which was formed only about 12 years or so ago <Col N="1823" /> and in which higher officers were much the same age as younger officers.  Every development of the Army which permitted, opened a place for men who had not been promoted, through no fault of their own, but merely because there was a sort of static position in regard to officers and there was not the natural out-flow of men of retiring age. I suggest that it was an injustice to import outsiders into the Army, putting them over men who had done training as cadets, men who had been officers for a number of years.  These men were brought into the Army and given special preference.  Of course, that is all over and we do not need to worry about it, but nevertheless that is what happened.</P>
    <P>I presume that in the inner circles of the Government, if an argument were required to justify that, the Government would say that they thought it was nationally desirable that the I.R.A. and other revolutionary organisations should be placated and that by bringing in men who had been engaged in operations against this State they would be indicating that the Army was no Party Army and that the men acting in one particular manner in 1922 had equal rights there with other men.  I can imagine an argument being put up in that way and it would possibly have commanded a certain amount of agreement, but during the last year we have seen, time and again, that men who responded to the Minister's call and who joined the new Volunteer force were assaulted.  I remember one case of a man who was chained near the Dominican Church in Tralee and I remember other men whose houses were raided and whose uniforms were seized; some of them were even court-martialled by the I.R.A.  These men had come forward as citizens to give service in the country's Army, while still carrying on their civil avocations.</P>
    <P>There is an unlawful association, an association which aims at creating a condition of anarchy here, which by the ends it proposes and the means it makes use of is the enemy of social order in this country, and that unlawful organisation, fulfilling the definitions <Col N="1824" /> that make an unlawful society under Article 2 (a) of the Constitution, has been left practically immune by the Government. The Government has power to ban that organisation.  It can bring members of that organisation before the Military Tribunal, charge them with nothing else but that they are members of it, and they are due to be punished by law for that.  Here were members of that organisation brutally attacking the persons and the property of men for the reason that those men answered the Government's call, and the Government failed to use the power the law gives it for getting after these people. I say it was a negative act of betrayal of the men who came forward to serve the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope the point is being reached when the Government will act in a manner that will indicate to the members of this revolutionary organisation that they are not going to be tolerated any longer, that Irish citizens are going to be freed from their menace and that the Irish citizen who volunteers his service to the Government is not going to be the target for their attacks. It seems to me that the Government has failed there.  It owed a duty to the citizens of the country and a particular duty to those citizens who came forward and volunteered their services.  The other day the President said something like this: &ldquo;We have tolerated things that no Government in the world would have tolerated, for the last three years.&rdquo;  That is quite true, but what does it mean?  The President tolerated things that no other Government would tolerate.  He actually did so and that was a true statement.  He tolerated a condition of things in which certain organisations were allowed to commit murder; he tolerated a condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, on the occasion to which I have referred, was speaking for the whole Government; but I do not want to argue that matter any farther.  My point is this, <Col N="1825" /> that the Government whose President boasts that he has tolerated what no other Government would tolerate, leaves the men who came forward and volunteered their services in the Army to be the target of these blackguards, to be chained to Church railings, to have their houses attacked, to have their houses shot into, to have their uniforms seized, torn up and burned. My point is that the Government knows of the organisation that organises all that and yet it refuses to deal with it as an organisation.</P>
      <P>Reference was made here to men who had been in the British Army before being in our Army.  Again I speak subject to correction, but that does not quite explain the whole situation.  In the beginning, when the Army was recruited hurriedly, rigid conditions were not laid down as to membership, age and other things; but after a few years rigid conditions were laid down and in order to join the Army one had to be not above a certain age.  Consequently, you may roughly say that any man in the Army who was also in the British Army is a man who has particularly long service in our Army. I think, again subject to correction, that it will be found that practically every member of the rank and file in the Army who was in the British Army prior to being in our Army has service from 1922 or 1923.  If it is a fact that the Minister has directed the machinery so that those men, as they become time expired, will be eliminated from the Army, there is, I will not say exactly an absolute injustice, because the Government has only contracted for the period of service for which they are attested, but there is certainly something contrary to equity.  I refer to the men who came into the Army in 1922-23, who gave years of service and therefore got completely out of the stream of civil life, who came into the Army when the work was particularly strenuous and dangerous, who served through the heat of the day, and that machinery is now going to be directed to eliminate from the Army service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I left there was a Bill relating <Col N="1826" /> to Army Pensions.  I do not know how far the Minister varies from it, but there was provision for men with long service, service up to 20 years, that they should have that long service recognised by being given a pension. Here are men presumably, if I am right in my assumption, with 13 years' service in the Army, who would be entitled to thirteen-twentieths of a pension and instead of having that service recognised, they seem to be, so far as one can judge, selected for elimination from the Army.  When we speak of this small nucleus Army with a loosely flung, not completely trained Volunteer reserve, it is clear you want non-commissioned men highly trained and highly experienced.  I think that the Minister will probably find&mdash;we are not saying anything against ourselves in this&mdash;that the N.C.O.s in the Army best equipped for training Volunteers and other men coming into Army life are these men with the long service and these men who, as it frequently happens, had British Army service.  I urge that not merely is it unfair to select them for elimination because they were in the British Army, but it is particularly unfair to select men to be disposed of when time-expired who are the very men who have given the longest service.</P>
    <P>If a man comes into the Army for one year or two years, he goes out and falls again naturally into his place in civil life.  The interruption does not amount to much in his career.  If, however, a man came from, say, the British Army into our Army in 1922 and is still in the Army in 1933, it may be taken for granted that the planning of his life is based on the assumption of an army career.  If the Government chooses that man particularly to fling him out into civil life, that is an injustice, to my mind.</P>
    <P>Periodically, during the year, Deputy Mulcahy asked questions as to why a good reservist was removed from the reserve, and the usual answer that was given by the Minister was to say that the cause of the man's removal was because his services were no longer required.  On one or two occasions, however, the Minister admitted under <Col N="1827" /> pressure that the man's services were no longer required because he was associated with our political body.  If our political body conflicts with the Constitution, then we should be declared illegal.  Certainly, the Blueshirts were banned by the Government. That is to say, the Government declared that the Blueshirts aimed at a certain end, or made use of certain methods in attaining an end they had in mind, which fulfilled certain conditions laid down under Article 2A of the Constitution.  Any Fianna Fáil Deputy in this House who likes can take up Article 2A of the Constitution and read it and, if he reads it, he will know perfectly well that when the Government stated that, in its opinion the Blueshirt organisation was an unlawful association&mdash;that is, such an organisation as is described in detail and by definition under Article 2A of the Constitution&mdash; it was stating an untruth.  I invite any Fianna Fáil Deputy to read the Article and see whether or not the Government was telling the truth when it affirmed that it believed that the Blueshirt organisation fulfilled the conditions that are prescribed in the Article.  Consequently, irrespective of any Government ban, the Government cannot make that body unlawful unless it is unlawful, because what constitutes unlawfulness is declared definitely in the Constitution. All that the Government could do was to put the Military Tribunal in the position that, when it received a certain statement from the Government as to what the Government thought, it had to accept that statement even though it knew that that was an untruthful statement from the Government.</P>
    <P>I agree quite readily that the Government should not tolerate in the Army, and that the Government would be perfectly justified in eliminating from the Army, any man associated with organisation which were directed against the State.  Certainly I quite admit that the Government would be pre-eminently justified in not allowing any man in the Army to belong to the I.R.A., or the Republican Congress, or the half-dozen other aliases that the <Col N="1828" /> I.R.A. takes, because, clearly, if a man belongs to an organisation aiming at the overthrow of the State, you will not expect good service from him in an organisation which aims at defending the State.  I can even understand the Government carrying that a little further and saying that they did not want any hectic organisations, or any organisations that were carried too far or too hectically, associated with the Army.  What the Government did say, however, was that this applied to one political organisation.  If you were associated with Fine Gael, and happened to be a private on reserve, you were then in the Government's power. The Minister has full power.  All he has to say to a man is, &ldquo;Your services are dispensed with,&rdquo; and that man is gone.  What happened was that that was done when a man was associated with the Fine Gael organisation. Whether or not the Government inquired as to whether men were associated with any revolutionary organisation in this country, I do not know.  Certainly, if one read the resolutions passed by Fianna Fáil clubs in this country, protesting against the Government action in not recognising that membership of a criminal organisation should make a man exempt from the sanctions of the law, you will find that Fianna Fáil, not in its totality or in its direction, but in regard to the clubs and to the kind of mentality that finds expression in these clubs, is clearly much more of an anti-constitutional movement in this country than Fine Gael is.  I do not suppose, however, that anybody thinks that, for instance, a man would have been fired out of the reserve because he belonged, say, to the Edgeworthstown Branch of Fianna Fáil.  It is quite unlikely.  If, however, he belonged to the Booterstown Branch of Fine Gael he had every chance of going out.</P>
    <P>I have had to point out these things which, I think, are departures from what I shall call the basic Government policy with regard to the Army. Although from hundreds of platforms the Government had announced that, once a de Valera Government came into power the I.R.A. were going to <Col N="1829" /> turn into lambs and say that that was all they wanted and that they were quite satisfied, the Government knew that was untrue.  The Government knew that there are organisations here which seek to overthrow Government in this country and that they are restrained only by one thing-not by any question of moral sanction, but merely by the fact that there is an Army here ready to defend Government institutions if these organisations take any overt action for the overthrow of the Government.  In that way, the Army is the real salvation of the State and even the Government itself has recognised that the Army should be above politics and merely be the servant of the State.  It was for that reason that I have pointed out one or two things in which, it seems to me, the Government has departed from its own right and general policy with regard to the Army.  I can say with absolute sincerity that during my time in the Army my great aim always was to see to it that the Army should get no political complexion from being the servant of a Government that happened to be of our Party rather than another Party.  I think that, in the interests of this State and of the Government itself, the Government will find out that the real threat to the institutions of the State does not come from the constitutional Opposition, but from the anti-constitutional and anti-moral forces in this country.  I think that this Government itself should be most meticulous and most careful to avoid anything that gives even the semblance of a political colour in the work it gives the Army to do and in the administration of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the statement made by the Minister for Defence in the opening of this debate, and although I admit that he spoke rather low and rather fast, there was one point which struck me very forcibly.  It was a point which was agreeable, I think, for everybody in this House to hear.  That point was the tribute he paid to the Army. As we all know, the Army or its <Col N="1830" /> officers are in no position whatever to defend themselves against attacks, not alone in this House, but even outside in the country, and they will read the morning or evening papers, as the case may be, in order to see how this debate turns out and how far the Army is to be discussed from the point of view of political partisanship from one side of the House or the other.  I think that the tribute that has been paid, not only by the Minister, but by the leaders of the Opposition, to the Army, and the feeling they have given expression to that this small Army is giving good value for the money expended upon it, and that it has the confidence of this House, should be displayed in bold black type for the Army to read.  The Army in this country has a far more difficult part to play than any other army in the world.  This country is so upset and there are so many labyrinths and peculiar political twists and turns that the Army could very well be forgiven if the feeling in it was one of depression and indefiniteness.  Unless an army can feel that the people are behind it, it cannot have that self-confidence and that pride and alertness which really go to make an army. Those who have served in an army know what I mean.  One of the pressing necessities for the Army is a change from the uniform which they have at present.  I do not mean the colour of the uniform but the fashion and cut of the unifrom.  First of all, I hold that there is nothing more monotonous on a march, either from the soldiers' point of view or that of the public watching them, than the brown leggings which the Army wear.  I hold that the soldiers would respond to a brighter and better type of uniform.  For instance, the cut of the infantry breeches or trousers could very easily be improved.  The type of breeches issued is not one which appeals to the soldier's imagination or makes him a good soldier.  If some improvement could be effected it would certainly appeal both to the public and to the soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I suggest is greater <Col N="1831" /> encouragement of athletics in the Army.  I do not know how much is contributed from Army funds towards the encouragement of athletics.  I believe that whatever encouragement can be given by officers is given and that whatever help can be given by regiments is given to athletics in the Army.  We do not, however, see half enough of them or hear half enough about them.  I shall probably be severely criticised if I say, &ldquo;Why not have inter-army competitions across the Border; why not send up our best athletes to compete with the neighbouring Army across the Border?&rdquo;  It might do a lot of good and I cannot see what harm it could do.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest that we should have more opportunities in the country of listening to army bands. There may be difficulties about that; there may be difficulties in having parades in view of certain conditions which have arisen.  I believe, however, that we do not get as good service as we could get if more money was allotted for the bands, so that the performances could be extended and the people of the country could have an opportunity of hearing them.  There is a great lack of musical recitals in this country and some of us look for a lead from the Army in that respect. Nothing could inspire young people more than listening to good military bands.  That was proved even in the stress of the World War.  Why can we not have more of these military band performances?</P>
    <P>I would also strongly urge that there should be an investigation as to how the Army transport service could be improved.  I am not referring to the personnel of the service but to the obsolete lorries and cars.  At present the Army transport service is catering for an emergency in this city with great tact which has merited the appreciation of the citizens.  I believe that further money should be provided to bring the Army transport service up-to-date and make it what it ought to be.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that the development of physical training <Col N="1832" /> to which he referred should be expedited.  Any encouragement which can be given in that respect should be given.  When the Volunteers were formed I thought that they would be given an opportunity of encouraging physical training by example and otherwise in this country.  When they have concluded their ordinary duties physical training demonstrations on a large scale should be given up and down the country.  That would do a great deal in some parts of the country to remove any political tinge, if such exists, in the Volunteers.  What is done in that respect in many European countries could be followed here with advantage.</P>
    <P>I hold that a proper outlook and spirit could be encouraged in the country through more frequent displays by the Volunteers.  I should like also to say that, if the Volunteers are going to amount to anything worth while, greater care ought to be given to their appearance and their physique. Arch-backed men, carrying themselves carelessly and looking badly, are not fit for the Volunteers or for the Army.  I do not say that the Army is suffering much in that direction.  On the whole, the men who join the Army are a fine type of manhood, but occasionally you do find in its ranks a sort of small, weary man.  That should not be the case, as it is in the best interests of the country that the finest and best types should be attracted to the Army. There is too much publicity given to the Volunteers at the expense of the regular soldier.  The regular soldier in this country is not given the proper amount of admiration and encouragement through the publicity services which are available.  It is by that method that you promote that wonderful spirit of pride and confidence.  It can only be brought out by giving far greater admiration and publicity to our regular Army.</P>
    <P>I desire to emphasise one point which struck me when the Minister was making his statement, and that is the appreciation of the Minister for the regular Army.  That appreciation has been re-echoed by speakers on this side of the House.  We have heard Deputy <Col N="1833" /> O'Higgins, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Kehoe.  They had their own criticism and accusations to make, but there is one matter on which everybody can agree and that is in the tribute paid to the regular Army.  That tribute is all the greater coming as it did from those who fought in the past against the regular Army. It seems extraordinary that no matter what comes up for discussion in this House there must of necessity be something political in it.  I do not believe that in the discussions in any other Parliament political issues are so widely introduced.  Please God that will die out by degrees, and a new tradition will be introduced into this House, to be handed on to those who succeed us.  In regard to the Army, I seize on that tribute paid by the Minister, which was re-echoed on this side of the House, and if in the course of my speech I have done nothing more than emphasise that tribute I will have contributed something of value to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not present when the Minister was introducing this Vote, but there are a few questions which I should like to ask and some information which I should like to get.  It seems that the Army is coming in for compliments from all sides of the House, and I do not think they are necessary from me. This time last year, when the House was discussing the Army Vote, the Minister definitely stated that as far as lay in his power the sluaigh committees would not be partisan and would be representative of the country as a whole.  I had my doubts about that at the time.  I do not know whether it is general, but I regret to say that in the County Longford this promise was not fulfilled.  With one or two exceptions, the committees are formed solely from the Fianna Fáil branch in the district.  In a sense that may be good tactics on the part of the Government, but I maintain that it does not help us to get a really representative committee or a really representative Volunteer force.  The result is that to-day we are back again with the old charges of a partisan and <Col N="1834" /> political Army and a partisan and political Volunteer force.  I regret that more than I can say, because I am perfectly satisfied that it is in the interests of the country that its Volunteer force should be built up on truly national lines.  The Minister may have had the best intentions in the world on the matter and his intentions may have been set aside, but in view of his promises to the House I think he should have seen to it that more care would be taken in the formation of those committees.  No doubt there were some difficulties in the way, but in my opinion those difficulties could have been surmounted.  In the committees in North Longford there are only one or two people who are not members of the Fianna Fáil organisation. The people who formed those committees deliberately excluded people of other political parties.  I do not think that is wise, and I would ask the Minister to see that that state of affairs is righted as soon as possible. If people are invited to become members of the committee and they refuse to do so, the Minister is exonerated and we have nothing to grumble about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister again as to what happened to the munition factory.  Is that another Fianna Fáil ideal gone wallop?  The Minister, when he was on this side of the House, talked a good deal about the necessity, the advisability and the desirability of having our own munitions manufactured in this country. He used to talk of what an unpatriotic thing it was to be dependent upon Great Britain for our arms and munitions. It seems to me that the little strong man of Finance must have butted into this particular matter and stopped it.  At least I could think of no other reason, knowing that the Minister was so very strong on the point.  Perhaps he will tell us what happened that particular scheme. Even though it was a thing proposed by Fianna Fáil when in opposition, it was an undertaking which I would be very glad to see in being. It was a proposal with which I agreed if it were feasible.  There are several other matters to which I wish to refer.  One is the <Col N="1835" /> amount for the military courses.  The item in the Vote for officers being trained abroad has been reduced from £2,000 to £1,000.  Is there a change of policy in that direction, or does the country not get value for the money spent there, or is the idea that the officers were not very much improved by it?  To my own knowledge, they were, and I think it is a very great addition to the Army.  To my mind, instead of there being a reduction in that direction, there should have been an increase and a considerable increase.  Everybody knows that if an army is too insular in itself and does not keep track with the latest things in international armies, it will have to take a back seat at some particular time.  I think the Minister should see to it that these courses are not interfered with even if he were to bring in a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked a good deal about a permanent Army.  Yet we do not seem to be anything nearer to that position.  I suppose he has that Bill in cold storage.  It is time, however, to give it an airing.  The Pension Bill for the standing Army was to be introduced last year, but it seems still as far away as ever.  Deputy Fitzgerald in speaking about the men and officers who had made the Army their career spoke truly.  But I think it is very unfair to those in the permanent Army that they should not know exactly where they stand so far as their pensions are concerned or the end of their Army career is concerned.  I would like to know if it is the intention of the Minister to introduce that Bill this year?  If not, why not?</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister the number of secretaries of the sluaigh committees who are being paid.  I think it would be quite possible in the matter of these committees to get men who would be willing to give their services voluntarily.  Of course it may not always be so easy to get that.  It would do away with a good deal of local criticism if it could be done.  Every time a position of that type is created and the person appointed starts to organise anything <Col N="1836" /> there is the usual cry that he is doing it because he is paid for it.  In order to remove that slur I think the Minister should try to get voluntary workers.  I believe that would be possible. I do not say it would be possible in every case but the Volunteer forces have to surmount difficulties. The development of that force is meeting with difficulties.  Everything that it is possible to do to overcome these and remove them should be done.</P>
    <P>I am a bit astonished at the item for Transport.  The increase there seems to be very great and out of all proportion to the requirements.  Is it because some of these vehicles are likely to be seconded to the Department of Justice or what exactly is the necessity for the increase in transport?  Of course it may be that the proposal is to purchase new vehicles instead of repairing the existing ones.  If that is the case it is the policy with which I am in perfect agreement.  If possible new transport should be purchased instead of repairing old vehicles.</P>
    <P>I am glad that everybody has paid tribute to the Army.  It is well deserved.  The Army as far as I know it&mdash;and I think I can speak as well as anybody in the House on that particular matter&mdash;is definitely non-political. It has always been the Army of the State and Army of the people.  I would wish to point out to the new heroes, the new would-be soldiers that if and when they get the support, if they ever get the support, of the majority of the people of this country that there is an Army there fit and ready and willing to defend the nation's interest against all comers; and that they would be much better advised and they would be serving the country much better by supporting and helping that Army rather than criticising or thinking of taking the field against it.  That will be a day that will be a sad day for them.  However, I suppose it takes experience to teach us all.  Even the Minister has got some experience in that now and he realises that what I am saying is true&mdash;that the Army is a non-political Army; that it was built up by men on this side of the House for that purpose and I <Col N="1837" /> think that it is something to be proud of.  I repeat again that it is a non-political Army, the Army of the State and of the people.  I hope and trust that the Minister will keep it so because if he does this country will have something to protect it in its hour of need.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of participating in this debate until Deputy MacEoin rose.  At the very outset the Deputy made a statement that ought not be allowed pass by Deputies who have any knowledge as to the way the sluaigh committees were formed in the different parts of the Saorstát.  Deputy MacEoin stated in a general way that these committees were formed in the different counties of one particular Party to the exclusion of the other.</P>

      <P>The Deputy specified one particular case.  He certainly mentioned North Longford.  Lest the House or the general public should think that his statement represents the real state of affairs in all Ireland, I will state what happened in my county; other Deputies can answer for theirs. In my county no such state of affairs existed at all.  When the officers for the Volunteers came to County Galway I know at least of one town to which they went.  There was a list of 22 names honestly and conscientiously submitted to them.  That was 11 from each side of &ldquo;the Jordan,&rdquo; if I might say so.  The 11 on the Cumann na nGaedheal side&mdash;it got a bit &ldquo;Finer&rdquo; since&mdash;were approached and one of the men approached by the O.C. was a Deputy of this House.  He was appealed to for the sake of the country, for the sake of the Volunteer movement and to further that movement, to join the sluaigh committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He wanted to get the support of all parties.  I will stand by any statement I make.  It was in order to have the thing non-political that that move was made.  It is very strange then to have a Deputy standing up here and saying that nobody is in charge of a sluaigh committee except Government or Fianna Fáil supporters. My reason for speaking in the debate is to contradict that statement, and to say that such a situation does not exist at all, so far as I know.  The position was this: that the supporters of the Deputy opposite refused point blank to act on these committees. Somebody had to act, and because of that the people who compose the committees are, in the main, members of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  We are acting willingly on the committees and we are showing no political bias.  If the Deputy comes to Athenry, some N.C.O. will parade a company for him. He will be amazed, I suggest, to see it, because he will discover that three-fourths of those composing it do not agree with Fianna Fáil at all.  I have spoken in this debate lest people might believe the statement made here by Deputy MacEoin.  What he said as regards the composition of these committees is not a fact.  In any case, where it is true it is due to what I have stated: that people of his way of thinking would not act on the committees.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Jordan might have waited and allowed the Minister to say if our people had refused to act on these committees.  I stated that the sluaigh committees were formed of Fianna Fáil supporters.  Deputy Jordan admits that that is right, but makes the excuse that it is because our people refused to act.  That may be true of Athenry, but I can assure him that it is not the case so far as Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon are concerned.  We were not asked to act.  Even Deputies were not asked. He says they were.  Well, I would like to hear the Minister on that, as to how it came about that Deputies in one part of the country were asked <Col N="1839" /> while Deputies in another part of the country were not.  The officer that has been referred to went so far out of his way as to beg this particular Deputy, for the sake of the Fianna Fáil Volunteer force to join and to give it a chance.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister if, in Galway and Longford, Fine Gael supporters refused to act on the committees.  When speaking earlier, I said that if that were so I had no complaint to make. My information is that they never got an opportunity to act and that they were willing to act; that, in some districts, the local Fianna Fáil Club objected to any Fine Gael member being on the committee, and that in places where one or two were put on the committees they refused to meet for three weeks until the Fine Gael members were put off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think that, in so far as the new Volunteer force has been given a political complexion, it has been the fault to some extent of both sides.  I think it is true, as Deputy MacEoin has said, that in many districts there has been objection to asking supporters of our Party to co-operate, but I think there have been cases in some parts where supporters of our Party have been invited and refused.  Personally, from the very inception of this force I advised anybody belonging to our Party who consulted me to accept an <Col N="1840" /> invitation to act, and to do their best to make the force a success as it had been started.  But, I think, what we are more concerned with is the future rather than the past.  The sluaigh committees are, to a large extent, one-sided now, and the question is whether that cannot be remedied.  I think it could with a certain amount of exertion on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This force was started under very unfavourable auspices.  There was great resentment in our Party because of the fact that the particular officers, to whom the recruiting of the force was handed over, were all men who were reputed to be bitterly hostile to our Party and, consequently, our supporters were not in a mood to take a perfectly dispassionate view of what their attitude to the force ought to be.  I think that a further effort might very well be made now to make these committees all over the country more representative than they are.  There was also a lot of ill-feeling at that particular time because of the efforts of the Government to smother our Youth organisation.  That militated very much against the new force. It is time now for that particular sentiment to have died down and for feelings to have become calmer.  I think it ought to be the desire of all of us, and I believe it would be the desire of the Minister, to see that throughout the country this volunteer force should lose any political tinge that it may possess at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other matter that I want to refer to, and that is the question of those men who have been dismissed in the course of the last 12 months on the grounds that their services were no longer required.  I feel rather strongly about that, because I believe that the Minister does not wish to run the Army on political and partisan lines.  It would be a crime on his part if he did, and I am willing to acquit him of any deliberate desire to do anything of the kind, but I do feel that in this matter the political prejudices of some of his supporters have preverted his mind and led him to do something that he ought not to have done.  If those men were guilty of acts <Col N="1841" /> of illegality, even if there were grounds for a strong suspicion that they were guilty of acts of illegality or were about to commit acts of illegality, I have nothing to say; but if, as I understand the case to be, those men's services were dispensed with merely because they were members of the League of Youth, then I think the Minister has done something very improper&mdash;something that, on more mature consideration, he ought to see is very improper.  The League of Youth is not an illegal organisation. The Government does not even purport to regard it as such, whatever it may have done with its predecessor.  That being so, I would appeal to the Minister to consider whether he cannot reinstate the men he has dispensed with, merely on the bald statement that their services are no longer required and without any record of evil doing against them.</P>

      <P>I must say that I was rather sorry for Deputy O'Higgins at being put up to justify the motion to refer the Estimate back.  If ever politics were dragged by the hair of the head into a debate to which they did not belong, it was certainly on this occasion.  In order to justify the accusation of political management of the Army, Deputies had to ignore the fact that when a political Party took over the reins of Government and when the Deputies of that Party became Ministers, they became Ministers, and, as such, were entitled to a certain amount of respect in the carrying out of their duties.  It is no dishonour to the Army to salute these men, no matter who they may be, when they are here in the position of Ministers, and, in saluting the Government, the Army is not taking part in politics, but is carrying out its work.  It is showing the people that it is going to support the Government in office in all circumstances; that the Government elected by the people is going to be supported by the Army in the last analysis.  It is a most ridiculous argument to say that when parades were called in a number of districts, in order <Col N="1842" /> to bring the Volunteers and the regular Army out, that these were political demonstrations because the units that paraded gave a salute to a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy O'Higgins must remember this, that his particular Party is not the Government now, and that the men who have been given responsibility for governing the country are entitled to respect.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the St. Patrick's Day demonstrations.  I think everybody connected with them was pleased at the way they passed off, and that the people in the districts in which parades took place were delighted at their success.  It would be very difficult to please Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Minch at the same time. Deputy Minch wants more and Deputy O'Higgins wants less displays.  I agree with Deputy Minch on this occasion. On Easter Sunday there will be another Government function&mdash;not a political Party function&mdash;and, as well as having an official side, it will have a non-official side.  The people who will be invited to take part in the official side of the ceremony will include Deputy Mulcahy and all members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Government.  In order that all the old I.R.A. and pre-1916 men might have a part in it, I got together representatives of the various groups in the City, and I asked them to form a committee so that they might marshal their men.  Anybody who is dealing with military service investigation knows how difficult it is to select men who were concerned in 1916, and I thought the best way was to leave it to the different organisations composed of old I.R.A. and old 1916 men.  Their function ceases with selecting the various groups that will march according to the garrisons they held in 1916, and supplying a firing party to fire volleys at the G.P.O.  Instead of <Col N="1843" /> having any criticism of that committee offered we should really be thankful to the men who were coming forward, and going to a great deal of pains to organise civilians and old I.R.A. and 1916 men, as well as the civilian end of the demonstration.  The function itself is an official one.  The monument is erected out of State funds that were voted by this House.  It will be unveiled by the man that this House elected President, and to that official function all the members of the Oireachtas will be invited, as well as the relatives of men killed in 1916.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That question does not properly belong to this debate.  As the Deputy introduced it, I say that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil official organisation has every possible right to sell a torch to its members or its supporters if they want to show, by wearing that torch, that they are honouring Easter Week.  If the Deputy does not like to wear it he can go and buy a lily.  So much for Easter Sunday.  On that day, as on St. Patrick's Day, the Army, in passing the saluting base at the G.P.O., is going to salute the President.  It will not be saluting him as a member of a political organisation but, as head of the State, to whom it owes a duty. Another question was raised about Blueshirts members of the reserve.  For the first time I got an admission from members of the Opposition that certain members of the reserve were Blueshirts, and no merely innocent members of Fine Gael.  I have no objection to any reservist being a member of Fine Gael and, as a matter of fact, Deputy Mulcahy must know very well that, at least, a couple of officers employed in Fine Gael offices are members of the reserve.  He must also know that I have no objection to that. But, as Minister for Defence, I issued an Order in October, 1933, forbidding members of the reserve to be members of the Blueshirt organisation, under any alias, and I certainly will not permit any officer or man in the reserve to belong to that organisation, as against that Order.</P>

      <P>Certain officers were taken in in connection with the new Volunteers force.  That matter was debated before and I have no apology to make in respect of it.  These officers are members of the regular Army, engaged in Volunteer organising work and these 20 men are associated with 500 other men in carrying out that work.  The combination of both in organising the Volunteers has been very successful.  Unfortunately, I cannot conscript members of Fine Gael into membership of sluaigh committees, but we did our utmost in all parts of the country, so far as I am aware, to get people of all shades of political opinion on these committees. If we failed in any particular district, it is not my fault.  If Deputy MacEoin has any qualms about any particular district, I shall try to get him the names of the persons who were approached to form a sluaigh committee in that district.</P>

      <P>Allegations were made that, because certain men were not retained in the Army, there was victimisation&mdash;that these men had formerly been members of the British Army.  The fact is that nobody in this country has any edge on people who were misled into fighting for small nations in Flanders in the years 1914-18. A lot of the men whose time expired during the past year had British Army records and they were given first consideration if they had I.R.A. pre-truce service also.  Numbers of them who had no I.R.A. experience were continued in service.  Deputy MacEoin raised the question of the munition factory.  I am sorry we have not got it going before now.  At present, we are having a site examined and I hope that, before the end of the year, further steps will be taken. <Col N="1848" /> Deputy MacEoin also raised a question as regards courses abroad.  Last year, we found that the amount of the Estimate was not fully expended.  Although I am keen on getting as many officers as possible trained abroad, I am satisfied that the sum we have estimated for this year is as much as we can expend.  If we go slightly beyond that sum, I do not suppose there will be any objection.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin asked about the permanent Army Bill.  That Bill is about to go to the Parliamentary draughtsman and I expect he will take a few months working at it.  We shall have it here before the next annual Bill is due.  Deputy MacEoin raised the question of the Pensions Bill for the standing Army.  We are waiting until we see the Widows and Orphans Pensions Bill before we bring our measure before the Dáil.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke of pensions for N.C.O.s and men, but in the scheme I found in the office, there was no mention of N.C.O.s and men.  We are working out a scheme for N.C.O.s and men, as well as officers, and we want to see the Widows and Orphans Pensions Bill before we definitely decide what will be the rate of pensions for N.C.O.s and men.  We have decided upon the officers' rate already.  As soon as the Widows and Orphans Pensions Bill sees the light, we shall go on with our measure.  Deputy MacEoin inquired regarding the position of secretaries of sluaigh committees. They get a very small honorarium&mdash;only £5.  If the Deputy reads the regulations regarding the duties of a secretary, he will see that he has quite a lot of expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In ordinary times, I think that it would be wrong to ask a man to accept that amount of expense without giving him something for his trouble.  That was all right in times of great national stress &mdash;for instance, during the Black and Tan war&mdash;but you cannot do that in ordinary, peace times.  Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy raised practically the same questions. <Col N="1849" /> I think I dealt fully with all the questions which demanded an answer. Deputy O'Higgins suggested that we were making the Army the plaything of a political Party and, as I say, in order to sustain that allegation, he had to go into very deep water and say that the men who are in charge of the government of the State are no more than a political Party.  They are more; they are the Government of the country.  Deputy Mulcahy asked a question, and an important question, as to what type of Army we would leave behind us.  I hope that we will leave an Army that will be no less loyal to the next Government than the present Army is to this Government, and, if it does that, I think the country has a good deal to look forward to.</P>

      <Col N="1850" /> That a sum not exceeding £260,002 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1936, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, and No. 24 of 1932), for Military Service Pensions (No. 48 of 1924 and No. 43 of 1934); and for sundry contributions and expenses in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in this Estimate for the payment of pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1932 (wound and disease), and for service pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1934. The total amount of the Estimate is £390,002.  The amount of the Vote for 1934-35 (including a Supplementary Vote of £11,200) was £299,676.  There is, therefore, an increase of £90,326 on the previous year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>There is increased provision to the extent of £5,000 for wound and disability pensions and gratuities under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, which it is anticipated will be awarded in the current financial year.  These pensions are payable from the 1st April, 1932, so that each new pension awarded involves payment of three years' arrears, in addition to the payment for the current year.  During the financial year 1934-35, 154 new awards of pensions and allowances were made under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, amounting to £15,889 per annum and 112 awards of gratuities, in wound and dependency cases, totalling £9,305.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in this Estimate for 122 further new awards of pensions and allowances amounting to £14,330 per annum, and 110 gratuities totalling £8,805, in wound and dependency cases.  There is increased provision in this Estimate to the extent of £82,000 for military service pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934. Provisions is made for 1,500 pensions under that Act, and for arrears on 1,100 as from the 1st October, 1934.</P>

      <P>I merely rise to put a certain point of view to the Minister. <Col N="1851" /> I have no objection whatever to the Vote and no criticism to offer with regard to the administration.  There have been, however, a very great number of Army Pensions Acts, each one dealing with merely a small fragment of a big question.  The 1923 Military Service Pensions Act dealt with services prior to that date; the Wounds Pensions Act applies to wounds received on military service before and after the passing of that Act and is a continuing Act; and there is, then, what I might call the Disability Pensions Act, 1927.  That definitely dealt with all disabilities other than wounds, in other words, disabilities as a result of illness other than wounds, but it only applied to disabilities acquired prior to the date of the establishment of the forces.  That was 1st October, 1924.  Then, we had the Defence Forces Pensions Act, 1923, which gave the Minister power, by regulation, to make provision for pensions, for disabilities and service, and other purposes of members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that there is a class of officer and soldier left uncovered by any of the Acts.  These are the men who left the Army between 1927 and 1932 and who suffered from a disability acquired subsequent to 1st October, 1924.  I admit that I am a little vague with regard to this.  I am speaking mainly from recollection and some of my recollections with regard to these particular matters and Acts are ten or 12 years old.  I feel certain that if there is a class left out, through an oversight on everybody's part&mdash; perhaps on our part as well as others &mdash;there was no intention by anybody to leave out any man who suffered from a disability and I merely want to call attention to the fact in case my recollection is correct, and to leave it to the Minister to rectify it, if it is correct.</P>

      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister, with Deputy O'Higgins, that there are cases which should be covered by other legislation. I do not know whether I am entitled to recommend that at the moment. <Col N="1852" /> There is also the point I should like to make that, in a case of disability from disease, the fixing of 80 per cent. disability is out of all reason.  That applies, of course, to the 1932 and the previous Acts.  When a volunteer or soldier who serves his country suffers an 80 per cent. disability, you can make a coffin for him.  He is dying and I think it is out of all reason that that amount of disability should have to be present before State aid can be granted.  While, like Deputy O'Higgins, I have no complaint to make against either the administration of the various Acts or the amount involved, I do think that 80 per cent. disability is an unreasonable percentage.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that matter.  If he was introducing legislation, the matter could be rectified as an amendment of the other Acts.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the latest Military Pensions Act, there has been a widespread movement throughout the country to revive what is known as the old I.R.A. Associations have been formed all over the place, with the approval of the Government, of men who are members of the old I.R.A. and, naturally, these associations have played a prominent part in helping the members to present claims for pensions. I have no complaint about that situation so far as it goes, but there is an obvious danger that it should be used for political purposes and that is a danger that I feel obliged to call attention to on this Estimate.  I feel obliged to call attention to it because of a speech to which I have already referred in this House, made by a member of the Government at Carrickmacross, three weeks ago.  It was a speech to the local old I.R.A. Men's Association, and, in the course of it, Deputy Dr. Ward advised his hearers against admitting supporters of the Opposition into that association, giving as his ground that those who were supporters of the Opposition were ranged on the side of Ireland's enemies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that ought to be protested against in this House.  It is far from being conducive to the maintenance of peace and order and conducive <Col N="1853" /> to the elimination of unnecessary bitterness from politics and, in addition to that, it tends to throw suspicion over the whole of the administration of the military pensions legislation because it suggests that these old I.R.A. Men's Associations, which are specially efficient, or claim to be, and I imagine are, in supporting the claims of their members for pensions, should close their doors to supporters of the Opposition, the inevitable result being to turn them into a propaganda agency for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I cannot think that the Minister for Defence would approve of that, now that it has been brought to his attention.  One back-bench Deputy in his Party, Deputy Briscoe, definitely dissociated himself from Deputy Ward's speech on the last occasion when I mentioned it here; but what is more important is that the attitude of the Government should be made clear.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I am strictly in order in raising one particular matter on this Estimate.  There in a glaring case in Dublin City, South, of an individual whose name is Peter Kavanagh and who lives at 13 Golden Bridge Avenue, Kilmainham.  That man, in the course of an armed conflict between the forces opposing each other during the civil war in this country, received 12 or 14 bullet wounds&mdash;I am not quite sure of the number&mdash;and as a result of those wounds he has been absolutely incapacitated.  I take this opportunity of bringing his case to the notice of the Minister.  I am aware that the Minister's Department has received sheafs of letters relating to this case, which is an extremely deplorable one and which richly deserves consideration. I know this individual has no legal claim.  He is not entitled under any Act to get compensation for the awful incapacity from which he suffers and for the destitution to which the members of his family have been brought.  I ask the Minister to give special attention to the case.  If he is of opinion that the claim cannot be put on a legal basis, I hope he will at least make some <i>ex gratia</i> payment to Peter Kavanagh.</P>

Is í an chathair chéadna rug an chraobh léi ar an tinnreamh ab aoirde an dá bhliain roimhe seo freisin.  Seo é an t-órd 'na raibh na háiteacha ba ghoire tinnreamh do Chathair Chorcaighe sa mbliain 1933-34: Cathair Phortláirge, 87.7; Conntae Chorcaighe, 86.5; Cathair Bhaile Atha Cliath, 86.4, agus Uíbh Fáilghe 86.3.  Bhí méadú i bpercentáiste an tinnrimh i gcás dhá cheann fhichead de chontaethe no de chontae-bhuirgí, agus laghdú i gcás sé cinn aca, i gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir le tighthe scoile féin agus a bhfeisteas tá dul ar aghaidh maith déanta leis sin, freisin, agus sa mbliain airgeadais 1933-34 do cuireadh suim mhór&mdash;£160,000&mdash;i leathtaoibh i gcómhair foirgnimh agus méaduighte agus feabhsuighthe tighthe scoile náisiúnta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dona an scéal é, ámhthach, go bhfuil mórán scol ann fós gan cóir <Col N="1856" /> sláinteachais do bheith ortha.  Ath-thógáil foirgneamh an rud is mó atá ag teastáil ins na ceanntair tuatha; i mbailte móra agus i gcathracha ní hamháin go bhfuil ath-thógáil le déanamh chun tighthe maithe do chur in ionad droch-thighthe, ach is riachtanach mórán scol ná fuil dóthain slighe ionnta dá líon leanbhaí do mhéadú.  Do tosuigheadh le linn na bliana seo atá fá mheas againn ar roinnt scoltacha móra do thógáil i mBaile Atha Cliath agus i gCorcaigh. Tugadh aire speisialta don déanamh a bheadh ar na tighthe sin, agus táthar á dtógáil ar an módh nua-aimseardha.</P>
    <P>Ceist fá leith is eadh ó tighthe oireamhnacha scoile do sholáthar i mBaile Atha Cliath, agus badh chóir go ndéanfadh gach uile dhuine a bhfuil suim aige in Oideachas iarracht tréan diongbhálta ar an fhadhb so do réidhteach.</P>
    <P>Caithfear scoltacha agus feisteas do sholáthar don fhás agus don leathnú atá ag teacht ar an gcathair ins na ceanntair ina bhfuil áitreabha nua déanta. Ina theannta sin tá cuid de na scoltacha atá taobh istigh de shean-teorainn na cathrach ina seasamh ó cuireadh Córas an Bhun-Oideachais ar bun agus níl siad oireamhnach anois.  Is beag ar fad a ndearnadh de thighthe nua scoile in san limistéar sin le dachad bliain anuas.  Fuaireadh amach de thoradh fiosruighthe speisialta a rínneadh le déigheanaighe go bhuil breis agus dosaen de na tighthe scoile sin, nó de shreatha tighthe scoile, gan bheith oireamhnach do réir caighdeáin an lae indiu.  Is soiléir a mheas gur deacair ionaid d'fhagháil d'fhoirgnimh in áiteanna mar Bhaile Atha Cliath mar a bhfuil an talamh go han-daor, ach ar a shon sin féin táthar ag dul ar aghaidh go seasmhach, agus táthar ag súthar ag súil le tosnú gan mhoill ar roinnt mhaith eile de scoltacha nua do thógáil sa gcathair agus ins na fo-bhailte ar a himeall.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcaoi a gcoimeádtar na scoltacha tá an scéal díreach mar bhí sc.  Déanann roinnt de na bainisteóirí a ndícheall agus amannta téigheann siad thar a n-acfuinn leis na scoltacha a dheisiú agus a mhaisiú nuair a bhíonn gádh leis, ach tá mórchuid díobh atá faillightheach san rud so.  Is fíor go dtéigheann sé righte le cuid aca an <Col N="1857" /> t-airgead a sholáthar; ach tá roinnt díobh agus deallruigheann sé gur cuma leo cé an bhail atá ar na tighthe scoile atá fá n-a gcúram.</P>
    <P>Ní bhid na seomraí scoile taobh istigh ach go measardha glan.  Na scoltacha atá fá chúram ban bíd de ghnáth níos glaine agus níos deismire ná na scoltacha atá fá chúram fear; ach uaireannta bíonn siad súd neamhshlachtmhar freisin.  Is beag slacht a bhíos ar mhórán de na scoltacha do bhuachaillí.  Ach d'fhéadfadh na hoidí idir fhearaibh agus mhnáibh i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh leis na scoltacha a choimeád i gcaoi go mbeidís i na sompla do'n lucht scoile agus don chomhursanacht.</P>
    <P>Tá na cigirí uilig ar aon fhocal nach dtugtar aire cheart do na cúl-tighthe. Bíonn na hurláir agus na suidheacháin ionnta go fliuch salach go ró-mhinic, agus ní déantar na claiseanna d'fholmhú go tráthamhail.  An saghas cúltighe is mó a bhíos ag scoltacha tuaithe ba chóir cré thirim d'úsáid ionnta go laetheamhail, ach i bhfíor-chorr-scoil a déantar é sin.  Dá bhíthin sin bíonn boladh bréan ag éirighe uatha go mór mhór san samhradh; caithfidh gur mór an chontabhairt í seo do shláinte na ndaltaí agus na n-oidí, ach is beag suim a chuireann a lán bainisteóirí agus oidí ann.</P>
    <P>Do rinneadh cóimh-meascadh ar 48 scoltacha i rith na bliana, agus do chuir sin 24 scoltacha ó fheidhmiú ar leithligh. Meastar gurb é an laghdú bhéas ar an bhfoirinn múinteoireachta de bharr na scoltacha sin do thréigean ná máighistir amháin, 18 máighistreása, agus 15 máighistreása sóiseara conganta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hOileamhaint Mhúinteoirí b'éigean an uimhir díobh a glacadh i gColáistí Oileamhna Catoiliceacha d'fhearaibh sa mbliain 1934 do laghdú mar do rinneadh an bhliain roimhe sin, de bhrigh go raibh barrachas de mhúinteoirí oilte fear ar fághail, agus mar gheall ar an ndeifridheacht a bhí idir an uimhir a bhí in áitreabh agus an uimhir a raibh cead áitreabhtha dhóibh, do rinneadh 10 per cent. de laghdú ar líon an dara dreama i gcómhair na gColáistí sin; ach breathnóchthar an scéal arís ar ball, agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh réidhteach um <Col N="1858" /> an dtaca sin ar na deacrachta atá ann fá láthair.  Ar an dtaoibh eile den scéal tá ganntanas ban-mhúinteoirí ann fós, agus ó's rud é go mbeidh an gá atá leo ag dul i ngéire do réir a chéile mar gheall ar an riaghail nua a choisceas ar mhnáibh a gheibhcann oileamhaint tar éis na bliana 1934 leanamhaint den mhúinteoireacht ar phósadh dhóibh, is mór is mian leis an Roinn go gcuirfí caoi oileamhna níos fairsinge ná mar atá ar fághail do mhná fá láthair.  Táthar tar éis molta éagsamhla do mheadhadh, agus cé nach féidir a rádh go bhfuil réidhteach na ceiste ar fagháil tá súil ag an Roinn nach fada go mbeidh.</P>
    <P>Do cuireadh Scéim na gColáistí Ullmhúcháin ar bun sa mbliain scoile 1926/27.  Do beartuigheadh seacht gcoláistí do bhunú fá'n scéim sin, sé sin, trí cinn de bhuachaillí Catoiliceacha, trí cinn eile do chailíní Cataoiliceacha, agus ceann amháin do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní Protastúnacha.

An dá Choláiste eile atá ceaptha do bhuachaillí, .i. Coláiste Eanna agus Coláiste na Mumhan, níl ach áruis shealadacha aca san fós nó go dtógtar áruis chóra dhóibh i mBóthar na Trágha i nGaillimh, agus i mBaile Mhúirne i gConntae Chorcaighe.  Táthar ag dul ar aghaidh le tógóil na dtighthe sin fá láthair, agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh siad ullamh i gcómhair a n-áitreabhtha i gcionn bliana nó mar sin.</P>

Fuair 95 fán gcéad de scoláirí na gColáistí sin a rinne iarracht ar an Ard-Teistiméireacht do ghnóthú, fuaireadar onóracha, agus is mór le rádh é sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a judicial tribunal be established for the purpose of inquiring into definite matters of urgent public importance, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1. Whether a meeting of engineers or persons purporting to act in that capacity as members of the organisation styling itself the I.R.A. was held on Saturday, the 10th day of February, 1934, at or near Parnell Square or elsewhere in the City of Dublin;</P>
      <P>2. Whether the purpose or one of the purposes of the said meeting was instruction in or demonstration of the use or construction of a land mine or other explosive;</P>
      <P>3. Whether the police authorities or the Government were aware that such meeting was intended to be held and of the purposes thereof;</P>
      <P>4. Whether the police authorities or the Government were aware that such meeting, while in progress, was being held; and, if so, why such meeting was allowed to proceed, and why the persons taking part in such meeting were not arrested and charged;</P>
      <P>5. Whether such meeting or the proceedings thereof were related to or in any way connected with the explosion which took place at Dundalk on the day following the said meeting, namely, Sunday, the 11th day of February, 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down on the Order Paper some thirteen months ago, shortly after some incidents were recited to the House.  In all the circumstances, and having regard to the facts, the Government ought to be glad to hold the inquiry requested.  The <Col N="1861" /> responsibilities of the people charged with the preservation of order depend very much upon the prevention of anything which will give rise to outrages. A tragic occurrence took place in Dundalk; there was loss of life and a boy was maimed.  It is requested that a judicial tribunal should be established for the purpose of inquiring into definite matters of urgent public importance, and these matters are set out in the motion.  It is quite plain from the manner in which this particular matter was treated by the Government from the beginning that a judicial inquiry should take place. High police officers called upon two members of this House and admitted that they knew nothing about the circumstances. It is obvious from that either that the administration of the Gárda is imperfect, inefficient, and unequal to the task which it ought to be its duty to perform, or there was some occult reason for not dealing with the matters detailed here in the House 13 months ago.  I accordingly move the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.E. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to urge upon the Minister the necessity for setting up the judicial tribunal asked for in the motion.  I think the Minister will concede that the elementary duty of government, in fact the chief reason why government exists in any country, is for the protection of the lives and property of citizens of that country.  Here we have a case where life was lost, persons were maimed, private property was most deliberately destroyed, and the criminals have not been brought to justice.  Side by side with that what do we find?  We find, within a few days of the commission of the crime, the responsible leader of the Opposition stating publicly in this House that on the eve of the outrage the police here in Dublin watched, with the help of field glasses, the progress of a meeting in No. 44 Parnell Square, the purpose of that meeting being to instruct certain persons in the construction and use of a land mine which was to be used <Col N="1862" /> on the next day.  The explosion did take place the next day&mdash;on Sunday evening, the 11th February&mdash;and it took place in a quiet, working-class district in Dundalk, with fatal consequences, with very tragic consequences.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply on that occasion gave the House to understand that he had not completed investigations, but that he was quite satisfied that there was no connection between the meeting in Dublin on the 10th February and the explosion in Dundalk on the 11th February.  It is very noteworthy that the Minister did admit that that meeting in fact took place and, of course, we have the evidence of our senses in support of the further fact that the explosion which took place in Dundalk on the following evening was the only explosion of that kind that has occurred here ever since. That admission and that fact, and the terrible consequences ensuing from that fact, have left a very nasty impression on the public mind in Louth.  It has left the impression that life and property here are insecure; that life and property can be attacked here with impunity so long as the perpetrators of outrages of that kind are members, and claim to be members, of certain organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people want to know, and they have a right to know, whether the police authorities in Dublin had information that that meeting in Parnell Square was arranged or whether they came across it by accident.  In either event, we want to know why the proper and the reasonable thing was not done.  We want to know why those premises were not raided on that evening and the conspirators arrested and the land mine seized.  Surely the plea cannot be put forward that the job was too big for the small group of detectives watching the progress of the meeting.  Either they had prior knowledge of the fact or they had not. If they had prior knowledge that that meeting was about to be held, suitable arrangements to deal with it could easily have been made.  If they had not prior knowledge, adequate assistance for the raiding of the premises could very easily have been secured.  The fact remains, however, <Col N="1863" /> that that meeting was held, that that meeting was watched by the police authorities, and that the conspirators were allowed to escape with the land mine.  On the following evening we had the explosion in Dundalk which, as I have aleady stated, was the only explosion of its kind which has since occurred, thank God.  Personally, I have no doubt whatever but that the Minister has perfectly clean hands in this matter.  To assume otherwise would be to assume that the Minister is wholly unfit for the position he occupies.  After all, why should any effort be made by him or by the Executive to shield those who blundered in this matter?  Somebody has blundered, and I for one would not be unduly hard on the Minister for somebody else's blunder, but we have a right to demand&mdash;whoever blundered on that occasion, whether it be a higher officer or somebody in a more subordinate position in the police&mdash; that the blame be placed on the proper shoulders, and that those people who so mismanaged that particular case and treated their responsibilities so lightly shall be transferred from the positions they occupy to posts more befitting their competence, or their incompetence, and their apparent lack of a sense of responsibility. All this motion asks the Minister to do is what would be done in another country which I will not offend the patriotic instincts of the Minister by even naming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I though I might have heard some speakers deal with this matter more fully.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out in his opening remarks, this enquiry is called for on the basis of its being a matter of urgent public importance.  Thirteen months have elapsed since this motion was tabled, and I think that aspect of it at any rate has disappeared.  I can assure Deputies that so far as I am personally concerned I had nothing to do with the putting back of that motion.  It is, I understand, a matter of procedure, and I would be anxious to have it disposed of as quickly as possible.  A proposal to set up an enquiry such as this <Col N="1864" /> is I think very new to this House.  I do not think there is any precedent for it&mdash;not in my recollection at any rate. It is assumed when a tribunal like this is set up that there would be certain evidence given before that tribunal. Who are the people to give that evidence? The police say there is no relation between anything that occurred in Dublin and what happened in Dundalk on the following day.  I am satisfied that that information from the police is quite correct and sound and that there is no connection, good, bad or indifferent, between any meeting which took place in Dublin on the Saturday and what happened on the following day in Dundalk.  I was surprised at the statement of Deputy Cosgrave as to the interview which he had with certain officers of the Guards, because I do not think that statement was made when questions were asked previously. In the reports which have been made to me by the Guards it has not been conveyed to me that they stated to Deputy Cosgrave that they knew nothing about it.  I will quote the officer's report of his interview with Deputy Cosgrave.  It is dated 27th February last:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I beg to report that accompanied by Detective Inspector McGloin, Detective Branch, I saw Mr. W. T. Cosgrave, T. D., at his residence `Beechpark,' Templeogue, at 11.20 a.m. on 27/2/34.  I told him that we had been directed to interview him in connection with the disclosures in An Dáil in regard to incidents in Parnell Square on the 10th-11th instant.  When I said this Mr. Cosgrave became very annoyed and said in a rather aggressive tone `What is all this tom-foolery about?  I want an explanation as to why the police did not raid the place, Parnell Square.  You are a police officer and you know your duty.  If you do not know about it, send me someone who does.  It is a matter that is well known to you people.'  Mr. Cosgrave then ignored us, turned away and started looking at unopened letters on the table.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not recollect that Deputy Cosgrave said, when this matter was raised in questions, that the police <Col N="1865" /> officers stated they knew nothing about it.  If that had been stated at the time I would have asked for a further report on the matter as to whether their memory was at fault or otherwise. The position as I see it is this: I have the police reports before me.  The only people I can see who could give any evidence before a tribunal would be Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy. Deputy Mulcahy was interviewed also, and his attitude was: &ldquo;Submit to me questions in writing and I will answer them.&rdquo;  What is the object of that? If a person has information, and a police officer interviews him, he can give that information without having questions submitted to him in writing, and taking some time to consider the answers.  Was there any desire to help the police in this matter?  I do submit to the House that a Deputy is not in any different position from anybody else. If he has information to impart, and especially if he takes an interest in it as this matter was taken an interest in by the Deputies concerned, his duty is the duty of the ordinary citizen&mdash;to give that information to the only people to whom it is proper to give it, and that is to the police.  That information has not been submitted to the police.  No assistance has been given to the police by the Deputies concerned.</P>
    <P>Is the object of an inquiry to try to suggest that the police force in this country is a force which cannot be relied on to do its duty, or is it suggested that that police force, while willing to do its duty, has been interfered with? If that is the suggestion, I should like to say at the outset that the police have not been interferred with in doing their duty.  They have been urged at all times to do their duty fairly and effectively, and I wait evidence in support of any suggestion that they have not carried out their duty in this way.  If a meeting of certain people is being held, it is not an unusual thing in this country that such places are kept under observation, and it is for the police to decide what is the best way to act in a certain situation or in a certain set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>It happened in Deputy Cosgrave's régime that certain places were kept <Col N="1866" /> under observation and I assume, for very good reasons, raids were not carried out at particular times.  This is probably not the only incident, but it is the only one that comes to my mind at the moment in a business of that kind, where certain places and certain persons have been kept under observation. I submit it is done by every police force in the world.  Anybody who attended that meeting was kept under observation, the details of his movements taken and so on.  On very clear evidence and on very clear facts, I am satisfied, and the police authorities are satisfied, that there is no relation whatever and no connection whatever between anything that transpired in Parnell Square and the regrettable affair that happened in Dundalk afterwards. For that reason I do not see any purpose whatever in having an inquiry of this kind.</P>

Now my time is just as valuable as the Minister's, and I am not going to tolerate any police officer of the State coming to my house and asking me questions about a matter of which he knows nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his speech said that this motion has been on the Paper for 13 months.  It was put down as a matter of urgency and he presumes that the lapse of 13 months indicates that there cannot be any urgency, or that that aspect has disappeared.  I think that the fact that thirteen months have gone by makes the matter more urgent, more particularly because in these 13 months we have seen a repetition of organised crime in the form of murder in the country.  Listening to this matter when it was discussed here, what I understood was that this thing arose in this way: That on a Saturday the police entered a certain house, which had been closed by the Military Tribunal, in order to observe a house in Parnell Square. On the Sunday following, to my own knowledge and from my own observation, I know that the military were sent out around the Country Dublin. To begin with, the police had information that that meeting at Parnell Square on the Saturday was to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not purported to refute that there was a meeting of an unlawful association aiming at the overthrow of this State called by the I.R.A.  Certainly there are grounds for inquiring as to why an organisation which is seeking to overthrow this State, an organisation whose methods are known to us as assaults on persons and even murders, should be allowed to meet peaceably.  The Minister said that the police decide how they will act.  He said that in every country the police keep people under observation.  Quite true.  But is there any other country in the world in which the police were known to have taken possession of one house in order to watch another house in which <Col N="1868" /> a meeting was taking place for the purpose of promoting the overthrow of the State by an organisation known to organise murder?  In no other country would it be possible to have such a thing happen, or that on the next day, with this knowledge in the possession of the police, would you find a house blown up by criminals who organise murders.  If that happened in any other country there would certainly be an inquiry as to why the police decided to stop short at observation.  If there had been an inquiry one might ask what the police did and what had happened there. One might ask why it was that the Army and the police were directed on the following day to a particular activity.  The thing seems perfectly clear.  There was first information that there was to be a meeting.  Then there was a meeting and that was a meeting of such an organisation as I have indicated.  There was reason to believe that on the following day some act was going to take place which required particular activity on the part of the forces of the State. There is there a <i>prima facie</i> case for that assumption.</P>
    <P>There is room for an inquiry as to why these men were not arrested, and whether it was because of police methods or through Government orders that was not done.  I submit one of the things that such an inquiry should ask for would be what recommendations the police made, and is it as a result of police advice that no specific action has been taken against the I.R.A. as an organisation but only against members of it who are inevitably caught in outraging the laws of this country?  Is that a result of police advice?  We have the fact, at all events, that the I.R.A. proposed to meet in Parnell Square, and no action was taken against them.  Have the police themselves proposed that when a meeting of an illegal organised body takes place that body is only to be observed, and thereafter the people who take part in that meeting shall be kept under observation?  If that happened in this case the police certainly deserve very great censure.  Anybody who knows anything about police observation <Col N="1869" /> knows perfectly well that as often as not they lose sight of the people they observe.  Now let us suppose that the police had reason to believe that the people met at that meeting for such a purpose as I have indicated; that such meeting was of the nature that required police watching, and that whatever number met there, let us say 20 or 30, the police said: &ldquo;We will not raid or arrest these men.&rdquo;  They kept these men under observation, they say. First of all, they could have arrested them, and by the mere fact that they were members of an illegal organisation they could have brought them before the Military Tribunal.  Instead of that being done they kept them under observation.  Now, keeping these men under observation was a thing that was practically impossible to do whatever the number was.  Let us suppose there were ten or twelve there, and that there was reason to believe that these people, or some of them, would embark upon an unlawful act.  Judging from what the Minister has said as to the action of the police, their line was that they would keep them under observation and thereby catch them committing that act.  Well, any police force in the world will tell you that when you have a body of men working together in a criminal organisation that the only possible and successful course is to raid their meeting when it takes place, arrest them, and that the most futile and helpless course would be to leave them to scatter&mdash;afterwards using the police force for the purpose of watching the individuals at that meeting for whatever time might be thought necessary.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister says is to be taken as representing the police view, then there should certainly be an inquiry to consider whether or not the Commissioner of police should be kept in his position and if he is to hold that position.  Personally, as far as I am concerned, and taking superficial presumptions out of what we know, I would say that if what the Minister said is a fact: that the head of the police thought that the proper course would be to keep those individuals under observation, then he is not fit for the position that he holds, if that <Col N="1870" /> is the type of advice he gives the Government in its action to keep down crime in this country.  If that is the kind of advice that he gives to the Government, then it is perfectly understandable how a railway train could be derailed and two men murdered, how the young man O'Reilly could be beaten to death and how it is that Mr. More O'Ferrall could be murdered. All these things have happened.  It is no wonder that the organisations that make use of such methods can flourish in the country if our police system is such as the Minister suggests.  One can understand why the country is in the position that it is in.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that no assistance was given to the police.  I was here and listened to the debate on that occasion. Deputy Cosgrave spoke about taking up a position in that house.  The Commissioner of police could make inquiries about the police who occupied that house.  He need not go to a Deputy to get the information.  It would be much easier for him to find out, and he could find out for certain. He could inquire, first of all, from the people who were noticed to be there; he could inquire as to why no action was taken and as to why these men were gathered there.  He could inquire, if it was not done under his own orders, who was the subordinate of his who ordered particular activity on the following day.  In that way the Government could get quite a lot of information. The Minister says the police are satisfied that there was no association between that meeting and what happened on the following day.  I could understand that if the police had certain information that that meeting was a meeting of the I.R.A. and that the blowing up of the house and the murder of Mrs. McGrory on the following day was not the work of the I.R.A. But I do not see how they can know that it was not the work of the I.R.A. unless they have very good reasons for knowing that it was the work of some other organisation no way connected with the I.R.A. If they have that information, then an inquiry should be held to find out what that information is, and why <Col N="1871" /> it is that, with such information, the police are not able to bring the murderers of Mrs. McGrory to justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister gets up and talk with an air of injured innocence.  Is he anxious to get after these murders that are taking place?  Is he quite satisfied that the police are doing all that is possible to get after them?  The President, within the last few days, has publicly announced that his Government has borne things for three years that no other Government in the world would tolerate.  Now, I think there are very good reasons for inquiring why it is that the Government of this country tolerates things that no other country in the world would tolerate.  What have we seen?  Certainly, the President spoke the truth when he said what he did say: that the Government has tolerated the murder of Mrs. McGrory, the murder of Mr. More O'Ferrall, the murder of the two men on the railway and the murder of O'Reilly.  The President announces to the world that he tolerates these things.  If so, then he is a party to the guilt of them.  He has a pre-eminent duty, and that is the protection of the innate rights of the people of this country: their right to live and their right to protection from murder.  The President's own words are that he tolerates what no other Government in the world would tolerate.  If he had said that he refused to tolerate things that other countries tolerate he might have some justification.</P>
    <P>Our history has directed us in a course which disregards authority because authority in the past was vitiated by being alien.  We had to seek political ends by extra-political means in which violence was used. Even though that may have been justified at the time it creates a bad tradition in the country.  When an attempt was made to overthrow order here, everybody should have combined to create in this country a tradition to supplement the law, an absolute willing obedience to the law, but instead the President has tolerated criminal organisations which unlawfully aim at the overthrow of the State and seek to achieve their ends through <Col N="1872" /> the means of murder and violence.  He has publicly announced that he has tolerated that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that one argument used by the Minister was that this motion was put down, first of all, as a matter of urgency?  He argued that 13 months had elapsed since it first appeared on the Order Paper, and that the urgency behind it had since departed.  But the 13 months <Col N="1873" /> that have since elapsed have also been marked by crime similar in origin and nature.  I submit that gives this matter a different value and a different significance.  It gives it additional urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that I was seeking to extend the terms of the motion.  What I am concerned with is this, that in this country there is organised crime, and that there was organised crime in February of last year when a house was blown up in Dundalk and a woman murdered.  We have what I may call a form of moral certainty as to the organisation that was responsible for that murder.  I think, therefore, that the toleration of the organisation which probably was guilty of that specific murder&mdash;in any case, if it was not, it was guilty of others&mdash;is more than a matter for inquiry.  It is a matter of supreme urgent national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister gets up and blandly waives all that aside, and says that the urgency of this motion has departed&mdash;that there is no need to bother&mdash;I say that is the very negation of government.  I say that this crime, which was marked by particular brutality, was clearly an organised one.  One could trace cause and effect from what went on before and after it happened.  The police, I have no doubt, pursued inquiries, but they have not made use of all the powers that the law gives them.  The law gives the Government and the police power to arrest anybody known to belong to certain organisations.  That has not been done.  So far as I know, nobody has been arrested on the specific charge of being a member of an organisation aiming at the overthrow of this State, known to be responsible for murder and probably associated with the murder that we are dealing with.  That in itself is a matter that calls for very urgent inquiry.  The Minister gets up and talks about the duty of Deputies as citizens to assist the police.  There I entirely agree with him.  Not only <Col N="1874" /> Deputies but everybody is bound to do that, although Deputy Little refuted it at one time in this House, and Deputy Cooney refuted it completely.  Every citizen is bound to assist the police to bring murderers to justice, though Fianna Fáil Deputies did denounce such a proposal as asking them to become police informers.  I entirely accept it, that if I had any information that could at all assist the police in getting after the murderers of Mrs. McGrory, I would certainly give it, and I would not expect to be thanked, because I would be doing my mere duty.  Deputy Cosgrave, as far as I can judge, made a clear statement on the matter about a year ago.  He said that he was publicly placing before the House the information he had.  When it comes to assisting the police every citizen has a responsibility, but the pre-eminent and immediate responsibility rests upon the Government.  The Government is armed by law with power to put down organisations that are by nature criminal.  The Government has assiduously refused to employ the powers which the law gives it.  For a few months before we went out of office we had the power that this Government has.  During these few months these organisations were, I might say, notorious for their silence and their inactivity.  The I.R.A. were suddenly converted into lambs.  Yet the first thing this Government did was to release the men who were rightly and necessarily in gaol.  It did more, it released them and gave them jobs where they would be paid out of public funds.</P>

If the Government had used the powers that the law gives them, it was their patent duty to make use of them, so that that meeting could not possibly have taken place.  An attempt would not even have been made to let it take place, because it would be known that everyone participating in it would be immediately rammed into gaol or would be brought before the Military Tribunal and sentenced.  I never heard anything so fantastic as the Minister's suggestion that a meeting of an organisation, which there is reason to believe is going to result in crime, should be allowed to meet and go its way, and that the police could trust to luck to deal with each individual member.</P>

      <P>The Minister said something like this: &ldquo;It is for the police to decide the best way to act.&rdquo; He then went on to say that there was observation of a meeting rather than raiding.  The Minister said that under our régime, and before this Government came into power, people were kept under observation and that in every country in the world people were kept under observation.  From that I gathered that it was perfectly natural that the police should decide to let the meeting take place, and that they proposed to keep the people who were present under observation, but should not raid.  To me that is a perfectly fantastic proposal.  There are times when the police, believing they have no evidence against people who are engaged in something that is unlawful, endeavour to keep them under observation.  If just one or two men were concerned it is sometimes possible to keep them under close observation, but with organisations they lose track.  In the case of organisations meeting one might say that it is practically impossible to keep men under observation when they disperse. If the Minister's statement meant anything it was that the police had <Col N="1876" /> got information, and quite rightly believed that the meeting was to take place; that they let it take place and did not raid but kept the men under observation.  Comparing that with other countries I said that in other countries I thought always that if the police had reason to suspect that people were going to break the law, they acted.  In this case the police knew that every man who was present at the meeting was breaking the law; that they were acting unlawfully and were members of an organisation. What did they propose to do? Not to raid, not to arrest, but merely to keep them under observation.  The next day certainly the observation, as far as I can see, was attempted, because all around County Dublin one met parties of police and military apparently expecting something to happen.  Meanwhile this unfortunate woman in Dundalk was murdered. The Minister's reply is that it is 13 months since that happened, that there was nothing urgent about it or nothing to inquire about.</P>

      <P>I do not think a more disingenuous speech could be made in this House than the speech which we heard from the Minister for Justice to-night.  The Minister has not denied the truth of the statement of facts contained in the motion.  He has not denied that the Guards knew there was a meeting of engineers, or persons purporting to act in that capacity, going on about the 10th of February, 1934.  He has quoted or said that he had some police reports in his possession. He has not stated that he got them from any responsible member of the Guards or from the Commissioner from whom I expect he would receive information.  He has not denied that a considerable number of persons calling themselves engineers and belonging to different corps or branches of the I.R.A. met for the purpose of getting instruction for the making, laying and exploding of land mines.  He knows that and he has not denied it.  It is in the police reports to him.  Did the Government know that such a meeting was going to take place?  They did. Eight or ten detectives were not sent <Col N="1877" /> to watch the house, I suggest, unless they knew there was an important meeting there.  They knew it.  I challenged the Minister to deny that the meeting was for the purpose of the more efficient engineers giving instructions to the less efficient engineers in the construction of land mines.  That was allowed to go on.  Why?  Are men to be taught without interruption to use deadly and cowardly weapons for the destruction of the lives of citizens of this State or are lessons in murder to be given, and is it a sufficient answer for the Minister to get up and say: &ldquo;Oh, when people are giving and getting lessons in murder it is quite sufficient for the Guards to keep them under observation&rdquo;? The Minister has boasted&mdash; and boasted very proudly&mdash;that every single thing the I.R.A. do and every single thing they plan is known to him within 24 hours.  I dare say when he made that statement he had this particular case in mind.  That there was to be a meeting for the giving of instruction in the making and exploding of land mines, the Guards knew.  He has not denied it.  It was allowed to be carried on.  Why?  He gives us no answer and no explanation.  He suggested, rather than openly stated, that it was not because he or the Executive Council was interfering with the discretion of the Commissioner of the Guards.  Why did the Commissioner of the Guards allow that lesson in murder to be given, to the knowledge of the Guards, without interference?  Is not that a question which ought to be answered?  Ought there not be a public, judicial inquiry to satisfy the people of this State as to why the Commissioner and the responsible officers of the Guards, who should have dealt with this matter, did not deal with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister goes a bit further.  He says he is satisfied on police reports that there was no connection between the murder in County Louth and the lesson which was given and the mines which were constructed in Parnell Square the night before.  On what authority is he satisfied?  The Gárda authorities are indicted here.  They are charged here with negligence. <Col N="1878" /> They are charged with neglect of their duty.  They are charged with allowing a cowardly murder to take place when, if they did not know that that murder was going to take place, they must have known that some crime was going to be perpetrated.  What is the Minister's answer?  He says simply &ldquo;I must do precisely what the Commissioner of the Guards tells me and the Commissioner of the Guards pleads not guilty of the charge and says he is satisfied he himself was not negligent.&rdquo;  That is a new principle. The man who is charged with a very serious offence&mdash;allowing, through his gross carelessness, a murder to be committed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should be delighted if the Minister had defended the Commissioner, but he has not done so.  Surely I am entitled to draw a conclusion which every member in the House can draw for himself, having the evidence before him.  There is a mine constructed, and lessons are given in the construction of mines on a certain night.  There is police activity next day searching for the mine.  A mine is used in Dundalk the very next day, and is there anybody who has not sufficient brains to draw the conclusion that it was the same mine?  Drawing the conclusion&mdash;as every sane man must do&mdash;that it was the same mine, I say that the guilt, the inefficiency or the negligence of some member of the Guards&mdash;at any rate, the person who ought to be responsible for the Guards &mdash;is a matter that ought to be inquired into by an impartial judicial tribunal. If those concerned show that they were guiltless of negligence, nobody will be more pleased than I.  But the whole confidence of this State in the administration of the law will be shaken if a gross blunder has been committed&mdash; surely I can say that; I would use another description if you, a Leas Chinn Comhairle, would permit me&mdash; and there is no inquiry for the reason that, according to the Minister for Justice, the Guards are above the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that he is satisfied from the police reports that there is no connection between what occurred in Dublin and what occurred in Dundalk.  He has, apparently, stated that on police evidence. What are the facts?  We are entitled to know what they are.  The public is entitled to know, and the public mind ought to be relieved by a recitation of the facts&mdash;if they are facts.  The responsibility for law and <Col N="1880" /> order and the preservation of life is a very big responsibility.  Nobody would be better pleased than I if a judicial tribunal found that there was no connection between what happened in Dublin and what happened in Dundalk. Assuming that that is so, was there a meeting in Dublin and was it for the purpose of giving instruction in the preparation and detonation of land mines?  Was that a good purpose? Was it advisable that people should be allowed to assemble for instruction in the preparation and explosion of land mines?  The police are aware that a meeting was held there.  There is no connection, the Minister says, between that incident and what happened in Dundalk.  It was not for amusement that people were brought from different parts of the country to a house in Dublin to receive instruction in the preparation and detonation of land mines.  It was not for the purpose of blowing up ruins or roots of trees or blasting quarries that people were brought there.  That there was a meeting in Dublin there is no doubt. That it was for the purpose stated in the resolution there is no doubt.</P>
      <P>The newspapers of the 16th November, 1934, have a report of the trial of a man before the Military Tribunal. I do not propose to give any names. One of the charges against this man was that he refused to answer the following questions:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Were you in Dublin on the 10th February, 1934, in connection with the work of your organisation?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Did you travel to Dublin on 10th February, 1934, in company with another man?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Did you attend a demonstration of engineering whilst in Dublin between the 10th and 13th February?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is it that gives evidence that those questions were put to that man?  No less a person than the superintendent. Who instructed him to put them?  Just think for a moment of the whole construction of this particular case.  Men assembled from various parts of the country in a house in Dublin; they are allowed to remain there; they are allowed to go on with that course of <Col N="1881" /> engineering; and, six months afterwards, a man is arrested and prosecuted because he does not answer those questions.  Strangely enough, in the Party paper belonging to the Minister, those question are not set out.  What is set out is: &ldquo;He failed to give an account of his movements on February 10th.&rdquo;  Is it so important in November that a man has to be charged with an offence and prosecuted for an offence and convicted and sentenced for an offence, when, by a single act of commonsense administration, the Guards could have gone into that house and sent those men home about their business?</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate results of this lack of administration on the part of the Government, in the first place, and inefficiency on the part of the police, in the second place, is that young men <Col N="1882" /> in this country are allowed to join organisations which have motives that are unlawful and ungodly and are bringing them into bad ways.  It is not the responsibility of the young people but rather that of a week, incompetent administration and when you are asked to hold an inquiry into who is responsible for this, the answer is: &ldquo;It is so long ago that nobody is interested now and it is no longer a matter of public importance.&rdquo;  A police officer is sent to one person who recites the case here.  The very first question he is asked is: &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;  and he has to admit that he knows nothing.  If that is not incompetence on the part of the authorities in this country, I should like to know what incompetence is.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil the Government ought either to abandon the profession of Republicanism or to seek authority from the electorate for the immediate establishment of a Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a very long time; it has really been on the Order Paper for the better part of three years, because the genesis of it was at the time of the First Reading of the Constitution Amendment (Removal of Oath) Bill, when I stated that the time had arrived when we ought really to make up our minds whether it was in the interests of this country or not to be a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations and, if it was in our interests to continue such membership, that we ought not to embark upon a series of measures such as the Removal of the Oath Bill.  Since then there have been other measures tending in the same direction, measures which added nothing at all to the liberties possessed by this country, but which were calculated to do a great deal to destroy any value that might arise from the Commonwealth connection, in particular as regards the abolition of partition, because, by attacking matters of sentiment which do not really interfere with the liberties of this country, we are wiping out the best available means to our hand for conciliating the feelings of the majority in the North of Ireland. I said at that time that if we were going to embark upon such a course, if it was to be the policy of the Government of the Irish Free State to be continually seeking to wound the feelings unnecessarily of people who are attached to the Commonwealth connection, if it was to be the policy of the Irish Free State to be bringing in the sort of measures that excited the minds of the more ignorant of our own people, the sort of measures that brought existing institutions in this State into disrepute by suggesting that the whole foundation of those institutions was rotten, it would be <Col N="1885" /> better for us to make a clean sweep of the situation and to go out of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I think that we should get on very much better in dealing with this whole matter if we realised that there are no members of this House, I imagine none, certainly that there are no Parties in this House, who desire to see the governmental institutions of this country imposed upon us by any sort of compulsion, compulsion from without or compulsion from within. Now, the President and his colleagues suffer, or profess to suffer, acutely from the sensation that compulsion is being imposed upon us from without. Personally, it seems to me that, before bothering our heads about that question, it would be appropriate to consider on the merits what the best course for this country would be if there were no compulsion at all and whether possibly the best course in our own interests&mdash;our material interests, interests of prestige, and every other sort of interest&mdash;is to do the thing we are alleged to be compelled to do. Personally, I deny that such external compulsion exists.  It does not appear to me that the view of a few people across the water, and their desire to deny our right to separate, is of any importance.  What is important is that there is no responsible person in politics in this country, on either side of the House, who does not take the view that it is up to the Irish people themselves to decide whether or not they want to separate.</P>
    <P>While we are disputing as to whether there is external compulsion or not, I think that too little attention is paid to the other kind of compulsion, a compulsion which, to my mind, is much more a reality than the compulsion of which the President of the Executive Council complains.  I am not alluding primarily to the sort of compulsion that is exercised&mdash;although it is very real&mdash;by the existence of organisation in this country which threaten the stability of the State and the safety and liberty of the individual in the name of Republicanism.  I think that the existence of these organisations, and the amount of prestige which recent <Col N="1886" /> history, unfortunately, has given to them, does constitute a very genuine and very unfortunate form of compulsion which tends to rail-road us into being a Republic whether we want to or not.  There is a more subtle and more dangerous form of compulsion, however, and that is the sort of compulsion that is imposed upon us by what I would call, without any disrespectful intention at all, the compulsion of the dead hand.  It is a curious thing that, whereas there is no question so important to this country as what we call the national issue, it is of all questions the least discussed.  In fact, I have never heard it discussed on its merits during the little more than three years that I have been in Irish Free State politics.  It is never discussed because those who are in favour, or who say they are in favour, of a Republic will not allow it to be discussed on its merits.  They do not want to hear the arguments, pro and con, stated as if the question were an open question.  Their desire is to treat it as a question which is not open, a question upon which a decision has been taken, a question about which we are allowed to take one view and only one view if we are to be considered as patriotic Irishmen at all and if we are not to commit a terrible offence against the martyrs of 1916.</P>
    <P>I resent that sort of attempt to closure discussion on a matter that is vital to the interests of this country. Several times before in this House I have alluded to the men who lost their lives in the rebellion of 1916, and I do not think I have ever alluded to them without respect and appreciation of the sacrifice they made; but the history of Ireland did not begin in 1916, and a long line of other martyrs could be quoted who had not got just the same ideas about the governmental institutions of the country that those men had.  There is one fundamental feature in common between all the people who died for Ireland, whether they were Republicans or Royalists, or whatever they were, and that is that they loved their country so dearly that they were willing to sacrifice their lives for what they believed to be the good of the country.  What is the obligation <Col N="1887" /> that is imposed on us by the memory of such men?  Is it to take the precise view that they took at the time of their deaths, even though during the major part of their lives they may have held different views themselves, and even though there was diversity of opinion between the people who gave their lives for the country at different periods?  Is there any reason to be tied down to one particular set of these people and one particular set of opinions held by them at a particular epoch in their lives?  I say that our duty is the duty of considering the good of our country, and of considering such questions on their merits and not allowing our own minds to be closed to the consideration of what is for <Col N="1888" /> the advantage of the country&mdash;not dispensing ourselves from the duty and labour of thought and from the duty and the unpleasant task, if necessary, of taking an unpopular line of action, although in conflict with the trend of public opinion for the time being, and doing what in us lies to educate the people to a wider conception of what ought to be done in order to enable this country to reach its full stature and to enjoy the full fruits of liberty.</P>
