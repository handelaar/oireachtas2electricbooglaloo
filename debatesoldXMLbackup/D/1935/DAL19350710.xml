      <P>Sites have not yet been acquired.  Certain sites have been inspected, but it is not clear that in their selection sufficient attention has been paid to the question of a water supply.  An inspector is being sent to assist the Board in the formulation of a definite scheme. Sanction has been given to the raising of a loan for the Board's general housing scheme, in which the Athenry houses will be included.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware (1) that considerable quantities of last season's oats crop are still on hands; and if he will consider the question of providing immediately an outlet for this oats, as otherwise the surplus will have an injurious effect on the disposal of this season's crop, which promises to be heavy; and (2) whether he intends fixing a price for the 1935 oats <Col N="162" /> crop; and, if so, if he is yet in a position to state what the price will be.</P>

      <P>The position with reference to stocks of home-grown cereals of the 1934 crop is being carefully watched.  It is anticipated that the operation of the Order recently made under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933, requiring registered maize millers to increase from 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. the proportion of home-grown cereals in a maize meal mixture will result in the absorption of all or almost all of last year's oat crop still on hands.  As regards the latter part of the question, it will depend on the prices which will be paid for oats of the 1935 crop, when it comes on the market, whether it will be necessary to fix the price of this cereal.</P>

      <P>The stock of materials and goods, machines, etc., under the control of the Gaeltacht Services Division of the Department of Lands was taken as at 31st March last.  The actual figures revealed by the stocktaking are under examination at present, but owing to the process of reorganisation it has not been found practicable to complete the appropriate figures in respect of the actual survey.  These figures will be conveyed to the Deputy as soon as the calculations are complete.  The difference between the actual sum realised and the amount estimated to be received by way of Appropriations-in-Aid will be included in the surplus on the Vote to be surrendered to the Exchequer in the usual way.</P>

      <P>That in the case of the Finance Bill, 1935:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Report Stage of the Bill shall be the first Order of the day on Wednesday, July 10th, 1935, and the proceedings on that Stage if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. on that day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion and after the appointed time no Question shall be put from the Chair upon any amendment set down to the Bill save on an amendment set down by the Government, and the Question on such an amendment shall be in the form, That the amendment be made.</P>
      <P>2.  The Fifth Stage of the Bill shall be considered immediately on the conclusion of the Fourth Stage on Wednesday, July 10th, 1935, and the proceedings on that Stage if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 9 p.m. on that day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> There are just two facts to be mentioned in connection with this Bill. One is that the Bill must be law by the week ending the 3rd August. Therefore, the last day upon which it could come back from the Seanad would be the 2nd August if there are any matters coming back from the Seanad to be dealt with.  Therefore, in order to give the Seanad their full time for the discussion of the Bill, it is necessary to pass the Bill at once. The second point is that, on the various stages of the Finance Bill we have already taken 74 hours and 50 minutes, and if the House wishes, we can add five hours to that now, which figure disposes of the argument that ample opportunity has not been given for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must oppose this motion, Sir.  Even if the Parliamentary Secretary has not advanced very far, I am glad that he has advanced a little further than yesterday.  Yesterday, misled, possibly, by the events of last week, he seemed to assume that the mere statement from any member of the Party opposite &mdash; Minister, Parliamentary Secretary, or otherwise&mdash;that a certain matter was urgent, should preclude all discussion and that that statement was sufficient to get the view accepted by the House.  That the Parliamentary Secretary should be under such a delusion was natural enough after the way in which the majority Party in the House conducted the business towards the end of last week.  Again, however, neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor any Minister has answered the question as to why the matter is now urgent.  None of them has attempted to controvert the statement, that, if there is blame in this matter, the blame rests on the Government in not having their financial business up to time.  Neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary, at any stage, has dealt with the question of what was the necessity for the postponement of the original date of the Budget.  Here we have Parliamentary institutions made a mockery of, and the alleged excuse for that was the Spring Show! At all events, <Col N="166" /> that was the official excuse for the postponement of the Budget, and the attendance of Ministers at the Spring Show has now brought about, as one of its consequences, if we take that explanation, this series of resolutions that we have before us&mdash;the lamentable proceedings of the week-end and the resolutions that we have before us to-day.</P>
      <P>That was the first cause of the trouble in which the Government now finds itself.  Then, we have had no explanation of the postponement of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  None at all!  Those of us who were in this House and attended it regularly for the past couple of weeks know perfectly well that there was a lot of time devoted to business that could not be described as extremely urgent, and yet there was no objection there.  Hour after hour was occupied in business that could not be described by any stretch of the imagination as urgent.  It is only when it is necessary to curtail still further the rights of the ordinary Deputy in this House that, suddenly, the Government discovers urgency.  Then we have this sudden respect for the Seanad, as if the Seanad never got a Finance Bill late.  That respect for the Seanad is rather amusing coming from the quarter from which it comes.  I know that it is a tradition in this country that we should respect the dead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the sentiment, perhaps, but, for the moment, it strikes me that the respect of the Government in this connection partakes more of the nature of the courtesy or politeness of the assassin, doing things gently and with gloves on when he is stabbing the victim.  That is more the kind of politeness displayed by the Government towards the Seanad at the present moment.  Is there anybody who could seriously entertain the Government's plea that it must urge forward these resolutions because of its respect for the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> Now, Sir, what are they doing? The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out the number of hours that have been devoted already to this Budget.  Well, as his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, boasted, this is a unique Budget&mdash;a statement that was received with full approval from every side of the House.  It was one of the few statements on this Budget that was received with unanimous approval&mdash;that it was a unique Budget.  I wonder whether it is beginning to dawn on the majority Party in this House how unique the Budget is and how unique the country is beginning to see that the Budget is. Does anybody suggest that that unique Budget, taxing the very necessities of life and putting on innumerable taxes, none of which had been previously examined, did not require proper and full examination; or is it the view of the majority Party in this House that the function of the House is, if I might use the phrase used by the Minister for Finance in 1932 on the Emergency Duties Bill, to review and subsequently confirm such matters? I think the phrase be used was that certain drastic action of the Government on financial matters was subject to review and to subsequent confirmation.  Apparently, now, the Government's idea of the functions of a Parliament is to give subsequent confirmation to the actions of the Government&mdash;not to examine them. A certain amount of time was spent on Friday and Saturday last examining an immense Schedule to this particular Bill.  Quite an amount of light was thrown, not merely on the individual items of that Schedule, but on the whole policy of the Government in so far as it was illustrated and covered by that Schedule.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested yesterday that there was repetition when I challenged him as to where there was any irrelevancy. He said there was repetition. If he will examine the debate, I do not think he will find that there was any undue repetition except on his own part.  I think I heard more than once, more than twice&mdash;perhaps more <Col N="168" /> than a dozen times&mdash;that 20 per cent. is enough of a tariff, and that therefore the Minister proposed giving 40 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 50 per cent. sometimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sometimes 50 per cent. and sometimes 100 per cent., but I think it was the 40 per cent. that was repeated most often. Again and again we heard, in reference to the various articles embraced in that Schedule, the boast of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the sufficiency, of the efficacy of the 20 per cent. tax, but, without any explanation&mdash;and I will admit that he was given several opportunities of giving an explanation&mdash;he said that he was giving 40 per cent.  It was not out of place to point out in that particular connection that, not merely was he unduly taxing the people, which, of course, might appeal to his colleague, but that, in addition, he was damaging the industries that he was pretending to protect.  Was there anything obstructive in bringing these facts to light, in reference to the different items in that Schedule?  It was necessary to do so.  I think the revelation of the Government attitude on these things shocked even such an out-and-out protectionist as Deputy Belton: namely, that you were doing good to industry, when 20 per cent. tariff was found to be extremely efficient, by giving 40 per cent.  I think that to anybody interested in the future of finance in this country, or of protection in this country, the debates and the attitude of the Government as displayed in those debates on Friday and Saturday should prove exceedingly interesting.  After all, it is those matters that we are supposed to discuss in the Budget, and no amount of mathematical calculation on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; simple addition is generally what the Government is quite good at; their higher mathematics do not go <Col N="169" /> beyond that&mdash;can relieve the Opposition of the duty of examining those items.  Many of those items that were debated last week were then debated for the first time, and it was then that the revelation of the Government policy in reference to them was afforded.  A proper examination had to be given, and as the Opposition at all events cannot regard themselves, as I said already, merely as the conduit pipe to convey to the people the wishes of the majority on those matters, the Opposition felt bound fully to examine those things.  I think that examination will show the evils inherent in the Government policy&mdash;in the policy of protection as it is carried out and exercised by them.  I thoroughly agree with the position taken up, in this matter at all events, by Deputy Belton&mdash;that this particular procedure and that particular policy are much more calculated to damage the cause of protection than anything that could be said against it from an out-and-out free trade point of view.  There was a very useful number of hours spent on Friday and on Saturday in bringing those things to light.  The Government does not like examination of those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will admit that there was a welcome contrast between the conduct of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;although we thoroughly disagreed with him, and although he did feel it was expedient to shout once or twice&mdash;and that of his colleague.  From his colleague, I think it will be admitted, no help whatsoever was given in the discussion on this unique Budget. I think the absence from the House of the President of the Executive Council&mdash;the Leader of the House and also the Chairman of the majority Party who are pushing their wills over on the House&mdash;during all that Budget debate calls for explanation.  Possibly it is not the kind of Budget that he cared to grace with his presence.  It is possible, of course, that he may have been engaged in pressing work elsewhere, and that he could not spare all his talents to help the Minister for Finance to bankrupt the country. He may have been engaged in pressing &ldquo;national&rdquo; work during the past <Col N="170" /> week, which prevented his attendance in this House.  Other financial matters, or other crises may, despite the national crisis, have engaged the attention of the President.  His presence elsewhere may have been more vital from his point of view&mdash;from the point of view not of the Government but at least of the majority.  Party&mdash; than here in this House.  A little more <i>savoir-faire</i> on the part of the Minister for Finance, and the presence of the President might undoubtedly have avoided a certain amount of the events that occurred last week.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that a certain amount of time has been spent on this Budget this year.  I do not think that it dawned on anybody on this side, and I am perfectly sure it did not dawn on anybody on the other side, that the Fianna Fáil Government would introduce a Budget like this, and it was necessary that time should be spent on it.  When we see the Government apparently blindly, obstinately, and deliberately plunging into this kind of financial mess, or rather plunging the country into it, it is the duty not merely of the Opposition but even of the occupants of the Government Benches to try to help them out of that particular mess.  But we had no contribution, practically speaking, from the Government Benches.  Both the President and Deputy Corry were silent.  We had the President, the Minister for Finance, and Deputy Corry, all silent on this matter.</P>
    <P>Here is a resolution anyhow on which they can speak.  I am sure that the three Deputies whom I mentioned are much more at home in trampling on the Opposition, and insisting that the majority has the right to do it and has the power to do it, in connection with this resolution, than they are in discussing or defending the taxes imposed by the Budget.  I therefore suggest that, if the President is not still busy with urgent business elsewhere, he be asked to take part in this debate.  We got no assistance in the effort to clarify or to defend the Government policy from the Minister who is supposed to be responsible.  We saw him last week alternate between sulks and attempts <Col N="171" /> to browbeat either the Chair or the House.  That is what was evident to us on this side of the House&mdash;those attempts on his part.  He alternated between one and the other.  That was the contribution of the Minister responsible for the financial business in this House to the debate on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There must be an examination of the Bill on the Committee Stage; that is when there is supposed to be examination of the details, of the incidence, and of the consequences of the various taxes put forward.  That was the time to justify the different taxes put forward.  I do not say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce justified them, but he at least made an attempt to articulate the Government point of view.  He certainly says that he made an attempt to justify it. When last week we saw tax after tax being gaily imposed by the Government to the refrain: &ldquo;20 per cent. is enough but we will put on 40 per cent.&rdquo;, without any advertence by the Government from beginning to end to the effect on the consumer, or any reference to the interests of the consumer, then the clear duty of the Opposition was to examine those things, and there is no justification for the line now taken up by the Government. If there has been delay, the delay is due, as I pointed out, to the original determination of the Government to postpone the introduction of their Budget so that they could be photographed at the Spring Show.  To them, that is, I admit, undoubtedly more important than the ordinary rights of Parliamentary institutions or the privileges of democracy.  That was the alleged excuse, at all events.  It may be that the Government had not then made up its mind that it wanted a new Budget.  However, we can only take the official excuse.  There was subsequent delay.  We saw business, and by no means vital business, not so vital as this particular Budget, put through the House day after day.  The original fault, the primary fault for delay lies with the Government, and on that account the House should not accede <Col N="172" /> to the wishes of the Government in this respect.</P>

      <P>The position for the past few weeks was that by their methods of obstruction the Opposition have been endeavouring to turn the proceedings of the Dáil into a farce.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is their firm intention to prevent the plans of the Party opposite to destroy these principles and these institutions by the methods they have adopted.  This motion is a weapon to be used for that purpose.  The Party opposite have been given adequate opportunity of expressing their views upon the proposals in the Finance Bill.  These proposals were discussed at length when the Financial Resolutions were before the Dáil upon two occasions.  They were also discussed at great length and with considerable amount of repetition during the two stages of that Bill before the House.  The Finance Bill must become law before the 5th August or the whole finances of the State are disorganised. The aim of the Party opposite, by obstructing the passage of the measure, is intended to ensure that the finances of this State will become disorganised. They are careless of what damage they may do to the financial position or the credit position of this State so long as they can score a petty Party advantage. There is barely time to secure the passage of this measure in time.  It must go to the Seanad, and the Seanad is entitled to 21 days for its consideration. There is no precedent for the <Col N="173" /> Seanad being given less than 21 days for the consideration of the Finance Bill.  Unless this Bill passes this House to-day it cannot become law in the time provided by the Constitution, if the Seanad insist upon exercising their rights to consider that Bill for 21 days. If the Bill does not become law within 21 days very considerable damage will be done, not merely to the plans of the Government but damage will be done to every citizen of this State. This motion is necessary to protect the interests of this State and its people, and that is why it must pass to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few brief words on this matter.  The Government organ became mixed up on the 16th May, when it wanted to persuade people that the Budget it was then reporting to them indicated a reduction in expenditure in this country. The account was headed &ldquo;Reduction in Expenditure.&rdquo;  It required a certain amount of skill and a certain amount of imagination to persuade people that there was to be a reduction of expenditure in the country with the bills that were being handed out with this Budget to each individual householder in the country.  Things became mixed up. Therefore, it is in the columns of the sports report that we find some references that were intended to be inserted in the leading article about the Budget.  It was in the sports report that we read that this was the gosh darnest almightyest doo-dingle that was ever before seen.  This was made to refer to the new Irish heavy-weight wrestler in the United States.  But I submit that the paragraph really belonged to the description of the Budget that was being brought before the notice of the people that day.  Also, there was a little displacement that indicated that &ldquo;a sick and wilting industry has been developed into a thriving sport.&rdquo;  That unfortunately got into the columns of the wrestling report too, instead of into the leading article regarding taxation.  It was also indicated &ldquo;that nobody thought of the new technique before.&rdquo;  Now we have passed to another stage, and we can no longer say of the Budget <Col N="174" /> proposals here that they were the gosh darnest almightyest doo-dingle that was ever seen, because we have gone a step further, and these three motions have outwhipped the original whip, and we have to deal with scorpions now.  I do not say that we have seen the end of it, for when I see this guillotine motion I wonder, like the <i>Irish Press</i> writer, that nobody thought of this new technique before.  Yesterday, however, we got the explanation: &ldquo;We have now for the first time in this House a Government with a majority,&rdquo; and therefore we see the things that we are seeing, and instead of &ldquo;a sick and wilting industry,&rdquo; like taxation was up to the present, we see now that it is a thriving sport.  The Minister's assistants in this sport can go and stick their noses into every home, and after inspecting everything in these houses, come back to the Minister at night and say: &ldquo;You see what we thought could be taxed to-day.&rdquo;  They look into the smallest items in the homes, and the only things now left to tax are the little odds and ends that find their way into odd boxes and vases and are called in the Gaeltacht craithnisí.  We will have a further schedule of them for taxation or a further emergency Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot by his guillotine motion make this country a more thriving country than the people can make it under present circumstances. There is not a section of the community that is not put to the pin of its collar to-day not so much to find the wherewithal to pay taxation, but to find the wherewithal to keep themselves and their families in any kind of a decent position.  Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce having now thrown at his disposal for a few months the troop of people who were seeking out any new articles that could be taxed, take these people and send them around to his employment exchanges and make an inquiry from every person under 22 years of age and try and find out from them what industrial hope they have under the present circumstances?  Will the Minister carry out an examination like that?  Here we have the people whose principal industry is cut away and burdened by taxation, year after year <Col N="175" /> and going deeper and deeper into it. The main burden lies on them, on their initiative, with their own resources, to eke out an existence here either in agriculture or in any industrial circumstances here, and what are the prospects for them?  The Minister has, by his Budget, just skinned every man and woman of any few pence that are left.  What hope is he leaving to them to make a livelihood in the country, where the depression grows more serious as a result of his Budget?</P>
    <P>Guillotines will not save the matter. Shutting your ears to argument will not save the matter.  Keeping silent, like the Minister for Finance when information has to be given or explanations have to be made, is not going to help either the Government or the people.  If the people are forced to continue under the conditions under which they are at present, all the protestations of the Ministry as to the greatness of their nationalism and the high ideals they have for this country and its people will all be nothing but so much frothing of people who have got nothing but their own pride or their own ignorance, or their blind spite, not so much against anybody else in the country as against the fact that circumstances have driven them along the lines they have followed. The Minister with his guillotine to-day can force all this huge burden of taxation through.  It is already down on the backs of the people.  But the Ministers have responsibility; they have the future of the people to safeguard, whose conditions they have to try and improve.  They are doing nothing but making them worse.  By their actions here they are destroying the only institutions that can serve to direct the people upon proper roads industrially, agriculturally, or socially. If they go very much further in the destruction of these institutions, then their last state will be very much worse than the first and so will that of the people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is very glib, but even his glibness is not going to help either himself or the people if his glibness is simply going to cover up the actual <Col N="176" /> destruction of these institutions of Government that the people have had up to the present.</P>

      <P>This motion deals with a Bill which bears on its final page: &ldquo;Ordered by Dáil Eireann to be printed, 6th July, 1935.&rdquo;  This is the 10th July and this measure of 41 pages, according to the guillotine motion before us, has to be passed through all its stages in this House in four days.  Whenever one hears a good deal of noise from Ministers or sees it portrayed in the newspapers of the majority Party in this House, one may reasonably come to the conclusion that they are getting nervous.  They make most noise when they are most nervous. It has been stated that this motion is for the purpose of preserving the democratic institutions of this State.  The motion in its own terms bears its own condemnation.  The newspaper to which I have referred makes reference this morning to 121 speeches in connection with the various items which are going to be taxed under this Bill.  On page 21 of the Bill the Schedules begin, and there are in all eight Schedules.  The first has 29 different items which are going to be taxed and the second 17.  The third has one with 30 different scales of charges in it, and in Part II there are four drawbacks; in (a) five drawbacks; in (b) six drawbacks, and in (c) 15 drawbacks.  The fourth Schedule has eight items and the fifth has one, with 11 different scales in it.  Part II of the fifth Schedule has three different scales in it and Part III has three different scales.  The sixth Schedule has six different items, the seventh has in Parts I and II six terminations of duties; in Part III, one termination; in Part IV, two terminations.  The eighth Schedule has 18 different items. So that there are in all 83 separate items, and if one includes the separate scales of charges, there are in all 126 different items.  Yet complaint was made by the organ of the majority Party in this House that there were 121 speeches in respect of all these items&mdash;five short of the total number of items under review! The measure was introduced on the 6th July.  The <Col N="177" /> Seanad is to be given 21 days to consider it and the Dáil four.</P>

      <P>Since the 6th July.  If the House has discussed the Budget of the Minister it has discussed a Budget which was introduced at a later date than any Budget since this State was set up.  What was the meaning of the delay?  There was no other reason for the delay than that Ministers were aghast at the taxation that had to be imposed; that they argued and disputed and delayed in the hope, like Mr. Micawber, that something would turn up.  If anything is damaging the credit of this State it is that sort of business.  No State can ever prosper if the facts of the case that should be presented are kept from it, and the facts of this case are serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Budget introduced by the present Government proposed to collect from the people £27,000,000.  They have gone up the scale until this Bill seeks to impose taxation which the Minister estimates at £29,300,000.  The Government's first Budget put £4,000,000 extra taxation on the people and every succeeding Budget they introduced since has increased the taxation on the people.  If 74 hours were absorbed in the discussion of the Budget, where else should it be discussed except in the Parliament of the people?  Who else has a right to discuss a measure concerning taxation except the representatives of the people? Do the rights of the people belong only to one Party?  The people of the country as a whole contribute their quota to the taxation imposed in this Budget and if they see, year after year, millions mounting upon millions, and the receipts from the main industry of the country going down, who has the right to speak on that subject except those who have been sent here by the votes of the people?  Are four days considered to be sufficient to discuss a Finance Bill?  Do not talk to us about having discussed the details of this measure for 70 hours.  We are now dealing with the main fundamental principles involved not alone in connection <Col N="178" /> with taxation, but the whole financial economy of this State.</P>
    <P>The excuse given for the introduction of this measure is that it is to preserve what they call the democratic institutions of this State.  Let us examine that.  What has been the history of the whole world in connection with democracy? When one examines the historical inroads upon democratic rights one finds that they have been to get for rulers, for monarchs as they were called up to the time of the revolution, for Czars, or Emperors, or Kings, authority over the people's purse, and the people's representatives in Parliament, year after year, resented that encroachment upon their liberties and rights.  Now we come to the point where there are no longer monarchs attempting to seize the people's purse and their authority and liberties.  We have the Star Chamber method of those who posture before the people as being the democrats of to-day.  What are they doing?  They are resorting to practices and systems that even monarchs in their worst days would not have attempted.</P>
    <P>This thing is not unheard of in this country, as I have said in this House before.  An Irish Parliament met at one time in the Blue Coat School. Only by a single vote did the House refuse to give funds for 21 years. One man stood between the rulers of that time and the people.  If 60 or 70 men stand to-day against the rapacity of the rulers of this State to take from the people what they are unable to give, are we to be told that it is for the preservation of democratic rights that a guillotine motion such as this is going to closure discussion in the Dáil and to prevent the people of this country from knowing what is being taken from them?  We have a right to discuss the injury that is being done to the national credit of the State by taxation of this description.  It is time that there should be some protest against our modern rulers treading the very same path and going the same way that other rulers in the past have gone.  They should realise that the democratic rights that were won by the sweat and labour of the people will not be lightly given up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave worked himself into a white heat over an imaginary grievance.  He complains that the Government have brought in a closure motion, after 74 hours had been devoted to one stage of a Bill. He says that Deputies of this House are the only people into whose hands is given the right to defend the people and to prevent this taxation, but he does not tell us of the type of speech made during these 74 hours.  I was listening here on Friday night to Deputy Belton telling us how one could make a football.  He told us how you got your wax-ends and how you got your leather and made the football. Other speakers behaved in the same way.  We had ten hours on Friday of that sort of talk.  We met again on Saturday and we got from Deputy Bennett directions as to how we were to play football, and suggestions as to how we should pick a team and the type of football we should use.  What sort of contribution is that to the financial business of the State?  When we were in Opposition this very identical closure motion was used. Yet the maximum time this Party took to discuss the Finance Bill was 17 hours in 1929.  For the last two years we were in Opposition we spent only 11 hours in discussing it.  Here we have 74 hours already taken by the Opposition on the Financial Resolutions and on the Finance Bill up to the present stage.  Still they complain that we are closuring them! Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Cosgrave and the rest of them pretend that they have the greatest respect for democratic institutions.  They have always been accusing us of trying to burst them up. I suggest to them that until they are able to give a better contribution to the debates here and tell us in more constructive language what should be done, instead of wasting time in telling us how to pick football teams, how to make footballs and rubbish of that kind, the people will know how to deal with them.  They took their measure long ago in the elections, but if they go on as they have been going on for some days past here, even the small <Col N="180" /> number of Deputies they have in this House now will be very much reduced by the time the next election comes on, if they do not get down to business and stop this nonsense.</P>

      <P>It is rather startling to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of all people, making the charge against members of this Party that their aim is to disorganise the finances of the State.  If that were true of any member of this House he would not deserve to sit in this House either as Minister or Deputy.  As I say, it is rather startling to hear such a pronouncement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having regard to his performances in the year 1929 when the Third National Loan was floated.  He went out through the country and he made a speech on a Sunday.  The National Loan was being opened on the following morning.  In that speech he told the people&mdash;and it was published in every newspaper up and down the country&mdash;that this country was sinking into a bog of bankruptcy.  By way of proving that that was not an accidental performance on his part, but that it was part of a conspiracy, I may say that his colleague, who is now the Vice-President, speaking in another part of the country 40 miles away, used a similar expression when he told his audience that the outlook was as black as night. These are the patriots who come into this House now and who say that the Party who are endeavouring to protect the rights of the people are aiming at the disorganisation of the national finances.  What was the meaning of these two speeches in 1929?  What was the meaning of the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time except to prevent the people of this country from subscribing to the National Loan?  What was the object except to make the loan a failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to tell us to-day that the present motion was necessary for the preservation of democratic institutions. That is a very nice sentiment from the Minister who gets up to advocate <Col N="181" /> this gag motion.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, by reason of his well-known love for truth deserves to be known as the George Washington of that Party. He certainly has shown somewhat more than his customary audacity in suggesting that this motion is calculated to preserve democratic institutions in this country.  Judging by our experience of this House last week and this week, motions to gag the Dáil are becoming part of the daily procedure in this House.  Some time about a year ago the President told the House on one occasion that he would like to give the Dáil a six months' holiday. The aspiration expressed in that statement is being carried out by other but more dangerous methods because this motion is part of the machinery to prevent criticism in the Dáil, and to prevent representatives of the people on this side of the House expressing their views on the burden of taxation that is now being imposed on the country.  The closure on the Finance Bill which taxes every necessity of life and the closure on Estimates, involving an expenditure of £11,000,000, is rendered all the more scandalous by the conduct or the misconduct of the responsible Minister, if one can use the word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in any of its senses with regard to the Minister for Finance.  We remember his insulting disregard for the rights of the House, the rights of the people and the people's representatives in this House, when he sat in the House last week reading his &ldquo;yellow-back&rdquo; and ignoring every request for information on the scope and meaning of his Budget.  That conduct was such that he would have been more fittingly employed sitting outside in the Lobby playing a ukelele than sitting in this House, showing his contempt for the Chair and the Deputies of this House.  Apart from the usual scheme of stifling discussion, the Minister has a very particular reason for stifling discussion on this year's Budget with its top-heavy cargo of new burdens on the back of the people.</P>
    <P>The great author of the scheme for <Col N="182" /> reducing taxation by £2,000,000 now presents us with a Budget in which taxation is increased by over £8,000,000 and, fittingly and appropriately enough, he has sitting behind him as Parliamentary Secretary the gentleman who achieved fame by his scheme for abolishing income tax and who, having achieved fame in that way and arrived in this House, has amused a cynical world ever since by his oleaginous advocacy of an income tax more than 50 per cent. higher than the income tax that existed in 1931. I say these proceedings in this House are designed and calculated to establish a dictatorship in this country. The Party opposite profess a hatred for the name of a dictatorship but they have, in fact, established a dictatorship here in substance and in essence.  They profess a love for the word &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;, but they violate every principle on which every republic is founded by taking away and destroying, so far as they are able to do it, the rights of the people in this State.</P>

      <P>This Government is almost three years in office and during that time they have carried out a very heavy legislative programme.  I think we can say that we have sat for far more days in the year than our predecessors did.  We have had much more business to do.  We have given many more facilities in general.  The fundamental question here is whether, when a Government is returned, it is <Col N="183" /> to be allowed to carry out its duties. As has been stated by the Minister for Agriculture, this is a Government which for the first time has a majority of the elected representatives of the Irish Free State.  Deputy Cosgrave assured the people when this Government came in that they were to be facilitated.  I would like the Opposition to show where they were facilitated.  They were facilitated when Bills like the Unemployment Assistance Bill, involving very large sums of money, were being put through.  The large sums involved in those Bills are, of course, mainly responsible for the taxation that the Opposition now complain of.  Those Bills were allowed through the House with practically no criticism from the Opposition.  There is no criticism when money is being spent, but there is plenty of criticism when money is being collected.</P>
      <P>The Opposition are not at all consistent. The Government is consistent. The country knows the Government's policy, knows that it stands for a policy of out-and-out protection.  There is no question of examination by Tariff Commissions.  The Eighth Schedule, if we look at it from the revenue point of view, on which the whole of this rubbishy discussion last Saturday took place, brings in about £5,000.  It concerns items like cricket balls, tennis racquets, footballs and so on.  Have we not been told by the Opposition in the South Dublin Election that no tariff that is put on by this Government would be removed by them?  Why has it been necessary for the past three years to hold up the work of the Government of the country by a senseless and ridiculous obstruction to a policy that they say now they favour?  Not alone Deputy Cosgrave, but Deputy MacDermot, indicated that outside.  There has been senseless obstruction on these items in the Schedule.  There has been no criticism and no amendment of any importance or any utility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general propaganda against the Budget, nobody can say that the country has not got plenty <Col N="184" /> of it.  In two by-elections in two very important constituencies the Opposition have had plenty of opportunities and they may have more opportunities of putting their case before the public. Discussions in relation to the Budget have been going on in this House for something like three months.  It is absolute nonsense to pretend that there is any stifling of discussion.  The simple fact is that the business has got to be got through by a certain time.  We do not mind sitting through the whole of August and September to get the business through, if necessary, and we have shown that.  What is the attitude of the Opposition in regard to this financial business?  We were told the Opposition were going to facilitate the Government, were going to be a reasonable Opposition and a patriotic Opposition; we were told they were going to see that the fundamental principles were carried out and that the business of the country was going to be done.  Where is that Opposition at the present time?</P>
    <P>Deputy Rice tells us the President wants a six months' holiday.  Of course he does.  Was it not the custom for ten years to sit for a small number of weeks in the year for one and a half to two and a half days?  Have we not been trying to do the business of the country by sitting for four days each week and yet we are not able to get it done?  If we give Deputies a few all-night sittings they will tell us that their health cannot stand it and they are too delicate.  In any case, they have to be at home saving the hay.  We are men and we prefer the humane killer.  We used to hear, when business was not nearly so pressing, when the whole of the finance business, including the Finance Bill, the Budget Resolution and the Estimates were got through in about 80 hours, that Ministers had not much time to do their business.  At least two Ministers of the previous Government said here that they were sick and tired of the Opposition in this House, as it gave them no time to do the ordinary business of the country.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Opposition to talk in the Dáil, but it is not by <Col N="185" /> talk that business is done.  If Ministers are going to be detained in the Dáil for a large portion of the year, sitting four days per week, it is quite evident they cannot attend to their administrative business.  That is one of the reasons why there is delay in producing legislation.  The Government is put to the pin of its collar to give these measures the consideration that is necessary, thinking them out, drafting them and preparing them. We were often reminded of that fact, not once but several times, during important debates that took place here in the past.  That seems to be entirely forgotten now.  Did not Deputy Cosgrave, when he was President, and his Ministers, frequently tell us that we were absolutely silly to think that the real business of the country was done in the Dáil?  They told us the real business of the country was done in the Government offices, by Ministers in touch with their staffs of officials, carrying out the business of their Departments.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the Government, with the majority of the people behind them, an unqualified majority, for certain aspects of its policy, and with support even from the leaders of the Opposition, is entitled to hold up this senseless obstruction.  We had to consider amendments here to every single line of the Schedule, and the whole of the Schedule was only a fleabite, not worthy of consideration, if the other issues are of such magnitude as we are told.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to stress, and that is the point brought up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which seems to have annoyed Deputy Cosgrave.  That point is that when the pressure is so great, as it has been found in every modern State, when the economic pressure, the effort to solve economic problems, to get solutions as near perfection as possible, and to get Government policy through all the stages of complicated machinery is so great, there is no Parliament in the world that could be satisfied that business is being carried on in the way it should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> We are not living in the mid-Victorian age; we are living in an age of great pressure and it is just because Parliamentary institutions have not been able to do their work that they have been abolished, and that gentlemen in black shirts or blue shirts or red shirts have come along with their little groups of followers and laid down the law, because in these countries they feel that they have men with a will, and with at least a definite policy, at the head of affairs.  This Government, as well as any other Government in Europe to-day, at any rate has a definite policy.  There can be no doubt whatever about it.  It is obvious to everybody.  It is clear to everybody.  It is the policy that we were elected on and the policy we are carrying out.  We ask from these gentlemen, who would try to put other systems of government in force in this country, if the opportunity were given to them and the circumstances were favourable, to be a little more sincere in their criticisms of democratic institutions and to try to enable this Government to do its business in a proper and legitimate way.</P>

      <P>The motion which is now before the House, is in my view, a scandalous, a shocking and a shameful attempt to uproot Parliamentary institutions and turn them into a mockery, a delusion, and a snare.  Here we are dealing with the most important measure of the year, a Bill that touches every member of the community and comes home to the business and the bosom of every man in the Free State.  Why all this indecent haste?  Since the cow jumped over the moon and the dish ran away with the spoon there was never such a reversal of established order, and the only excuses that were put forward for this are urgency and obstruction&mdash;words as blessed as Mesopotamia.  Why all this urgency?  Who have been the cause of the delay?  There was ample time to have this Budget brought forward in such a way as to give the representatives of the people the chance of carrying out their main function, which is to see that the burdens imposed upon <Col N="187" /> the people are not appallingly oppressive, if not actually impossible.  The leader of the Opposition has dealt effectively with the plea of obstruction.</P>
      <P>An attempt has been made to show that there was some organised obstruction to the measure, but I think that the leader of the Opposition has disposed of that argument.  Finally, as a last resort, the Minister for Industry and Commerce appealed to the sacred name of democracy.  Well, all I can say is: Democracy! Many crimes are committed in thy name! The villain of the whole piece&mdash;I do not use the word in any derogatory sense&mdash;who is not in the House at the present moment, sat there smug and self-satisfied, reminding one of little Jack Horner, sitting in the corner, munching his Budget pie.  It may well be, however, that whatever plum, if any, he may happen to pull out will give him a very bad attack of indigestion, which will call for the assistance of the Minister for Agriculture.  There was an old land agent in Ireland many years ago, who gave evidence before a Commission set up by the British Parliament. He was asked what was the best way to make the Irish farmers prosperous, and his answer was: &ldquo;Salt them well with rent.&rdquo;  It appears to be the policy of the present Government and their belief that the only way in which the people of the Free State can be made prosperous, happy, and contented is by salting them well with taxes&mdash;taxes of such a nature that, if continued, they are bound to bring on a condition of national bankruptcy in this country.  Of course, I know that the motion will be carried by the House, but it will be a Pyrrhic victory that may prove very dear to the victors. Time, after all, is the best almanack, and we&mdash;the minority, if you wish&mdash; sitting on this side of the House, confidently leave the verdict to that impartial tribunal.</P>

      <P>When there was a similar motion before the House yesterday I felt a bit at sea, and did not know where the boat was drifting to, but towards the close of the sitting last night I saw very well where it was drifting.  I saw or, at least, I think I saw, what prompts these guillotine motions.  I remember the stand taken yesterday, particularly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have also noted his stand to-day, and he has shifted his ground to-day.  Yesterday, he said that the Opposition, in private negotiations, informed his side of the House that three hours would suffice to get through with the Bill. Now he says they are not satisfied to get six hours.  &ldquo;Is it not rank hypocrisy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to say that we want to closure discussion?&rdquo; Well, I am sure that it was not by an accident that the silent strong man who sat there last week and would not give any information&mdash;if he was capable of giving any, which I do not know&mdash;took up so much time yesterday.  Of the six hours allocated for the discussion of that short Bill yesterday, there was left one effective hour for discussion. Deputy Brennan opened the discussion and occupied ten minutes.  The Minister for Finance followed and took up 40 minutes out of the hour, leaving ten minutes for the following speakers. So that, in fact, the six hours boiled down to 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is never short of an excuse, but who somehow gives it in such a rollicking kind of a way that one does not blame him too much&mdash;he will always manage to get out of a corner &mdash;did not take up that stand to-day. He said, with an air of sincerity and conviction, that this motion was put up to save the democratic institutions of this House and of this country.  He was followed by the Minister for Education, who talked of the tasks that are before democratic States <Col N="189" /> to-day.  They are not political, he said; they are economic, and we want to be engaged in solving those economic questions.  Well, the recognised key to economic solutions the world over in all times, and the recognised key to freedom, is finance.  If finance is not run properly there must inevitably be economic chaos.  If finance is not under the control of the people there must inevitably be dictation and slavery.  Freedom is lost the moment the people lose their grip on the finances of the country.  The last Government was severely criticised for its managerial system in local authorities, particularly in the local authority in the City of Dublin, on which I listened to a condemnation by Deputy Kelly for two solid hours one night in the City Hall; yet that piece of modern tyranny imposed on local authorities by the previous Government left this handle to freedom, that whatever else the City Manager has powers to do, we, the corporators, have power to strike the rate, and if we do not give him the money we shut him up.  And there is no closure when the rate is being struck.  Deputy Kelly is the councillor who is then articulate and eloquent about what the people have to bear, of what the poor are suffering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You are silent for two or three months, except now and again when you interrupt me.  I hope you will not be silent to-day.  Let us consider what are the consequences of the Bill that is to pass this House to-day under the guillotine.  Let us consider what the two previous Ministers have stated.  Let us consider, and weigh carefully, the incompetence of the Ministry of Finance to meet and solve the economic situation which has grown up in this country&mdash;the incompetence of the Ministry of Finance to vindicate the right of this country to freedom.  Take any paper to-day and look at the market reports.  Deputy Cosgrave, the leader of the Opposition, pointed out how taxation has gone up in the last three or four years. It is a pity he did not deal a little with <Col N="190" /> the other side of the picture, and show how the national income has gone down just as taxation has gone up. Let us take one item, and one item will be a speech on the lot.  The price of Irish butter in Liverpool to-day, according to the quotations in to-day's papers, is 85/- per cwt.; the price of New Zealand butter is 90/- per cwt., and the price of Australian butter is 87/- per cwt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can resolve it into the price per lb.  We have not time to wait for the Deputy.  The price of Swedish butter is 90/- per cwt.; for Finnish butter, 96/-, and for the Dutch butter the price is 84/-. But that is not the whole story.  The actual value of the money to the Dane at 100/- is 125/- per cwt., when he takes his money back to Denmark, under the exchange advantage to the Dane.  The value of New Zealand butter when the money is taken back to New Zealand is 112/- per cwt.  The Australian 87/- per cwt. is worth in Australian currency 108/9 per cwt. The 96/- for Finland butter is worth in Finnish currency, when taken back to Finland, 112/- per cwt.  Let us see what the 85/- which the Irishman gets for his butter is worth.  If there is anything of importance in considering the Budget and the capacity of the people to pay the demands of that Budget, that capacity can be measured only by the national income, and the national income in this country is mainly agricultural.  In fact, it is entirely agricultural, because agriculture has to carry all the parasites on its back.  That 85/- per cwt. has to be cut down in this way: 40 per cent. is taken by the British in the economic <Col N="191" /> war that we have won, which means that 34/- comes off that 85/-, leaving a net figure of 51/- that the Irishman gets for his cwt. of butter and brings back here.</P>
      <P>Last evening, the Minister for Finance contradicted Deputy Mulcahy when he said we were being taxed to give England cheap butter.  For fear he would be contradicted he monopolised all the time which the guillotine had left the House to debate the matter.  Now, if he has the pluck to get up later, I challenge him to deny that what we get for our cwt. of butter, between Ireland and England as two trading units, is a net figure of 51/-.  But the exporter would have to stop business at that price; he could not carry on.  And what is done?  The taxpayer has to come to the rescue of the exporter and give the exporter a subsidy of 51/- out of taxation.  In other words, the taxpayer has to pay up to 50 per cent. of the cost of sending the butter to England.  That is the position here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week when we were discussing the Finance Bill in Committee we could not drag from the Minister a solitary word of explanation of the various taxes that were imposed.  Yet he had the hardihood, the cheek and the impertinence to repeat here yesterday what he had said in his Budget speech&mdash;that the tax on the fixed quantity of wheat which we have to import into this country to give us our daily bread &mdash;on which he has put a tax of 6d. per cwt.&mdash;is going to be a benefit to the farmer.  If the Minister understands his own Budget and if he understands the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill for which he voted and for which I voted last week, he will know that percentage is fixed to come in, and that percentage is measured by the amount of wheat short of our requirements that we produce.  We must get that percentage, and that percentage is based on the amount of wheat grown here during a cereal year.  The taxes on what we have to import help agriculture in no way in the world.  On the contrary, these <Col N="192" /> taxes on our daily bread are an additional outlay on agriculture and an additional burden on the people.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister made the welkin ring with his wild and foolish statements.  He claimed to have the mantle of Griffith and Collins on his shoulders; he claimed to be carrying out their policy.  He taunted me with having voted against everything in the Budget that helped that policy and that helped to develop Irish industry. I challenged him then and I challenge him now to say where I voted against any measure which had helped that policy or helped Irish industry. His colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, talked in in a similar manner.  The country is economically depressed, yet the people have still to listen to the clap-trap of the Minister for Finance claiming that his is a Republican Government. That Government has not reached in the discharge of its national duty the stage that every Government in the British Dominions has reached. The Minister for Finance is the Minister who is to look after our financial position.  He is the Minister who must take cognisance of economic tendencies, and has to regulate the finances of the country.  What is the first step that must be taken by the Minister for Finance in any nation?  He must first get machinery to correct any economic tendencies. We have been treated for a good while to shouting and cheering about nothing but nonsense.  We are being told that we have a Republican Government because we abolished a form of words.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to shout because the British Privy Council no longer can hear Irish appeals.  Another victory for the Republic.  But has the Minister looked to what must first be done in discharge of his duty to the citizens of this State?  Has he discharged that duty in the same way as the Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have done?  In other words, has his Government looked after the credit and banking position of the people and have they set up a local authority? <Col N="193" /> If they have not set up a local authority like the Dominions to look after and control banking and currency and the credit of their respective countries, then the Government have failed in their duty to the citizens.  When economic depression came to England who was consulted? The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England.  When economic depression came to the U.S.A. whom did President Roosevelt gather around him but the bankers, those in control of the Federal Reserve System? What happened in England? In 1931 England could not sell her goods because the value of her currency was too high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill is proposing certain taxation.  It proposes to get £29,000,000 by taxation, I have given instances of the economic situation that has arisen, and I take that to govern the lot.  I do not want to go over the whole gamut on the paper.  What militates chiefly against the price of our butter in the export market is the fact of our currency being on a parity with the £ sterling and controlled by the Bank of England. We have to sell on a parity with the British £.  Our competitors the Danes, the Finns, the Australians and the New Zealanders can sell their butter and get British pounds and British shillings for it.  Their currency <Col N="194" /> is depleted as compared with sterling, and when they bring the British currency back to their own country they have, generally speaking, an advantage of 25 per cent.  That is as if the British Government gave them 25 per cent. of an advantage over us. The Minister for Finance, whose job it is to set up in this country the same machinery as those other Dominions have, has not done his job.  If we have any pretentions to be a nation, much less a Republic for the 32 counties, much less a special brand of republic, he should have machinery at his command, at least as good as the Dominious have to protect their citizens and their nationals and the trade of their agriculturists.  The Minister has not done that.  I am criticising him and his Department for not having done so. I am also pointing out the impossibility of carrying on our industries in such circumstances when we have to compete at a loss.  We are at such disadvantage with our competitors in the British market, and that such disadvantage is entirely due to the incompetency and, what I might term, the unnationalism of the Minister and the Government of which he is a member. It is nauseating to listen to members of the Government and the Government Party saying: &ldquo;We are for Ireland and everybody else is for England!&rdquo; No, the Minister and the Government are for England. In this matter he is placing the control of our daily lives and everything we produce in the hands of the British Government through the Bank of England.  The Minister for Finance hypocritically called himself a Republican here yesterday; worse still, he claimed that the mantle of Arthur Griffith had fallen on his shoulders.  If Arthur Griffith were listening to him his bones would turn in his grave at the insult. Here is all that he can do, although he claims to be a republican and nationalist.  The best he can do is to appoint a Commission to examine and report on the system in Saorstát Eireann of currency, banking, credit, public borrowing and lending&mdash;including borrowing by the Corporation, which they cannot do&mdash;and the pledging <Col N="195" /> of State credit on behalf of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the Banking Commission as such.  But the Minister, instead of acting up to the standard of nationhood here, and fixing up national machinery to control our currency, credit, and banking, has abrogated that duty and delegated it to a Commission.  That shows that he has not a proper sense of his responsibility&mdash;that this country which bled so much for freedom does not want it now.  Instead of that, in appointing a Commission of experts he should have said: &ldquo;We are a nation now; we want to travel forward, not backward; we want you, as a Commission of experts, to take evidence and report to us, not as to whether we shall have a national currency and banking system, because that is decided, since we are a nation, but as to what is the best national currency and banking system.&rdquo;  That is what one would expect from an Irish nationalist occupying the position of Minister for Finance.  It is not the business of the Minister to appoint a Commission and tell them to report to him whether he shall be free financially or not.  Imagine the Provisional Government in 1922, when it appointed a body to frame a Constitution, saying to that body: &ldquo;We want you to decide and report whether we shall have an Irish Parliament in Dublin in full political control.&rdquo;  What would happen? What would the Minister for Finance have said then, or what would he say now?  What would anybody say?  But the Minister for Finance has, in a matter of far greater importance to this country than a Parliament, appointed a body and left it in their hands to decide and report to him whether we shall be financially free or not.  If that body says: &ldquo;The present system is all right; just touch it up here and there,&rdquo; the seat of power over this country will remain, not in this House, but in the Bank of England, and the Minister will be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> Small petty excuses were given here to-day, some of which impugned the conduct of the Ceann Comhairle in the Chair when it was stated by two Ministers that there was constant repetition. I think you, Sir, keep an eye on repetition. In fact, I have one vivid recollection of an occasion when you did, and when somebody paid the penalty. I certainly did not hear any repetition last week.  If this Bill was discussed in a friendly way, which it could have been, and if when difficulties arose and people over here wanted information and points elucidated, the Minister helped them, he would, even if they wanted to be obstructive, which I did not see any sign of, disarm them by elucidating the points.  But, instead of that, he would not speak.  The Minister for Finance should remember that he has a bigger job to do than merely collect taxes; that it is one thing to impose taxation and another to collect it.  I hope he does not think there is any threat hidden in that.  But the taxation should be of such dimensions as will not lean too heavily on individuals or on the business of the country. He cannot demonstrate to this House that since he took up office the national income has improved.  It is quite the contrary.  On the other hand, national expenditure has gone up.  He should try to equate the burden of taxation to the capacity to pay.  If he does not and it is lopsided, with the weight pressing most heavily on the people who are not able to bear the load, there can be but one inevitable end.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan to-day referred to the statement of the Minister last night in which he tried to impute wrong motives to everybody who does not agree with him.  He and the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce here to-day also, accused us of being opposed to the development of Irish industry because we voted, not against the principle, but against the size of a tariff proposed by the Minister and embodied in this Bill.  A 50 per cent. tariff was proposed on a certain article or articles as to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House that the Irish industry <Col N="197" /> was developing with a 25 per cent. tariff and that the imports were practically nil.  We asked the Minister for Finance to justify the increase in the tariff.  I said I would vote for any tariff they wanted to put on if the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce would say that the present tariff was not sufficient to develop the industry which he wanted to develop.  But the Minister for Finance would not speak.  Then he had the audacity to get up yesterday and misrepresent my attitude.</P>
    <P>Let me take one of the tariffs proposed in this Bill, that on footballs. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tried to make an excuse about the time that was taken up in referring to the making of footballs.  All I said about footballs was that if they were hand made one country had no advantage over another in making football covers, except that one country might be more technically efficient than another, or might work harder.  That was the only difference; machinery did not come into it.  In support of that and notwithstanding that 25 per cent. increase in the tariff which is going to be carried through under the guillotine to-day, I might refer the Minister to a letter which I saw in the daily Press, including &ldquo;truth in the news,&rdquo; on, I think, Monday of this week.  A football cover-maker in Dublin who read the issue as being a tariff to help industry here or no tariff&mdash;the issue was not a tariff or no tariff but a tariff of a certain height against a tariff of a greater height&mdash;wrote to say that as far as his business is concerned, there will be no increase in the price.  He carries on business in King Street or Andrew Street.  Taking his standard, what is the need for a tariff?  Yet we want a guillotine motion to pass through an extra tariff of 25 per cent. &mdash;not a tariff, but an extra tariff. There we have over the name of a maker of football covers a statement that he wants no tariff, that no matter what tariff is imposed his price will not go up.  He must be satisfied with his present price.</P>

      <P>I am making the point that the Minister for Finance tries to misrepresent the attitude of Deputies like myself who have voted a certain way, as being opposed to the development of Irish industry.  I resent that very much.  I would not resent it if I were a Free Trader but I am not a Free Trader.  I stood for Protection before the Minister for Finance understood what it was.  I still stand for it and I am not afraid of any vote I have given here so long as it is represented correctly.  It should be beneath the dignity of the Minister for Finance to misrepresent the attitude of any Deputy in this House.  Surely he has enough points of difference to accept a challenge on, without looking for a point by misrepresentation.  There are a lot of other matters in this Bill but I feel that I have occupied sufficient of the short time available and I do not want to take up the time of the House any further.</P>

      <P>I know that if there is something which they themselves would have a certain delicacy in doing, the unpalatable task is entrusted to the Deputy.  The Deputy habitually follows Deputy Cosgrave into the Opposition Lobby.  Deputy Cosgrave has told us that the financial business is the most important business of the Dáil.  Deputy McGilligan said that the whole substance of legislative freedom resided in the control over public finances. Speaking yesterday on a similar motion he said: &ldquo;So we have in regard to this question of public finance, the elaborate procedure of financial resolutions, the general debate immediately and a detailed expression of opinion on the details of the Financial Resolutions, the Report Stage of the Financial Resolutions, and the bringing of these Resolutions into a Finance Bill which goes through the ordinary stages of Second Stage, where the principle is discussed, and the Committee Stage, where every detail is exposed, dissected, criticised and so on.&rdquo;  But he forgot to add that in this State, owing to requirements of the Constitution and the law, all this has to be done under a time table.  It is intricate and delicate machinery.  It is machinery which should not be abused.  It is machinery which should not be <Col N="200" /> violated.  It is machinery, every element of which every Deputy in this House should be concerned to see preserved, and which should not, again in the words of Deputy McGilligan, &ldquo;be broken like a vase in the hands of a fool.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact that so much care is taken to see that every aspect of taxation will be fully considered in this House also implies that no time should be wasted in useless or needless discussion by any Deputy, that no one should employ useless and senseless verbiage merely to waste Parliamentary time or to secure some Party advantage.  If this machinery for the discussion of financial business is to be preserved, an essential requirement is that it should not be abused.  Yet, Sir, as I have said, the speech to which we have just listened from the Deputy for the past hour is typical of the speeches which he delivered on practically every item which went to make up that Finance Bill.  We had the same rambling disquisitions on a subject of which the Deputy knows very little&mdash; the subject of currency and banking.</P>

      <P>I was explaining the delicate instrument which democracy has devised for the control of public finance and for the regulation of taxation.  We have often been accused of not having sufficient regard for the requirements of the Constitution, but, so long as it remains there, the Seanad is a vital part of the Oireachtas.  It has, in the matter of Finance Bills, rights which are reserved to it by the Constitution.  Never since the State was established has the Seanad been given less than the full constitutional requirement of 21 days to consider the principal Finance Bill of the year. That, Sir, explains the urgency of the Bill and is a complete, justification, if we had not any other, for the motion which the House is now asked to consider. Deputy O'Sullivan stated that time should be spent on the consideration <Col N="202" /> of the Budget.  With that I agree. When we were in Opposition we con tended for that principle.  We discussed the Finance Bills of our predecessors with care, with acuteness, with intelligence, and, in the words of the late President of the Executive Council, the present leader of the Opposition, we did much business in a shorter time, with a more pithy discussion.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill of 1928, seven hours and 40 minutes were taken by the Opposition; in 1929, 15 hours and five minutes were taken; in 1930, ten hours and 25 minutes were taken; in 1931, nine hours and 45 minutes.  That criticism was so effective that it recommended itself to the good sense of the people, as was witnessed by the fact that the then Government which was being criticised is now in Opposition and the Opposition which was then criticising the finance proposals of the then Government is now the Government. The fact that we were able to do that and at the same time, with every care for the preservation of democratic principles, did not waste a moment of Parliamentary time is, we think, a justifiable reason for resenting the spectacle which we have witnessed here, not merely on the Finance Bill of 1935, but, as the country saw, on the Finance Bill of 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said yesterday, when the change of Government did take place the time which was spent on these <Col N="203" /> measures jumped up to 34 hours and 10 minutes on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill of 1932.  Then there was the General Election, and the Opposition, a little chastened, wasted much less time in discussing the Finance Bill of 1933, because they spent only 19 hours and 10 minutes.  Then again, in 1934, after the results of the local elections of that year, they occupied only 16½ hours.  This year, on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of this Bill, they have taken 41 hours and 45. minutes, much longer, in fact, than they occupied in the year 1932.</P>
    <P>Now with the particulars which I have given of the time taken on other Bills in other years before them.  I think there is no person in the Opposition who would be prepared to contend and, even if he does contend, can substantiate the statement, that insufficient time has been given to the Opposition to consider the details of this measure.  Let us see how that time has been spent.  The debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill began at 6 p.m. on 2nd July.  Before the House adjourned at 10.30 that evening no less than 18 sections of this Finance Bill had been disposed of, and in regard to every one of those sections upon which there was a pertinent discussion and in connection with which the Opposition made any worth-while point, I participated in the debate and justified the proposals of the Government to the satisfaction of this House. Then on Section 18 a change took place.  The Opposition had an amendment down to that section.  The amendment stood in the name of Deputy Dillon and it read as follows: &ldquo;To insert after the word &lsquo;tea&rsquo; the following words: &lsquo;the invoiced price of which at the port of importation does not exceed one shilling and sixpence per lb.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;After the word &lsquo;tea&rsquo; to insert the following words: &lsquo;the invoiced price of which at the port of importation does not exceed one shilling and sixpence per pound&rsquo;.&rdquo; The name to the amendment is that of Deputy James M. Dillon, and the amendment was to be made in line 38 of sub-section (1).  Now, Sir, the Opposition have said that they have not had time to consider this Bill: that they have not had time to criticise intelligently the proposals contained in the Bill.  The resolution which Deputy Dillon sought to amend in this way was adopted by the House early in May. The Finance Bill embodies the terms of the Resolutions which, of course, were also printed and circulated to the House and, therefore, could be studied by all Deputies, including those who have taken upon themselves the responsibility of opposing the proposals of the Government in regard to this and other matters.  That Bill was introduced in May and could have been studied by all Deputies at their convenience.  The Second Reading of the Bill was taken on the 12th, 13th, 14th and 18th June, and the Deputies opposite, therefore, had ample time to weigh well their words and to express exactly their intentions. This Opposition, however, which professes to participate intelligently in the business of this House and purports to be the watch-dogs of the people in regard to matters of taxation, had to make this admission through the mouth of Deputy Morrissey:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Fagan I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 3 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the foregoing sub-section and of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1934, any house or buildings used or occupied by a person for the purpose of farming or working lands shall be deemed to be a farmhouse or a farm building.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister understands the purpose of the amendment.  There are certain assessments being made on buildings which are attached to farms in the country and they are not assessed as if they were part of the farm.  They are assessed separately, and accordingly more income tax is being got out of them than if regarded as farmhouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting that amendment.  It is much too wide. In that connection I should like to make the following statement: I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in their opinion a house which is being used as a farmhouse and which is occupied with lands for the purpose of farming such lands by a person who makes his living by farming may reasonably be regarded as a farmhouse for the purposes of this section and of Section 2 of the Finance Act of 1934, even though the house was not originally constructed for use as a farmhouse.  Instructions will be issued to inspectors of taxes throughout the country accordingly.</P>
      <P>I think that will cover most of the case which Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan and Deputy Fagan were interested in when this matter was being discussed on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister see his way to put that into the Finance Bill so that it would not be left to the discrimination or discretion of the Revenue officers throughout the country?  Each case will have to be decided on its own merits.  In other words, each particular inspector in charge of an area will use his own discretion and accordingly the position will vary all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister have the courage of putting it down on paper so that there will be no ambiguity as to the position?  We will assume that there is a case in which a man has, say, £2,000 invested, from which he gets an income of £100 a year.  That income has been diminishing in the last two or three years.  Will there be any advertence to the fact that a reducing income from other sources, will leave this man in exactly the same position of being solely dependent on the farm?  Will it be taken into account? I instanced the case of a man having £3,000 a few years ago invested, but who now has £2,000, which is bringing him in £100 a year.  That is not sufficient to maintain the man, but it is necessary for him in order to balance his accounts.  In a case of that sort what would the figure be which the <Col N="209" /> Revenue Commissioners will consider is a sum of money which debars that man from being regarded as solely dependent upon the profits of his farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I think in that case we will have to leave it until we see the figures for each separate case.  The important condition in the statement I have made is that the person must make his living from the farm.  That does not mean that he must be devoid of any other income but that his principle means of livelihood must be the farm.  Then we will assume that his residence is the farm house for the purpose of the Act. At least, the Revenue Commissioners have formed an opinion that in that case his residence could be regarded as a farm house for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but still my point arises.  He may have some other source of income.  Does that debar him from being regarded as being entirely dependent on his farm?  From his farm he gets say from £300 to £400 a year and this income from his investments is a small proportion of his income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy assumes that the phrase I have used &mdash;that the person must make his living by the farm&mdash;implies that he must be entirely dependent on the farm.  If it is clear that he makes his living from the farm then his residence will be treated as a farm house.  In the case to which the Deputy has referred even though the man derives some income from an investment and from property it seems clear that the income he is making from his farm is his principal source of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a farmer who is a rate collector in the country.  The decision in each of those cases will be left to the discrimination or discretion of the inspector.  The same would apply in the case of a small shopkeeper who is making some of his living from a farm.  The Revenue Commissioners or the inspectors will come along and decide what the position will be.  What will <Col N="210" /> be the position of the farmer who has a shop or some other means of living in these cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to go into details based upon hypotheses. These simple questions of fact will be determined by the inspectors of taxes from whom there is an appeal to the Special Commissioners.  These will find what the facts are.  I am not attempting here any definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; beyond what I said.  If it is quite clear that the person though he has a farm does not make his living by the farm, then his house if it is a mansion, if it is a house that is not obviously and patently used as the habitation of the farm, will not come within the terms of the statement I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the point I raised&mdash;that the concession he is prepared to give will be made part of the Statute Law.  The Minister has just stated that if the inspector refuses to give relief there is an appeal to the Special Commissioners. Presumably, there is also an appeal to the Circuit judge.  Whatever the Commissioners may do the Circuit judge will only act on the strict letter of the law.  He will not be able to exercise any discretion.  My suggestion is that whatever the Minister wishes to give should be put into words and made part of the statute law of the country.  Otherwise, there will be no security for the individual taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4 to add at the end of Section 3 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo; (8)  This section shall not apply to or have effect in the County Borough of Waterford, and accordingly tax under Schedule A of the Income Tax Act, 1918, shall be <Col N="211" /> assessed and charged on tenements and rateable hereditaments situate in the County Borough of Waterford as if this section had not been enacted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet a case of the Borough of Waterford in connection with which undoubtedly special circumstances exist.  The City of Waterford was revalued after the passage of the Treaty and the establishment of the Free State.  The new valuation came into force in March, 1926.  That new valuation had the effect of increasing the valuation of the city from £51,000 odd to £76,000 odd, or an increase of about 49 per cent. From these figures and an examination of specimen cases Schedule A assessments in the County Borough of Waterford will work out relatively at least as high as the 25 per cent. increase that has been put on in other parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert after the word &ldquo;Waterford&rdquo; where it first occurs the words &ldquo;nor in the case of tenements and rateable hereditaments constructed or reconstructed after the 6th December, 1922, in respect, of which new valuations have therefore been made since that date,&rdquo; and to insert after the word &ldquo;Waterford&rdquo; where it secondly occurs the words &ldquo;and in the case of tenements and rateable hereditaments constructed or reconstructed after the 6th December, 1922, and in respect of which new valuations have therefore been made since that date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to the Minister's amendment with regard to Waterford.  It is quite true that Waterford was revalued and that the new valuation was an increase of nearly 50 per cent. on the old valuation. When Waterford was revalued it was not revalued on any new principle. It was revalued as a whole and the old principle was applied.  That old principle dealt with modern circumstances. What that change means can easily be seen if one takes the valuation of Waterford and compares <Col N="212" /> it with the valuation of Limerick. My amendment would mean that as well as extending this relief to Waterford where the whole property in the city was revalued, the relief would also be extended in the case of tenements constructed after the 6th December, 1922, in respect of which new valuations have probably been made after that date.</P>
    <P>Let us see how the City of Dublin is affected by revaluations carried out since 1922.  When revaluations were carried out in the City of Dublin after 1922, the same thing happened as happened in Waterford, except that in the City of Dublin it applied to a certain number of individual people, but in Waterford it applied to property owners as a whole.  If we take the old City of Dublin before the 1930 extension, we find that the valuation in February, 1922, was £1,170,000, and that the valuation of the same area in February, 1935, was £1,580,000.  So that in that area, as a result of certain rebuilding&mdash;because inside the city the extension of new buildings was not very great&mdash;the valuation of the city was actually increased by 29 per cent., something over half, I think, of the increase in Waterford.  As regards particular property in the city, we find that the valuation of a certain property in O'Connell Street before it was destroyed in 1922 was £6,501, and that the valuation of the property when rebuilt was £14,283, so that the valuation had gone up by 120 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister proposes to put on top of that revalued property in O'Connell Street, and in other parts of the city where revaluation has taken place, an increase which he thinks it would be unjust to property owners in Waterford to put on them. I therefore think it is only reasonable that the amendment should be accepted; that relief that is proper, and that no one will deny is just in the case of property owners in Waterford, is equally just and necessary to be given in the case of persons who own property in the rebuilt areas in O'Connell Street and many other places in the City of Dublin where revaluations <Col N="213" /> have been carried out since 1922.  I think that Deputy Cosgrave, with his more intimate knowledge of the city, can say that that also applies to Cork, as it also refers to many other parts of the country.  I think that justice should be extended to individuals in various parts of the country who are in the same position as the property owners in Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Mulcahy has explained with regard to Dublin also applies to Cork, Balbriggan, and other places where property was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt. It must be remembered that, not alone was the valuation in these cases increased, but that, in so far as building costs enter into the question of valuation, and I rather think they do, the cost of building at that time was much higher than it is now.  As far as these premises are concerned, no subsequent revaluation would increase the valuation.  It is quite likely, on the contrary, that it may be reduced.  In one case in Cork the valuation was actually increased from £75 to £300. You can see at once, therefore, how much hardship was involved on a firm having premises of that sort, which had been entitled to a deduction of one-sixth two years ago and had been assessable on £250, who now find themselves having to pay on an assessment of £375.</P>
      <P>There are not many cases involved. In the case of Dublin, my recollection is that after 1916, although reconstruction did not take place for many years, the increase in the valuation of premises in O'Connell Street was in the neighbourhood of £32,000.  If the new buildings were more adapted to and did more business, no question would arise; but it is very unlikely in the case of Dublin, Cork, Balbriggan, or any place where property was destroyed, that there has been such an increase in business.  For over ten years, apart from certain concessions in respect of local taxation that were given to them, they have borne the full assessment of income tax on the higher valuation.  They certainly have got as strong a case as Waterford has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Waterford, I should <Col N="214" /> say that they have this advantage: that the city has not been so extensively reconstructed during the last few years as in the other cases.  The premises in question were rebuilt at a time when building costs were high and the owners who have had to bear the income tax assessment over those years, are now put in the position that within the short space of two years they are to be liable for an assessment 50 per cent. in excess of the highest valuation that could be put on the premises.  That does not appear on the face of it to be equitable.</P>

      <P>There are features in this amendment which I dislike, but I dislike them less intensely than I do the provisions of the Finance Bill. Taking a choice between them, with all my objections to it, I prefer Deputy Mulcahy's amendment to the section in the Bill.  I think the whole principle of this section is bad and unsound.  It is retrospective legislation in its most vicious form.  Not only is it retrospective legislation, but in existing circumstances it is a particularly objectionable type of retrospective legislation. On the Second Reading of the Bill I expressed the view that it was unfair that working-class dwellings built, let us say, since the war period should, for income tax purposes, have their valuation raised by 25 per cent.  An effort was made by the Minister to show that the increase in valuations in these cases did not mean an increase in income tax.  If that is so, why does the Minister object to inserting a provision to exclude dwelling-houses of that kind?  The Minister persists in getting a blanket charge to increase the valuation of houses for income tax purposes by 25 per cent.  While I am not, in existing circumstances, opposed to certain persons, fairly well-endowed with this world's goods, making a contribution for budgetary purposes, I am strongly opposed to any kind of blanketing code such as is enshrined in the section, which enables the Minister to exact this tribute from persons who come into the category of ordinary working-class folk.  For that reason, although I have objections to it on <Col N="215" /> another score, I prefer Deputy Mulcahy's amendment to the proposal of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, as everybody knows, true to say that within the last 20 years house-building costs have been high.  Houses have been erected in an atmosphere of high building costs and the erection of those houses has consequently meant an expenditure of a sum of money which, perhaps, would not be spent to-day in the erection of a similar class of dwelling.  Many of those houses have been bought by working-class people on the hire purchase system.  They have not merely to pay high outgoings in the form of annuities to extinguish the loans which they have received, but now under this section a considerable number of these people may be caught in such a way as to compel them to pay an additional sum for income tax purposes, arrived at by deeming the house to be value for five-fourths of its valuation.  If the Minister is so satisfied that working-class people will not come within the scope of the section, then I cannot see any reasonable objection to excluding houses of that kind.  I think the effect of the section would be bad from the house-building point of view and that in existing circumstances it would not be desirable that we should create another impediment in the way of house-building activities.  The Minister now wants to claim that for income tax purposes he is entitled to take the valuation as five-fourths of the present figure.  If the Minister is entitled to take the valuation of dwellinghouses for income tax purposes at five-fourths of the present figure, how can he resist a claim by the local authorities that the same method of calculation should be applied in respect of rates?  If the income tax authorities are entitled to base their assessments on five-fourths of the valuation, and if any case can be made for that viewpoint, I think a still stronger case can be made for asking the owner or the occupier of the house to pay rates on the basis of five-fourths of the existing valuation.  The whole principle seems to me to be vicious.  It presupposes an increase of <Col N="216" /> 25 per cent. in the valuation of all houses.</P>
    <P>There is apparently to be no appeal against a minimum increase of 25 per cent., because in the meantime the Minister will have collected his money. I am sure the necessary legislation will be drafted in such a way that there will be minimum increases of 25 per cent. in order to protect the Minister against the liability to make refunds.  If we are going to increase the valuation of dwellinghouses, surely we ought to do it only after detailed inquiry?  Surely we ought to examine the merits of the claims of particular towns and cities for exemption, and their plea as to why they should not be treated in the same way as other towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Under a simple section such as this without any detailed or expert inquiry, we are now proceeding to revalue every piece of property in the land for income tax purposes, not in the interests of tenants, but with a view to squeezing from the tenants more money in income tax.  I think this is a revolutionary proposal, and it is a dangerous kind of revolutionary proposal.  Revolutionary proposals in themselves are not bad, but this is a reactionary revolutionary proposal because it embodies retrospective legislation and it will create, I believe, obstacles to house building.  At the same time, in a period of acute depression we are going to increase valuations for income tax purposes by 25 per cent.  I think the whole proceeding is an outrageous proceeding. I think it cannot be justified unless you take the view that when you want money you are entitled to strike anywhere, and grab at anything within your reach.  That may be good reasoning for the purposes of balancing a Budget, but it is not good reasoning in any other sense.  Although I dislike some of the implications involved in Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, I think the amendment on the whole is preferable to the section in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> I hope very strongly that the Minister will accept the amendment of Deputy Mulcahy.  One of the great objections I made previously was that the Minister's proposal tended to increase manifest injustices and inequalities which are at present in existence owing to the very different kinds of valuations which are in force on different dwellings.  The Minister's proposal will make these inequalities more marked than ever.  To a certain extent, if he accepts the amendment of Deputy Mulcahy, these inequalities will be smoothed out.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment which will be a decided improvement on the original proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>It is impossible to accept the amendment for many reasons.  In the first place it would be practically impossible to administer it and, if it were adopted, it would be better to discard the section altogether. Secondly, it has no ground of equity to support it.  The amendment is to exempt buildings which have been reconstructed after the 6th December, 1922, in respect of which new valuations have been made, and tenements and rateable hereditaments, constructed or reconstructed after the 6th December, 1922, and in respect of which new valuations have therefore been made since that date. The case of Waterford is not at all analogous to what is proposed here, because in Waterford the whole city, including new and old property, was revalued.  The considerable increase in the valuation to my mind in the case of Waterford springs undoubtedly from the revaluation of old property.  I may say, Sir, that what convinced me that something should be done in this case of Waterford was the statement made that when appeals from the assessments of the Commissioner of Valuation were before the court, the court took the view that more regard should have been paid than heretofore was paid to the existing incomes, which could be derived from the letting of the property, and that, in fact, the Commissioner of Valuation seemed to have taken such incomes into consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, in the case of Waterford, a comparatively small town, the valuation had been increased, as I have said already, by 49 per cent. There is no other area in the Free State of which the same can be said.  A great deal of the case for this amendment has been based upon the valuations of buildings which have been built to replace property destroyed, and there has been, I think, some confusion in the minds of the Deputy who proposed the amendment and Deputy Cosgrave, who supported it, because they seem to regard the old property which was destroyed and the new property which rose like a phoenix from the ashes, as being one and the same property, one and the same building.  Of course, it is quite clear that this was not so.  You have only to look at O'Connell Street now, and cast your mind back on what it was like prior to 1916.  I know there is one building there, the first and second storey of which were occupied as a dwellinghouse by the manager. The dwelling accommodation has been replaced by three magnificent suites of offices, the income from which, I venture to say, is not less than £400 a year.  It is quite clear that a building which formerly might have provided living accommodation for the manager of an establishment was not at all comparable with the building that has replaced it, which has been constructed as a modern office building with all the amenities of offices, which give the fortunate owner an income of £400 a year from lettings alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is largely as the result of valuations of new buildings that this increase in the valuation of certain areas in Dublin has taken place.  In striking the valuations for every one of these new buildings, the Commissioner is bound by earlier decisions of the High Court and Supreme Court to have regard to the principle of relativity and even these new buildings have been considerably undervalued, having regard to the income which may be derived from them from year to year.  It is quite <Col N="219" /> clear that no case can be made on grounds of equity for the exemption of buildings of this type from the section in the Bill because their valuations have been artificially depressed by reason of the fact that, in general, the valuations of buildings in this State are not at all proportionate to the income which is derived from them.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Most of the buildings in O'Connell Street and elsewhere are business premises.  It does not make any difference to the occupiers of these premises whether this section in the Bill stands or not, so long as they do not happen at the same time to be owners who let part of them.  If they are merely owner occupiers, then for the purpose of assessment under Schedule D an increased allowance will be made for the income tax which they pay.  That income tax will be increased correspondingly under Schedule A, so that so far as the occupiers of business premises are concerned, provided they do not own the premises and do not make a profit from other sub-lettings, they will be in no different position to what they are now.</P>
    <P>On the question which Deputy Norton has raised, I think he also is under some misapprehension.  He has attacked the section because he feels that it proposes to squeeze from the tenants more money in income tax. The fact of the matter is that under the Schedule the tenants do not pay income tax; it is the landlord; the owner of the premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But where the tenant is the owner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up that point later.  The owner occupier is not obviously in the same position as a tenant.  We are now dealing with the statement that tenants are being squeezed for income tax.  I want to make it quite clear that so far as the proposal in the Bill is concerned, tenants are not going to find themselves in any worse position than they are in to-day.  It will be the landlord, the owner of the property, who will pay the income tax.  Deputy Norton, however, may have had in his mind <Col N="220" /> the case of a man who is purchasing his house, possibly through the Corporation or through a building society.  As I have already said, in these cases the amount of interest almost invariably exceeds the Schedule A assessment and will still, I believe, exceed the increased Schedule A assessment, so that no charge will fall on the tenant purchaser.  Let us take an example. There are, I understand, possibly 5,000 houses falling under the Corporation easy purchase scheme.  Only £50 is paid by the purchasers of these houses at the outset.  The amount of the interest on the balance of the purchase money is so large that as a practical measure no Schedule A tax is being collected on the property.  The Corporation account direct to the Revenue by reference to the tax on the interest, etc.  Take the case of a house on which the poor law valuation is £26, a house completed subsequent to 1923. A house of that sort would sell normally in Dublin for from £950 to £1,000, or possibly £1,050, subject, maybe, to a ground rent of £10.  Unless the purchaser is so well off that he can put down ready cash for a very large proportion of the purchase price, it is obvious the ground rent plus interest on a house of that description would exceed £32 10s., which would be the amount of the new Schedule A assessment, so that it is quite clear in a case of that sort, and I think it is an extreme case, the occupier will bear no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, take the case of a house of which the poor rate valuation is £20. A house of that sort would sell in Dublin at from £700 to £800, subject to a ground rent of about 1 per cent., say, £7.  Here, again, it is obvious that the charges for interest and ground rent almost invariably&mdash;in fact, in the great generality of cases&mdash;will exceed the Schedule A assessment, and of course we cannot legislate for the particular case.  Take, again, even the case of the small owner occupier who has been able to purchase his house outright.  The allowances, in normal circumstances, in such a case as that, are such that the man is, in fact, exempt from income tax.  Take, say, a man with £6 a week of earned <Col N="221" /> income, equivalent to £312 per annum, who has two or three children.  His allowance for earned income will be £52.  His marriage allowance will be £225.  His allowance for each child will be £50.  If, therefore, he has only two children, he cannot become liable to income tax until his income, other than income from his employment, amounts to £65.  If, of course, he has three children, he cannot be liable until his income, other than earned income, is about £115 per annum.  I think that on a consideration of these cases, it must be clear that the proportion of the members of the wage-earning classes who will be affected by the section in the Bill must be very insignificant&mdash;in fact, I should say that it would be negligible indeed.</P>
    <P>Now, I think we ought to have a glance at the other side of the picture. I think we ought to have a glance at the sort of case we are trying to catch: the case of a man who derives a substantial income from the ownership of property and who, hitherto, has been paying very much less than his just share of the national taxation. Take, say, a house with a poor rate valuation of £20.  That house is likely to let, in present circumstances in Dublin, at £80 per annum clear, or it may be a house of the same kind with a poor rate valuation of £26, which is likely to be let at £100 per annum&mdash;and I may say here that the Revenue Commissioners actually have particulars indicating that even higher rents than this are paid in some cases&mdash;let us assume that a landlord has 12 such houses valued for what would be an average figure at £24 each, all built since 1923.  At a moderate estimate, he will get £100 per year for each house, the owner paying the rates and, in many cases, owing to the provision as to relief from rates, the rates would be negligible.  If it be assumed, however, that the rates and repairs on each house cost him £25 a year, which is a very liberal estimate, his real income from each house will be £75 per year, and his total net income, taking one year with another, will be £900 per annum.  At present he is assessed for income tax purposes as though his income, instead <Col N="222" /> of being £900, were only £288; in other words, £612 of his income escape scot free from income tax. Now, the point is this: that if the amendment, in the form in which it is now before the House, is carried, it will make the proposal in the Bill impracticable.  We would have to drop it, if, of course, a greater cataclysm than that did not occur and we had to swop horses.  But if we had to drop these proposals, the effect would be that an individual, in the circumstances I have mentioned, enjoying a nett income from property of £900&mdash;an income he has enjoyed&mdash; would be taxed as if that income were only £288, and he would be free of income tax on the balance of his income, amounting to £612, at the expense of the rest of the community, including, of course, the workers for whom Deputy Norton speaks and with whom he is particularly concerned. Not alone that, but we would have to make good the cost to the Exchequer of the exemption which that man would continue to enjoy&mdash;the exemption that he has had up to the present &mdash;by imposing a heavier duty upon some other commodity.  I think, as I said before, there is no justification in equity for the proposal, and I hope the House will reject it.</P>

The Minister put forward very elaborate arguments but he left out of the question altogether the case I put before him of the owner occupier&mdash;not the man who is deriving a large income from investments in house property, but the owner occupier who had this one privilege that was withdrawn last year and who is to have this extra burden planted on him this year.

      <P>(3)  Section 106 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, shall, in its application to any article chargeable with the duty mentioned at reference number 15 in the Second Schedule to this Act, be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;or shall be found to be of less value for home use than the amount of the drawback claimed&rdquo; contained in the said section were omitted therefrom.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this amendment arises on a section of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, which contains a general provision that the drawback shall not be payable on any goods whose value for home use is less than the amount of the drawback claimed.  The application of this principle to the duty on printed paper is one of the matters to which the amendment relates.  It is well known that unsold papers are returned to the proprietors of the different newspapers and are ultimately exported as waste paper.  At the moment the prices which are obtainable abroad happen to be in excess of the duty paid on the raw material&mdash;that is on printed paper.  But circumstances might arise which would seriously depress the price at any rate on the home market for waste paper.  The home market is limited and a strict application of the principle might result in the refusal of the drawback. In these circumstances it is necessary to enact that this provision shall not apply to the duty.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, Section 18 (1), line 38, after the word &ldquo;tea&rdquo; to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the invoiced price of which at the port of importation exceeds one shilling and sixpence per pound.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not very much time, Sir, for this amendment, but I desire briefly to explain to the House that the object of the amendment is to secure that the duty which is proposed in the Finance Bill shall not apply to cheaper teas&mdash;shall not apply to tea costing up to 1/6 per lb.  The object is, of course, to see that the poorer sections of the community shall be exempt from this tax, which would be to them a very heavy impost.  In this connection in regard to the cheaper teas I might mention a matter of which the House may not be aware.  In the course of the last few years the cheaper teas have been increased in price by from 5d. to 7d. per lb.  That increase does not apply to the higher classes or the better quality teas.  So far as I understand it, that increase applied up to the 2/- a lb. tea.  It will be seen, therefore, that 4d. a lb. duty will mean an additional burden on the people who, because of their poor circumstances, are compelled <Col N="227" /> to purchase the poor quality tea.  I have already stated most of the reasons for this amendment.  I desire to get a decision on the matter, and as I want to hear the Minister on it I do not propose to say any more at the moment.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that more time was not available for a discussion of this amendment.  Almost 74 hours have been devoted to a criticism of the Budget proposals, and a large part of that time has been taken up with this question of the duty on tea. This tax has come in for a great deal of criticism.  Therefore, I say it is rather a pity that the Government, in defending the proposal, is under a greater disability in regard to time than the Deputy who proposed the amendment.  That is not the Government's fault.  When this amendment appeared originally on the Order Paper it was expressed in these terms: &ldquo;after the word &lsquo;tea&rsquo; to insert the following words.&rdquo;  Then instead of appearing in the form in which it appears here in this amendment, it read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 38, after the the word &lsquo;tea&rsquo; to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the invoiced price of which at the port of importation does not exceed one shilling and sixpence per pound.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that form the earlier amendment proposed to exempt altogether from duty, not the cheaper, as is proposed here, but the dearer teas.  I regret that the Opposition should have failed to express itself clearly, because I should like to have had a longer discussion on this section.  The first thing I would have to point out is this, that even if the financial position permitted us to accept the principle of the amendment, it would be impracticable to try to administer the concession upon the basis which is set out here. The exemption on the basis of import value would obviously be an incentive to fraud.  One of the difficulties of an <i>ad valorem</i> duty is that the importer can always understate the value of the commodity he is importing.  Therefore, this principle of exempting any article from taxation on the basis of <Col N="228" /> its import value is one which could not be adopted on practical grounds except for the most urgent reason.  For that reason, therefore, apart from any other, it is necessary to oppose this amendment.</P>
    <P>The actual amendment itself has raised another point.  It proposes to confine the increase in the rate of duty to tea the invoiced price of which at the port of importation exceeds 1/6 per lb.  Then, however, if this amendment were to be adopted the duty on the tea would only apply to about 30 per cent. of the tea imported; the other 70 per cent. would be free from the increase. The cost to the Exchequer in the current year would be over £200,000.  For that reason the amendment will have to be rejected.  Apart altogether from this question of the cost, it is clear that if the object of the amendment was to help the poor and not to benefit the other class, the amendment is, to say the least of it, very loosely drawn.  It has been drafted without any great consideration of the facts of the case; tea up to the price of 1/6 would probably be retailed here at 2/6 a lb. and more. That is possibly more than the poor of the country usually pay for tea.</P>
    <P>As I say, the Deputy who, in the course of his speech, was very much concerned to point out that there had been an increase in the price of the cheaper qualities of tea, nevertheless in his amendment roped in tea that could not possibly be described as cheap tea.  He was going one better. He was, in fact, getting back to the principle of Deputy Dillon's original amendment.  I understand the Deputy in this case is acting for Deputy Dillon, and the Deputy will remember that on the Committee Stage of the Bill he withdrew Deputy Dillon's amendment, on Deputy Dillon's behalf, and as the agent for Deputy Dillon, indicated that he proposed to replace it, again I take it as the agent of Deputy Dillon, by another amendment.  As I have said, in this amendment he is still not off with the first love.  His first intention was to exempt the more expensive teas.  Possibly he committed himself to somebody to try and get that accepted. <Col N="229" /> I do not know.  In any event, whatever commitments he had in regard to the original amendment, he has not been able to relieve himself entirely of them, and in this amendment he is tending to get back to the position in which some of the more expensive teas would be exempted.</P>

      <P>In pages 13 and 14, Section 21 (5), to delete paragraphs (b) and (c).</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5), which it is proposed to amend, exempts from Excise duty certain oils, including oils used for cleaning purposes.  If this exemption were not in the Bill, all the oils mentioned would still be free from duty. Not being intended for use for combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle, they would be entitled to a rebate.  The exemption provision was inserted before the Commissioners had any exact information as to the circumstances of the trade and consequently before any procedure in regard to the allowance of rebate could be determined. On examination of the position, however, it has been possible to institute an extremely simple procedure, involving practically no restric tion on the trade in oils entitled to rebate; so simple, indeed, that it is much better that it should apply to the oils entitled to exemption under paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-section (5), instead of any procedure which would operate under that sub-section.</P>

The Minister has now brought in an amendment to insert £4 instead of £3 in the relevant Act.  I am sorry the Minister has not seen his way to go to the extent of inserting £5 instead of £4.  The additional concession will not cost the Exchequer very much, and it would be removing an admitted injustice to the category of workers who come into the wage earning class.  Is it not possible for the Minister to accept an amendment now which would increase the exemption limit to £5?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that it is rather late now to appeal to the House to bethink themselves of what they are doing in passing this Budget. I wonder whether the members of the, for the moment, Government Party have given consideration to the disastrous effects this Budget is bound to have on the country&mdash;that it cannot avoid having.  That was pointed out on the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance and on the Second Reading, and this Bill has passed through this House now practically without amendment.  A few minor concessions have been given, but taking the burden of taxation as a whole, no concession has been got from the Government so far as the ordinary people of this country are concerned, and, as far as I know, no concession was asked for by the members of the Government Party in connection with the burden of taxation that the Government has chosen to put on everybody in this country.  Still, the Budget is so bad, the financial policy that it represents seems to me to be fraught with so much danger to the country that we do feel bound to make a last appeal to the House not to pass this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one thing that was not quite so evident, perhaps, at the start, but which became a little more evident as the various stages of this Bill progressed and that was the light-heartedness with which, at least, the Minister looked upon all this imposition of taxes.  One thing became evident, and I think it was quite evident, especially in the course of the past week, and that was that the one thing that never seems to have occurred to the minds of the various Ministers was the capacity of the <Col N="237" /> people to pay or the wisdom of putting these burdens on the people. They considered other things in connection with the imposition of many of these taxes, but it is quite obvious that that was a consideration that was altogether beyond their purview.  We object to the Budget as it stands.  We object to this Bill&mdash;to the Budget as it is in reality&mdash;in so far as it pretends to be a statement of national finances and of taxation.  It is nothing of the kind.  Under the system that has grown up&mdash;and this is quite relevant when we are asked to impose taxes on the people &mdash; and that has developed with alarming rapidity in the last couple of years, many of the more serious taxes no longer appear in this Bill.  To those we have directed attention already, and when people are asked to pay a tax on their sugar, on their tea, on their tobacco, and on practically everything they use or eat, it should be borne in mind that there are other things also on which these unfortunate people have to pay taxes that are not mentioned in the Budget; such things as butter, bacon, a large portion of the sugar tax, and above all on bread.  In addition to these, there is another sum collected which is incalculable&mdash;incalculable in the sense of being very difficult to calculate; in fact, it is practically impossible to calculate it.  I do not think that anybody could give even a guess as to the effect that the imposition of tariffs has had in increasing the prices of commodities manufactured in this country and consumed in this country. That should also be borne in mind when we are asked to impose these further new taxes or even to continue the old taxes on the people of this country.</P>
    <P>It is not, as I say, in this Bill alone that these burdens appear.  It is not in the Resolutions to which this Bill refers.  This is not the only instrument that imposes new taxes on the people. There are many other methods also by which new taxes are imposed on the people, and it is extremely bad finance and shows extreme callousness to the real burdens that the country has to bear, not to be conscious of <Col N="238" /> these things when we are imposing these new burdens or even keeping on the old ones.  If, therefore, anybody wants to get any kind of a real idea as to what the running of the country costs, he must go far beyond the present Bill or the present Budget statement to which the Bill has reference. He must go even beyond the Estimates. These things only deal with a portion&mdash;a gradually diminishing portion, if you like, owing to the rapid increase in the other methods of getting money out of the people&mdash;of the taxes from the people.  But even though the unacknowledged Budget is mounting up and up, it is still far from the enormous sum represented in this particular Budget.  There are other charges as well that the people have to bear.  What is the excuse for all this?  With what do those who support the Government try to salve their consciences or to win over their people?  The excuse they offer is the necessity for keeping up the social services. There were additional social services legislated for this year, such as the Widows' and Orphans' Fund. Let anybody ask himself what the worker has to pay in the way of additional taxation to meet that social service. He will then see how hollow the plea is.  It is not in the social services that a great deal of money is unnecessarily spent.  It is unnecessarily spent where it would be well for the country if it were not spent.  We object, and we have objected all along, to the immense sum that this House is asked to provide, because the expenditure which it is meant to meet is not justified.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I do not want to deal again with matters that have been already dealt with.  I do not want to stress the wrong point of view displayed at the present time by putting a tax on the necessities of life, whether it be bread or sugar, or butter or tea; but even in the matter we discussed last week, and to which I already made reference to-day and shall not now repeat, when we asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give us some justification for the extraordinary number of Schedules he or his <Col N="239" /> colleague has in this particular Bill, I think long as was the discussion and frequent as were the interventions of the Minister, there is one thing which was not made clear, and that is: who precisely benefited by many of those impositions.  In regard to the figures published by his own Department, we know that according to the Minister they mean nothing, or if they mean anything they mean the opposite to what they seem to mean, but it is quite clear that the wages fund of the State is not benefiting.  There may be people getting benefits from those tariffs; there is a view abroad that many people are making rather easy money as a result of the tariffs.  The attitude taken up by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce last week in increasing many of those tariffs from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. only makes it easier for those people to make easy money at the expense of the people. Undoubtedly, as Deputy Dowdall reiterated in his repudiation, the ordinary manufacturer will make the money, and why should he not?  That was the point.  Luckily, we had last week a case in which it was clear that the tariff had put up the price.  It was the one case in which we did not get the usual stereotyped reply from the Minister, that as a result of the tariffs everything would be cheaper; that if you put on a tariff of 20 per cent. the article would be cheaper than if you put on no tariff; if you doubled the tariff the article would be cheaper still, until possibly, if you put on 100 per cent. the people would almost get it for nothing.  He did not go quite as far as that, but that was the direction in which his rather absurd argument was tending on that particular occasion.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the House really approve of this Budget?  I know they voted for it.  They voted for its various stages, but, in contrast to previous Budgets, we waited in vain for any strong speeches in its defence. It is easy to speak on the Fifth Stage now.  A couple of general remarks to the effect that you approve of the Government policy and will stand by <Col N="240" /> it, are quite easy, but when there was an opportunity, during the Committee Stage, of defending the taxes which the Government proposes to impose there was no such alacrity in coming forward.  Now, on the Fifth Stage, I expect the intervention of a couple of the Deputies who are generally so vocal on financial matters, but who were so remarkably silent during the Committee Stage of this measure. Many of them have been muzzled; many of them may have assumed the muzzle.  I think they were not sorry to be told not to speak and not to defend those particular taxes.  As far as I remember, one Deputy, greatly daring, did stand up&mdash;Deputy Donnelly. Whether it was in defence of this or some similar tax, I cannot remember, but he did defend one of them.  If the Government's policy&mdash;its international policy or its so-called economic policy, which is merely effecting the ruin of the foundations of the economy of this country&mdash; requires the kind of taxation which has been put on the people this year, without any great strain or stress to justify it, then it speaks very badly for the policy.  It is in itself a condemnation of the policy of the Government. They speak of the social services, but they are largely financed now, it is quite clear, by taking the money out of the wages of the ordinary people of this country.  Any increased yield from taxation no longer comes, as was boasted on the first Budget, from the richer classes. They have been drained dry, according to the confession of the Minister for Finance and of the President. They have had extracted from them the last penny, and now all those services &mdash;necessary or unnecessary; the increase in the Guards, the financing of the unnecessary economic war, and so on&mdash;have to be borne out of the ordinary wages of the bulk of the people of this country.  Right through, as I said, there was no evidence of any kind that there was any thought given to the taxpayer and by the taxpayer I do not mean what used to be meant in the old days by ratepayers&mdash;people of property; I mean every individual citizen of this country, and practically every child in <Col N="241" /> this country, because in so far as they are consumers of many articles in the way of clothes, and so on, they indirectly contribute to the taxation. They bear all those indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing now is the increase not in the direct taxes but in the indirect taxes.  That is the outstanding feature of the progress of Fianna Fáil finance in the last three years.  They started off by trying to get money from the direct taxes, but gradually they have reverted to the indirect taxes, which bear on every man, woman and child in this country, and which everybody knows bear the heavier the poorer the person is.  That is inevitable.  It cannot be avoided. That is the characteristic of indirect taxation.  It is useless to pretend that a tax on bread bears as heavily on a man with £10,000 a year, if we have any such people in this country, as it does on a man with £10 a year. It does not.  There is no comparison. The same thing applies to several of the other taxes&mdash;the tax on tea, sugar, and so on.  One thing which was apparently left out of account in the framing of the Budget, and certainly in every speech made in defence of it, was the capacity of the people to bear those taxes.  Now, the Fianna Fáil Party cannot pretend that it is ignorant of the importance of that factor.  Nobody, I think, stressed it more fully than the members of that Party.  They are quite aware of the importance, when you are imposing new taxes, of taking into account what the people can bear.  They were very eloquent in pointing out, when the taxes were much less than they are at present, that the people could not bear them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce may shout that production is now much more than it was before. He will not convince the country of that because the country knows that the opposite is the case.  Let him get all he claims for his new industries; supposing they are not what they are; supposing they are much better than they are; supposing they are what he claims for them&mdash;that in no way compensates for the damage to the principal <Col N="242" /> industry of the country.  If you take the productive capacity of the country as a whole, undoubtedly the production of the country is much less now, and the value of it is much less now than it was, say, six or seven years ago, when the Fianna Fáil Party was so eloquent on the incapacity of the then Government and the impossibility of the country bearing the amount of taxes that were put on. Yet that same Party year after year increases the taxes and that at a time when the taxable capacity of the country is decreasing.  Well, it must be plain even to them that with the decline in trade, with the serious inroads that have been made on production, that a policy of that kind cannot help being disastrous; and that any shouting that they may indulge in and any pretending the opposite is simply&mdash;to use one of the oldest metaphors&mdash;whistling while passing the churchyard.</P>
    <P>One thing, at all events has become clear and that is that the country is reckoning the seriousness of the situation. It is not merely the case of a tax on tea, or a tax on sugar or that these taxes are unpopular.  It is not against these that the country is kicking. The tax on tea and sugar is rightly unpopular in the present circumstances particularly with the imposition in addition of the indirect taxes not mentioned in this Bill.  The addition of this tax is rightly unpopular but it is not the unpopularity of the tax alone that explains the tendency of the people to kick against it.  It is the growing conviction on the part of the people that there is only one place and that a particularly unenviable one to which the policy of the Government is leading.  Let the Fianna Fáil Party contrast the glee with which the first Budget of the present Minister for Finance was received by that Party and the remarkable and almost chilly silence in the way of defence of the details with which the Party receives the present Budget.  They know themselves that this policy is disastrous, and they ought to know that not merely may it be disastrous to them as a Party, but, what is much more <Col N="243" /> serious, that it is bound to be disastrous for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was somewhere about the beginning of last May that the Dáil started the discussion on the financial proposals for this year&mdash;the discussion that will terminate this evening.  In the first speech that was made on behalf of the Party opposite &mdash;the speech made by the leader of that Party&mdash;it was indicated that while the members desire to have all the social services and all the Governmental services provided for in the Estimates they do not want to pay for them. Apparently, Deputies opposite considered there was some method by which these services could be maintained without providing the money for them.  On the day on which this discussion commenced they were repeatedly appealed to by Deputies on this side of the House to reveal the secret of the method by which they thought that could be done.  They were asked to tell us precisely their ideas by which these social and Governmental services could be retained without paying for them.  They have not done so though they spoke at great length during the various stages of the discussion.  Not once but many times they refused to respond to that appeal. They refused to give the Dáil and the country the benefit of their plans for providing not merely the social services now in operation but increased social services, with less taxation. Deputy O'Sullivan concluding the discussion now on behalf of his Party also refused to give that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Deputies opposite into a secret&mdash;no Government finds it popular to impose taxation.  Any Government that can avoid imposing taxes or that can avoid imposing new taxes always avoids it.  No matter what new services may have to be provided no Government in any country will impose new taxes if it can avoid it. If there is any method by which additional <Col N="244" /> taxation can be avoided, we are prepared to adopt that way when it is shown to us.  We told the Deputies opposite so, on the day on which the Budget was introduced&mdash;the day when this discussion started.  I asked them then to give us their ideas and their plans.  They have not done so yet despite all the opportunities.  Although we sat late on different occasions and though we provided them with the whole of last Saturday to discuss this matter, they failed to respond to it.  I make an appeal now, not to the Party opposite because Deputy O'Sullivan has succeeded in driving them out of the House, but to the three Deputies present.  There are social services and Governmental services.  The cost of these is set out in great detail in the Estimates.  That cost must be covered by revenue raised within the year. There are no means or ways of which we know by which that revenue can be secured except by taxation.  But if the Party opposite knows of other methods why not give the benefit of their great ideas of their magnificent new plan to meet the cost of public services without taxation to the Dáil and to the country.  Let them give us the benefit of their plans, if they have plans, which will make it possible to raise the money in some other way. Deputies opposite have repeatedly stated that there is not one of these social services which they want reduced.  When challenged on the point they carefully avoided naming one of them on which they wanted less expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which taxation can be reduced is by reducing the cost of Government and the only way of reducing the cost of Government is by spending less upon some or all of the social or other services.  Will the Party opposite tell us on which of the existing services less money should be spent?  They will not tell us that.  They are trying to follow a completely illogical course.  They want to appear as advocating not merely the social services now in existence but additional social services whilst at the same time advocating reduced taxation.  They cannot have both.  So far as we know, not <Col N="245" /> merely do they want all the existing social services but they want additional ones.  They cannot forget that they published in their programme their intention of maintaining the social services in operation, Widows and Orphans Act, the old age pensions, the operations under the Housing Acts, the Unemployment Assistance Acts and other services for social amelioration. But they want to go further and they have added two new services&mdash;old age pensions at 65 and the complete derating of agricultural land.  These have been inserted in the programme of their Party at their annual convention. These two services between them will cost more than £3,000,000. Where are they to get that money?  It is not £3,000,000 out of the existing revenue.  It is £3,000,000 in addition to the existing revenue that they have undertaken to provide.  Where are they to get it without having increased taxation?  They are opposed to increased taxation.  Yet they have committed themselves to these two additional services.  We invite them to tell us where is the money to be got. The country is entitled to know if they have any plans for getting the additional £3,000,000 without increasing the taxation on the people.  Why keep that knowledge to themselves?  Why not share that knowledge with the unfortunate suffering taxpayers of this country?</P>
    <P>They have not merely made the task that their Party would have to undertake more difficult by committing themselves to these additions to State services, but they have gone much further. They have indicated that they are going to provide not merely the existing revenue required to meet existing services, but £3,000,000 as well.  They have barred certain taxes. There are certain existing taxes which they say they are going to abolish. They are not to have any tax upon tea, any tax upon sugar, or any tax upon tobacco.  They want to reduce the income tax in various aspects.  There are a very large number of additional duties which they have voted against, which they have stated should not be imposed, and to the removal of which <Col N="246" /> they have committed themselves, if ever an opportunity of governing this country should again be theirs.  They have, therefore, to provide from secret sources of revenue not merely the £3,000,000 additional required to meet the cost of old age pensions at 65, and the derating of agricultural land, but some £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 more to make good the loss of revenue that will arise when these taxes are abolished. Let us say £10,000,000 and call it a round sum.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite, therefore, have come into this House, representing themselves as responsible representatives of the people, a Party with a policy, a Party with something more than a policy, with a desire to be called upon to put that policy into effect.  That policy involves raising £10,000,000 over and above the revenue to be raised this year without imposing any new taxes.  Is not that their policy?  If it is not their policy, let them tell us what it is.  If it is their policy, let them tell us where they are going to get the money and how they are going to do it.  If it is not their policy, let them say what their policy is.  Remember, we are entitled to know.  The Party opposite claim to be an important part of this House, a responsible Opposition, and their responsibility is going to be judged, not by the way in which they abuse Ministers, but by the constructive proposals which they can put up against the policy of the Government.  If they are not going to get that £10,000,000 without imposing additional taxes, let them tell us what taxes they would impose to raise it.  I do not think they will tell us that.  There is still one hour and a quarter in which some member of that Party can break a self-imposed rule of silence concerning their Party plans, but I am quite certain it will not be availed of.  They will avoid that issue, because it is not popular to face it.  They will avoid that issue because, unless they continue to avoid it, they will not be able to pose before the country as the advocates of increased social services, on the one hand, and the advocates of reduced taxation on the other hand.  I wonder do they <Col N="247" /> seriously believe that there is any body of people in the country which takes them seriously.  They take themselves seriously at times; but do they think that, outside of this House, there is any number of responsible people who believe that it is possible for them to provide these increased social services and, at the same time, reduce taxation in a manner which is so secret that it cannot be even whispered?  Of course, they do not.  They found out that the people do not believe it.  They are going to continue to find out that the people of the country have no use for any political Party that is not prepared to set out in clear terms, in black and white, their political policy and their governmental programme.</P>
    <P>This Party did that and this Party is in office.  The Party opposite declined to do it and they are in Opposition.  Each succeeding election reduces their numbers and their significance in the political life of the State, and that process is going to go on indefinitely until they disappear, unless some one member of their Party has got the moral courage to commit the Party to a definite policy of some kind or another.  It does not matter what they commit themselves to.  So long as the people know where they stand upon any issue, there will be somebody to support them, but when nobody knows what they stand for, when they see different members of the Party contradicting each other upon every issue of public importance, then nobody is going to take them seriously, except the limited number of people who have attached themselves to their political organisation for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked what justification the Government offered for the schedules to this Bill.  It is not necessary for the Government to offer justification for the schedules to this Bill.  The justification for the proposals embodied in the Bill can be seen all over the country in new factories and in additional people at work.  I want Deputies to bear in mind the figures I gave them two weeks ago.  In the 12 months preceding <Col N="248" /> April of this year 97,000 more people got insurable employment than in 1931.  Deputy O'Sullivan says that the various new industries established have not increased the wages fund. Why does he not attempt to support these ridiculous assertions by some reference to the facts?  The amount of money paid out annually in wages through Irish industrial concerns has increased this year, as compared with 1931, by no less than £2,000,000.  At least £2,000,000 more is going out in wages to Irish workers because of the industrial development that has taken place, and that is our justification for the schedules to this Bill.  The Party opposite in their published programme commit themselves also to this statement: That they were to protect Irish industries and assist their development by tariffs, quotas, and prohibitions.  That is the phrase they used in their Party programme published after the recent Ard Fheis. Yet on every occasion upon which a proposal for industrial development is brought in here involving a tariff or quota or prohibition, that Party vote solidly against it.  The people have long since tested the sincerity of their declarations in favour of industrial development.</P>
    <P>We had in 1932 a difficult task to perform, first of all, in arresting the decline in Irish industry which had set in during the previous decade; and, secondly, in securing increased industrial development.  We have done that.  Not merely have factories that were closed down between 1922 and 1932 been reopened, but a very large number of additional factories have been established and, employed in those factories, are 25,000 more people than were employed in similar industrial concerns only four years ago. Twenty-five thousand people, all of them in permanent employment, and all of them receiving wages every week which they spend in our shops buying the produce of our farms and of our factories, helping to increase the commercial activity and the general prosperity of the country, is no small number.  It is an important contribution to the development of this country, <Col N="249" /> and, because of it, we can say that the proportion of our total production of butter, bacon, cattle, and all other agricultural products consumed at home is much higher now than at any time for which statistics are available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan talked about decreasing production.  He said the production of the agricultural industry and other industries is less now than it was.  That statement is completely untrue.  Every figure published through the Official Statistics Bureau, every source of information open to Deputies, reveals the very reverse of what Deputy O'Sullivan has asserted.  Why do Deputies opposite come in here making statements of that kind which they know can be disproved without the least difficulty, thinking they can get away with it? I invite them to examine even our export statistics.  Deputies opposite attach considerable importance to our export trade.  I have always argued here that they attach too much importance to an export trade and I have told them that we could have a period of positive poverty in this country with increasing exports just as we could have a period of immense prosperity with no export trade at all. The export trade is no index to the prosperity of the country but, taking their own index to the prosperity of the country, namely, the export trade, I ask them to note the fact that in the last year we sent out more butter than in 1931; that we sent out more bacon and hams than in 1931, and that, in respect of a large number of other agricultural products, exports have increased.  It is true that in the last year we sent out less cattle than in 1931, but this year that situation has been remedied and the exports for the first five months of this year were over 50,000 head in excess of the exports for the same five months of last year.  There has been no decreased production.</P>
    <P>Not merely in relation to the limited range of agricultural products on which our farmers were engaged during the régime of Cumann na n Gaedheal, has there been no decline in production <Col N="250" /> but there has been added to that range of products a number of new products&mdash;wheat, beet, and cereals of other kinds&mdash;the production of which is still increasing the return which our farmers get from the use of the land.  I am not pretending to anybody on this side or the other side of the House that the agricultural industry is in a prosperous condition or that agriculture in present circumstances is paying its way, but Deputies opposite do not want it to pay its way. There is only one method by which agriculture can be put back on a profitable basis, and that is by increasing the price of agricultural products, but you cannot increase the price received by the farmer for the product he has to sell without increasing the price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Yet, every measure brought in here, designed to increase the price to the farmer, was opposed by the Party opposite on the grounds that it led to an increase in the price to the consumer. Of course it did.  They are bitterly complaining here because the price of butter is on a particular level, because the price of bacon is at a particular level, or because the price of bread has been increased in consequence of the increased production of Irish wheat.  They complain about all these things and they try to defeat the efforts of the Government to keep up the price of these products although at the same time they deplore the fact that agriculture is not yielding a profit to those engaged in it.  If we are going to improve the position of the farmers, if we are going to improve it on the basis that they will get a profit on the sale of the goods they produce, then we have got to raise the price of these goods on the market.  Yet, whenever the Government bring in here proposals to that end, I know they are going to meet with the bitter opposition and the blind obstruction which we have experienced in the past from the Party opposite.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The country is kicking,&rdquo; said Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is, of course, and it is kicking the Party opposite. On every occasion on which we have given them an opportunity from 1932, <Col N="251" /> they exercised themselves in fine style and demonstrated, by their kicks, exactly what they thought of the Party opposite.</P>

      <P>In 1933 we went back to the people and gave them an opportunity of reviewing the decision which they had taken in 1932.  They reviewed it, and decided to send this Party back with an increased majority. In 1934 the people were afforded another opportunity in the local elections, and although the then leader of that Party announced that they were going to win 22 county councils out of 26, they did nothing of the kind.  They did not even hold the seats they had.  They were beaten in the great majority of the counties, although the election took place on a franchise which was particularly favourable to the Party opposite.  This year we invited them to contest two by-elections.  They have lost a seat and we have gained one.  I hope they feel in their own hearts a little more confidence in their future political prospects than their words would indicate.  If they have any doubt whatever as to what the country thinks of them we invite any one of them in any constituency in Ireland to resign and we shall attempt to take his seat.</P>

All the information available points to the other direction.  The consumption of luxury goods is increasing.  There is more money being spent on tobacco, more money being spent on drink, more money being spent on motor cars, more money being spent on <Col N="253" /> luxuries of this kind than last year, and there was more money spent last year than in the previous year.</P>

The figures are there&mdash;the import figures, the revenue returns, and other sources of information&mdash;and if the Deputy thinks that I am misrepresenting the figures given in those statistical books or the information available in the various official returns, let him quote these statistics and the returns here himself. But he will not do it.  They never do because if they went at all to reliable sources of information, their contentions could no longer be made.  I said here in this House three years ago that one of the greatest tragedies in political life is to see a beautiful theory killed by an ugly fact.  All the beautiful theories of the Party opposite live only a very short while in the atmosphere of this House, because they are not well let loose before some ugly fact gets them by the throat and throttles them.  Deputies have got to face up to facts which are ugly from their point of view&mdash;ugly because they have doomed that Party to eternal opposition.  I would not mind if they were even a good Opposition, but they are not a good Opposition.  With the exception of Deputy Mulcahy, I do not think there is a Deputy opposite who reads the measures beforehand, although they discuss them here quite frequently.  It is painful to see Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Brennan and Deputy McGilligan coming in here during debates and listening to speeches to find out what it is all about before making their own contributions.</P>

      <P>It imposes two kinds of taxation.  The first kind are the taxes designed to produce revenue to provide the social services the people want and are glad to have.  The great majority of the people, irrespective of Party, approve of these social services and recognise that in order to provide them taxation has to be imposed, and even the Party opposite dare not say to their own supporters, much less to the public at large, that if they got back into office they would terminate a single one of these services. On the contrary, in order to secure votes, they pretend that they wish to improve upon them.  The Bill imposes another group of taxes upon manufactured goods imported into this country, which, in future, we are going to make for ourselves.  As factories for the manufacture of these commodities are opened, one by one, if there is any official opening or any other ceremony in connection therewith, Deputies of the Party opposite for the constituency concerned will be present on every occasion.  They are there, as I said last week, on the band waggons, beating the drums and making speeches declaring how glad they are to note this development and how much the members of their Party wish to co-operate with the Government in securing a development of its industrial policy.  They will all be there.  At the few of these functions at which I have been present, <Col N="256" /> there have always been Deputies of the Opposition Party.</P>

Deputy Morrissey the other day gave a complete illustration of the tactics of the Party opposite.  There was a vote here on a tariff relating to aluminium ware, the factory for which is situated in the town in which Deputy Morrissey lives, Nenagh. Deputy Morrissey was not in the House when the tariff was being debated.  Other Deputies of his Party who were here were opposed to the tariff, and, when the motion was put from the Chair, they called for a division. I told them publicly to warn Deputy Morrissey as to what they were doing, and when Deputy Morrissey came into the House, one or two of the Deputies opposite went up and warned him that they were voting against a tariff designed to help that Nenagh industry, and Deputy Morrissey left the House.  He took his warning and went out, and other Deputies opposite always do the same thing.</P>

    <P>I said here during the first discussion on tariffs we had in this House, as a Government, when the Fianna Fáil Party was in a minority, that, on any tariff resolution, we could always <Col N="258" /> be certain of a majority because there were bound to be some Deputies opposite who were interested in the development of the industry concerned because of the location of some of the factories in their own constituencies. It always worked out that when the Resolution went to a Vote we got sufficient votes from the Party opposite to carry it, and we always will because they are not a Party.

      <P>I think that I have disposed effectively of everything that was said by Deputy O'Sullivan and, in fact, of everything said by the Opposition since May last on this matter.  I invite the Leader of the Opposition to speak and to answer the questions that I have put to them: How can they maintain the existing social services and the existing Government services and at the same time reduce taxation? Furthermore, how are they going to go beyond that and to provide another £3,000,000 for old age pensions at 65, and the derating of agricultural land, without imposing new taxation?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  Was not this one of the things in the policy on which the Minister was elected: Foreign wheat to be allowed into Ireland free of duty. That is taken from: &ldquo;Some points in the agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I do not think that the cheap jack anties of the Minister for Industry and Commerce would convince <Col N="260" /> anyone.  Probably people not accustomed to listening to him might think that there was something behind what he had to say, but those who know him are well aware that the method of debate he adopts is really for the purpose of killing time, and hence his speech this evening leaves us absolutely unconvinced.  The one thing that seems to trouble the Minister is this: &ldquo;What is the policy of the Party opposite?  They want social services but they will not say where they are going to find the money for them.&rdquo; The Minister has a convenient sort of memory.  Does he remember when he sat on these benches?  Does he not realise that the antics pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party during that period were such as to preclude any party from ever attempting to put a policy across the House before again becoming the Government of the country?  Does the Minister remember all the promises he made?  When he sat on these benches, and wanted to get to the side of the House on which he now sits, he told the people that his party would reduce taxation by £2,000,000 a year; they were to reduce the Civic Guards and the Army, and to make agriculture more prosperous than it ever had been.  That was the policy on which Fianna Fáil got elected as a Government.  Since they became the Government they have failed to carry out any one of their promises.  The Minister wants to know why other people do not put forward&mdash;I wonder does he mean&mdash;a similar policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a similar fake? The people on this side have a tradition of Government and of responsibility. Does the Minister think that we should put up something idiotic that we would have to run away from immediately we became the elected Government of the country after a General Election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and the Minister does not care what is in the Bill either. The Minister did not discuss what is in <Col N="261" /> the Bill.  He will do anything but that. As I have said, he has a very convenient memory.  He told us this evening about the success of his efforts and of the Government's efforts in bringing prosperity to the country.  The Minister seems to forget that he told us quite recently that in these hard times it was hard to balance the Budget, but now, apparently, there is no difficulty in doing that.  According to him, we have prosperity on every side. Two years ago the Minister for Finance told us, and quite rightly, that revenue was buoyant, but it does not appear to be buoyant to-day.  The only thing that appears to be buoyant to-day is the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in trying to bolster up a very bad case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan quite rightly asked if, when this Budget was being framed, any consideration was given to the capacity of the people to pay. The Minister for Industry and Commerce appeared to think that that does not enter into it.  I will spare his blushes by not reciting the speeches that he and his colleagues made from these benches when in opposition. Then the capacity of the people to pay meant everything.  At that time our Budget amounted to something like £21,000,000, as against £29,000,000 to-day. Then the Minister felt that the capacity of the people to pay had not been considered; that they were not able to bear the taxation that was being put upon them.  After three years of Fianna Fáil Government and an increase of several millions in taxation by people who went in to reduce taxation, we are seriously asked what is our policy.  The Minister said that if we had a policy we should state it. What did the Minister do with regard to his policy?  Where is the plan that Fianna Fáil flaunted all over the country, and that they spent thousands of pounds publishing in the newspapers? What has happened to that?  It has gone with the rest.  It has gone with the prosperity of the country.  What really happened with regard to the economies that the Government was going to make?  Did they reduce the number of Civic Guards?  Not at all. <Col N="262" /> No such thing.  A scare was started, accidentally or otherwise, around Leinster House, and it was stated that more Guards were needed to protect Government Buildings.  Consequently, the country has to pay for them.  That is what happened with regard to the Civic Guards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>After doing all that the Government wants to know what we propose to do.  All I will say to that is that the Government that succeeds the present Government will have my sympathy.  They will have to undo all the harm.  The Minister knows that.  He knows perfectly well that this country is on the down grade. Knowing that as well as I do, the Minister should have sympathy for his successors, whoever they are going to be.  We had statements last night from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture with regard to bacon levies and the bounties paid on bacon.  They disclosed an extraordinary type of mind and an extraordinary state of affairs.  The bounties on bacon are provided partly, the Minister said, by this taxation.  He said that the price of bacon on the Irish market was so much in excess of the price in the British market&mdash;although it was getting top price there&mdash;that we had to give bounties, or at least to subsidise the export of bacon so that exporters would send it to England. In other words, according to the Minister, the people in this country wanted more of their own bacon, and would not be allowed to have it, yet the taxpayers were made pay, so that bacon curers could send out of the country what was required at home.  Do Ministers think that anyone is going to swallow such statements?  The Bill before the House, according to the Minister for Agriculture, is a unique Bill, and in order that this unique Bill could get through without certain criticism, we had certain motions passed.  I do not blame the Government. I do not blame Ministers for standing up and making general statements, such as we had from the Minister <Col N="263" /> for Industry and Commerce.  But they cannot stand over this and they know it.</P>
      <P>Are there any items on which economies could be made?  What about the economic war for a start?  What is that costing?  Apart from what we are paying in the way of bounties and subsidies, amounting to between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 annually, what is it costing the country otherwise?  How is it affecting the capacity of the people to pay?  The present Government has never attempted to realise that agriculture is the main industry of this country and that it must pay its own way.  Agriculture cannot be paid for by any subsidiary industry.  It is not by accident that we are a stockraising country.  The Minister for Agriculture told us that.  I wonder if the Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees with him.  He commented adversely on a speech made by Deputy O'Sullivan which dealt with production in this country.  Peculiarly enough, the Minister for Agriculture stated recently that there was only one way to get a better price for agricultural produce, and that was to produce less. The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us recently that we had now arrived at a stage at which there was a practical assurance that we would have no surplus live stock.  I wonder if that is evidence that the country is in a better position to bear increased taxation.  Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Fianna Fáil Party believe that a man who had ten cows last year is better off with three cows this year?  Is that what Fianna Fáil believes?  If not, I would like to know what the Minister for Industry and Commerce meant when he said, by way of a boast, that we had reached the end of our surplus cattle&mdash;not that we have got other markets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should point out that there is evidence at present that we will run short of fulfilling our cattle quota.  I am sure if we arrive at that stage the Fianna Fáil Party will feel very proud of their policy, proud that they did a good day's work for this country when they slaughtered the calves and killed the cattle trade.  If the Executive Council pays any attention whatever to the adverse trade balance, and if they take that as an indication of the prosperity or otherwise of this country, they must be feeling pretty blue at present.  They should remember that it was the live-stock trade kept this country from going on the rocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there more value? If Deputy Corry thinks that the value of farmers' stock has been increased, let him go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and ask what money they will advance on a certain number of cattle.  Let him compare the accommodation he would get to-day with what this semi-Government Department would be prepared to give in 1931.  The Deputy will then see how the credit of farmers stands to-day. That is the test.  Another thing that struck one forcibly during the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was the advance the Minister has made in his education since he changed from these benches to the Government Benches.  He said that there was only one way of reducing expenditure, by curtailing social services. The Minister, and also the Minister for Finance, does not remember apparently that they offered this country better social services at a <Col N="265" /> lower cost.  It is convenient to forget that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is and at a lesser cost?  Are we not paying seven or eight million pounds more than we ever paid in taxation?  Even the Minister would try to convince us, as some Deputies tried to convince us on various occasions that as far as British penal tariffs go they do not really make any difference to the people.  The Minister for Finance told us that if the Irish people were paying a tax on British coal, then the English people were paying a tax on Irish cattle.  We have not forgotten the endeavour that was made to mislead the people into the belief that the incidence of the taxes was the same on both sides.  It is absolutely different.  One of the real reasons why we have taxation in these forms this year is because of the Government's blunders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an economic war which is costing us millions.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us two years ago that we had won this war, but we are still financing it, and our farmers are still losing by it.  We have had to resort to free beef, unemployment money and increased home assistance to cope with the position, and the Minister for Finance has to find money for all these services. That is the way prosperity has been brought to this country.  In this Bill, the Minister for Finance has had to go outside the ordinary law in order to find money.  There is a provision in the Bill for the collection of revenue upon the five-fourths of the valuation of certain house property. We have to go outside all rules of arithmetic and outside all law to find means by which we can collar some money.  Is that not a very dangerous and vicious principle for any Government to enunciate&mdash;that the Minister for Finance should go outside the ordinary law to find revenue?  Is there anything to prevent the Minister for Finance saying that, next <Col N="266" /> year, he will increase the charges on the farmers' valuations by 25 per cent?  The Government must, in their present position, find money for their own blunders.  That is the reason that we have taxed in this Bill food, clothing, bread and the coal for cooking the foodstuffs.  There is nothing left free except air and water.  Probably, the Minister for Finance thinks we ought to be thankful to have even these two left.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan told us to-night&mdash;I regret that he was badly briefed by his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Leary&mdash;that they had a tradition of responsibility.  I wonder where they got it.  They took over a certain policy from the British and they worked it for ten years.  Year after year, they carried out that policy.  They never had the courage to change it or to move one inch from the old English aim &mdash; to make this country the fruitful mother of flocks and herds.  They had no industries. I am prepared to admit that a certain number of foolish individuals did start little industries here at the start of their régime, thinking that Irish industries would go ahead now that there was a national Government. What happened to these industries? Every one of them was closed down&mdash;</P>

If Deputy O'Leary or Deputy Brennan want to see our plan, he can go down the country and see it in the fields.  They will see in the fields, wheat that their Minister for Agriculture told us could not be grown in this country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a resolution, which I got yesterday, and I will read it for the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Owing to the general depression in agricultural produce during the last four years, together with the bad prices prevailing, a large number of farmers find it impossible to pay their annuities in the constituency of East Cork.  We, the Midleton Urban District Council, request the Minister for Agriculture to devise some means whereby outstanding arrears can be collected without undue hardship on the farming community&mdash;for instance, spreading them over a number of years at 3½ per cent. interest until they are paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That resolution was proposed by Mr. Edward Carey, T.D., seconded by Mr. M. Connors, and carried unanimously by the Midleton Urban Council on 6th October, 1929.  The farmers of my constituency were not able, in 1929, to pay their annuities. They were &ldquo;broke&rdquo; and they were appealing to the Government to give them time to find some way out of the position in which they were placed by a Government which completely <Col N="268" /> ignored the welfare of the unfortunate tillage farmers and which completely ignored the appeals made by me, month after month and week after week, that the farmer whose land was valued on the wheat basis should get a market for that wheat and that the man whose land was valued on a barley basis should get a market for that barley.  We were told then that we had the world market prices.  But this is what Deputy Carey says.  That was the position of farmers as given forth in October, 1929, by a Cumann na nGaedheal T.D. &ldquo;Signs on,&rdquo; when the unfortunate man came up here, he saw that these people were going to do nothing at all for him, and when the General Election came along he got the high road, same as a few more of you will get when the people get a chance.  That is the tradition of responsibility&mdash;save the mark!</P>
    <P>When we endeavoured to get a price for the farmers for their butter, Deputy Mulcahy led his colleagues into the Lobby, saying that 2d. per gallon was enough for the farmer's milk.  Deputy Bennett broke away and voted with us, just as Deputy Morrissey ran out the other night, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce told you.  They opposed the admixture scheme to give a price for barley to the farmers.  They opposed the Bacon Bill and the Wheat Bill&mdash; in fact, every Bill that would give a price to the ordinary working farmer. Their god was the bullock and the ranch.  Now, they come along and complain of the cost.  The cost of what?  The cost of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, for which they voted; the cost of the houses for unfortunate workmen which for ten years they refused to build; the cost of reconstructing the small farmers' houses, for which they refused to give any money for ten years.  They complain now because they are asked to find money for Bills that they dared not oppose; because they are asked for the £625,000 they robbed from the old age pensioners.  They come in here now with their tongues in their cheeks and complain that the cost of social services has gone up.  I defy anyone of <Col N="269" /> them to name a single social service that they are prepared to oppose. They voted for every one of them here. They were too much under the thumb of the capitalists to bring forward proposals themselves, but when they are brought in here by a Government elected by the ordinary plain people, they have not the pluck to oppose them.</P>
    <P>They come in like dumb-driven cattle and vote for them and then they complain. Deputy Mulcahy complained that the poor man is paying 1/5 per lb. for his butter.  Then we have Deputy Bennett running around the Lobby and coming in after us to vote with us, because he realise that the farmer must get an economic price for his butter, just as the industrialist gets an economic price for what he produces.  Deputy Bennett broke away from the Party and voted with us on that occasion.  As soon as Deputy Bennett had made the price of butter safe for the County Limerick farmer, he marched nobly into the Lobby and voted against his comrade across the border in County Cork getting a price for his wheat.  The wheat men there voted with us.  That is typical of the way they have acted. They have not the courage to oppose any proposal brought in here.  They voted for the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, for the Old Age Pensions Bill that they went out of office before they would give, and they voted for the Housing Bill.  There was no opposition and they were in favour of all those measures.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out, they were in favour even of still more.  They were prepared to give old age pensions even at 65.  I am sure there is some genius over there who might contemplate giving pensions to people when they are born if he thought there would be any chance of that proposal getting a vote for him at an election.</P>
    <P>We all know that the people got a sickener of the Party opposite.  They got so disillusioned in regard to those people that no matter what they do, every time there is an election there will be more gaps over there.  Soon <Col N="270" /> they will be so few in numbers that they will not be able to get enough to call a division.  They will be wiped out root and branch.  I do not want to take up the time of the House, but I could not avoid intervening when I heard Deputy Brennan.  The Deputy had not only his own brains to work on, but he got all Deputy O'Leary's notes in order to help him out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing for Deputy Keating is to look after the licences.  Under the last Government the farmers of this country were left in the position so very clearly pointed out by Mr. Carey.  He said that from 1925 onwards the prices the farmers were getting for their produce in the market beyond the seas were so wretched that the farmers were absolutely broken and they were unable to pay their annuities.  The farmers were broken in 1929, dead to the ropes, according to Mr. Carey.  We raised them up, we made men of them, we made farmers of them.  As I pointed out before, when Deputy Kent was a poor crippled man, not able to walk with rheumatics, I had to lift him into the wagon to make his speech at an election meeting, and in recent times I saw him challenge the Minister for Defence to swim the Liffey with him.  After six months of the plough, carrying out the Fianna Fáil programme, after using the plough and the spade, he got so limber in the <Col N="271" /> muscles, he was so free himself, that he offered to swim the Liffey against the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>That will show you what we have done for the farmers.  They have got loose and limber in their limbs and instead of being just able to crawl out with a stick to see if the bullocks were fattening, they are now out with the plough and to-morrow or after they will be out with the scythe and the reaper and the binder.  And they are paid for their work in spite of the attempts of the Opposition.  Every proposal that we put forward to give them a decent price was voted against by the Opposition.  We had the pluck to change the old British policy and to provide a home market worth £2,000,000 a year for the farmer's wheat.  We gave them a market worth £1,760,000 for the bacon that Deputy Brennan alluded to.</P>

      <P>Of course Chinese bacon was good enough for the poor farmers then.  We changed that and preserved the home market for the Irish farmer. Last week when we endeavoured to stabilise bacon prices we had Deputies opposite protesting and marching into the lobby against our proposal. They want nothing that will benefit the farmer except it comes in the shape of a price for the bullock.  They did not want houses built for the poor. They thought the poor should live in hovels.  They were in charge of the finances of this country for 12 years and during that time there was not a labourer's cottage built in the Free State.</P>

      <P>Or burning houses.  I remember appealing here to Deputy Mulcahy to give the farmers some chance of building a house or repairing the bad houses they were in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one shilling did they give towards the repair of small farmers' houses in this country.  They could live in the hovels&mdash;they were good enough for them&mdash;and mind the bullocks for John Bull.  That was the régime of the Party opposite when they were a Government.  Now they come along here and complain and cry and wail against the country being asked to do what they said they were prepared to do or what they tried to prove they were anxious to do at the next general election: namely, to support a policy of building those houses for the poor, of providing old age pensions, and widows' and orphans' pensions, and all the other social services which we considered necessary and which the people considered necessary&mdash;services which the people put us in here to give them. Whatever the cost of these social services may be, they will be carried out, and more of them, whenever we see the need for them.  The Opposition can swallow that, and they can come along then and see if any of their promises will bear fruit, or if their brain-wave of old age pensions at 65 will get them more votes.  They can come along then and see if the poor old people down the country, who saw their meagre old age pensions reduced by 1/- a week in the old days by the gentlemen who now come along and say that they are going to give them old age pensions at 65, will believe them.  They must think that the people in this country have very short memories.  I can tell them that the people will pay just as much heed to such statements as they paid to the statement of the leader of the <Col N="273" /> Opposition when he said that his Party would cut the annuities in half and would not ask them to pay the annuities over a period of years.  The people just laughed at that statement and voted for us.  They took no more notice of that statement, I suppose, than they would take of a little dog barking in the street.  Who would take notice of their statements, in any case, in view of their previous record?  I must say that every time they come in here, they are getting fewer and older-looking, and more miserablelooking; and, God save us all, if there is any home at all that they could be put into, I am sure that the people of this country would be entirely grateful for it if they could get rid of them in that way.</P>

      <P>After that bit of bilingual and ejaculatory wisdom from Deputy Corry, I am sure that we all understand what this is all about.  I feel that there would really be as much unanimity in letting Deputy Corry speak as there was in preventing the Minister for Finance from speaking&mdash; the only thing in which the House was unanimous in the last five years.  The only thing, that I can recollect, in which the House was unanimous in the last five years was that the Minister for Finance should be shut up.  Deputy Corry used one phrase:&mdash;&ldquo;Let the Opposition&rdquo;&mdash;and he might as well have said the taxpayer&mdash;&ldquo;swallow that.&rdquo;  He might as well have said the taxpayer, because it is the taxpayer that is swallowing the taxes mainly. Remember this: That it is the tax on bread, the tax on sugar, the tax on tea, the tax on butter, about which Deputy Corry is so vociferous, that is paying for all this.  And Deputy Corry tells us that we will have more, and that if they cost more, in his own words: &ldquo;you can swallow that.&rdquo;  It was a good phrase that Deputy Corry used; but it is not the old famous plan that we heard so much about.  You remember the words of the Fianna Fáil Government: That £2,000,000 was to be saved in taxation, that the farmers' wealth was to be increased by £3,000,000, that 84,000 more people were to be put into employment, and so on, <Col N="274" /> and that there was to be more and more and more money; and why should it ever stop?  I am sure that Deputy Corry swallowed that with a great many other things.  What is he making the people swallow now?  Not complete derating, surely; not £2,000,000 of a reduction in taxation; not 84,000 more people put into employment, and so on.  There have been a lot of calves slaughtered in this country, as Deputy Corry tells us, but I suggest that there is one glorious calf still to be slaughtered when the Prodigal Son returns home, and that is Deputy Corry.  His neck is eager for the knife and I suggest that he should restrain himself now, because he and his Party will get it in the neck very soon. Deputy Corry did not get the £3,000,000 in agricultural relief, or the £2,000,000 in reduced taxation, or the 84,000 people who were to have been put into industrial occupation.  Where are they?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are there? Well, if they are there, they cannot be counted.  The Minister has tried to give us the count, but what does it amount to&mdash;£26,000 in a total wages bill of £4,000,000! Deputy Corry tells us that we can swallow it, but you cannot swallow much extra taxes when you have considered the taxes on butter, on sugar, on tea, on bread, and when you consider the £26,000 extra in a total wages bill of £4,000,000.  If that is what Deputy Corry is going to swallow, he will need to have a big appetite before he can approach that feast with any sort of pleasure. Deputy Corry told us that we can go down the fields and see the slaughtered calves.  Was that one of the items in the Fianna Fáil plan?  Did the famous plan say: &ldquo;We will give you more houses, and we will give you more mills in Cork, and so on, but you will have to pay for it in taxes on sugar, in taxes on tea, in taxes on bread, and in taxes on butter?&rdquo; Did Fianna Fáil claim the votes of the people on such promises as that?  Did Deputy Corry claim the votes of his constituents on that?  If so, Deputy Corry is here on <Col N="275" /> false pretences&mdash;he is here on false pretences, anyway&mdash;but can he show in what way these promises have been fulfilled?  Deputy Corry says that the signs are all around us now.  Yes! What are they?  Does Deputy Corry believe in the figures that have been given&mdash;17,000 employed in three years, and 15,000 of these engaged in building, and 2,000 in all industries, and that there is a reduction in the number of people employed on the land?  Does the Deputy believe these figures?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry says that it is about time that money was brought back&mdash;the implication being that it is to be used in Irish industries. <Col N="276" /> If so, some results should be shown. What are the results?  Increased employment?  Have we that?  More goods manufactured here?  Have we that?  Less goods being imported into this country?  Have we that?  Last year we sent out £38,000,000 to purchase goods that we could not make at home.  What did we get in?  We got in £18,000,000.  Deputy Corry's extravagant leaders have brought us to the position of sending out £38,000,000 as against £18,000,000 that we got in, and if, as Deputy Corry suggests, the money that is coming home here is to be brought into productive industry in this country, where are the goods that that money is producing?  If this money that is being brought home here from investments abroad is being put into productive employment here, why is not the revenue yielding what it should yield?  If that is the case, why does not the income tax, which is now at 4/9, yield what we used to get when it was at 3/6?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he wasted his time in trying to refute them.  I say that if the British are getting in at 4/6 more than, or even the same as, they used to get in when the tax was 5/-, and if we can only get in at 4/9 what we used to get in at 3/6, it is a bad sign for the country.  The yield of the tax is going down, the people are not getting employment, and the money is not being sent out of the country, but Deputy Corry, in  ignorance, believes that everything is prosperous in the country, and I suggest that that is the kind of ignorance that is behind this whole Bill.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was pointing out that in certain cases the Attorney-General <Col N="279" /> thought fit to have men brought before the District Court, and thought that was sufficient.  In similar cases where those charged were members or supporters of the Opposition even in the most trivial charges, they were brought before the Military Tribunal.  The Attorney-General denied that and he challenged me to produce any case of that kind.  Cases of that kind have been brought to the notice of the Attorney-General in this House before now.  Last night they were brought to his notice again.  Such cases were brought to his notice on the last occasion on which the Vote for Law Charges was before this House.  There must have been numerous cases up and down the country which must be known to the Attorney-General. We have cases where A, alleged to be a member of the I.R.A., charged with having a revolver and ammunition, is brought before the District Justice.  On a similar charge B is brought before the Military Tribunal because he is a member of the League of Youth or because he is not a member of the I.R.A.  That is known to every member of this House and to every reader of the Press.  Then we had a case at Mohill.  There was a case in Strokestown, and we had the famous case in Wexford of men charged with making an armed attack on and robbery of a very old man and charged with having firearms on that occasion.  In these cases the culprits were brought before the District Justice.</P>
      <P>Last night I asked the Attorney-General to give us some information regarding the number of counsel whom he has thought fit to employ in certain cases during the last 12 months.  I asked also for some information, if he has the information, with regard to the fees which those counsel employed by the State get.  I am told they get fees which are far in excess of those which ordinarily are paid or claimed in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to know from the Attorney-General what he has to say regarding the performance of a counsel employed by this State to <Col N="280" /> conduct a prosecution and who availed of his position as State counsel for the time being to give to the prisoners&mdash;&ldquo;misguided young men, as he called them&rdquo;&mdash;a lecture as to the difference between their brand of Republicanism and the brand favoured by the President. He gave them a lecture also on the difference between the constitution of the I.R.A. in the President's day and the constitution of the I.R.A. at present &mdash; a lecture in which he pointed out that the essential difference lay in the fact of a certain amendment made in the constitution of the I.R.A.  Are we to be asked here to-night to vote money to pay counsel for indulging in what was nothing but at attempt to use the courts of the country for propaganda on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and on behalf of the President?  I think it was a scandalous performance and one that the Attorney-General will find it hard to justify if he intends to justify it. I am satisfied of this: that that counsel would not be allowed to act in that way before the civil courts of the country.  He took advantage of the fact that he was appearing before a court the members of which have had no legal training.  It seems to me if we are to have State counsel conducting cases in that way there will be very little respect for State counsel, for the office of the Attorney-General or for the courts before which such statements have been made.</P>

      <P>I had the distinguished pleasure last night of listening to the late Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, telling us what he thought of the present administration of justice in the country, and principally what he thought of the present administration of justice under that damnable thing the Public Danger Act.  Well many a father has lived to curse his child. Many a father has lived to be ashamed of the thing which his hot youth produced. Who was the father of the Public Safety Act?  Who was the father of this damnable system?  Who was the father of the invasion of the <Col N="281" /> ordinary law and the production of special legislation of the character of which the Deputy says is being abused?  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I remember when the Bill and its successor were introduced here.  I do believe that Cumann na nGaedheal was so amazed that they could get anybody with legal training with any shadow of a reputation for respect for the profession to which he belonged to father it here in this House.  They got Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  They made him Minister for Justice&mdash;for justice in order to do it.  Last night he spent an hour tearing a simulated passion into shreds telling us of the hateful characteristics of the evil and lecherous thing to which his depraved mind had given birth.  The engendering of this made him Minister for Justice.  That was the price of the betrayal and dishonour of everything that his profession was supposed to stand for.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must have misunderstood Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I listened to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney from the Chair yesterday evening and he did not proceed at all on the lines that Deputy Flinn is following.  The gravamen of his remarks was that the Attorney-General was introducing evidence that was not legal and securing convictions on evidence that should not be presented, as not being legal evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am getting at.  The Deputy was comparing a court of the kind constituted under that Act with the ordinary kind of court in which barristers are accustomed to appear, and he was pointing out that before that kind of court which he had created, a court of untrained men, because they were untrained men it was possible for the Attorney-General to do things which he says could not have been done before another court.  That was the gravamen of his charge.  He stated that the Attorney-General knew that he was producing what was not evidence. He said that, knowing it was not evidence, he yet produced it.  He said that before that court of untrained men which he, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, had set up, because it was a court of untrained men, and because it was not bound by the traditions, conventions and experience of the law of an ordinary court, the Attorney-General, knowing that the testimony that he presented <Col N="283" /> was not evidence within the law, was able to get away with it and so to get convictions.  Is not that what he was saying?  Let us accept it for the moment that it is so.  He said that that was a crime against the country, a crime against the individual, a crime against the liberty of every man in the country.  A crime how committed? A crime committed because he had set up this specific machinery for the purpose of enabling that to be done.</P>
      <P>The fact that these are untrained men is not a new discovery.  This is not the first time that we have heard of it.  When did we hear of it first? Day by day, and every day throughout the discussion of that Bill, it was suggested that they should be trained men, that they should have some knowledge of the law, that they should have some respect for the traditions of the court, that they should be people who had some training, who had been brought up to respect the liberty of the subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not discussing, and I have no intention of discussing, its merits.  What I am complaining of is that those particular characteristics which were in it were used as the weapons of attack on this Vote on the Attorney-General.  No one can deny that.  It was not just in that one particular, because the Deputy went through it in detail.  There were the ordinary customs and traditions of other courts which decided the form in which evidence should be given, which decided what was evidence. Because this criminal here, who is disgracing the traditions of the Irish Bar, had a court which had none of these traditions, which had been set up with the authority to make conventions and traditions for itself in <Col N="284" /> violation of all the traditions to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney appealed&mdash; for that reason, and for that reason only, they were able to get away with it.  Is anyone denying that is what he said and that he spent his whole time saying it?  But we protested against that portion of the performance.  That particular condition which has produced the evil against which they now protest, was put in of set purpose, with his eyes open, by the very man who is now protesting against the consequences.</P>

I am dealing with the attack on the Attorney-General, whose salary is provided for in this Vote, and the allegation that he allows his agents to get away with certain evidence before a court of untrained men, set up by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. They want to get away from that.  They introduced points of order to stop that discussion. They want to get away from the speech and the attack of the Deputy.  That is what they are using their points of order for, just to hide themselves.  If it is possible for the Attorney-General to bring before the court evidence which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says is not evidence at all, why is it possible?  I mean that is the charge. Who created the instrument?  Who made it possible?  &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;when we contrived this perfectly beautiful, Christian, almost divine instrument of justice under the Public Safety Act, we contrived it under the idea and the impression that there would always be on those benches Christian men.  How are we <Col N="288" /> to be held responsible because it is now producing these results?&rdquo; Well, they are responsible in this sense: that but for their Act&mdash;I mean not merely their law, but for their actual operation of that Act&mdash;we could not have put it into operation.  They went out leaving the Public Safety Act in operation.  They left it for us to come in and take possession of it.  Now you may say: &ldquo;Well, that was very wrong, but there may have been some difficulty about it.  There may have been some difficulty in removing this Act from the dangerous manipulation of these mad wild children of the Fianna Fáil Government.&rdquo;  There was none. When the Cumann na nGaedheal Government went out and left that Act in operation, they were in control of the Seanad.  They had got the Public Safety Act through in three hours.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a certain old farmer came up here to visit the Land Commission. I understand that he wandered into Woolworth's or one of these places, and looking at all the nice, pretty little gadgets laid out, he picked up what he thought was a little framed picture.  He looked at it and said, &ldquo;Me ould father,&rdquo; and, at odd intervals, he used to look at this mirror and say &ldquo;Me ould father.&rdquo; He brought the mirror home and at odd intervals looked into it, until the old lady began to wonder whose picture the old man had brought back from Dublin.  She got hold of the picture and had a look at it and said &ldquo;If that is the ould harridan he is after, he is welcome to her.&rdquo;  Deputies opposite are accustomed to look out upon the world and see thieves and vagabonds and men disregarding the law, treating the courts with disrespect, breaking the law, and engaged in conspiracies for the purpose of tearing down the legal system of the State; they see people refusing to meet their honourable obligations and engaged in all sorts of depravities of that kind.

    <P>The next thing that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny said was that men were being accused in this country by the Attorney-General and his overpaid minions, according to Deputy Morrissey, of crimes that were not crimes within the law.  They are being accused of crimes that are crimes within the law constructed by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, and those are practically the only special crimes of which they can be accused by the minions of the Attorney-General before the Military Tribunal.  That was not all of the facilities which the Deputy provided so that untrained judges could carry out the evil behests of a criminally-minded Attorney-General. He left a machinery behind him and left it in operation when he could have put it on a shelf from which we could not have taken it down without the permission of the Seanad.  He left in possession of that court the power to <Col N="291" /> invent crime; he left it in the power of evil-minded officers of justice to accuse a man of a crime which was not a crime in law at the time the man actually committed it.  That was one of the Deputy's great achievements, one of his great contributions to the liberty of the subject&mdash;the same man who, according to Mr. Justice Hanna, had provided a new statutory criminal offence&mdash;the offence of being suspected.  He provided a machinery by which, without the intervention of any court of law of any kind, without the intervention of even this particular court which our friend is supposed to be misusing, merely because a sergeant of the Civic Guard stated that he suspected the man of intending to commit that crime, the man could be automatically banished from the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are not complaining of the Act; they are complaining of the operation of the Act. How can they complain of the operation of the Act when the ex-Attorney-General, speaking of that precise Tribunal which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says is being misused, said: &ldquo;I have every confidence in the Military Tribunal&rdquo;&mdash;every confidence in that precise Chamber which is allowing this criminal here, through his agents, to get away with the criminal malpractices of which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny accuses him.  That may not be precise enough. It may be that it was for the principle, for the sacred and holy principle of trial by the Military Tribunal that Deputy Costello was speaking, so we will come along to an expert who makes sure that there shall not be any doubt that it is precisely this Tribunal, which is capable of and <Col N="292" /> is actually being, according to them, continuously and continually misused by the Attorney-General, in which they have confidence.  &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied,&rdquo; says Deputy Dillon, &ldquo;that, under the Public Safety Act, as at present administered by the five officers in Portobello Barracks, justice will be done.&rdquo;  The law they passed, the court they set up, the rules of court which they envisaged, the powers which they arranged, the precise personnel which they put upon the bench, and yet they come here to say that my poor innocent friend the Attorney-General is able to pull the wool over their eyes.  &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied that under the Public Safety Act as at present administered by the five officers in Portobello Barracks that justice will be done.&rdquo;  In spite of the fact that the late Attorney-General had every confidence in the Military Tribunal and of the fact that Deputy Dillon is satisfied &ldquo;that the Public Safety Act as at present administered by the five officers in Portobello Barracks that justice will be done,&rdquo; they still come here and say that the whole liberty of the subject, and the whole decency of human life, in face of the law, is being outraged. I do not know what they would say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am not by any means a defender of this system.  I should be very glad indeed to see that that system, that child of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's was stifled now.  I would be very glad indeed to see that the Frankenstein that has arisen to curse them should be put under the sod. But they have no cause for complaint. They made the whip for themselves; they surrounded it with every possible machinery by which they could make it of evil effect to political opponents. It was contrived for the purpose, and if to-day that lash lies heavy on any of them they deserve it, but it is a great pity that such an instrument should be in the country to have to be used for other people.  But the time is coming.  I hope the time is coming soon, when there will be no possibility of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney being able to complain in this manner; when there will be machinery in existence by <Col N="293" /> which temporary and emergency legislation to deal with temporary and emergency conditions can be passed in the form in which it is required to deal with a particular occasion.  Up to the present this Government had no power to alter one single provision of that particular Act without the permission of a majority which was controlled by those opposite.  If, and when, that machinery does come into existence, I hope it will be used to see that there is a system of the kind that cannot be abused.</P>
    <P>Now has it been abused?  I do not know.  I do know that the people who created that Act, and who set out in it specific provisions, went into the ordinary courts to say that those specific provisions did not exist.  I have seen attempt after attempt made by those who were responsible for the machinery of that court to break down its powers and authority.  I do see the dangers in an arrangement of that sort, but is there any man in this House who wants a tribunal which shall be a military tribunal if he can get a civil tribunal?  But what do we find in the case of people who are brought before that court, which is being abused by the Attorney-General, for crimes which are not crimes of a political character at all, which are specifically ordinary offences: of men trying to de-rail trains, trying to break up roads, and firing into houses? When they have been convicted before that tribunal which Deputy Dillon says &ldquo;as at present administered by the five officers will give justice&rdquo; and punished by that court, what happens when they go back to the country? The lovers of law and order, the people who think that the crown prosecutor has a tradition of justice in this country, what do they do?  They turn out to welcome and to congratulate them, to flag their towns and cities for them and to say to them, &ldquo;Well done, thou good and faithful servant, keep on doing it.&rdquo;  What single one of those people who have been convicted by that court which Deputy Dillon says he &ldquo;is satisfied will give justice&rdquo; has been banned from the good political society of the Deputies opposite as a result of the offences that they have committed? <Col N="294" /> How can you have justice administered in the country, how on earth can you expect the comfortable, smooth administration of justice under those conditions?</P>
    <P>Complaint was made here in relation to actions that were taking place at seizures and auctions of that kind. Who made it necessary?  What is the cost to the community, and what is the cost under this Vote of the conduct of Deputies opposite and of the organisations to which they belong in encouraging people in these matters? They can get rid not merely of the abuses of the Public Safety Act, the Public Danger Act, but they can get rid of the Act itself.  They can get it put back into cold storage and in a very short time, I think, they can get it removed from the Statute Book altogether if they will cease encouraging the organised propagation of crime for political purposes.  Are they going to do that?  No. They prefer to come here and to attack everybody who has anything to do with the administration of justice.  The Guards, that do not come under this Vote at all, were dragged in by a Deputy who said that they did not come under it.  They were dragged in simply for the purpose of offering an ugly innuendo against them.  Is that the sort of thing that is going to help the administration of justice?  Is that the sort of thing that is going to get the people behind the administration of justice?  Is that the sort of thing that is going to make the people uphold justice?  They do not want law.  What they want is dominance. The people had the damned impudence and abysmal ignorance to change the Government and to put in here a lot of looters, a lot of murderers and a lot of Communists.</P>

I am simply asking the Deputy to make any interruption and, when I deal with it I hope he will not raise a point of order.  It is not a nice <Col N="295" /> thing, and not a pleasant thing, to have to administer justice in the conditions under which we have to administer it.  It is not a nice thing to have to seize cattle for the purpose of getting annuities.  It is not a nice thing either that what was the Government of the country, and that is trying to imagine itself as a possible alternative Government, should be engaged in creating a condition of affairs which requires artificial measures of this kind.  I am perfectly satisfied that any of the Opposition who have been engaged in those practices and who have &ldquo;got it in the neck&rdquo; have deserved it.  If they &ldquo;get it in the neck 400 times more&rdquo; they will have no cause of complaint against the instrument that they contrived for the purpose.  I am sorry that they have left on the Statute Book an Act of that kind.  I am sorry their conduct has made it necessary to use that instrument.  I am sorry their control of another House has prevented us from producing a right and proper substitute for it.  I hope the time is coming soon when they will get a little sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, in dealing with this subject to-night I have not had an opportunity of getting the official report of the inspired words of the late Minister for Justice.  For that reason it has seemed almost unbelievable to a considerable number of members of the House that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney could have said some of the things which I have suggested he has said.  I want the House to remember that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, for a period of two or three years, held in this House the position of Minister for Justice; that in that capacity he was responsible for the administration of justice and had a very special obligation to do those things and to abstain from doing those things the contrary of which would have brought justice into disrepute.  There is no man in this House upon whom there lay a higher obligation to weigh every single word he said and every act he did or abstained from doing in the balance as to whether or not that act or that word would contribute to the maintenance of justice in this country and respect for the law.  I say that on that Deputy lay a very special obligation to see that everything that in him lay should be done for the purpose of maintaining respect for law as law.</P>
      <P>Very specially that obligation lay on him in relation to seeing that the officers of the law in the carrying out of their functions as officers of the law, the executive officers of the law, the Guards and people of that kind, in carrying out the orders of their superiors, should be respected.  If there was one obligation upon him which was higher than that, it was an obligation to see that in relation to any case in which a man was accused or was likely to be accused before any court in this country, by no action of his should that case be prejudged. That obligation carries on from the time when he did fill the position of Minister for Justice to his present position as a responsible leader of even an irresponsible Opposition.  I do not think there is any man in the House who will quarrel&mdash;I am perfectly sure the Deputy himself will not quarrel&mdash; with any single word I have said as defining his duty in the matter.  I am now going to quote to the House one single sentence uttered by the Deputy, which will show that, in every single one of those characteristics, he was unfit to be Minister for Justice and is unfit now to be a responsible member of this House.</P>

      <P>I am now going to quote what the Deputy said, and this is from &ldquo;twopenny worth of law and order.&rdquo; There was a time when this paper used to be sold at what was then called Kingstown, by a man who used to say: &ldquo;A pennyworth of law and order,&rdquo;&ldquo;Latest sporting intelligence,&rdquo; Another landlord shot.&rdquo;  That was the method in which it used to be sold. That is the paper which now I am going to quote&mdash;the <i>Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, July 10th&mdash;and this is what a man, who has a very special obligation in relation to regimenting the people of this country behind the law, in respect for the law, said in this House last night:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to refer to what, he said, were brutalities charged against certain members of Colonel Broy's <Col N="301" /> new recruits.  Appalling brutalities&mdash; certainly one of them so indecent that he could not, under any circumstances, refer to it in the House&mdash;had been practised.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Had been practised!&rdquo; This is not a question of something which is alleged. The ex-Minister for Justice says they &ldquo;had been practised.&rdquo;  But let us hear the rest of it:</P>
    <P>He was not going to go into that matter because the Attorney-General was not responsible for the Guards....</P>
    <P>Though the Deputy knew that the Attorney-General was not responsible for the Guards, he deliberately dragged in the Guards for the purpose of making a general insinuation of that kind.  He then went on further, and it would be very difficult to put in a single sentence more culpable material from the point of view of a Deputy in his position:</P>
    <P>He was not going to go into that matter because the Attorney-General was not resposible for the Guards, and, secondly, because legal proceedings had been taken.</P>
    <P>Because legal proceedings &ldquo;had been taken&rdquo; in relation to &ldquo;appalling brutalities&rdquo; which, according to the Deputy, &ldquo;had been practised.&rdquo;  If <Col N="302" /> ever there was felon-setting, if ever there was work worthy of a crown prosecutor, if ever there was an action which was degrading and shameful to the profession to which he belongs and to the individual who disgraces it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said: &ldquo;Appalling brutalities&mdash;certainly one of them so indecent that he could not, under any circumstances, refer to it in the House.&rdquo; Was he referring to it in the House? It was so appalling that he could not refer to it in the House, and he said that these brutalities had been practised. He said he was not going to go into the matter.  Why?  First, because the Attorney-General was not responsible for these people, and, secondly, because legal proceedings had been taken against the men who, he in this House said, had, in fact, committed the offences of which they were accused.
